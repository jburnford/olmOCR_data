Indian Agency,\nMeadow Lake, Sask.,\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, you are advised that the Principal has overlooked certain points which should be brought to his attention and which he should follow when preparing future Returns:\n\n1. The Principal has shown on the Return a number of pupils were in residence for less than the prescribed number of days in the Quarter (32), however, he has not indicated in the remarks column the reason for absences nor the dates when the pupils left residence and returned to residence. This information is necessary as it is required by our Treasury officials when making payments on the Return.\n\n2. The Principal has shown pupils 0374, 394 and 395 as having been admitted to hospital on a certain date. He overlooked the fact that in cases of this nature the school is entitled to thirty days hospital grant in addition to the usual number of days the pupil was in residence prior to admission to hospital. We have consequently raised the number of days in residence for each of the three pupils to 30 days.\n3. It is noted that a number of pupils who did not return to residence on September 1st have been dropped from the Return. This practice must be discontinued as we are not able to trace the children should they return to residence at a later date. In cases of this nature, the Principal should keep the names on the Return or ask for the discharge of the pupils concerned and when the discharge is approved he may then drop the pupils from the Return.\n\nWe are forwarding an extra copy of this letter to you for transmission to the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEnclosure\n\nMFI/EM\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJanuary 4th, 1952\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the St. Anthony's Catholic (Onion Lake) Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Wright Roselema.\nEnglish name: Wright Roselema.\nAge: August 2nd, 1937.\nName of Band: Moosomin.\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 233.\nFather's full name and No.: Dead.\nMother's full name and No.: Dead.\nParents living or dead: Dead.\nState of child's health: Catholic.\nReligion: Catholic.\nDoes applicant speak English?

Indian Residential School, you are advised that as these children are of the Anglican faith and as the school is a Roman Catholic School, the admission of Joseph and the re-admission of the three Dillon children cannot be considered.\n\nWe have noted the contents of Mr. Dillon's statutory declaration and will apply for a ruling on Mr. Dillon's wishes. When a ruling has been received, you will be advised accordingly. In the meantime, no action should be taken to place these children in the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. If for any reason these children are already in the school, they should be immediately returned to their parents, as the department will not allow any per capita grant for them.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. Walker, Clerk-in-Charge of the Meadow Lake Agency.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nSeptember 18, 1952.\n\nMr. S.K.

I have accepted pending approval of the Department, under the same conditions as those under which I took Anglican children last year.\n\nThe mother does not want her children to go to the Prince Albert Anglican school, the reason given being distance. She wants to take advantage of the privilege of having her children at home every weekend, (Friday evening to Sunday evening). However she is not able to look properly after the children. For the last few years, her own father was doing this, but now he is in ill health, cannot work, and has applied for rations from the Agency for himself and wife. The chief of the reserve feels that these children are truly destitute. He has written in this vein a letter to the acting superintendent of the Agency at Meadow Lake, not knowing that the recommendation for admission would have to go through your office. I expect the clerk at the Meadow Lake Agency will forward the letter to Ottawa.\n\nThe children seem in good health, except they were very thin and undernourished.\n\nI hope you will see your way clear to recommend approval of admission by Mr. Phelan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Lessard O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention:- Superintendent of Education\n\nPlease find attached hereto, applications for admission for three children of Mrs. Mary Mountain and a copy of the letter received by this office from the Principal of St. Anthony's Indian Day School.\n\nIt is respectfully requested that these applications be given favorable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Her husband, Frank Heathen is also Anglican. Their children have been brought up as Anglicans as much as anything.\n\nWith regards to the Dillons, Mrs. Dillon was Mary Ann Kuyuckoooss of Loon Lake. Her grandfather is pagan, her mother is deceased, and she herself is either Anglican or pagan. We cannot locate a copy of their marriage registration.\n\nAlthough neither family is very particular about the religion taught their children they are quite liable, in order to have their children admitted to the Onion Lake School, to have their children baptized R.C. They definitely wish them to attend the school on their home reserve, will not allow them to leave to go to a protestant school many miles away where they cannot see them only during summer holidays, and as the Indian Act states they can authorize their children to attend any school of any faith they are really causing a lot of disturbance.\n\nShould the Department for its own reasons refuse to authorize the admittance of these children because they are Anglicans, then we believe we may soon receive the certificates of baptism of these children into the R.C. Faith.\n\n(J.A. Davis)\nIndian Superintendent,\nMeadow Lake Indian Agency.\nJanuary 31, 1952\n\nMr. J.A. Davis,\nSupt.

At the commencement of the new term this fall Mr. Dillon completed a statutory declaration in accordance with Section 117 of the Indian Act in which he stated that he desired his children to attend the Catholic School despite the fact that he himself is a Protestant. According to Mr. Dillon the main reason he did this was because he and his wife are away a good deal of the time and as the St. Anthony's Indian School is the only residential school on the reserve it is the only place where he can be sure they will be properly looked after. He also informs me that the day school on the reserve is over 2\u00bd miles from his home and that it will be impossible for the children to go to school unless they are permitted to attend at St. Anthony's.\n\nIt would appear that Section 117 of the Indian Act was designed to take care of cases similar to the present one and I can see no reason why the request should not be granted. There are four children ranging in age from 7 to 11 and unless they are permitted to attend St. Anthony's School it would work an undue hardship on the parents and in all probability result in the children not attending any school as I understand that they are not required to do so if the school is more than 2\u00bd miles from their home.\n\nI understand from Father Lessard that a ruling on Section 117 of the Indian Act was requested through the office of the Superintendent on August 29th, 1952, but that no reply was received to the request. On behalf of Mr. Dillon I am requesting that this matter be reviewed with a view to permitting his children to attend St. Anthony's School and I would be pleased if you would advise me after it has received your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOHN H.

Attached to the application was a statement signed by the father, Ernest Dillon indicating that he has instructed his children to attend the Onion Lake R.C.

However, on the 9th instant, I proceeded to Onion Lake in company with Assist. Agent Nissen of the Keeheewin Indian Reserve. Father Lessard the principal was interviewed concerning the removal of the children, and stated they were still in the School, but could be taken away at any time.\n\nPrevious arrangements were made to place them in the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore taking the children from Onion Lake Res. School, I wished to contact the mother and have her sign admission Forms for the Edmonton School. I contacted four Indian Families in an endeavour to obtain a team to drive six miles to the home where the mother was staying, but without results. Arrangements were made to meet the mother at the School on Friday the 13th instant, and at this time I had to return to the Frog Lake Reserve for a scheduled Band Meeting.\n\nOn Friday Mar. 13th, Assistant Agent Nissen proceeded to Onion Lake in an endeavour to bring the Children back to St. Paul, and to Edmonton. Mr. Nissen waited at the School until 4:00 p.m., and when the mother did not show up for her children he highered a team and drove to her home with the Chief.\n\nThe mother absolutely refused to let her children go, stating she would not let them go to Edmonton, and refused to sign admission Forms. She stated she would send her children Cont'd.\nto a Day School on the Onion Lake Reserve, and take them out of the Residential School. She wished to know why she had to remove her children from the Onion Lake School, stating that there were fourteen other children besides hers of the Anglican Faith attending this school. She gave the names of the following families:\n\nErnest DILLON - 3 children.\nDouglas Dillon - 5 children.\n? COOK - 3 Children.\nEdward CHIEF - 3 Children.\n\nThe names listed above were all confirmed by the Chief Arsene CARDINAL, who was in company with Asst. Agent Nissen.\n\nThe home where Mrs. Mountain is staying is about one and a half miles from the New Days School, which we were informed is not yet open, and about five miles from the present Day School in operation.\n\nAs the only alternative to removed the Children would be by force Mr. Nissen returned without them, and reported accordingly.\n\nFrom all appearances this family is hard up, and to have the children attend a Day School, there is no doubt that a form of relief will be required to assist in the maintenance of this family.\n\nThis report is being submitted for your further instructions, and should they be removed by force, the Services of the R.C.M. Police will be required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\n\nc.c. to Mr. G. H. Gooderham\n620 Public Building, Calgary, Alta.\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n628 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Mountain Children - Keeheewin Reserve\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of the 13th instant of even file concerning the Mountain children from the Keeheewin Reserve now residing on the Onion Lake Indian Reserve and who have been attending the St. Anthony's Indian Residential School at Onion Lake.\n\nOn a recent visit to Onion Lake I was informed that the Mountain children had not been at the St. Anthony's School since March 13th when Mr. Nissen made a trip there to bring these children in. I was further informed that since March 13th the three Mountain children have been attending the Day School on the Reserve. Up until this time the Day School they have been attending was approximately five miles from their place of abode. However, this week a new Protestant Day School is to be opened on this Reserve and it will be this school the Mountain Children will attend. This school is approximately three quarters of a mile from their present abode.\n\nShould you deem it necessary to remove these children the assistance of the R.C.M. Police will be required.\n\nI shall await your further instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\n\nT/c.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Mountain Children - Keeheewin Reserve.\n\nFurther to your letter of February 16, file 659-10 (26), I enclose herewith for your information, copy of report received from Mr. Taylor.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nHM/mg\nEnc.l.\nIn interpreting Section 117 of the Indian Act,\nChapter 29, Statutes of Canada 1951, it must be kept in mind that\nit gives the minister power to designate the school which every\nIndian child should attend. In this connection I quote \" Every\nIndian child who is required to attend school shall attend such\nschool as the Minister may designate \".\n\nThe next section \" No child whose parent is Protestant\nshall be designated to a school conducted under Roman Catholic\nauspices and no child whose parent is Roman Catholic shall be\ndesignated to a school conducted under Protestant auspices. \"\nThis part of Section 117 requires the minister to ascertain the\nreligion of the parent and if the parent is Protestant the child\nmust be placed in a school conducted under Protestant auspices\nand on the other hand if the parent is Roman Catholic the child\nmust be placed in a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nThe phrase \" except by written direction of the\nparent \" only applies if the minister ruled that a child whose\nparent is a Roman Catholic should be placed in a Protestant school.\nThis would require the parent's consent. The same applies if the\nminister rules that a child whose parent is Protestant should be\nplaced in a Roman Catholic School.\n\nSuggested but not sent\n\n1/1/63\nOttawa, June 12, 1953.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Rose Dillon,\nJames Roy Dillon,\nMary Dillon\n\nThe father, Ernest Dillon completed applications for the admission of these three children to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. In answer to the question on the application form regarding \"Religion\" the information was \"Anglican\". Superintendent Davis recommended the admission of these children to the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\nOn January 19, 1952, the above information was forwarded to you for a ruling. Your decision was \"except if the mother is of the Roman Catholic faith, the children who I assume are of the same religion as their father should attend a Protestant school\".\n\nFrom subsequent correspondence between the Superintendent of Education and Superintendent Davis it was learned that Mrs. Dillon's grandfather is Pagan, her mother is deceased and she herself is either Anglican or Pagan.\n\nSuperintendent Davis was then informed of the ruling and instructed that the children should remain in the Onion Lake R.C. School to the end of June 1952 but must be returned to their parents at the end of the academic year.\nThe children remained in the Onion Lake School to June 30, 1952. When they returned home the parents consulted John H. Maher, B.A., LL.B., Barrister, Solicitor and Notary Public, North Battleford, Saskatchewan. In a letter to the Department, Mr. Maher writes:\n\n\"In view of the fact that Section 117 of the Indian Act contains a provision that a Protestant child may be assigned to a school under Roman Catholic auspices under written direct of a parent and as Mr. Dillon has complied with this requirement by filing a statutory declaration with the Department, I would be pleased if you would now advise me why the admission of his children to St. Anthony's School cannot be approved\".\n\nI would appreciate being advised what answer should be given to Mr. Maher.\n\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6326, file 659-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM FOR:\n\nTHE A/DIRECTOR OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nReference your memorandum of June 12 concerning the case of Rose, James Roy and Mary Dillon. According to information available, the father would be of the Anglican faith and the mother either Anglican or Pagan. I note that Mr. John H. Maher has questioned the ruling made and his attention should be drawn to section 117, which states that Indian children required to attend school shall attend such school as the Minister may designate. A child of Protestant parent should attend a Protestant school, while a child of Roman Catholic parent should attend a Roman Catholic school. Mr. Maher should further be informed that the directions of the parents are only required if the Minister decided to direct a Protestant to a Roman Catholic school or vice versa.\n\nAfter reviewing the facts, I see no reason for changing the ruling already made in this case on January 19, 1952.\n\nLaval Fortier.\nJune 20, 1953.\n\nMR. John H. Maher, B.A., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Solicitor and Notary Public,\nSuite 9, Miller Block,\nNorth Battleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of March 6th, requesting an official interpretation of Section 117 of the Indian Act, was received and I regret that a reply was not forwarded to you sooner.\n\nWhen completing applications for the admission of these children to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School, the father, Ernest Dillon, stated his religion to be \"Anglican\".\n\nIn interpreting Section 117 of the Indian Act it must be kept in mind that it gives the minister the power to designate the school which every child should attend. A child of a Protestant parent should attend a Protestant school while a child of a Roman Catholic parent should attend a Roman Catholic school. The direction of the parent is only required if the minister decided to direct a Protestant child to a Roman Catholic school or vice versa.\n\nIn view of the above, there does not appear to be any reason for changing the ruling already made refusing the admission of the Dillon children to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMarch 1st 1953\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the St. Anthony's Indian School Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ...............................................................\nFather's full name and No. ...............................................................\nMother's full name and No. ...............................................................\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

With respect to the truck asked for, the Sisters have on various occasions spoken to me about this. If the Department can see its way to supply the school with one, it would be very useful, as the school is situated more than thirty miles from its nearest railway point; and, I am sure, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 22, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing requisition for stock and farm equipment, which has been received from the Rev.

I should be grateful if you would ascertain just what stock and equipment this institution now possesses and let me have a recommendation as to what should be supplied. It appears that the Rev. Principal has entered into an agreement with Mr. Bolduc in connection with his horses. This Mr. Bolduc is to be the school farm instructor and the Principal has promised to buy his horses and harness from him. The Department is favourably disposed towards this arrangement, if you find that the horses in question are satisfactory for Indian residential school purposes; but I am not at all satisfied that six additional animals are required.

REGINA, SASK., March 31st, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 115-9-14, dated the 16th instant, with which you enclosed a requisition for stock and farm equipment received from the Reverend Principal of the Onion Lake Roman Catholic Residential School. I am returning the requisition, as requested, together with a list showing the stock and equipment which I think are necessary. I am, also, giving an estimate of the cost of same.\n\nWith reference to the horses, I consider that six horses are quite sufficient to operate this farm. At other schools we have only provided four horses, but in view of this school being so far from the railway I think that an extra pair should be provided, as there will, no doubt, be a considerable amount of freighting to do.\n\nI consider the land packer is not necessary.\n\nWith regard to the truck asked for, I do not think that we should be called upon to pay for this. The Anglican School at Onion Lake are using a truck, but it was paid for by the Church Missionary Society and I think that the Roman Catholic Church, if they desire a truck, should pay for it themselves.\n\nI may say that I am including in my estimate the cost of horses and harness asked for, in the event that the deal with Mr. Balduc does not go through. I have no information as to whether the horses are satisfactory or as to how much he is asking for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 659-14, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A of the 31st ultimo, with reference to stock and agricultural implements at the Onion Lake R. C. Indian Residential School. The proposed expenditure in this connection amounts to over $3,000, and I hesitate before authorizing such a large amount until I know what stock and implements the institution already possesses. The equipment which you recommend is, apparently, complete. Surely, the school has some equipment that would be satisfactory for a few years, at least. Further, I think that six horses are more than the Department should allow to a school that has been in operation. I have examined the most recent report concerning stock at this institution, and I find that they already have eight cows. Are you satisfied that six more are required?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, 115-8-14, with reference to the live stock and agricultural implements for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. I note that the proposed expenditure will amount to over $3000.00, and that you hesitate to spend such a large amount until you know what stock and implements the institution already possesses. I regret that I have not this information at hand. When I made this recommendation I was governed by what was supplied to other schools, and I am quite sure that the request for six cows at this school is reasonable, even though they already may have eight. I have not the slightest doubt that they have some equipment, and I shall take steps to find out what it is, and will also make inquiry regarding the number of cows and horses on hand. I note you think six horses more than the Department should allow to a school that has been in operation. If the school have horses on hand, six is perhaps too many to ask for but they may have sold whatever horses they had, considering that they belonged to the Mission, and if such is the case they would have to be supplied with six; four to work on the plow, and a team of lighter horses with which to haul supplies from the railroad, a distance of forty miles. If they only have four they could not take two of them off the plow to haul these supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 115-8-14 of the 12th ultimo, concerning stock and agricultural implements for the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, I have to advise you that I am in receipt of information from the Agent, Mr. Lang Turner, stating that this institution has nothing of any value in the way of farm equipment, as they have always borrowed from the Agency anything required in that line. They have only seven cows of mixed grade quality, and one old horse, seventeen years of age.\n\nI have gone carefully through the list of farm equipment and stock, which accompanied my letter to you of the 31st March last, and have made one or two changes which will reduce the amount of the suggested expenditure, and the items which I would eliminate now are as follow:\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|----------|--------|\n| Logging chain         | 1        | $4.00  |\n| Potatoe cultivator     | 1        | $14.00 |\n| Walking plow          | 1        | $36.00 |\n| Binder                | 1        | $260.00|\n| Fanning mill          | 1        | $55.00 |\n| Bull                  | 1        | $200.00|\n\nWith reference to these reductions, I think that one logging chain should be sufficient and they should be able to cultivate their potatoes by hand. If we procure a combination Sulky plow, the Walking plow can well be struck out. With regard to a binder, it will not be required until the result of the crop is seen, and, in any event, as they have only seventy-five acres ready for seed-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\ning, any cutting of the crop that may be required could be done by a hired binder. I have struck the farming mill off, because the acreage they have is comparatively small. If they wish to breed their cows, I think they could make use of the Department bull for a time at least.\n\nI have allowed the item of six milk cows to stand, as the school only possess seven cows, and the new school provides for a pupilage of eighty. It is possible that the number might be reduced to four, but I am of the opinion that it would be better to let them have the larger number.\n\nIn regard to horses, I think they should be allowed six, as at least four will be required on the farm for seeding and plowing etc., and an extra team for wagon work and hauling to town will be of great use to them.\n\nIn his letter in reply to mine, the Agent states that the Sister Superior expresses the opinion that the Department should supply seed to sow sixty acres of oats, which would require 150 bushels. I have informed the Agent that the Department can not consider this and the request is a most unusual one.\n\nI shall be prepared to take any action to purchase the equipment allowed, if the Department will advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 8, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 3rd instant, with reference to stock and agricultural implements to supplement what is already owned by the authorities at the new Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. You may make purchase of the stock and implements listed under cover of your letter of March 31st, as amended by the communication I am now answering. You might bear in mind the reference to Mr. Bolduc in my letter of March 22nd. The Department relies on you to purchase from the best sources of supply and to keep the expenditure as low as is consistent with efficiency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

School, asking that an Ayrshire bull be purchased to enable them to breed the Ayrshire cows which were bought for the use of the school last year. On enquiry I find that a registered bull, between two years and three years old, can be bought from Mr. H. Thomas, of Lloydminster, at the price of $175.00, F.O.B. Lloydminster, and, if the Department will sanction the purchase, I can arrange with the Agent to buy the animal.\n\nA request was also submitted to buy a binder. The purchase of this was deferred last year, in view of the fact that only a small area was cultivated. The Agent informs me, however, that this yielded 1550 bus. of oats, 4000 sheaves, and 575 bus. of wheat. The school proposes to seed 115 acres this coming spring and later on in the year they will need a binder. If the Department will sanction the purchase, I can inform the Agent that one can be purchased when the time comes.\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter addressed to the Agent by the Sister Superior, with a view to securing more power to operate the farm. You will note the Sister wishes to purchase a tractor. I am not in favor of purchasing this type of equipment, however; and, as the instruction the boys get should be of use to them when they branch out for themselves and tractors are not in use on Indian Reserves, I cannot recommend the purchase. If the Department feels disposed, however, they might be furnished with an additional team of horses. Some months ago authority\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwas given to purchase six horses and, although the Agent was instructed accordingly, I find no record of any vouchers having passed through this office, and it is possible they may have gone direct to Ottawa.\n\nIn this connection, however, I would like to ask the Department if it is its intention and practice to furnish these schools with all the equipment they need, or whether its policy has not been to furnish a reasonable amount and expect the school to carry on with this end, from time to time, supplement it out of the Government grant or from other sources.\n\nI shall be glad if the Department will advise me in regard to the matters referred to herein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\nOttawa, February 8, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-11A R.C. of the 31st ultimo, relative to the request of the Onion Lake R. C. School authorities to be supplied with an Ayrshire bull. In this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the purchase of the registered bull referred to by you, the price of which should not exceed the sum of $175. It should first be ascertained that this animal is free from tuberculosis.\n\nRelative to the request for a binder, I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of this equipment, and you may arrange with the Agent, when timely, to obtain same. The binder should be purchased on the best possible terms.\n\nRelative to the copy of a letter which you enclosed from the Rev. Sister Superior requesting that a tractor be supplied, I have to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of this equipment. Six horses were purchased for this school in June, last, the account in payment having been forwarded to the Department through Mr. Agent Turner. We are not disposed to authorize the supplying of an additional team of horses. It is the policy of the Department to furnish a reasonable amount of equipment, stock and farm implements, but it is expected that all replacements will be made by the school authorities from their per capita grant earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The report discloses that this girl who was an orphan, had been ill for some time suffering from tuberculosis and that she was a student in the Indian School at Onion Lake, Sask. On June 20 she was permitted to visit her sister on the Onion Lake reserve and on June 22 she died. The facts were reported to Dr. G.L. Cooke, Coroner who is also the doctor for the Indian Affairs branch, and he stated that he would forward the necessary certificate so that burial could proceed.\n\n3. Enquiries are continuing and further report may be expected.\n\nThe Commissioner, R.C.M.P.  \nOTTAWA, Ont.  \n\nYours truly,\n\nForwarded in duplicate for your information with copies of Onion Lake Detachment report of June 24 attached.\n\nT.W. Chard, Supt.  \nIn Charge, C.I.B.\n\nRegina: T.W. Chard, Supt.  \n5-7-48 In Charge, C.I.B.\nIn the a.m. of this date Wilfred CARTER, Treaty Indian, Onion Lake Indian Reserve, called at this detachment and stated that the captioned-name had died at the house of his brother, Fred CARTER, on the Reserve, that same morning. It had been some months since Caroline had seen a Doctor.\n\nAs this girl was a student at the Roman Catholic Indian School, Onion Lake, Saskatchewan, Father CABANE and the Sisters of the school were interviewed. The following statement of one of the teachers, Sister Rose-Melene, sums up the information they were able to give:\n\nCaroline ANGUS, Treaty Indian girl, aged 16 years, from Thunder Child Reserve, Treaty #0342, had been attending our school since Nov. 20th, 1941. She was an orphan. She was always a sickly, nervous child. On June 10th she became ill, ran a high temperature of 101 or 102. On June 16th she became normal and on June 20th her sister, who lived on the Onion Lake Reserve visited her for a visit we allowed her to go. Early this morning, about 7:00 a.m., Fred CARTER, Treaty Indian, of the Reserve, came to the school and stated CAROLINE was dying. Father CABANE and we Sisters went to the CARTER house, arriving about 7:30 a.m. The girl was dead upon arrival. There were two basins of pus indicating that her lungs were totally diseased from tuberculosis. She had been under the care of Dr. C.L. COOKE, of the Indian Affairs Branch, since 1941. *(Signed) Sister Rose-Melene A.S.V.*\n\nThe Coroner, Dr. C.L. COOKE, of Lloydminster was contacted by telephone. The girl was well known to Dr. COOKE as he is also the Indian Affairs Branch Doctor for this district. In view of this he stated that he would issue the necessary certificate from Lloydminster and forward it to this detachment. The writer was to contact the Doctor if it appeared from the investigation that the death was caused by other than tuberculosis.\n\nThe patrol continued to the house of Fred CARTER. A careful examination was made of the body and no signs of violence or foul play but none could be found. Due to the heat the two basins of pus had been disposed of.\n\nThe following statement was taken from Alice (Mrs. Wilfred) CARTER, Treaty Indian, aged 16 years, Onion Lake Reserve.\n\nMy sister, Caroline, and I were born on Thunderchild Indian Reserve. Modest ANGUS was our father, both he and mother died when we were small. Since 1941 my sister and I have lived at the Roman Catholic Mission School, Onion Lake Reserve. My sister was always sickly. Her nose would bleed and she was always coughing and spitting. When we asked what was wrong with\nWHEN WE ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER SHE WOULD NEVER ANSWER. SHE CRIED A LOT. I LEFT THE SCHOOL TO GET MARRIED ON MAY 10TH, 1948. I SAW CAROLINE EVERY WEEK AND SHE CAME TO STAY WITH US LAST SUNDAY (JUNE 20TH). SHE WAS FEELING SICK BUT NO WORSE THAN USUAL. WE CAME TO FRED CARTER'S YESTERDAY NIGHT AND I LEFT FOR HOME ABOUT 9:00 PM. CAROLINE STAYED. ABOUT 1:30 THIS MORNING FRED CAME OVER AND TOLD US CAROLINE WAS SICK. I CAME AND MARION CARTER AND I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT WITH CAROLINE UNTIL SHE DIED ABOUT 7:15 THIS MORNING. SHE WAS NEVER CONSCIOUS ALL NIGHT. HER BREATHING WAS HARD AND SHE PUDED PUS. HER BREATH BECAME SHORTER AND SHORTER BEFORE SHE DIED.\"\n\n(Signed) Mrs. Wilfred CARTER.\n\n6. Statement of Marion (Mrs. Fred) CARTER (Treaty Indian) aged 31 years, Onion Lake Indian Reserve.\n\n\"About noon yesterday Caroline ANGUS and her sister, Mrs. Wilfred CARTER came to our house for a visit. Caroline was going to stay with us for the holidays as she was an orphan. She was 10 years old last December. She was a cousin of mine. We spent the afternoon at housework and had a late supper about 8:00 PM. After supper we baked bread and Caroline helped me. We curled each other hair and went to bed about 11:30 PM. During this time Caroline was feeling fine. She coughed a lot but she had been coughing for a long time now. She was nervous and ever since she was a baby she has been unable to sit still. About midnight Caroline started to cry. She sat up and then fell onto the floor. She rolled around on the floor. She was crying but did not say anything. I just rubbed her stomach to indicate it was painful. I picked her up and put her back into bed. My husband, Fred, went to Wilfred CARTER's to get Alice. They arrived about 1:30 AM. We stayed up all night with Caroline. Caroline was not conscious; she was breathing hard and pus kept coming away from her nose and mouth. About 2 basins full of pus came away. This morning about 6:30 AM my husband went to the Roman Catholic Mission for help. Caroline died about 7:15 AM (before my husband returned). Her breathing had been getting shorter and shorter, then stopped. We did not know until the Roman Catholic Sisters told us this morning that Caroline had tuberculosis.\"\n\n(Signed) Mrs. F. CARTER.\n\n7. A similar statement was taken from Fred CARTER. A copy of this report is being forwarded direct to Lloydminster Detachment in order that the medical history of this case be obtained from Doctor COOKS.\n\n8. This girl had no property other than the Treaty money which was held for her by the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa. In view of the season an speedy burial was necessary; permission was given and on 23-6-48 the body was buried at the Roman Catholic Cemetery, Onion Lake Indian Reserve. The cemetery is not lotted or plotted. Further report will be submitted when the necessary papers have been received from Dr. COOKS.

They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him.

STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED\nTHE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Caroline Angus from September 1941\nto June 1942. The immediate cause of death was\nPulmonary Tuberculosis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was influenza.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nThis pupil was never looked after at all when she was at the R.E. School. I had occasion to examine her on many occasions from 1941 until just prior to death. She had an attack of tuberculosis, which caused an acute attack of influenza.\n\nC. L. Carter M.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Caroline Angus of the Thunderchild Reserve - Battleford Agency have been recorded? Yes If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nIn view of Dr. G. R.

Packman)\nA/Supt.\nSt. Anthony Indian Res. School\nOnion Lake via Lloydminster, Sask.\nMay 1, 1950\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIt is with regret that we report the death of Alfred Bear, age 7, and son of Augustin Bear from Meadow Lake, Sask. His register number was 405.\n\nThis child has been in the infirmary under the special care of the nurse since December 12, 1949. The Lloydminster Doctor has seen him and diagnosed intestinal tuberculosis, so medicine was given and a little improvement was shown for some time, but at the beginning of April his condition changed and the doctor was called again. After having made a report of his condition we were advised to take him to the Lloydminster Hospital, this was done the next morning, April 6. The diagnosis proved that meningitis had developed.\n\nHe died on April 28 and arrangements were made with our Indian Agent so that the body would be taken to Meadow Lake for the burial, but at the last moment a phone call was received telling us to have him buried here in Onion Lake. The Agent could not locate the father as he had gone north to work.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is impossible for us to have the usual inquiry, prescribed by the Department of Indian Affairs in case of a child's death, to be made. This child's mother is dead, his father being absent, the Agent being at Meadow Lake makes it difficult to fulfill this obligation.\n\nHoping that the given information will prove satisfactory, I remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

An official account has been opened in the local bank wherein the per capita grant and all other moneys received are deposited, and all the accounts are paid by official cheque.\n\nThe discipline of the institution is well kept up, the children are well clothed and fed. There was little or no sickness, excepting one child in the last stages of consumption. The sick rooms were empty.\n\nBuilding operations on the gymnasium were being rapidly pushed.\n\nThe Farmer, with his staff of boys, was engaged at spring seeding.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(Sgd) T. P. Wallsworth\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nOn behalf of the English speaking portion of the parish of Qu'Appelle, we beg to extend our cordial welcome.\n\nThe large number present here today from all parts of the district amply testifies the interest which has been taken by the Superior General of the great order over which you preside.\n\nIt is with pleasure and pride, Rev. Fathers, that we greet you and members of the order of Mary Immaculate in Qu'Appelle. We are worthy followers of the great order founded by St. Stanislaus, ever witnesses of their untiring energy, and zealous labors in the cause of God. It will come as adequate compensation for the effort made by the members of this order to see them in their missionary labors among the Indians.\n\nWhile pleased to see so many of your able assistants with you, we regret that illness prevented His Excellency the Bishop from being present here today; we are sure he would have wished to be present to see the magnificent results of the foundation of his order. In 1869, thirty-three years ago he opened the mission of Qu'Appelle. The result of his wisdom and prudence was most satisfactory. Under his charge are, Rev. Father, appointed on every hand.\n\nWishing you a pleasant journey, and assuring you of our prayers, we remain your Father, with the most profound feelings of respect and esteem.\n\nOn behalf of the congregation,\n\nM. M. Seyberts,\nTreasurer.\n\nThe distinguished visitor not being very well versed in the English language, replies to both of the communications in French.\n\nA little later in the day a reception was held at the Institute. Salads, which are always such delightful entertainments, were presented, as well as a number of visitors from Fort Qu'Appelle. Addresses were delivered by the boys and girls of the school, one of which is given below. The Very Rev. gentlemen present also addressed the natives in French in very felicitous terms, and Rev. F. Langeron also addressed the auditorium elegantly in English. After a brief interval of the orator's remarks, and telling the young natives how thankful they should be for the care and attention they were receiving from the Government, and also of the kindness of the H.H.C., in times past. Mr. A. Macdonald also made a few complimentary remarks concerning the school and the good work being done there.\n\nTo the Very Rev. Fr. Soulire, Superior General O. M. I.\n\nVary Rev. Fathers,\n\nWe the pupils of the Institute of Qu'Appelle, do hereby address you, as your humble servants, and as children of the Holy Catholic Church. We come to you, Perdue us, in doing thus, to tell you how grateful we are for the kindness shown to us by the Holy Father, and by the Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ. We are grateful for this favor.\n\nWe desire to express our thanks with feelings of profound veneration, a high dignity, the order of Mary Immaculate, and of the Sisters of Mary Immaculate.\n\nEspecially do we meet with happiness, your fatherly developments and affection, the ruler of our good and devoted missionaries who have been sent out to labor for our spiritual and temporal welfare.\n\nNo words can express the fact with gratitude and praise, that it was principally through the zeal and energy of these noble missionaries came into our vast territories.\n\nNo effort has been spared on their part to bring the Indians to the knowledge of God and civilization. For the space of half a century they have been engaged in the accomplishment of this most charitable object. They have been engaged in the education of the Indians, and have built many schools, churches, and bridges. They have not hesitated to give even their lives in their holy and charitable calling.\n\nAbove all, how grateful ought we, the hapless Indians, be to you, dear Fathers! We are continually the object of the benevolence and kindness of your dear good Fathers. Indeed, we may say that the Holy Father has reserved for us their greatest work of charity.\n\nFor these reasons we will be ever grateful to you, dear Fathers, for the gift of joy we will come in your venerable person the highest distinction of the order of Mary Immaculate.\n\nStanding your age and fatigue of a long and painful journey, your devotion has been manifested in order that you undertake a visit to all the missions.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Inspector Wadsworth's report of his audit of the books of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. The result of the year's work as presented in these statements is not highly satisfactory, as the year will, from all that can be gathered from them, close with a deficit. This is unfortunate, as the school, commencing the year favourably, should have been able at least to pay its way and end the year with an even balance sheet. In conducting an institution of this kind so much depends upon economy in purchases and in salaries paid that any presentation of the accounts is necessarily incomplete without a report upon this most important point. It is presumed that Mr. Wadsworth's audit included an examination of all vouchers and accounts, in order that he might ascertain whether the prices paid for supplies of all kinds were fair and whether the manner of making purchases would naturally result in the lowest rates being obtained.\n\nAgain, there should be an examination into the stock accounts, with special reference to the needs of the school, as it would be easy to overstock the institution.

Father Soulier's visit.\n\nI can state from what records the Indians came, and the approximate numbers, but it was found impossible to take down the names of every individual Indian present; an attempt was made the first morning, but the Indians have such an aversion to giving their names, some objecting on the ground that they would be made to pay for their rations, and some were found to be giving fictitious names, or such names which would have rendered the list useless; so that the taking of names was dropped. It could not be expected that I would find time myself personally attend to the giving of rations, to the indisposition and\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nand to the issuing of tickets, though I went to inspect the rationing as often as I could, and am confident that everything was done carefully and conscientiously. The tickets were issued only to the heads of families, the number of rations marked on each ticket, and as the tickets were presented every morning or evening, the date of receiving the ration was entered against the corresponding number in the book, so that no ticket could draw rations more than once on the same day.\n\nThe Indians who came were nearly, or quite all the File Hills reserve, the O'Soup reserve, the Pasqua reserve, a large number from Touchwood, including many of the Protestant Half-breed, the biggest part of Muscowequay and Bigfoot's bands, many from Yellow Calf and Newbigan reserves, several from Indian Head, Ochapaives and Pelly reserves, and all the Sioux in the vicinity.\n\n\"The Manitoba\" estimates the number at one thousand.\nThe meat was bought from the contractor, and at a low rate for the season of the year, and quality of the beef.\n\nThe Department asked me to issue the rations to the Indians attending these festivities, I have done so, as instructed, and did it in the best way I could, in my report for May, referred to the matter.\n\n(Sgd.)

The Rev. Principal issued a general invi-\ntation to the public, who responded to such an extent that the large hall of the gymnasium was well filled. A drama in three acts was given by the boys in a very creditable manner; the greater number of them that an amount of pa-\ntience must be required of these children to play a difficult piece so well. In the absence of a piano, which would have been no discredit to a regular com-\npany, the boys sang a very pretty drama called \"The Clear Sighted Fairy,\" which was acted by the boys, all nicely dressed, speaking English clearly and distinctly. They sang very well, but a very short time ago, they were run-\nning about the school like wild savage. Truly great is the transformation produced by the influence of the school. A band composed of Indian boys of the school, conducted by Mr. Greenaway, was much appreciated, especially by the ladies while the boys sang. A very funny laughable farce was then put on by the students, which, though not very amusing, created a great deal of amusement, and was enjoyed by all. It was favored to suit all tastes, some with something to suit those who were fond of music, with others who were fond of dancing. The noble art of self defense was then demonstrated from a Canadian and German point of view. Mr. Greenaway, a former student educated from Germany, did the honors for his countrymen. A song was then repre-\nsented by one of Glengarry's rustic sons, and the boys and girls of the school sang \"God Save the Queen\" in a very pretty style. This brought to a close one of the most interesting entertainments given in Qu'Appelle. Those present were mun-\nicipal officers, members of the council, being done by those in charge of the school, Mr. Greenaway, Mr. Hugmanard, Father Hugmanard, the principal, being there throughout the entertainment.\n\nThe recently built gymnasium is a very fine addition to the school. It affords not only a means of procuring healthful exercise for the pupils in the winter, but also makes the school hall for concerts and entertainments.\nDear Father Hugonnard,\n\nI was very much pleased to receive your little note attached to the programme of an entertainment held at the school on the 19th ultimo.\n\nSuch entertainments, as you yourself say, have a strong tendency to bring the students out of their shell and make them more confident not only among themselves but in approaching white people. We cannot do too much in the direction of getting their shyness out of them, because if they are to continue in that feeling of remaining aloof from white people they will never successfully cope with them. Therefore, I trust your efforts will meet with every success. The work of getting up the programme is particularly creditable, and I wish you would kindly convey my feelings to the boy. It certainly shows how he has progressed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndustrial School,\n\nQu'Appelle, Assiniboia\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Rev. Principal issued a general invitation to the public, which was responded to so cordially that the entire hall of the gymnasium was well filled. A drama in three acts was given by the boys in a very creditable manner. It is a general consensus that an amount of patience must be required to see children play a difficult piece so well. In fact, the performance would have been no discredit to a regular company. The title of the piece was a pretty drama called \"The Clear-Sighted Fairy.\" The performers were all neatly dressed, speaking English clearly and distinctly. They were not all that but a very short time ago, they were run- ning about the school grounds. Truly great is the transformation produced by the school. The audience was composed of Indian boys of the school, families from the district, and was most appreciated, especially by the ladies while the boys were enjoying themselves. A laughable farce was then put on by the girls. The performances, however, created a great deal of amusement, and satisfied the varied tastes of the crowd. All ages, some with sourkraut to eat, others with candy, were there to enjoy those who were not satisfied with the performances. The art of self defense was then illustrated from Canada's point of view. Mr. Ufroesser (professor of boxing) came over. He received the honors for his country, while Canadian boys gave him a hearty hand. The library's rustic scene was then presented by Miss McCauley and one McDonald. The boys sang \"God Save the Queen,\" and the school sang \"God Save the Queen,\" and the girls sang \"God Save the Queen.\" This was the most enjoyable part of the evening. Fort Qu'Appelle. These present were unanimous in their praise of the entertainments done by those in charge of the school. The Rev. Principal, Mr. Hugonnard, the principal, being away at the time, was represented by Mr. McCauley. The recently built gymnasium is in a very valuable condition. It not only affords not only a means of procuring athletic exercises during the summer and winter, but also makes a capital hall for concerts and entertainments.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. IIS, of April 24th, and in reply to submit my answer to your letter of February 19th, with regard to reducing the cost of maintaining this Institution.\n\nThe delay in my reply is due to correspondence necessitated by the reduction of the Matrons salary, which reduction had to be agreed to by the Superioress of the Grey Nuns of Montreal, in order not to have the unpleasantness of seeing the Sisters called in by their Superior General.\n\nYour third paragraph states that no effort has been made to manage the Institution more economically. Among the different articles of diet we have chosen the cheapest, substituting prunes and currants, for apples, which were very high.\n\nIf some articles of diet were bought, although not included in the Departments scale, such articles were bought in very small quantities, and were partly to give instruction to girls going out to service, as to the proper manner of preparing them, and in any case any luxuries\n\nThe Indian Commissioner.\n\nRegina.\nluxuries that were bought with the Departments money were used for the sick.\n\nAs soon as we found out the cheapest markets we bought our supplies there, and have favoured no one in buying of a single article.\n\nAs to clothing, besides the brown duck suits for the boys for summer, which as under the Departments management were bought all the rest of the clothes were made here as usual, and you will notice that we economized considerably in the purchase of material.\n\nWe purchased a hay scale, which was a necessity to ascertain the weight of coal, hay, and freight received.\n\nWe also bought a Binder, as the hiring of one every year represented more than the interest of the cost price besides the inconvenience and loss we have experienced from not having one at the right time.\n\nWe also bought a seeder which is acknowledged to be a necessary article on a farm of over 50 acres, and is especially so for us, as our soil is very light and high winds are prevalent.\n\nNo money was spent on childrens travelling expenses except when they first came from their homes, or went out to service.\n\nAs to the reduction in the salaries of the Employees proposed in your letter, I have done as follows which I consider to be all I can do, consistent with the sound management of the school, and without making any reduction that would be at the expense of efficiency, or that would drive away a good Employee.\n\nThe\nThe Farmer was reduced his board and lodging, valued at $15.00, and of $5.00 per month making a reduction of $20.00.\n\nThe Carpenter was reduced his board except dinner, and lodging valued at $12.00, and $3.00 cash, making a reduction of $15.00.\n\nThe Blacksmith was reduced his board and lodging valued at $15.00, and $3.00 cash, making a reduction of $13.00.\n\nThe Shoemaker was reduced his lodging $5.00, and $5.00 cash, making a reduction of $10.00.\n\nThe Furnacesman's salary was reduced $5.00 per month.\n\nThe Mason's salary was reduced $3.33 per month, making a total reduction of $76.33.\n\nWith regard to dispensing with the services of the Blacksmith with a view to economy, I beg to say there would be no saving, but probably an increased expenditure to cover the work done by him now, as every time a pump or pipe would require repairing we would have to send ten miles for a tradesman to do the work. The Blacksmith shop takes in quite a little money and it is a trade very useful for the boys to know.\n\nA reduction of more than $5.00 in the salary of Mr Miles would certainly drive him away, and the work that he does here during the summer as mason, plasterer, painter and general repairer would cost twice the amount paid him as salary, if tradesmen had to be hired to do it.\n\nA reduction in the salaries of the Clerk or Teachers would be at the expense of efficiency and necessitate a change.\nI would state that the duties of these three employees especially increases with the number of inmates, and is therefore heavier here than in other schools.\n\nThe reduction of salaries will not represent the whole deficit, but several articles bought last year will last for a long time, and will be a saving of expense while they last, such as scale, binder, seeder, team of horses to replace those dead.\n\nWith regard to the reduction of the Matrons salary I would say that we have here now two Sisters, not salaried. In order to keep them, and with so many girls we need them I gave the Superioress hope that when the number of pupils is increased to 235 or 280, I may be in a position to make more satisfactory arrangements.\n\nI have, etc.,\nsgd.

Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and Messrs. McCarthy & Co., of Regina, which have been handed me by Mr. Rudolph Bocz, together with some samples of felt manufactured by himself. The letter from Principal Hugonnard sets forth fully what is proposed by Mr. Bocz, and it is only necessary to add that for a beginning and to conduct the manufacture of the article on a moderate scale, an outlay of only about $50.00 is required for the necessary plant. The material being wholly wool can easily and readily be procured and present prices therefor are very low, material sufficient to make as much felt as would sell for $1.40, costing only about .7\u00a2 to .10\u00a2. The work is done entirely by hand and will give employment to children of all ages from 10 years upwards. In a course of 2 1/2 to 3 years' training they will, with ordinary intelligence, be able to manufacture for themselves. Harness felt, which is of a cheaper grade, can also be made and Mr. Bocz is competent to make the stiff felt from which \"Cowboy\" hats are made - the material of which is rabbit's hair and an article easily and cheaply obtainable here and which when manufactured commands a good price.\n\nThere is said to be a ready demand for all these wares at the prices marked on the samples, the prices being high\n\nThe Deputy of,\nThe Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit for your consideration the following report re the advisability of starting a tannery in connection with the school.\n\nTanning is an industry that has been neglected in this Country and one here would fill a much felt want in this district as the raw material, viz., hides are here and can be procured far cheaper than the tanneries situated in the east can buy them for.\n\nHides are sold here at an average of 3 cents a pound and leather costs from 25 cents to one dollar a pound.\n\nAll the leather turned out could be made into boots or sold.\n\nThe tanning is done with extract of bark and japonica at the Winnipeg tannery, which is a great success. There they finish from 75 to 100 sides every week and turn all the leather into boots and cannot fill all their orders.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina.\norders.\n\nThe tan and japonica have to be imported but the freight on it is nothing as compared with the freight on the hides when sent down and the finished leather when sent back.\n\n1st Tanning would be a particularly suitable industry here for the following reasons:\n\n1st Tanning is nearly all hand work and could be done by our pupils and ex-pupils with great advantage to the school and themselves.\n\n2nd Water - a large quantity is required for tanning, this we have in a convenient place.\n\n3rd Hides - more hides are procurable round here than in the ranching districts where cattle are mostly shipped and not killed on the spot.\n\n4th Leather - The leather would be required for our shoe shop, and for felt boots, and would probably all be turned into boots.\n\n5th Sheep Skins. These would have to be bought to be clipped to supply the wool for the felt, and would almost be lost unless tanned on the spot, but when tanned they could be used for boot lining, gloves, mitts &c.\n\n6th Hair from Hides, this would also be used for the felt.\n\n7th The same shoe shop would do for making felt and leather boots.\nA tannery without a shoe shop would not be a success, as the leather made could hardly compete in appearance with that of eastern manufacture, though it can all be made up into boots and harness with great advantage.\n\nThe tannery and felt factory would work into each other to great advantage - leaving no waste and ensuring success.\n\nIf the Department would supply the plant I would run the tannery on the grant with profit to the pupils, to the Institution, and probably to a certain number of ex-pupils.\n\nTwo thousand five hundred dollars ($2500.00) would buy the plant consisting of a building 20 x 40 with vats and one splitting machine.\n\nI would beg the Department to give this industry its careful consideration, as we have the natural facilities here, the necessary labour, and the raw material in the district if the tannery were started in conjunction with the felt factory. I am sure we could run it on the grant with profit to the Institution, pupils and district.\n\nsgd. J. Hugonnard,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nQu'Appelle, 29th June, 1896.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit a report re the proposed felt factory.\n\nYour letter of June 17th states that the Department will bear the cost of the plant, estimated at about $50.00. Mr. Boz says $50.00 will only cover the cost of the several special appliances and tools which have to be made here by him or under his direction.\n\nThese consist of (I do not know the English names):\n\n- Felting Shelters $6.00\n- 50 ft. 54\" Strings at 5\u00a2 $2.50\n- 5 Large Tables at $2.00 $10.00\n- 5 Smaller Tables $8.00\n- 3 prs Scissors, 2 ft. $6.00\n- Fachbogen $1.00 $5.00\n- 1 Sheet Iron 1/4\" x 2 1/2\" x 4' $4.00\n- 7 Schlagholzars $3.50\n- 1 Large Tub $2.00\n- 12 Lead Weights $2.00\n- 3 Frames, with heavy linen 5' x 8' $2.00\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\nand as per list will cost $51.00\n\nOne month's work to Mr. Boss, making or superintending the plant and fixings $45.00\n\n3 Agricultural Boilers, (to boil and dye the felt) $96.00\n\n1 Tailor's heater for ironing the felt, $15.00\n\nThe combing machine already ordered from Austria?\n\n1 Sewing machine, Blocks and Tools, to manufacture the felt into Boots and Hats, $75.00\n\nand the necessary accommodation, which can be provided by adding one story to the building above the root house which is 20' x 70', the cost is estimated at about $700.00\n\nAs nothing can be done before suitable accommodation is provided it is important that the building should be put up at once, as if left till after the session the building could not be completed much before Fall, which would deprive us of the benefit of one year's trade, as all felt is ordered at the commencement of the winter and customers who in view of our manufacturing for this fall's trade are holding their orders over for our benefit will have to order elsewhere; thus if the manufacture of the felt could not be started some time early in September, it would mean a year lost to us and that the running expenses would be without return for over a year or until the fall\nfall of next year\u2014which would be a very heavy drain on the per capita grant.\n\nMr. Booz has already made 3 trips here from Regina and is very anxious to commence as soon as possible as part of his salary is dependent upon the profits from the felt.\n\nOn these grounds I would therefore suggest that the building be commenced at once, and that authority be given for the purchase or manufacture of the articles enumerated above so that we may catch this fall and winter's trade, get some experience of the best paying lines and obtain some return this year for the expense incurred.\n\nAs to the advisability of starting the factory, although it has already met with the approval of the Department, I may add here my own reasons in favour of it.\n\nIn the first place it will be a highly desirable industry for the country,\n\n1stly Because we have the raw material\u2014wool and hair.\n\n2ndly It is nearly all hand work and light enough to give employment to children as well as adults.\n\n3rdly There is a ready sale for all the felt, felt boots and felt hats we can make.\n\n4thly It will be a credit to the Government to start a factory which will fill a want felt in\nthe North-West more than elsewhere.\n\n6thly It will give useful employment to our pupils and ex-pupils if required.\n\n6thly The felt made with wool will be far better than foreign felt made of rags and should speedily replace it.\n\nI have made careful enquiry into the subject and can see no reason why it should not be successful from the start, and besides giving useful employment to the pupils be a source of revenue to the school.\n\nsgd.

Sisters were quarantined with the sick, as nurses, and did not leave the hospital the whole time; their careful nursing, and attendance to the doctor's directions, have no doubt contributed greatly towards the happy issue of the epidemic.\n\nIt was most fortunate the fever broke out the day it did, as if it had occurred a day later we would have been without the services of Dr. Seymour, who was actually on his way to the station to attend the Medical Conference in Montreal, when he called in here and discovered the first cases.

The whole case can be summarized thus: On June 17th, 1896 an official letter authorized the engagement of R. Booz at $45.00 per month and board. On October 1897 I engaged him at $30.00 per month - the balance of $10.00 to be given him only if there was a clear cash profit of that amount from the felt industry.\n\nMr. Booz was engaged for two years so that he could not compel us to raise his wages or stop the industry. The Department were informed of this in letter No. 5984 of April 2nd, 1897.\n\nThe fire at the end of Nov. 1897 having destroyed the factory put an end to the industry, and I was instructed to discharge Mr. Booz. This I did giving him 3 months salary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\nMr. Rozz left without authority, took an engagement elsewhere, and still claims to be paid for the full year.\n\nAs I am ordered to appear before 20 days in Regina, and as I acted in the matter as the representative of the Government, and not as a private individual, I beg to ask that the Department will secure the services of a lawyer who will gather all the information required and present himself in my behalf before the Clerk of the Court before the expiration of the 20 days.

Hugonnard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial School, whereby the Principal agreed to employ plaintiff from such date until 31st December, 1896, to manufacture felt and oversee other workmen at the Indian Industrial School at Qu'Appelle, for $35.00 per month, and also to pay $10.00 per month extra out of the profits of the concern. The plaintiff duly entered upon his employment and continued therein until the 28th November 1897, when the Industrial School was burned. He put in a claim to your Department, which was not recognized, and he thereupon brought an action against the defendant claiming $1035.00, being for two and one half years' salary at\nat $45.00 per month, and board from the\n1st December, 1897, to 31st December, 1898,\nand $45.00 due him for fixing the felt\nplant of the institution. This is the\namount he claimed to be due after crediting\nthe sum of $207.00 received on account of\nsalary and $152.00 received on account\nof profits of felt factory. The Honour-\nable Mr. Justice Richardson recently\ndismissed the plaintiff's action, holding\nthat the defendant was not personally\nliable under the contract, as he was\nacting as the agent of the Dominion\nGovernment in entering into the contract\nin question. In view of this decision\nwe now write to ask if it is the intention\nof the Department to entertain the claim of\nMr. Boaz for remuneration. If not, we\npurpose, on his behalf, applying for the\nnecessary leave to file a petition of\nright.\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\n(Sgd) Hamilton & Jones.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 1st. of February 1898, in regard to a claim made by Mr. Boez against the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for arrears of salary, etc., and to enclose a letter received from Messrs Hamilton & Jones, of Regina, Counsel for Mr. Boez, which explains itself; also the account of Mr. T.C. Johnstone, Barrister, Regina, who acted for Rev. Father Hugonnard, the latter having been brought into Court by Mr. Boez.\n\nThe original claim of Mr. Boez was as follows,-\n\nJune 17 '96 to Sept. 17, 3 mos. at $45.00 $135.00\nSept. 17 '96 to Sept 29th. Fixing plant in Felt Factory. 45.00\nSept. 29 '96 to Nov 29th. '97, 14 mos. at $10.00 held back as a bond per month. 140.00\nThree months notice. 135.00\nLess $112.00 received on a/c of bond. 112.00\nBalance - $343.00\n\nThis claim was forwarded by the Department to this office together with correspondence and agreements establishing the position.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nposition of the Principal of the Qu'Appelle School in the matter, viz: that he agreed to give Mr. Boez $35.00 a month together with an additional $10.00 a month providing that the felt shop made a certain stated amount of profit per month.\n\nThe said profit not having eventuated Mr. Boez was only allowed $35.00 a month. For the same reason Mr. Boez does not seem entitled to the $45.00 agreed upon for the setting in of the plant. The three months notice was given and the Principal would have paid salary for this period if Mr. Boez had remained at work which apparently he did not do.\n\nIn consequence of the above the late Commissioner, Hon. Mr. Forget, came to the conclusion that there was no cause for complaint; whereupon Rev. Father Hugonnard was brought into court where it was decided that he was not the proper party to be sued.\n\nIt will be seen that since the first claim was made that the amount has swelled considerably owing to Mr. Boez asking salary to the 31st December last, whilst he actually left the school on Nov. 1897 and entered at that time into some agreement which necessarily prevented him from working at the school.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Johnstone's bill, I may say that Rev. Father Hugonnard was authorized to avail himself of his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary to the Indian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 12th July, 1899\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nRe claim of Rudolph Boez for wages as instructor at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school:\n\nBoez sued the Principal of the school for his wages and his action was dismissed by Mr Justice Richardson at Regina on the ground that the Principal was not personally liable under the contract as he was acting as the Agent of the Dominion Government. Messrs Hamilton & Jones, who are acting for Boez, state that if the Department does not intend to entertain his claim, they intend to apply for the necessary leave to file a petition of right.\n\nThere is nothing on file to show that the Department is a party to the contract before us. It would appear that any arrangement entered into was made either through the Regina Office, or through the Deputy Superintendent General when he was in the West in '96.\n\nI think that the question of the liability of the Department should be submitted to the Law Clerk.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is nothing to show that the Department authorized the employment but on the other hand the Principal's letter of 30th June, 1898, stated \"if the Department would supply the plant I would run the tannery on the grant with profit to the pupils, to the institution, and probably to a certain number of ex-pupils.\"\n\nIf the learned judge trial judge held that the Principal was not personally liable I can only conclude that he had before him evidence which does not appear on the file.\n\nThere would appear, however, to be a good defence to the claim on the merits; and should it be discovered, that as between the Principal and the Department, there was no departure from his offer above quoted the Department even if there is any liability under the contract the Department would have a right over against the Principal of the school.\n\nLaw Clerk.\nOTTAWA, 17th July, 1898\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, forwarding a communication from Messrs Hamilton & Jons, barristers, &c., Regina, respecting the claim of Rudolph Booz for arrears of wages as instructor at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school; and in reply to the enquiry made by Mr Booz's lawyers I beg to say that the Department has no intention of entertaining Mr Booz's claim for remuneration.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

That plaintiff performed no services for the defendant. That he is not indebted to plaintiff $45 for fixing up the felt plant. That at the end of the year there was no clear profit. That plaintiff has not always been ready and willing to continue the services he agreed to do.\n\nThat instead of being discharged plaintiff left his employment of his own accord and if held that defendant did employ plaintiff that...\nHe received a bonus of three months' salary and after leaving defendant, employed plaintiff engaged in other services.\n\nThe main question to be determined by me was upon which the plaintiff's right of action depends; whether plaintiff's employment was by defendant in his private capacity or as the agent or representative of the Government of Canada.\n\nFrom the evidence on this head the following facts appear: Plaintiff knew that the Indian Industrial School over which the defendant was principal was a government institution.\n\nKnowing such, plaintiff called upon defendant at the school about May 1876 and after explaining his own capabilities suggested that a felt factory should be started at the school. To this defendant stated that he was willing, but would have to be guided by the Indian Department, and to further the proposal defendant wrote to the Indian Commissioner at Regina giving this letter to plaintiff who stated he duly delivered it in person to that official who after discussing the subject with plaintiff told him, he, the Commissioner would have to corre...\nTwo weeks later, plaintiff again waited on the Commissioner's office on the second occasion meeting Mr. Reed, the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs who has come up from Ottawa. This interview happened 17 June 1896, resulting in an official letter being written by Mr. Reed's direction to defendant which letter plaintiff either carried or delivered or it may have gone by post. By this letter defendant was informed that plaintiff had been instructed by the deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs to report to defendant for duty. His salary is to be $5 per month with board and lodging and will be payable from your grant and the proceeds of the manufacture.\n\nPlaintiff appears then to have gone to work about 17th September '96 and was engaged in fixing up the plant and it was in order for work by the 30 September '96 and the defendant then started the manufacture of felt. On Oct 2/1896 a writing was prepared and signed. This is sworn to as that upon which it is claimed by plaintiff defendant is liable in this suit and the one referred to in paragraph 7 of...\nIndian Industrial School\n\nIn Appellee 2nd Oct. 1876.\n\nI, undersigned, Rudolph Boey, hereby agree to manufacture felt and to oversee other working at it in this school from date up till 31 December 1898 for the consideration of $5 a month and board and lodging.\n\nRev. Father Hugonnard agrees to add another $5 a month if there at the end of the first year there is a clear profit of $240 over all expenses and work connected with the felt manufacturing.\n\nI agree to work 15 hours a day and to take in the felt-making the same interest as if it were my private business.\n\nMr. Boey will receive 3 months notice before to leave after 2 years.\n\nP.S. J. Hugonnard\n\nFrom the date of this agreement, the felt manufacturing proceeded under plaintiff's labor until 26 November 1877, when the establishment was totally destroyed by fire and thus was plaintiff thrown out of employment.\n\nDuring the working of the factory, plaintiff wages were regularly paid him by defendant out of money placed to his credit by the Government and out of the parliamentary grant for carrying on the Industrial School.\nprivate bank payable to plaintiff's order and indorsed by him. They are signed J. Hoganward and under his signature appears stamped \"Industrial School Gillisville.\"\n\nA further agreement was adduced at the hearing \u00a7 18 as follows:\n\n14 May 1897. I, undersigned, agree to allow Mr. Booz above his salary the rent of the house from May 17, 1897 and one month he put in to prepare plant provided that after all expenses paid there is sufficient sum of money profit of the felt industry to make for the school the same amount as the rent and month work will come to. As Rudolph Booz. Rs J. Hoganward.\n\nNow the following facts are plain and clear:\n\nI. That the plaintiff knew from the commencement that of negotiations that with the defendant that the latter was the officer in charge of the Industrial School, a Government Institution.\n\nII. That he arranged for services in that institution with the Deputy Superintendent and Indian Commissioner, defendants' superior officers, and under this in September 1896 became a civil servant of the Crown.\n\nIII. That receiving a cheque for wages as he did by law, the was...\ngrants made to plaintiff for running the institution, i.e., the public purse.\n\nPlaintiff admitted that after the fire he personally applied to the Indian Commissioner for further employment.\n\nThat on the face of Ex. \"A\" there is no express undertaking or promise by defendant personally to pay the plaintiff the wages named in the consideration, i.e., the services were to be performed for the Government and which in ordinary cases of contract between individuals there would be an implied promise to pay for services undertaken when as in this case it is plainly apparent from the contract\u2014Ex. \"A\" itself, defendant was contracting, not as a principal but as agent notwithstanding he signed the document in his own name without the qualification inasmuch as evidence for what capacity and for what purpose defendant did sign it, is receivable on the ground that it does not contradict the document itself.\n\nIt was thus proper for me at the hearing to receive and now give effect to the intention of the parties in signing Ex. \"A\" which I find was to evidence a contract between plaintiff and defendant as an agent of the Dominion Government. His evidence was receivable also because what defendant did was proven to have been done by him.\ncontracts for service with public servants being on a different footing from the liability of an ordinary agent on his contract in the absence of special material evidence of an intention by defendant to be personally liable.\n\nI refer to Smith leading cases 386 in appeal Young vs Schuler 117 F.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemo: the Secretary,\n\nThe copy of Mr. Justice Richardson's judgment in the matter of Bocz vs. Hugonard which is now on this file was submitted to the Department with an informal request that the matter should be gone into in the light of that judgment, and the question decided as to whether under all the circumstances Bocz had not an equitable claim against the Department for a portion of his claim. It was pointed out that Father Hugonard before employing Bocz to start the felt industry submitted the matter to the Department; that the then Indian Commissioner communicated with the then Superintendent General; and that the felt industry was started and Bocz was employed with the authority of the then Deputy Superintendent General. It was urged that this interven-\nintervention of the Department justified Bocz in believing Father Hugonard was acting as Agent of the Department, and that the Department would be responsible for the carrying out of the terms of the agreement. Judge Richardson's judgment is in favour of that view for he dismissed the action on the ground that Father Hugonard had not incurred a personal liability, but was acting as the Agent of the Crown in the agreement which he made with Bocz.\n\nAfter going carefully into the matter I would suggest that the principal papers in the matter appear to be of record in the Indian Commissioners office that a copy of the judgment be sent to him with the substance of this memorandum, and that he be asked to go carefully into the matter in the light of that judgment, and advise the Department whether he considers Bocz has an equitable claim, and, if so, to what amount.\n\nIt seems to me that as Bocz purposes seeking redress by petition of right, the Dept should go fully into his claim before leaving him to that last resort.\n\nJ.

McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nMr. Rudolph Boez,\nRegina,\nN.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant respecting the claim of Mr. R. Bocz for arrears of wages as instructor at Qu'Appelle Industrial School, covering a copy of His Honour Judge Richardson's judgment in regard to said claim as brought in action against the Principal of the School, and asking me to advise the Department in the light of that judgment, whether I consider Mr. Bocz has an equitable claim, and if so to what amount.\n\nI have carefully read Mr. Justice Richardson's judgment and the correspondence in this office bearing upon Mr. Bocz's claim, and must say it is very complicated. But as the transactions, respecting which the alleged arrears of wages are said to be due, took place before I became Indian Commissioner, I feel free to give an opinion on the equity of the claim. Being a layman, of course, I cannot be expected to discuss its legality.\n\nThere are two aspects in which the claim may be viewed, namely, the Department's direct instructions, and the agreements entered into by the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, acting, according to Judge Richardson, as the Agent of the Dominion Government. The papers on file here, however, do not clearly show that these agreements were authorized either\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\neither by the Department or the Indian Commissioner. Mr. Boez in making out his statement of arrears seeks to take advantage of every point where the Department and the Principal were not in touch, whereas, in my opinion, to establish an equitable case, he ought to hold by either the Department or the Principal of the School.\n\nAmong the papers in this office is a copy of the following letter:\n\n\"Commissioner's Office,\nRegina,\n17th June 1896.\n\n\"No. II37/18\n\n\"Sir,\n\n\"Mr. Rudolph Boez, who is a manufacturer of German Felt and who recently interviewed yourself and the Commissioner regarding employment in this line at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, has been instructed by the Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs to report to you for duty.\n\n\"His salary is to be $45.00 per month with board and lodging, and will be payable from your grant and the proceeds of the manufacture. The Department will bear the cost of necessary plant for a beginning on a small scale, the aggregate of which is placed by Mr. Boez at $50.00.\n\n\"Mr. Boez has, I understand, already left for Qu'Appelle.\"\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Sgd) F.H. Paget,\nfor Commissioner.\n\n\"The Principal\nIndustrial School,\nQu'Appelle.\"\n\nThis letter informs the Principal that Mr. Boez \"has been instructed by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to report to you for duty. His salary is to be $45.00 per\n\"per month with board and lodging\", &c. This reads like an appointment of Mr. Bocz to a position in the School. At any rate he claims $45.00 per month, from the date of above letter, irrespective of his agreement with Rev. Father Hugonnard on the 2nd October following. Assuming the Deputy Superintendent General to be a higher authority than the Principal of the School, and making out the account seemingly in accordance with the instructions of the former, it would stand somewhat thus:-\n\nQu'Appelle Industrial School\nto Rudolph Bocz, Dr.\n\nTo wages as Instructor in Felt Manufacture\nfrom June 17, 1896 until date of fire\nNov. 26, 1897, 17 months and 9 days at $45.00. $778.50\n* wages 1 month for lack of previous notice. 45.00\n* Board and Lodging 1 month. 21.50\n\n$845.00\n\nCr.\n\nBy 14 months salary at $35.00 $490.00\n* additional 60.00\n* do 52.00 602.00\n\n$243.00\n\nTo which it may be right to add cost and expenses of suit Bocz vs Hugonnard. 85.00\n\n$328.00\n\nThe agreements entered into between Mr. Bocz and the Principal of the Qu'Appelle School are as follows:-\n\n\"Industrial School\nQu'Appelle.\nOct. 2nd. 1896.\n\n\"I, undersigned, Rudolph Bocz, hereby agree to manufacture Felt\n\"Felt and to oversee others working at it in this School from\ndate up till 31st. of December 1898 for the consideration of\n\"$35.00 a month and board and lodging for myself.\n\n\"Rev.

October 1896, it would\nappear fair to allow him for his services in preparing the\nfelt plant before that date. In this view of the case,\nand with Principal Hugonnard's agreement as a basis, the\n\naccount\naccount would stand somewhat as follows:\n\nQu'Appelle Industrial School\n\nTo Rudolph Becz, Dr.\n\nTo services in September 1896 in preparing Felt Plant. $45.00\n\nWages as Instructor in Felt Manufacture from Oct 2, 1896 until date of Fire Nov. 26, 1897, 14 months at $35.00 490.00\n\nExtra wages as share of possible profits for 14 months at $10.00 140.00\n\nWages for 3 months while notice of discharge was running, at $35.00 105.00\n\nBoard and Lodging for 3 months at $21.50 64.50\n\n$844.50\n\nCr.\n\nBy 14 months salary at $35.00 $490.00\n\nadditional 60.00\n\n\" \" 52.00 602.00\n\n$242.50\n\nTo which it may be right to add cost and expenses of suit Becz -vs- Hugonnard. 85.00\n\n$327.50\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that by taking a separate view of the two methods of presenting the claim, and not including both as Mr. Becz does in some of his varied statements of account, the apparent equitable claim comes out about the same.\n\nIn my opinion, therefore, should the Department, on behalf of the school, offer Mr. Rudolph Becz, without prejudice, the sum\nsum of Three Hundred and Thirty Dollars ($330.00) in full settlement of all his claims, he would be liberally dealt with in an equitable point of view.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th April, 1960\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe claim of R.

The Department has already had to pay over $170.00 for defending Father Hugonnard and if Becz brings an action against it, which his solicitors threaten to do, it will be put to additional cost. His Honor, Judge Richardson apparently holds that the Department is liable for the carrying out of the agreement with Becz, and I think it would be cheaper in the end to arrive at a settlement with Becz than to go to law again.\n\nThe question now seems to be how much the Department should offer Becz and what he would be willing to accept.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Rev. Father has worked a great deal and with great success during the many years that he has spent in Qu'Appelle.

His Honour Judge Richardson, before whom the case was tried, dismissed the action on the ground that the Rev. Father Hugonnard, the Principal had not incurred personal liability, but was acting as the Agent of the Crown in the agreement which he made with Mr. Ross. It was pointed out that Father Hugonnard before employing Ross to start the felt industry submitted the matter to the Department and that when the felt industry was started at the Qu'Appelle School Ross was employed with the authority of the Department, and that the intervention of the Department justified Ross in believing Father Hugonnard was acting as Agent of the Department and that the Department was responsible for carrying out the terms of the agreement.\n\nThe Indian Council was requested to go carefully into the matter, in the light of the judgment referred to, and to advise the Department whether he considered Ross had an equitable claim, and if so to what amount. The Commissioner reported recommended that\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa.\nthe Department, on behalf of the School, should offer Boes the sum of $380.00 in full settlement of all his claim, stating at the same time that he (the Commissioner) considered that Boes would then be liberally dealt with from an equitable point of view.\n\nIn arriving at the amount stated the Commissioner included the costs Boes was put to in his suit against Revd Father Hugonnard (which amounted to $65.00). Mr Boes never made any claim on the Department previous to entering suit against the Principal, and his first claim against that officer was only $448.00, although he sued the Principal for $1038.00 and afterwards claimed $1444.80. The Department Department had to pay over $170.00 for defending the Principal and if Boes had brought an action further against it (which his solicitors threatened to do) it would have been put to additional cost. His Honour Judge Richardson (as above stated) apparently holding that the Department was liable for the carrying out of the agreement with Boes. It being therefore considered that in equity Boes was entitled to compensation, and also that it would be cheaper in the end to arrive at a settlement with him than to go to law again, the Department offered him, through the Indian Commissioner, the sum of $380.00 on the distinct understanding that this amount was in full settlement of all claims his claim.\n\nIt was thought advisable to draw the cheque in the Commissioner's favour, in order that he might see Mr Boes and personally adjust attend to the matter, which would have been difficult to arrange by correspondence. The matter was adjusted, Mr Boes accepting the amount in question, for which he gave a receipt in full of his claim, which receipt I transmit herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHouse of Commons\n\nOttawa, April 17th 1901\n\nJames A. Smart, Esq.\nDep. Minister of Interior.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Smart,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th on the subject of the claim of Mr. Rudolph Bocz of Regina in which you state that this matter was finally adjusted in August last when Mr. Bocz accepted from the Dept. the sum of $330.25 in full settlement of all his claims against the Dept., or the Qu'Appelle Industrial School as well as expenses in Court and otherwise. I beg to submit that my personal knowledge of the case warrants me in stating that the above is a mistaken presentation.\n\nI was at Regina when the Indian Commissioner came there last August. He had an interview with Mr. Bocz and stated that he was prepared then and there to pay $330.25 in full settlement. Bocz declined to accept that and came to see me about the matter. I advised him to refuse to take the $330.25 as a full settlement but told him he might as well take that amount if the Commissioner would pay it over to him on the understanding that it would not prejudice his claim for further consideration. It was on such distinct understanding that he accepted the payment of the amount.\n\nSince that time Bocz had several interviews with myself and he\nhad one interview with Hon. Mr Sifton. Both myself and Mr Sifton promised him that his claim would receive further consideration. I am very strongly of the opinion that another $330 at least is due him. If I recollect aright his total claim was for an amount in the neighborhood of $1400. I do not think that he can show good title to the whole amount but I think a total amount of $660 would certainly be nothing more than he is well entitled to.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWalter Scott\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of the Interior,\n\nTo Mr. McLean,\n\nPlease report.\n\n19th April, 1901.\n\nac.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 20th April, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nRe claim of Rudolph Bocz.\n\nThis claim has been before the Department in different forms for nearly three years first taking the shape of an action against Father Hugonnard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial school for arrears of wages as instructor, which action was dismissed by His Honor, Judge Richardson of Regina on the ground that the Principal was not personally liable under the contract as he was acting as the agent of the Dominion Government. Proceedings for the recovery of the costs in the above action were instituted against Bocz, but were discontinued by order of the Acting Minister, and the Indian Commissioner was directed to go carefully into the matter in the light of Judge Richardson's judgment and advise the Department whether he considered Bocz had an equitable claim, and if so to what amount. He reported fully on the matter in April of last year and recommended that the Department, on behalf of the school, should offer Bocz the sum of $330.00 in full settlement of all his claim, considering that he would then be equitably dealt with from an equitable point of view. In arriving at this amount the Commissioner states that he included the costs Bocz was put to in his suit against Father Hugonnard, amounting to $85.00.\nI have turned out the memorandum signed by the Minister directing that Boez be offered the $330.00 as recommended by the Commissioner, as well as the Department's letter of the 25th July addressed to the Commissioner directing him to offer Mr Boez that amount on the distinct understanding that it was in full settlement of all his claims against the Department. A Cheque for the amount was enclosed to him and he was requested to obtain a receipt in full from Boez and forward the same to the Department.\n\nOn the 13th August last the Commissioner reported that he had proceeded to Regina to endeavor to effect a settlement with Mr Boez, stating that it was well he did so as it could not, he believes, be accomplished by correspondence. He forwards a receipt from Mr Boez for $330.00 being in full settlement of all his claims against the Department or the Qu'Appelle Industrial school in connection with his services as a former employee of said school, expenses of suit in court and otherwise. The Commissioner further states that it was understood that when this receipt was signed that the Department would make no claim thereafter for costs in the case of Boez vs Hugonnard. (Receipt and covering letter turned out).\n\nIn conclusion I may add that there is nothing on file to show that the Commissioner made any agreement, or that any understanding was arrived at that the acceptance of this amount by Boez would not prejudice his claim for further consideration, and the only way to corroborate the statement of Mr Scott, M.P., would be to write to the Commissioner.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reporting on the matter on the 13th of August last, the Indian Commissioner states that\n\nWalter Scott, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nthat he had proceeded to Regina to affect a settlement with Mr. Boos, and that it was well that he had done so, as otherwise he did not believe the matter could have been arranged by correspondence.

I may say that I am absolutely positive that this is a mistake. I was not present at conferences between Mr Booz and Mr Laird, but after the first conference Booz came to me and stated that he had refused to accept the amount offered. I advised him to accept the sum offered, on the understanding that further consideration would be given his claim; and certainly the various conferences that took place in October would give Booz the very strongest ground to deny that he had accepted the $350 as a full settlement.\n\nIf the Commissioner's report to Booz is to stand, I think that Booz could rightfully claim breach of faith concerning myself, yourself, and Mr Smart.\n\nAs I have already stated, my own opinion of the claim is, that Booz is well entitled to have the sum already paid him duplicated.\n\nI think it will be well for me to have a final understanding about this matter before going home.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWalter Scott\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Adolph Bocz, of Regina, has had a claim pending before the Department for a considerable time now, and I think something should be done to have it disposed of in some way. Briefly the facts would appear to be as follows:\n\nIn the month of October, 1896, an agreement was entered into between Rev. Father Hugonnard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and Mr. Bocz, by which the latter agreed to manufacture felt and to oversee others working at it at the School from the date above mentioned to the 31st December, 1896, 27 months, for the consideration of $35.00 a month, with board and lodging. On the 26th November, 1897, the Felt Manufacture was destroyed by fire, and in consequence the services of Mr. Bocz were discontinued. He thereupon instituted proceedings against Father Hugonnard for breach of agreement, and Judgment was rendered against him on the ground that Father Hugonnard was not personally responsible, but had acted in this matter as the representative of the Department. The matter then came before the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, who recommended a settlement by which Mr. Bocz should be paid any moneys coming to him for services rendered up to the time of the fire, but his claim on account of termination of contract was not recognized.\n\nI have marked underneath a copy of the agreement entered into between Father Hugonnard and Mr. Bocz in this relation, and according to my reading; of the same it would seem quite cle\n\nThe Hon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nthat although the was destroyed by fire some 13 months before the termination of the contract it did not relieve the Department from the obligation of giving employment and board to Mr. Booz up to the 31st December, 1896, and I am therefore of the opinion that he should be paid for the full term of his engagement, including three months prior to the date of such engagement when it was understood he should receive $45 per month. The following is a rough statement of his account:\n\n3 months at $45 per month prior to date of agreement ........................................... $135.00\n27 months salary at $35 per month .................................................. $945.00\n13 months board at $15 a month ......................... $195.00\nCosts of suit against Principal ............... $5.00\n\n$1260.00\nReceived on account ........................................... $22.00\nBalance due ...................................................... $438.00\n\nIn order to clear this long standing matter, I think Mr. Booz might fairly be paid the above amount, less the allowance for board at $15 per month. This would leave a balance of $243, which, with your approval, I will have paid over to him in full settlement of his claim.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, 18th October, 1901.\n\nPrivate:\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have carefully gone into the claim of Rudolph Boez, of Regina, and outside of his full receipt which he gave through the Indian Commissioner, and I have come to the conclusion that the only settlement that could be arrived at and to which I think Mr. Boez could not take the slightest exception, is as follows:\n\nI allow him three months salary at $45 per month, the rate fixed before he entered into the agreement with Father Hugonard. This amounts to $135. Allowing him 27 months salary 1/4 of which he was employed in the institution and 1/3 he was out of it altogether in consequence of the fire, at $75, $945. I also allow him $65 costs of suit against the Principal. This makes a total of $1,165, upon which he has already been paid $922, the balance being $243. The only difference is in connection with the charge which he has made for board for the 15 months, the balance of the time under the agreement during which he was not given any work or pay, and I have balanced this against whatever he may have earned during that time. I do not think any other arrangement can be made than this.\n\nWalter Scott, Esq., M.P.,\nRegina, Assiniboia.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply, I beg to state that I regret that Mr. Booz should not see his way clear to accepting the offer made as in recommending that he should be paid a balance of $243, in full settlement. I considered that I had stretched a point in his favour, and as far as I am concerned I must say that there is no way in which this amount can be increased. I hope, therefore, that after reconsideration Mr. Booz will find it is to his advantage, as it certainly will be, to accept the settlement proposed in my letter above referred to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWalter Scott, Esq., M.P.,\nRegina,\nAssa.

In connection with this payment I beg to ask your attention to the correspondence on a similar payment made in the fiscal year 1899-1900, which correspondence will be found on Page J 157-158 of my report for that year.

Booz in full claim for wages at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. In that letter you inform me that, although Mr. Booz had signed a receipt in full of his claim when the previous payment of $330.00 was made in 1900, he immediately wrote to the Superintendent General informing him that he could not accept this payment in full, and that he continued to press for a settlement, so that it was thought advisable to reopen the matter and to make the further payment now in question, as Mr. Booz appeared to have a fair and just claim for the amount.\n\nIn your letter of October 3rd, 1900, in connection with the first payment to Mr. Booz, you stated that the Indian Commissioner, after having been requested to go carefully into the matter, recommended that the department should pay Booz the sum of $330.00 in full settlement, and that he considered that Booz would thus be liberally dealt with from an equitable point of view. You further stated in that letter that Mr. Booz had never made any claim against the department previous to his suit against the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and that his original claim against the Principal of the School was for only $343.00, although he afterwards sued the Principal for $1,033.00, and subsequently claimed $1,444.90.\n\nAs the amount recommended to be paid by the Indian Commissioner, after he had gone carefully into the matter, was $332.00\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n$330.00, I should like to know what further information has been obtained with reference to this claim to pay an additional amount of $243.00, and also upon whose recommendation this payment was made and to be supplied with any further documentary evidence in your possession on the additional payment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\nOTTAWA, 26th December, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to the enquiries contained in your letter of the 26th ultimo respecting the further payment of $243.00 made to Rudolph Booz in full settlement of his claim for $500 as Trade Instructor at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school, I beg to say that in the month of October 1896 an agreement was entered into by Rev. Father Hugonnard, Principal of this school and Mr Booz by which the latter agreed to manufacture felt and oversee others engaged in this work at the school from the 2nd October to the 31st December 1896 (twenty-seven months) for the consideration of $35.00 a month with board and lodging. On the 26th November 1897 the felt shop was destroyed by fire and the services of Mr Booz were, in consequence, discontinued. He thereupon instituted proceedings against Father Hugonnard for breach of agreement but was non-suited on the ground that Father Hugonnard was not personally responsible but had acted as the representative of this Department. The matter then came before the Indian Commissioner at Winnipeg, who recommended a settlement by which Mr Booz should be paid any monies coming to him for services rendered up to the time of the fire, but his claim on account of the termination of his contract.\n\nThe Auditor General\n\nOTTAWA\n\nIndian Affairs.

The conditions however were accepted a few years ago notwithstanding the above agreement, the grant for all pupils below 10 years of age was reduced of one half thus making it below the grant to boarding schools, which have not the same expenses to incur, & objected to it, but the reduction was enforced, even for\n\nThe Hon.\n\nThe Sup't General\n\nof Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfor pupils previously admitted.\n\nPresently, the higher prices for supplies, fuel and labor, the difficulty of recruiting have made it impossible for me to manage the school any longer with present grant. For the same reason, the presbyterian authorities have asked and obtained an increase of $10.00 for their school at Regina, which was already five dollars higher than for our school. Under the present circumstances, I feel justified to ask for the same increase, which would make our grant still $10.00 below the Regina grant, as here the five dollars more they received previously, it cost us five dollars a head for the transport of supplies and personnel from station to the school.\n\nI hope your Honor will consider this demand a reasonable one. This school has been always managed more economically than other...\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat\n\nother schools of the North West; still we are indebted of over $1300.00 and we have been unable to clothe the pupils as they are in the Regina school which difference was noticed by visitors. If I could not obtain such a reasonable demand, which was granted to a school already more favored otherwise by the help received from their church, I would consider myself as the cause of the refusal and a not agreeable to the Dept., as unfit to manage at any larger.\n\nI asked the Indian Commissioner to place $1000 of increase in the new estimate, I beg to ask now the Superintendent General that this increase may start from the beginning of present quarter, as it was granted last winter to the Principal of the Regina School.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nyour most obedient servant\n\nJ.

General about increase of $500 by our grant to start from the beginning of present quarter I beg to state that the increased from present quarter would be a help to pay present deficit for which nothing is asked and which permits us to take advantage of the discount on the purchases. It would be in accordance with my demand and the recommendation of the Board at the time that the reduction of one half of the grant was imposed for pupils under ten years old. The reduction although general, was not made on account of our school as we were not admitting too small children nor did we have boarding schools to receive children under ten, and why a boarding school on the Siksika reserve was closed by the Dept. & was the children & our school. The reduction was the cause of present deficit and would justify the above increase to start of Oct 1st last year. I was told for Regina who received the increase from the beginning of the quarter.\n\nThe $125.00 asked for present quarter was voted by your obedient servant J. Hugonin\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 23rd December, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application of Rev. Father Hugonnard, Principal of Qu'Appelle Industrial school for an increase of $10.00 in the per capita grant, I beg to say that this school is at present paid at the rate of $115.00 per pupil, which is a lower rate than is allowed to any of the other Industrial schools in Manitoba and the Territories, with the exception of the one at St Boniface, which receives $110.00 and is, I understand, shortly to be abandoned, partly on account of the unsufficiency of the grant.\n\nFor the reasons stated by Father Hugonnard I think he is quite justified in making this application. The school is conducted with the greatest economy and notwithstanding this, he finds himself with a deficit of over $1300.00 at the present time and he is not asking the Department to assume this liability, but to make the per capita grant sufficient to maintain the school in future. I have it on good authority that there is almost too much economy exercised at this school as regards the clothing and diet of the pupils, this having been rendered necessary by the increased cost of supplies, fuel and labor and the difficulty of recruiting pupils.\nThe school is some twenty miles distant from the nearest railway station and all supplies, including coal have to be freighted by team at a cost of from 15 to 20 cents a hundred. This is a disadvantage not felt by other schools, except Battleford, where the grant is $145.00 more than covering the difference.\n\nFather Hugonnard has been in charge of this school since its inception in 1864 and under his management it has been most successful. It is the largest school we have and has an enrollment of 230 pupils with provision for 225, which is about the average attendance.\n\nFather Hugonnard is correct in stating that the rule of the Department to pay pupils under ten years at only half the grant, has considerably reduced his income. When such rule was put in operation, he objected to its being applied to the Qu'Appelle school for the reason that there are no boarding schools, where these young children who are generally neglected or orphans, could be placed.\n\nThe Regina school received an increase in January last and $125.00 is provided in the estimates for the Qu'Appelle school, $10.00 of which is retained by the Department to pay for incidentals. This deduction is not made from Brandon or St Boniface schools, and only $5.00 is retained from the Battleford school for contingencies. I think the present vote could stand the increase asked for from the beginning of the current quarter and it would relieve him of a portion of his deficit and allow him to purchase for cash and receive the trade discount.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 2nd June, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your letter of the 11th ult., which has further reference to the granting of a gratuity or bonus for your services in connection with the Qu'Appelle Industrial school, I beg to say that the Department regrets that it cannot alter the decision already arrived at, and which was communicated to you on the 26th April last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nC. Miles, Esq.\nSouth Qu'Appelle,\nAssa.\nAs the La Ronge Industrial School has been destroyed by fire, doubtless there will be discussions as to the advisability to rebuilding it. I thought perhaps my 16 years of teaching and observation of Indians might be of some use to you in deciding what is best to rebuild or not.\n\nI will confine myself to the pupils of this Day School who have attended the different Industrial Schools. Chas Eagle went first to Red Deer Industrial School for one year, and was then transferred to Brandon as he was so far advanced in his studies as to require a separate teacher and for the same reason he was sent from the industrial schools to the Brandon public where he passed his entrance examination into high school when he was sent back to the reserve to begin life without anything. He now has a wife (one of our day school pupils) two children own between 20-40 head of cattle, about 20 horses and good implements.\n\nLucy Littlecrow attended Regina Industrial School one year came back to this reserve married a strange Indian who eloped with another young woman and Lucy is here living with her mother.\n\nBetsy Whitecap attended Regina Industrial School for one month came home sick lived for two years and died of consumption.\n\nLizzie Hawks attended Regina Industrial School for one month took sick and came home and is here living.\n\nJoseph Road attended La Ronge Industrial School two years and died thus of consumption.\n\nSam Buffalo attended Regina Industrial School returned his sick and died in a few...\nfew weeks of consumption.\n\nAggie Berth attended Brandon Industrial School five years came home sick and lived for 18 months and died of consumption.\n\nEddie Whitecap attended Red Deer Industrial School about 2 months was sent home sick lived for six months and died of consumption together with his 6 year old brother and two sisters 16 & 14 years old.\n\nI may say that we have had but one death from consumption in ten years except those who brought the disease from the Industrial Schools.\n\nThe Dr. maintains that we had no active consumption on the reserve when Eddie Whitecap came home but his sister and brother took the disease from him in fact the whole family except the father and mother are dead.\n\nI myself consider it a crime to send a pupil sick with a contagious disease from the Industrial school to a reserve and spread the disease.\n\nTo say the least it is a very effectual way of solving the Indian problem.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nSergeant\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nW.R. Tucker\nOTTAWA, 13th June, 1904:\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, stating that as a result of your observations the pupils of your school who have attended Industrial schools have, in a large percentage of cases, contracted tuberculosis from their residence in such institutions, and that this disease has been communicated by them to other Indians on the reserve with fatal results. In reply I beg to say that enquiry will be made into these statements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nMrs W.

Tucker, teacher of the Moose Woods Indian day school, in which she calls the Department's attention to the result of her observations of Indian children from her school who have attended Industrial schools, and whom she states have returned to the reserves with the seeds of consumption and spread the disease amongst the other Indians.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHon.

R. Tucker, dated the 26th ultimo, in which the Department's attention is drawn to the results of his observation of Indian children who have attended Industrial Schools. I note that the Commissioner is asked to report upon the statements contained in Mr. Tucker's communication. With a view to obtaining information for the desired report I am communicating with the Principals of the Schools referred to by Mr. Tucker in regard to the children mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Indian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFort Qu'Appelle, Assa. N.W.T.\n\n2nd January 1905.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to present for your favourable consideration some reasons that I hope will induce you to grant me some compensation for the very heavy loss I sustained in the fire that destroyed the Qu'Appelle Industrial School on the 4th December 1904;\n\nI was book-keeper at the school and had nothing to do with the children in the ordinary course of events, but as I knew the children, the building, and had some experience in fires I took charge at the time.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. J. Hugonard, was in Ottawa at the time.\n\nThe Asst. Principal, Rev. P. Geelen, had only been in the building about twenty minutes, so, though my superior officer, as he did not know the building, the children, or the whereabouts of things, every one looked to me for orders.\n\nThe Senior Boys' Teacher was at his home for lunch.\n\nThe Junior Boys' Teacher, a young Irishman who was acting two ten, did not know all the children, or the interior of the building.\n\nThe furnace man was away hand. The other male employees boarded at home and were at their noon meal, except the farm Instructor who discovered the fire.\n\nThere were over two hundred children in the building at the time; under my direction all were taken out quietly, and some sick children from the hospital carried out on stretchers.\n\nI fought the fire as long and as capably as I could. I was wet through repeatedly and had no coat, cap, or mitts.\n\nUnder my direction bedding, clothing, and stores of provisions were rescued and taken to a safe distance.\n\nStill wet, but having no change of clothing, I have arranged for sleeping accommodation for the children, the Superintendent General\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nI have read the attached letter from Mr. Graham inclosing a letter from Mr. Sworder with reference to his large personal losses when the Qu'Appelle Industrial School was burned. If the fact can be faced that a payment to Mr. Sworder would create a precedent which would likely be followed by large claims from other persons who lost at that fire, his claim may be viewed favorably and some recompense granted him; but it seems to me that until we decide to pay the personal losses of all employees at this school it would not be well to make an exception in Mr. Sworder's case. I regret to report in this direction because it was the case that Mr. Sworder acted at the time of this fire in the interest of the Department and probably to the neglect of his own personal interest, but I am compelled by a broader view of the case to take this position.\n\nAccountant.\nQu'Appelle Inspectorate,\n\nFort Qu'Appelle, 3rd January, 1905.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley,\n\nYou will remember me speaking to you about Mr. Sworder's loss by fire at the Qu'Appelle School. You told me at the time to have him furnish you with a letter giving further particulars; this I now enclose.\n\nMr. Sworder's loss was an exceptionally heavy one and I am satisfied that had he let other matters go and looked after the saving of his own property, his loss would have amounted to practically nothing. As it was, he sacrificed his own property and took charge of the whole situation with the result that there was no loss of life and a great deal of property saved. Sworder's case is an exceptional one, and I think the Department should do something to recoup him for his heavy loss.\n\nWishing you the Compliments of the season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The buildings and plant are worth about One Hundred Thousand dollars and there are about two Hundred and Fifty people sleeping in each building every night, and if a fire took place at midnight and got well under way it would be a difficult matter to save these lives.\n\nMy opinion is that the School is in splendid shape financially and should bear the expense of this man's salary, but at the same time the Department should appoint the man. One can be engaged at $40.00 per month. He should be called upon to patrol all the stations, sixteen or seventeen, with his watch clock at least once an hour. The key of the clock should be kept by the Clerk, who should examine the paper dial every morning and place a new one in for the next night.\n\nA watchman's clock, sixteen stations, can be bought for $75.00 in Winnipeg, and I would ask authority to purchase one at once.\n\nI hope the Department will insist on the employment of a watchman at once and that strict and rigid\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nrigid instructions be sent to the Principal on this important matter. There is an old man at the school nearly seventy years of age, whom Father Ugonnard will probably tell you can do the work.\n\nI do not approve of this old man being engaged for this important work; a young man is wanted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInscr. of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 6, 1906.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ult., recommending the appointment of a night watchman for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you as to the necessity for a watchman for this institution, and you are hereby authorized to secure the services of a thoroughly reliable man for this position at the salary named by you, namely, $40 per month, to be paid by the school, and you should notify the Principal of your instructions in this direction.\n\nYou may also purchase a watchman's clock, sixteen stations, the key of which should be kept by the clerk, who should examine the dial every morning and replace it by a new one for night.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have been asked by Mr Sweder late book-keeper here and now with Mr Graham Inspector, to recommend his claim for compensation for losses in the fire that destroyed this school.\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to do anything I can to assist towards that end as I consider Mr Sweder's claim for compensation for losses in that fire merits your special consideration and sympathy.\n\nAlthough I was not personally present at the fire, I have heard enough about it from all quarters to know that Mr Sweder was most energetic in fighting the flames, in assuring the safety of the children and in saving Government property and other buildings. From all accounts he could certainly have saved most, if not all, of his personal property had he not devoted his efforts to protecting and saving the property of the Government. We all recognized Mr Sweder's claim as a special one and his receiving compensation would be a just recognition of his services and would not lead to any further demands being made on the Department in consequence of losses in that fire.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nsir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nLoss by Fire on 14th Jan '04\nBy ED Sworler 301816\nat Qu'Appelle Ind.

In January 1905 Mr Inspector Graham, who from his investigation of the fire knew the facts, recommended my case to your favourable consideration. Since then I have made enquiries as to any one else making any other claim for losses at this fire in the event of my receiving compensation, but as my case is looked upon as different to, and as my losses were so much larger than any of the others, as far as I can learn no one else intends pressing their claims, and in confirmation of this I enclose a letter from Rev J. Hugonard, whose losses were also large.\n\nAt the time of the fire I was book-keeper at the School and had nothing to do with the children in the ordinary course of events, but as I knew the children, the building, and had had some experience in fires, I took charge.\n\nThe Principal, Rev J. Hugonard, was in Ottawa at the time, the Assistant Principal, Rev P. Gealen, had only been in the building about twenty minutes, so, though my superior officer, as he did not know the building, the children, or the whereabouts of things, every one looked to me for orders. The Senior Boys' teacher was at his home for lunch, the Junior Boys' teacher, a young Irishman who was acting pro tem did not know all the children or the interior of the building. The furniceman was a new hand, the other male employees boarded at home and were at their homes having their noon meal, except the Farming Instructor, who, coming from home, discovered the fire.\nThere were over two hundred children in the building at the time; under my direction all were taken out quietly and some sick children were carried out on stretchers from the hospital. I fought the fire as long and as capably as I could, I was wet through repeatedly and had no cap or mitts. Under my direction bedding, clothing and stores of provisions were rescued and taken to a distance, out of danger. Still wet but having no change of clothing I had to arrange for sleeping accommodation for the children, the distribution of the blankets, for heating and cooking facilities and dining room accommodation, the housing of the provisions saved, etc.\n\nI contracted bronchitis and got very sore eyes, and was under the Doctor's orders for some weeks, though there was too much for me to see about to remain in bed as the Doctor advised; my eyes have been permanently weakened and my heart action has not recovered and probably never will.\n\nI saved most of the business records of the school.\n\nThe wood yard with about two hundred cords of dry wood and two out buildings were on fire at different times; it was in saving one of these out buildings that I got thoroughly wet, having water thrown on me to keep my clothes from catching fire, less than ten feet separated the building destroyed from the one we saved, the glass and window frames in the latter were consumed by fire, and the roof was alight several times.\n\nWhen I realized the impossibility of saving the main buildings of the school, if there had been another person to take charge, I could have saved the business books and documents and then could have easily saved my own things except perhaps the heaviest furniture. The Office and my private room had a separate passage cut off from the main hall by a door, so these rooms remained intact and were the freest from smoke for a long time.\n\nI have lived at Qu'Appelle since 1882 and had accu-\nulated a lot of things; my loss in furniture, bedding and equipment; oil and water colour paintings; books and wearing apparel; shooting, cricket tennis, photographic and microscopic outfits; collections of foreign coins and postage stamps; minerals, Indian, natural history, and other curios; harness saddle etc., and $130.00 in cash, amounted to over $3500.00.\n\nThree thousand five hundred Dollars would not nearly replace what I lost in the fire, and money could not replace the sentimental value of many things. I had $300.00 insurance on some of my pictures and furniture and I would respectfully present my claim for Seven hundred and fifty Dollars, being less than one quarter of my losses, and which I would willingly give to be physically as fit now as I was previous to the fire.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy\nof the Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nRespected Sir,\n\nPermit my voice to echo the sentiments of all present who offer you a most hearty welcome to our dear home, which was so generously given us by the Department.\n\nWe are aware that you were instrumental in the re-building of the school, and we fail to express our gratitude for the gift was so great; however, we gladly accept of this occasion to tell you how much we appreciate your liberality, for you took pity on our children, and gave us back what the cruel fire had taken away. In return, we hope to be ever worthy of all that is being done for us.\n\nThanking you kind sir, for the honor conferred upon us today by your visit, and wishing you many years of good health to continue your work in its high position you occupy. We beg to remain, with deep gratitude,\n\nYour respectful children\n\nThe pupils of the Pi'Appilii Ind. School\nNov. 14, 1906\nOttawa, December 7th, 1906.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of copy of address of welcome presented to me by the children of the Qu'Appelle School on my recent visit there and beg of you to express to them my appreciation of this and my hope that I may at some future date have the pleasure of again visiting the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nReverend J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle School.\nOttawa, 3rd January, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th November last dealing with your claim for compensation owing to loss at the fire which destroyed the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and in reply I have to say that the matter will be given due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nE.J. Sworder, Esq.,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWe wish to bring a few facts under your notice in connection with the Quappaw Industrial School which we hope and trust will be remedied as soon as possible, and if not we shall be compelled to have it enquired into by our representative. We understand that the Govt is paying into the School each year at the rate of two thousand dollars per month in addition to other things by way of vouchers, and in addition built them a fine...\nSchool at an enormous expense we suppose and we know that this money is coming out of the pockets of the public and naturally we would like to know and have a lawful right to know that this money is spent fairly.\n\nIn the first instance and one of the greatest complaints is the principal who his staff buy a lot of goods dry-goods and so forth with the school money supposing this to be for the Indians and instead of giving and using this for the Indian children they keep almost a general store and sell and trade with the half-breeds and by doing this...\nthey are working in opposition to our store, and then we learn from authority that the profits is not going into the School funds at least the books do not show it. The question is then where is this money going. Another every year the School grows a lot of potatoes and various other kinds of vegetables and we know for a fact that the principal sells hundreds and if we say thousands of acres worth of vegetables for now a number of years past and we know that this money is not going into the School funds. The beauty of the thing is he buys a lot of potatoes each year again the same with milk and butter the same with meat at the present time for instance he kills his own\nbrief from his own ranch and charge the Govt a big price for it; then as we know and see with our own eyes every day he sells part of this meat out to other people and we are told that this money does not go into the School funds. So there must a fortune in this school for somebody, and we ask the honest question why this is not stopped. We hope and trust it will be stopped at once; if not we will see that it is stopped.

I saw in a recent Free Press that the estimates for the Indian Department had been passed and I trust my case has not escaped your favourable consideration.\n\nThe loss of all my personal property wiped away nearly all I had to show for twenty-two years pioneering in this district and after passing through the bad seasons, the lack of railway facilities, and the experimental stage it was exceedingly hard line to have to mortgage what real estate I had to equip myself again in clothing, furniture etc., and meet my obligations, and to practically make a new start; especially at a time when this Western country had just commenced to develop so rapidly.\n\nAs you know I lost my property entirely through taking charge of the saving of the Government property and I am sure you will admit that the compensation of $750.00 that I asked for is very reasonable as my losses amounted to over $3500.00, and the new outfit of clothing, bedding, travelling equipment and furniture I had to purchase when transferred from clerk at the Industrial School to Clerk to Mr Graham, of the South Saskatchewan Inspectorate would not leave much of that sum.\n\nPhysically I have never been as well since my exertions in that fire, as in some way I strained my heart, and my eyes were permanently weakened from the smoke and heat; I had my eyebrows and eye-lashes singed off.\n\nOn account of not being able to realize on last season's farm produce, as yet, through car shortage on the branch lines,\n\nF.

I have looked into this matter and find that only $800.00 of this deficit can be traced to work on the new building, part of the balance can perhaps be considered as indirectly due to the new building but still it is work that under ordinary circumstances would have been done by the staff. I stopped sending in the Pay Lists on the 16th of August, 1906 for work in connection with these buildings, but since that date there have been odd jobs such as patching, repairing, work on outbuildings and many other matters that would naturally have been carried on in any other institution of this size, and paid for out of Per Capita grant. These size have all been charged up to New Buildings but should in my opinion, be paid from the grant and this was understood by the Principal, who will, to my mind have no difficulty in settling this matter.\n\nThe other is a natural deficit which will be wiped off in due course I have no doubt.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Your obedient servant\n\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspr. of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You might refer to Inspector Graham's reports in this connection.\n\nD. S. J. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum regarding the system in vogue at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for purchases and sales and contracting, I have to say that as this School is on a per capita grant we have no definite information as to their current methods. As the School is self-supporting it is evident that the management is conducted on that basis and that so far as their purchases under contract and otherwise are concerned they are probably made economically. In the winter of 1905 I see that Inspector Graham asked us for advice on certain questions. Mr. Benson reported on his letter and referred the question to me to be considered in connection with some matters that I had then in hand. I remember the reference distinctly, but the file was evidently taken away and I have not seen it since. It was probably the Qu'Appelle Industrial School that Mr. Graham had in view when he wrote his letter.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's first question I should say that the Department should have a rule to be observed by per capita schools that they should not traffic in ordinary merchandise, but should sell only the agricultural or trade products of the school. I think it perfectly fair that they should compete with general merchants or farmers for crops raised or articles made at the school, but I think they should not be\nallowed to buy general merchandise and re-sell it at a profit thus entering into competition with local merchants along their own lines of business.\n\nIn answer to Mr. Graham's second question I should say that so long as these transactions are shown in the books and that the staff was not allowed long credits for these transactions there is no serious objection to the practice. As the Principal himself pays the staff from the per capita grant he has almost perfect control of collections.\n\nAs regards the third question, it is so open to abuse that I think the whole matter of these outside contracts should be the subject of a report by the Principal of the school, and that he should receive the permission of the Department before entering into them. He is supposed to conduct his school, so far as its educative function goes, on a certain curriculum or system. How far this system may or may not be violated by outside contracts is open to question; and a question we should have the opportunity of deciding. One can easily understand how the Principal anxious to make his school a financial success would indulge to too great an extent in this practice, and make his boys and instructors simply a means to that end. A wider mechanical experience of what these contracts lead to might be of value to the boys in certain stages of their development; but it appears to me the Department should have the full facts placed before it when these contracts are being made, and that we should be able to judge by our Inspector's reports (as the matter would then become one of general management) what the main results are and whether they are valuable or not. Inspector Graham's report in 1905 was not specially pointed at\nthe Qu'Appelle Industrial School, but it was probably intended to apply to that school. If you thought it advisable to approach the matter openly we might ask the Principal to give us a statement of these contracts in the last two years; the number of boys employed, their ages, how long they have been in the school, under what supervision they work, name of instructor, rate of wages, time employed &c. &c.\n\nAccountant.\nOttawa, October 14th, 1907.\n\nReferring to your letter to the Department dated 20th February 1905 making advice with reference to certain transactions at Industrial Schools I have to say that it is evident that the Department should have a rule to be observed by per capita schools that they should not traffic in ordinary merchandise, but should sell only the agricultural or trade products of the school; they should not be allowed to buy general merchandise and re-sell it at a profit thus entering into competition with local merchants along their own lines of business.\n\nSo long as transactions with members of the staff are shown in the books there appears to be no serious objection to the practice of members of the staff purchasing from the school; but it should be distinctly understood that the transactions are to appear on the ledgers of the school and that no long credits should be allowed.\n\nAs regards your third question, the matter is certainly a serious one and should receive the attention of the Department. Would it be possible for you to report what the outside contracts undertaken by the Qu'Appelle Industrial School have been during the past two years; how many pupils and instructors have been employed on them, and any other information which would give the Department the full facts. It is thought that these contracts should come under the survey of the Depart-\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nment in some way in order that it may be clear that the pupils and staff are not being exploited as a means of making money for the institution with detriment to its general educative value.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nWas a mission for 35 years under Father Hugonard.\n\nThe School was built in 1884 on a section of land at the foot of Lake Qu'Appelle; 50 acres in valley and 2 sections on high bluff. The bottom is good hay land, situated 6 miles distant. Desires more land as that near the School is a little light for farming.\n\nThe new building is the largest yet seen; was built by the Department, completed last year. Main building is 120 by 180; has kitchen, dining room, offices, waiting rooms and special rooms on 1st floor;(storage rooms in basement); A chapel and Sisters' room on second floor; Hospital on third floor. There is also the girls' house, 50 by 80, and the boys' house, 50 by 80,\u2014 connected with main building by a covered passage.\n\nStaff:\nPrincipal,- Rev. Fr. Hugonard.\nAsst. do.,\u2014 Fr.

Drawn from southern reserves and R.C. boarding schools. Insp. Graham states that the recruiting is not so difficult as it was formerly. There were 7 children found in bed from various causes,(1 consumptive), and 7 additional afflicted with scrofulous glands. (See my letter to Department written from School; No. 309,157 file).\n\nSchool Work:\nThe younger pupils have whole day in school, with hours from 9 to 12 and from 1.30 to 4; the older pupils have half-day system.

There are Mr. Robie fire-extinguishers and ample fire-escapes provided.\n\nThe water supply is from the lake; is pumped by a 4\u00bd H.P. gasoline engine to a 3,000 gal. capacity tank located in basement; the hard water for drinking purposes is supplied by a well.\n\nLighting is by acetylene gas.\n\n(Ventilation;) The ventilation is inadequate; it could readily be remedied by shafts from each furnace room with steam coils heating the air. Such was advised by me during construction.\n\n(RECOMMENDATIONS) There would seem to be two requirements to this fine school. The one is the lack of adequate ventilation, referred to above, and the other is that greater attention should be paid to the admission of healthy children and more immediate attention to the treatment of those children with tubercular glands. Would recommend that a Hospital Tent be supplied, (See file 309,157), and that operative cases from neighboring R.C. schools be brought here for treatment.\n\nFather Hugonard has proved his great ability as (IMPRESSIONS) an organizer, but certain old ideas with regard to tubercular cases and their treatment demand that the medical officer act promptly in this matter. While Dr. Harvey, the medical officer of this School, is young, I have instructed him in the presence of both Insp. Graham and Father Hugonard, to remove the considerable number of tubercular patients to tents and operate, and it is probable this reproach will be removed.\n\n(Note,- Regarding action re cases of tubercular cases, for treatment of which a Tent Hospital was sent in June, 1907, see file 309,157 for correspondence.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. Sworder, being compensation for loss sustained from the fire that destroyed the Qu'Appelle Industrial School on the 4th January, 1904. On the slip placed among the accounts in support of this payment, which is signed by F. H. Paget, as Acting Accountant, it is stated that provision for the same was made in the Supplementary Estimates of 1907-08 under Vote 483 for Schools. On reference to the Supplementary Estimates, I find that no mention of this item is made at all. The estimate reading simply 'To provide a further amount for schools.' As the item in question passed the House without any discussion, I do not see that it can be held that Parliament specifically authorized this payment. I am strongly of opinion that all cases of this nature should be made a special item in the estimates, instead of being included in the ordinary estimates. In the present case, as this item was not specifically sanctioned by Parliament, I have to request that you obtain an Order in Council sanctioning the payment. A statement should also be submitted by Mr. Sworder, showing how the amount claimed by him was arrived at.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st Nov. last regarding the payment of $500.00 made to Mr. E. D. Sworder as compensation for loss, etc. In reply I beg to enclose herewith list of the articles lost by Mr. Sworder, with their estimated value, and I have also to inform you that the following explanation was before Council when the item was allowed for the Estimates and before the House while in Committee of Supply:\n\nAt the time of the fire Mr. Sworder was Book-keeper of the School. Although he had no personal responsibility with reference to the management of the children, knowing that there might be great loss of life if they were not removed quietly without panic, under his personal direction all were taken out safely and even some sick children were carried from the Hospital. After performing this useful service he fought the fire, and, owing to a thorough wetting that he received, he caught cold which settled in his eyes and permanently weakened them, so he states, and that the exposure and excitement of this occasion has materially weakened the action of his heart. Owing to his interest in saving Government property and lives under the care of the officers of the School, he neglected to save his own personal effects; some of which were very valuable. Mr. Sworder puts in a statement estimating the value of these effects at $447.00. It is proposed to compensate him to some extent for this loss by the grant\n\nThe Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nof the above-mentioned sum in full so far as this Department is concerned. Mr. Swerder's claim is warmly supported by the Rev. J. Rigonard, the principal of the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant (file No. 116,575, I.B.), in reply to mine of November 21st last, regarding a payment of $500.00 made to Mr. E. D. Sworder, as compensation for loss, etc. Although an explanation of this appears to have been included in the key to the Estimates, it does not appear to me that Parliament when voting the estimate in question was aware that an item of this nature was included therein. I am of the opinion that every special item of this or of a similar nature, which is not directly concerned with the carrying out of the Indian policy of the Government, should be specifically voted by Parliament. I have, accordingly, to request that a specific vote to cover this payment be obtained from Parliament in the Supplementary Estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHonorable Sir,\n\nI beg to submit to your favorable consideration the following report of the financial situation of this institution and the insufficiency of the grant.\n\nThe Qu'Appelle school was placed by the Dept. of the capitation system in 1894 and the grant to each school was based on their respective cost. As this school was managed more economically, I have received ever since the smallest grant of all the Industrial Schools of the North West viz $120.00 per capita and only $65 for all pupils under 10 years old. Regina and Battleford receive $145 and they are by the railroad while we are 19 miles away, incurring an expenditure of over $100.00 for freight from the station. No school is farther away from a road and no school receives a smaller grant.\n\nThe Hon.\nSup. Govt of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nYour Honor is undoubtedly aware that since 1894, the cost of supplies, material and labor has increased considerably. The heating of three separate buildings and the lighting by acetylene cost more. The occupation of the land around, the scarcity of wood, the distance from coal mines are another cause of increase of expenditure although this school is managed with the same old economy.\n\nMy efforts have failed to keep the deficit from increasing and it was over $7000.00 at the end of December as per our financial statement sent in monthly.\n\nI beg to ask that the grant to the Qu'Appelle School be the same as to Regina and Battleford viz $145.00 per capita, and I hope you will consider the demand as fair and justified.\n\nI am, Your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hugoward\nPrincipal\n\nThe Sup't General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nHonorable Sir\n\nI beg to apply for the unexpended money of the Qu'Appelle School appropriation in order to help pay for the deficit. This unexpended money is the balance of the \u00a32250.00 kept yearly to pay the doctor, drugs and stationery, and also the half grown kept by all pupils below 10 years of age. This deficit amounting to over \u00a37000.00 at the end of last December was not caused by mismanagement but increased cost of supplies and labor, by items not chargeable against the grant or bought to replace what had been burnt viz:\n\n1\u00b0 Extra cost of flour \u00a350.00\n2\u00b0 150 lb. buckets, 25 quilt spills \u00a3100.00\n3\u00b0 24 band instruments \u00a3120.00\n4\u00b0 3 harmoniums and a piano \u00a3540.00\n5\u00b0 By engineer imposed by the Dept. salary \u00a3800.00\n6\u00b0 Store, kitchen utensils, Crockery etc. bought fireplace burnt article \u00a3300.00\n\nTotal \u00a33610.00\n\nThe\nSept.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe deficit was made up also by increased cost of fuel the last two years, failure of crop, chapel furniture bought to replace burned goods property, higher salaries etc.\n\nThe following expenditure was made of buildings viz:\n\n1. The painting of all out buildings to make them not too disparate with new buildings $740.00\n\n2. Extra cost of engineer's house necessitated by small por $700.00\n\n3. A stable 30 x 26 by the farm $300.00\n\n4. A coal shed at the station $250.00\n\n5. Carpenter work and material to refit windows and storm sashes, to hang storm sashes from the top to take ventilators, to sheet and cell 3 coal rooms, to make shelves, cupboards etc. $460.00\n\nTotal $2450.00\n\nThe above work was considered necessary and it was thought that a good crop would help to pay for it, while the extra cost of flour increased the deficit.\n\nThe capitalization grant was not...\nnot intended for buildings, and I hope the Dept will pay for work done on Gov't property.\n\nI may add that I never asked before the Dept to pay a deficit nor to pay travelling expenses, implements and horses as in some other schools but the insufficiency of the grant in the past, the burning of the school and the hard times have compelled me to make demands this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Huguenard\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nOttawa, 23rd February, 1908.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letters of January 31st and February 4th dealing with the financial position of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. After due consideration I desire to say that the Department would not be averse to assisting you to the extent of $3000.00 in payment of the deficit which has accrued, provided that proper vouchers can be submitted for expenditure which could properly be paid by the Department. The vouchers should be certified, after an examination of the books, by Inspector Graham.\n\nWith reference to an increase in the per capita grant from $130.00 to $145.00 per annum, I desire to say that I am not prepared to promise such at present. The whole question of the per capita grant is now under consideration and I hope to make a definite statement shortly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J. Hugonnard,\nC/o The Juniorate,\nCumberland St.,\nOttawa.\n\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge, with pleasure, your letter of the 22nd ult stating your willingness to decrease our deficit by $3000.00 when proper accounts confirmed by Mr Graham are sent in. As Mr Graham has not yet returned the accounts have not been sent and we have to pay interest on overdue bills.\n\nThe above sum will pay less than half of our deficit and I was depending on the increase of grant and with economy to pay the balance in time but the increase was not allowed and could not be promised so I had to study the situation from a business point of view and at the approach of the new fiscal year I have come to the following conclusions:\n\n1. The smallness of the grant which has made the deficit in the past will also cause a deficit in future.\n\n2. Besides specials and temporary causes of the deficit there are permanent ones viz., increase of cost of supplies, a large salary of $800.00 per year imposed by the Department, the increase in cost of labor, the increased cost of light and fuel for three separate buildings and the fact that we had to procure three car loads of coal more than was expected.\n\n3. The requisition to increase the grant to $145.00 having been already granted to two schools on railroad lines would create no new policy for the Department.\n\n4. The distance from railways costs us $5.00 per head to freight supplies specially on coal. I feel that I cannot manage the school any longer with a deficit and an insufficient grant and the refusal of any increase of grant would\nforce me to the conclusion that you do not want me to manage\nthe school any longer since I cannot manage the financial\npart without going into debt.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nsir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

It will be a much needed help towards the financing of the school.\n\nAs your letter states that the grant is $130 per head for 225 pupils, I take it to mean 225 full grants including pupils below ten years.\n\nI notice that your letter No 116575/10 of April 16th 1909 stated that the object of the half grant was to discourage the recruiting of children below 10 years but the recruiting of this school in sufficient number would become impossible if children were not taken in before 10 years of age.\n\nAt the time this regulation was made it was understood that a system of day schools and boarding schools would act as feeders to Industrial schools where the children would not need to be taken before 10 but the policy had to be abandoned.\n\nOn the Muscowpetung Agency the Department closed three day schools and two boarding schools to have the children come to the Industrial school.\n\nThe sooner Indian children come to school the less difficult it will be to teach them English and to have them forget Indian habits and to acquire civilized ways.\n\nThe half grant reduction for small pupils has been one of the factors in crippling the finances of this Institution.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa Principal\nunder 10 years\nAge Apprili\n8 Boys\n7 Girls\n15 total\n\nnone under 7\ntwo are 7\n\n$9.75\n$9.75\nMemo for Mr. C.

I do not see how further reconsideration appeal to the Department to have the rule rescinded in regard to the Industrial School.\n\nIt is the opinion here has been expressed that his per capita grant will be increased by $10 per head from the date of this letter. I fail to see that he should receive any additional benefit in regard to his pupils under 10 years of age.\n\nThe whole question is to be investigated, the case of Boarding School pupils who are only $5 per year for pupils under 7 years old, is evidently worthy of being placed on the list pending a decision thereon.\n\nS.

There was nothing in the letter above quoted to lead you to believe that the intention was to abolish the age limit for entrance. Up to the present time the Department has paid $120.00 for full grant earners; this amount will be $130.00 and the earnings of the half-grant pupils will be accordingly increased; but the restrictions as to age will still obtain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Heretofore as you are probably aware there has been no demand made upon our provincial revenues for the purpose of educating these children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHon. Frank Oliver,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, January 18th., 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th. instant addressed to the Hon. Frank Oliver, I beg to say that in future no half-breeds will be admitted to Boarding or Industrial Schools conducted by this Department for the education of Indian children. Probably there were some few half-breed children admitted in the past for whom the management of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School is not paid the usual per capita grant by this Department, but in future such children will not be allowed in residence. There is no intention, however, of dismissing the few half-breed children who are now in the schools as this action would probably cause hardship.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

The people of Lebret aided and backed by those in authority of the Industrial went out of their way to cater for picnics from Regina and Melville, and got them. They were entertained in the school grounds, had in fact the full use of them, were fed in the School itself, at whose expense, or who got the money for the meals we are not in a position to say, but what we are in a position to say is, that we do not think it is right, that Government institutions should be allowed to run counter to towns which have no government institutions. Now take for example Fort Qu'Appelle. We purchased 30 acres of land last year for a public park. This cost us $2500 for the land alone and we are spending another $1000 or $1500 fixing the grounds up this spring. Now seeing we pay taxes for the upkeep of the country we do not think it is quite the thing to see places like Lebret who do not pay a cent for their grounds, butting in and taking legitimate trade away from us. We bought those grounds for the express purpose of getting the Regina and Melville people, and we cannot stand idly aside and let the Indian Industrial School get business which by rights belongs to us. I trust you will look into this state of affairs, and put a stop to it so that we can have a fair show.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Picnics from Regina and Melville were not catered for and secured to the disadvantage of the Board of Trade of Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nThe facts are these; Deputations from Sunday Schools and other Societies came here and asked if they might be allowed to use the School grounds for their sports and, as was customary, permission was granted.\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Industrial School has always been an attraction for visitors and last year a greater number came on account of the favorable railway facilities.\n\nOwing to the scanty accommodation for the feeding of visitors, the School served a number of meals at the urgent request of those who were unable to get food otherwise.\n\nIt was explained that any meals served here was a special privilege and only because few meals could be obtained at other places that any were served at all.\n\nThe School cannot be blamed for the Regina and Melville people choosing Lebret as a picnic point. If the Board of Trade of Fort Qu'Appelle wish to come here and cater to the crowds that intend coming this summer, the school has not the slightest objection and in fact would be glad if they undertook this, but it is certain that the School cannot compel the G.T.P. Railway from advertising excursions to this point.\n\nLebret being the most picturesque spot on the Qu'Appelle\nLakes, it is quite natural that the general public would select it for a day's sport or rest as the case may be.\n\nLebret is distant some miles from Fort Qu'Appelle and it is beyond us to understand how the School can interfere with the Public Park there.\n\nIt is not our intention to serve meals this year as there is better accommodation now but far from sufficient and therefore we are urging some society to take this matter in hand.\n\nWe understand that the G.T.P. has already booked seven excursions to Lebret and we feel certain that the Department would not ask us to exclude visitors from the School, either the grounds or the buildings.\n\nWe emphatically state that we have not taken any legitimate trade from the Board of Trade of Fort Qu'Appelle nor is it our intention to do so at any future time. It would be more reasonable that objections would come from our local people and as none have been made it would seem that the School acted wisely considering circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion we would ask the Department to allow us to feed the hungry if circumstances calls for it.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nActing Principal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa - Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

My mission is in connection with the Lebre (La Cappelle) Industrial School. As you are the acting and real head of the Indian Dept., it is only proper I should come to you and I know the Minister would not do anything without consulting you. I was told you were out of town so have sent a few lines.\n\nAccording to instructions the Half-breed children on the Lists 5 La Cappelle Ind. School should have been removed at the end of June Quarter. The Principal, Mr. Auger, undertook a recruiting campaign last winter but was obliged to interrupt on account of illness and has been disabled ever since. The result is that the Admissions during the last 12 months were only 37 (Treaty Child), and about 20 Treaty children were discharged during same period (deaths, marriages, other causes).\n\nThe net result is that there are still 51 non-Treaty Children on a list of 225. In the interest of the school I feel obliged to plead the case of those...\nChildren and submit the following:\n\n1. Because of illness & Principal recruiting could not be attended to effectively.\n\n2. With the No. 8 discharges yearly it is almost too much to expect to eliminate 50 children and make up for ordinary discharges besides.\n\n3. It seems a very drastic measure to turn away children when their course of training is already begun but only half completed.\n\n4. The school cannot afford such a loss of revenue when expenditure will practically continue the same. It is well then in mind that cost of living has greatly increased during last years.\n\n5. The Half breed problem is at present under consideration by the Ind. Dept., and intimation has already been made that it was not the intention of the Dept. to apply exclusion rules to the half breed children (whatever the ultimate ruling may be).\n\nMy suggestion in regard to the problem facing us at Our Opelle School would be simply to admit those already on the list (half breeds) - there have been no new admissions in the last two years - or if there is no formal admission to allow these names remain on the list until elimination takes place by ordinary discharges.\nThis course will permit the school to go ahead and keep up its attendance although no other half-breeds should be accepted in future. In the meantime a different ruling may prevail in regard to half-breed children in their relations to the schools.\n\nI think the above remarks will appeal to you as carrying some weight. Knowing your interest in our Indian work and your familiarity with its problems I confidently trust that a solution will be found to bridge us over the present difficulty at the La Appelle Indian School.\n\nI am leaving the city today but will be back about Tuesday or latest Wednesday next week.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nChas.

I found about\u2014fifty half-breed children in this institution over and above the number shown on the last returns sent in vis. 43. I also found that the practice is followed of drawing a grant for Indians for three, six nine and in some cases for 12 months after they have left the institution, their names appearing on the return sent to you as if they had been present and receiving regular instruction. The explanation given me is that while the Indians whose names appear on the return were not in the school there were sufficient half-breed children there, over and above the 43, to make up the required number. As you are aware the school has an authorized grant for 225 pupils. I think it is a mistake allowing the Principal to admit half-breed children without even referring to the Department, even if they are not grant earners. In my opinion, every admission, whether Treaty or non-treaty should be authorized by you. It is wrong having children in school and leaving their names off the returns that are sent to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Father Hugonard further states that the retreat could be held without any interference with the routine work of the school, as accommodation could be found for the priests on the hospital flat.\n\nThis is a most unusual request and they seem to have lost sight of the fact that the school is a public institution for the education of Indian children.

Father Hugonnard. He apparently continued to work there for some considerable time but his term of employment had not expired when the plant was burned and the manufacture of felt discontinued. Mr. Bocz claimed at that time a balance of $1035.00 coming to him under his contract but apparently never was able to obtain any satisfactory settlement of the same. You will no doubt have files on record giving the particulars of the matter and we will be very glad if you will refer to these and let us know whether it is not possible to do Mr. Bocz justice even at this late date. We will be glad to hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTurnbull & McCausland,\n\nPer.\nOttawa, May 6, 1915.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo claiming on behalf of Mr. Rudolph Boez a balance of $1035.00 under an arrangement made by him with Rev. Father Hugonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, for the manufacture of felt.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not indebted to Mr. Boez, settlement having been arrived at with him through the Hon. Walter Scott, who was acting for him at that time, who wrote the Department on the 31st of December, 1901, that \"Mr. Boez consents to accept the sum of $243.00, being full settlement of his claim re. Qu'Appelle Industrial School\", a cheque for which account was sent to him on the 7th of January, 1902.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMessrs.

I may say that I agree with all Mr. Beer says. I thought we had this business stopped, but it seems to have started up again. Unless the Department is emphatic and stops this entirely there will be further complaints. As regards using these shops for teaching trades there is nothing to it.

He was six years at the Regina Industrial School, not at Lebret as my first informant stated. His education cost the Department $840.00 (Eight hundred and forty dollars). I understand when he left school he got entangled with a bad squaw from Turtle Mountain and for two years he was useless. The agent endeavoured to start him farming and gave him a yoke of steers which had to be taken from him after about a year. He now has a pair of small ponies and is doing a little farming but is more or less of a loafer. He is now married and has one child. This is all the information regarding him I can gather.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is no good ground for any complaint made against our shops. We have a carpenter who is a first class wheelwright and as there is no wheelwright in this village and none in the neighborhood five rigs were repaired for the public who asked to have the work done as a favor which work was done to the great satisfaction of those concerned, we have no regular outside trade and no outside accounts, the little that has been done was a cash deal.\n\nWe are selling some vegetables during summer and Fall to accommodate the public and some person might consider this as a complaint also.\n\nWe do not at all times have sufficient work to keep a wheelwright busy and what little was done for the public could not be done in the village so there was no competition besides this work benefits the school by enabling us to keep a good man when the work of the school is slack, who repairs our machinery and other implements which otherwise have to be taken to other villages for repair.\n\nThe complaint comes from an ex-employee who was discharged for being incompetent and who applied to the Conservative Candidate to be reinstated. It would be regretable if by such means the ex-employee could have the satisfaction of injuring the school to satisfy a personal spite.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Father Hugonard in which he states that there is no good ground for any complaint, there is no competition with any other merchants or tradesmen, and, beyond the carpenter, who is also an excellent wheelwright, repairing a few rigs, which work could not be done elsewhere, as there is no other wheelwright in the village or in the neighbourhood\u2014they have done no outside work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

In 1911 the deficit was $7000.00 and it is now $xx about $8000.00.\n\nThe fires of some time ago likely increased the deficit as the management had to replace grain, vegetables, provisions and other material destroyed.\n\nAlthough every effort has been made to increase the receipts from the farm, to keep up the number of pupils and to economize whenever possible, still the steady increase of cost of supplies and labor caused deficit to increase and to render the management impossible unless a remedy is found to relieve the situation.\n\nThe division of the new school into 3 separate buildings has made the heating and lighting more expensive. Many articles of supplies are twice as high as formerly viz; meat, flour, wages and clothing.\n\nThe present number of children is about 15 less than the authorized number which means $2000.00 less grant with very little decrease in the expenses and I fear a larger decrease in the number of pupils.\n\nThe increased cost of living has been felt in almost every branch of the Government service and has necessitated a redress in most cases.\n\nThe above considerations, the amount of our deficit and the prospect of an increased deficit has forced me to ask for better terms.\n\nIf the department would pay our present deficit an increase of grant of $15.00 per head may be sufficient to carry on the work without loss but if the Department does not pay our present deficit it would certainly require an increase of $2 $20.00 per head to enable us to reduce gradually the present deficit.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa - Ont.\nOttawa, December 14, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant making an application for an increase of grant to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will be brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General on his return to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nSir;-\n\nI beg to refer to my Letter No 8289 of Dec last re increase of grant and to state that the deficit on the 31st of December last was exactly $10,570.34 which amount was reached by the purchase of beef, flour and coal for the winter. The necessity for an increase of grant is urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa - Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. Father Hugonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, wrote on the 4th ultimo and submitted a statement which showed a deficit of about $8,000.00. The school has been going behind for a number of years and Father Hugonard claims that the present grant of $130.00 per capita is not sufficient to meet the running expenses of the school, although the strictest economy is exercised. He says that the deficit is occasioned by the increase in the cost of supplies and salaries and that the fires which have taken place there have increased it, as the management has had to replace grain, vegetables, provisions and other materials destroyed. The division of the new school into three separate buildings made the heating and lighting more expensive. Father Hugonard asks to be relieved of the deficit, which, in a letter just received dated the 12th instant, he states amounts to $10,570.34. This includes the purchase of beef, flour and coal for the winter. He claims...\nclaims that, even if this deficit were paid, it would still be necessary to have an increased grant to meet the current expenses.\n\nThe grant of $130.00 is as high as is paid to other schools of this class and we have in the past paid deficits for schools conducted by other denominations. If the cost of the Elkhorn school is considered, it would appear that $130.00 per capita is not enough to meet the current expenses of an industrial school in the west under existing prices. The missionary societies or the protestant denominations help out the cost of the management of the schools by contributions of money and clothing, while this school is only dependent on the government grant for its support.\n\nAlthough there is an existing deficit to the amount stated by Father Hugonard the school has assets in the neighbourhood of $30,000.00, as shown by the statements submitted by Mr. Inspector Graham with his report of the 12th of November, last, herewith. Mr. Inspector Graham, who made a thorough examination of the school then, reported most favourably on the conditions there and I think Father Hugonard's application is deserving of the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nFor some little time I have intended writing to you personally regarding matters at the Qu'Appelle School, but put off doing so until I received the quarterly returns for Sept. 30th, which I am sending to you with this letter. I wish to call your attention to the sad neglect of class-room training that is being shown here. Matters in this regard have been going from bad to worse and I think the time has come to make a complete change. Allowing that July was not a teaching month, there would be 42 teaching days in the quarter, but we find from the returns that nine days was the most that any boy attended the class-room and many of them were there only 2 days. In the girls Department things are almost as bad. I may say I have received many complaints from parents of late about the manner in which their children are treated. They claim they are receiving no education and that the sole aim of the Principal is to get the children to school to make them work and not to teach them. I think that if you look through the returns, not only of this quarter\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbut for previous terms, that you will agree with me\nthat they have some ground for their complaints.\n\nI have told Father Hugonnard that he is\ngetting away from the idea of the Department and\nthat our schools must not be turned into work houses.\nThe trouble is that Father Hugonnard, not being well,\nhas handed over a great deal of the work to Father\nKalmes, his assistant Principal, and as he has increased\noutside work to such an extent, the main idea and object\nof the school is being entirely neglected, in my opinion.\n\nIn order to make a complete change instructions\nwill need to be quite emphatic and I would suggest\nthat the Department insist that every child under 14\nyears of age be required to attend class-room the full\nnumber of teaching days in each quarter (unless prevented\nby sickness), and that pupils over 14 years of age, should\nbe in the class-room at least half the time.\n\nThe Indian parents, especially the educated ones,\nand those who are farming at home, claim that if their\nboys are to go to school to do nothing but work, they\ncan make better use of them at home.\n\nI should like to have a copy of any instructions\nthat are sent to Father Hugonnard in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOctober 23rd, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Graham -\n\nYour personal letter to Mr. Scott regarding the management of the Qu'Appelle School came to hand this morning. Mr. Scott is absent from the city and will not return for a few days. As it is desirable that any instructions issued should be signed by him, I shall hold his letter until his return, and I have no doubt that the action suggested will be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, November 17, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has been informed that the pupils of your school have only attended classes for nine days during the September quarter last, and this is borne out by the quarterly return.\n\nWhile the Department is aware that the summer holidays have to be taken into consideration and also that there is considerable farm work to be done, there are a number of children under fourteen years of age in the school who should be in the class-room continuously.\n\nI trust that you will see that for the balance of the year the older pupils put in the full half day time in the class-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOttawa, November 17, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo I beg to say that the Department is writing to the Rev. J. Hudson, Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, and informing him that the children under fourteen years of age in the school should be in the class-room continuously. He is being asked to see that the older pupils put in the full half day time in the class-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 116575/1 of the 17th inst re attendance of pupils at class.\n\nIt might be observed that while the boys had only 9 days of class most of the girls had 22 days attendance. The pupils do not all take their holidays at the same time, some in July, others in August so if teaching is given to only part of a class the same work must be repeated when all pupils are in attendance while the industrial teaching can be given if only a part of a class is being instructed.\n\nAs for the boys we feel that they should get more class in the Fall in accordance with the wishes of the Department and of the Indians and we are trying to do so as much as is consistent with the management of the school about the Farm, garden and keeping the grounds in order.\n\nThe main industry for boys is farming and as there is none to be done in Winter, except the care of stock, they can be taught farming only in the Summer and chiefly in the Fall.\n\nIn winter time the boys go regularly to class both A.M. and P.M. to make up for the time spent on the farm in the Fall.\n\nAs to keeping boys under 14 years continually at class it is difficult to draw a line exactly at that age as some come late to school and need more class even at 14 years.\n\nIn the summer and fall when there is light work such as weeding, thinning out of vegetables and gathering the vegetables and only boys above 14 were taken the rest would be an incomplete class and these outside\ncould not have the overseeing of the Teacher who would have\nto remain in class while if all go to the field the work is\nquickly done and the Teacher being with them will see that\nthey talk and behave properly and that every one does his\nshare and well and the overseeing of a number of boys at work\nis necessary.\n\nDuring the year the boys under 14 years lose very little\nclass and the others have almost a continual class in the\nwinter and spring.\n\nI may say that our farm being five miles away it is not\nalways easy for the boys working on it to come back for class\nin the afternoon. Our boys are well advanced in their studies\nand the work done does not prevent them, when leaving school,\nto know as much as an ordinary farmer needs to know.\n\nWe shall endeavor to carry out your instructions as\nnear as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa - Ont.\nOttawa, December 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to official letter of the 17th instant I beg to enclose herewith for your information a copy of a communication received from the Rev. Father Hugonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, in regard to the attendance of the pupils in the classroom.\n\nThe Principal has been told that it is hoped that there will be no further grounds for complaint in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nOttawa, December 6, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo in reference to the attendance of the pupils of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School in the classroom.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is hoped that in future there will not be any complaints that the pupils in your school do not receive sufficient classroom training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Hudson,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLestret, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit for your consideration a report on our financial standing and an application for an increase of grant.\n\nThis school is managed, as you know, with a grant per capita since 1894; the grant was fixed at $115.00 besides drugs, medical attendance and stationary and the grant was the smallest of all Industrial Schools in the North West; at a later date the grant was raised to $150.00.\n\nThe increase in the cost of supplies and salaries soon brought a deficit which was $3000.00 at the end of 1900. In 1911 the deficit was $7000.00 and it is now $9768.22.\n\nThe fires of some time ago likely increased the deficit as the management had to replace grain, vegetables, provisions and other material destroyed.\n\nAlthough every effort has been made to increase the receipts from the farm to keep up the number of pupils and to economize wherever possible, still the steady increase of cost of supplies and labor have the deficit to increase and to render the management impossible unless a remedy is found to relieve the situation.\n\nThe division of the new school into 3 separate buildings has made the heating and lighting more expensive. Many articles of supplies are twice as high as formerly viz; meat, flour, wages and clothing.\n\nThe present number of children is about 20 less than the authorized number which means over $2000.00 less grant with very little decrease in the expenses and I fear a larger decrease in the number of pupils.\n\nThe increased cost of living has been felt in almost every branch of the Government service and has necessitated a re-dress in most cases.\n\nThe above considerations, the amount of our deficit and the prospect of an increased deficit has forced me to ask for better times.\n\nIf the Department would pay our present deficit an increase of grant of $15.00 per head may be sufficient to carry the work without loss but if the Department does not pay our present deficit it would certainly require an increase of $20.00 per head to enable us to reduce gradually the present deficit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, in reference to an increased grant for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. While the Department appreciates the circumstances under which the school has to be conducted at the present time, it is regretted that funds are not available, either for an increase in the per capita grant or for the payment of any deficit incurred by the school. Our school appropriation has been much curtailed and it is necessary to exercise the strictest economy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Indian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn June 10th, 1915, you wrote to me regarding a complaint made by one, A. Beer, painter of Fort Qu'Appelle, in which he stated that the Qu'Appelle School was doing work for outsiders, thus competing with legitimate tradesmen who were paying taxes, rent etc.\n\nI replied to this letter on June 16th, 1915, giving my views on Father Hugonnard's report on the matter.\n\nOn June 23rd, 1915, you informed me that you had written to Father Hugonnard informing him \"that these trade-shops must not be employed in any way even to a moderate extent, for outside work.\"\n\nThese explicit instructions were apparently ignored for a year later you received a complaint from Mr. Martyn, Blacksmith of Fort Qu'Appelle, who stated that work was being done in the school shop for outsiders.\n\nI was instructed by you to investigate this complaint, which I did, and reported to you on June 3rd, 1916, after having ascertained that the complaint was well founded.\n\nI repeated to the Principal the instructions contained\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin your letter of June 23rd, 1915. After having done this I asked you to confirm my instructions, but I was never advised as to whether this was done.\n\nTo-day I learn indirectly that your explicit instructions given direct to him on June 23rd, 1915, and again repeated to him by me in June 1916, are being ignored, as work is being done in the school blacksmith shop for outsiders.\n\nNow, Mr. Scott, it seems to me that Father Hugonnard has gone about far enough in taking matters in his own hands in the face of such emphatic instructions, and unless he is prepared to carry out the orders of the Department, it is very little use for me to try to keep a check on what is going on, for as you know these are not the only instructions he has ignored. I have had continual trouble with him during the past few years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Agencies.\nJanuary 9, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 2nd instant, with reference to complaint that work is being done for the public in the blacksmith shop of the Qu'Appelle industrial school; I am taking this matter up with the Principal of the school and asking him for an immediate explanation as to why the repeated instructions of the Department in this respect have been disregarded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMr. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nJanuary 9, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIt has again been drawn to my attention that work is being done in the blacksmith shop at the Qu'Appelle industrial school for the public, if so, I would like it at once discontinued and an explanation from you by return mail as to why the repeated instructions of the Department in this respect have been disregarded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Hugonard, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of the 9th instant came yesterday. I can assure you that what was done was not considered to be against the spirit of your instructions, but somewhat against the letter of it. The same things were done in the past to help a neighbour without any complaint, but there are here two parties divided chiefly by racial lines, and that is the real cause of the complaint. A neighbour was allowed to use our appliances to shoe wild horses. It was not done in disregard and still less in defiance of your instructions. But since your order is so imperative and since we are watched so closely, I have taken your measures to refuse any service to such a neighbour, even with the thought of sending our blacksmith work away, in order to avoid anything that might give the least reason to complaint.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have requested the Deputy Superintendent General to approve of Father Lecocq's appointment. I understand that it is usual to make the appointments provisionally. I trust that Father Lecocq will be successful in his new position, which is certainly one of great importance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Rev. O. M. Mathieu,\nArchbishop of Regina,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 1st, 1917.\n\nMy dear Father Cahill,\n\nYou will have received my wire of February 28th. to the following effect:\n\n\"I will agree to Father Lecocq's appointment provisionally. Writing you.\"\n\nI think highly of Father Lecocq's business capacity, but you will perhaps allow me to say that I do not think he speaks English well enough for this special position. As you well know, the Qu'Appelle industrial school is a sort of show place, and he will have to receive a good many visitors during the summer. Father Hugonard had a most excellent manner and spoke English quite fluently. For this reason and for one or two others, which I will mention when we meet, we have thought it well to make the appointment provisional.\n\nRev. Chas. Cahill, O.M.I.,\n222 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOf course we hope that Father Lescq will be quite equal to his task, and you may be assured that I will give him every support.\n\nThe officer who will look into the school matters with the new principal is Inspector Graham, who is at present on leave. He will not be back at his Agency much before the 1st April, and the urgency of the spring work will likely delay the special action for a sufficient time to allow the principal to thoroughly familiarize himself with conditions.\n\nI think Father Lescq has good financial ability and will be able, no doubt, to place the finances of the school on a better footing. At the same time what we want to improve particularly are the conditions under which the pupils have to work. It has been constantly represented that they are simply used as so much manual power to produce revenue for the school, and this has certainly been a factor in making recruiting difficult. Mr. Graham and Father Lescq should look carefully into these conditions.

Father Francis Macdonald was the celebrant for the occasion and was assisted by Oblate Fathers who have long been identified with the school: Fathers Kim and Boyer.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 16, services were held at the Mission Church, the first mission where Father Cahill served, from 1874. Father Cahill celebrated mass on the occasion and Father Daly of the Holy Rosary, Regina, preached the funeral sermon. It was a panoramic for the saintly priest, the zealous apostle, Father Cahill, who named the church after the prince of the western apostles, the pioneer of Catholic missions in Canada, the man who had accomplished more for those who needed the most.\n\nIf today the people could behold the flowers in bloom, it was due to the good planting of the good father. He planted the seeds of faith and desire to follow in the sacred path and apostolic career, and would be pleased to see the fruits of his labors. For those left behind...\n\nArchbishop Beliveau celebrated pontifical mass at the church, Father Cahill assisting at the throne. Father Juhinville officiated as deacon, Father Brabant, and Father Daly as sub-deacon. Representing the Oblates were Father Grandin of Edmonton, and Father Frisque Magnan, formerly stationed at the school. Father Mathieu was arch-priest for the ceremony and delivered the main address.\n\nArchbishop Mathieu delivered the principal address. Among the guests were Lieutenant-Governor Lake; Hon. W. R. Moberly, minister of agriculture; and J. G. Gardiner, M.L.A., for Prince Albert, and Mr. S. H. Smith, Saskatchewan government.\n\nOther guests present were Archbishop Mathieu, of Regina; Archbishop Beliveau; Bishop Bourneau; Domine Muenter Abbey; Vicar General Ledoux, of the Edmonton archdiocese; Fathers Cahill and Grandin, the first provincial of the Oblate order in Montana province, the second provincial for the province of Alberta; Father Juhinville, of Edmonton; Father Daly, of the Holy Rosary cathedral, Regina; Father Sutin, of St. Mary's, Regina; and Father Thibault, of Edmonton.\n\nOther life-long friends of the dead priest were present.\n\nWEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY\n\nTHEODORE ROBERTS\n\nTHE RENOWNED CHARACTER ACTOR IN\n\n\"The American Consul\"\n\nSUPPORTED BY MAUDE FEALY\n\nADDED ATTRACTION: \"LONDON AT 2:30 A.M.\"\n\nComing Attractions:\n\nGLARA KIMBALL YOUNG IN \"THE PRICE SHE PAID.\"\n\nMARY PICKFORD IN \"POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL.\"\n\nPAULINE FREDERICK IN \"SAPPHO.\"\n\nCHARLIE CHAPLIN IN \"A SURGEON.\"\nFUNERAL ORATION BY ARCHBISHOP MATHIEU\n\nArchbishop Mathieu preached the funeral oration in French and English and with a voice full of emotion and the eloquence of a master he said:\n\n\"The very pages of Holy Scripture we are drawn to the love of God by the admiration of His works. All creation, God's creation, is an invitation to the tiny blade of grass in the field is called to testify to the greatness, to the power and to the goodness of God who has done all through love.\n\nBut there is no image of God in this world the grandest and most beautiful such as that which the Father gave man; man whom He has made to His image and likeness, command, after Him, all that exists.\n\nAmong men themselves there are degrees. There are souls capable of showing more particularly the degree the most rare, the resemblance with the Author of Life. They resemble Him in their noblest vices, perfections and the traits of the Perfection. They manifest the grandeur, the magnificence of Him to whom they offer their lives, to whom they have received. Their life is like a sacred offering and a lasting glory of the Most High. Of these men is he called \"mirabilis Deus in sancta sua,\" God in his holiness.\n\nIt seems to me that I can affirm without fear that the name of such a soul in him whose loss we deplore, good Father Hugonnard.\n\nHe caused him to be born in France, the country of light, to fill the privilege of giving to Jesus the blood of his children, the blood of Christ shed in infidel countries, in a unique position.\n\nHe granted him that great grace of being born in the bosom of one of those families distinguished by the fact that the father gives the example of a pure and holy life, that he is a model of fervor and her zeal, sustains and encourages the religious education.\n\nHe made him bear the Eternal Word which makes apostles. \"Come and follow me,\" He says to him, \"for I will give you a lively intellect and noble heart, unerring judgment and a firm resolve upon him; he bowed his head under the weight of a too holy glory and he trembled at the thought of the crown of priesthood which, like that of St. John the Baptist, must be washed in the blood to flow only for the glory of my Father in heaven.\"\n\nHow often the generosity of his immeasurable love, so strong that it was the superior part of his soul an inexhaustible source of joy and consolation, that pleasure of being saturated with divine things and which died away only when God Himself entered and reposes in the interior sanctum.\n\nFor over forty years, good Father Hugonnard devoted himself to mission work in our country. His whole life was all his riches. He devoted it religiously, to the service and care of the poor savages for whom civilisation with all its possibilities seemed to cast aside without shelter. He said to them as said one of those men who were sent to proclaim liberty to the world God and liberty: \"Gold and silver, all that you may need I have given you. I give you myself, all that I am, all that I have. In this mess, I offer you what saves, what makes you happy, what gives you hope and Charity.\"\n\nFrom the first day of his life in Canada he belonged to these poor savages, without any reserve. All could count on him and he knew how to console their souls.\n\nWith more than he possessed a charitable heart full of the most tender affection, most faithful love for these poor abandoned people?\n\nWho more than he had a hand for charity? Who more than he raised up, which saves; actions which multiplied themselves, steps which multiplied themselves, actions which multiplied themselves, steps which multiplied themselves? Night and day, a life spent drop by drop.\n\nFather Hugonnard knew that God loved him, that he had in his hands the salvation of souls. He devoted himself to the salvation of souls, and he found happiness in sacrifice.\n\nBut with this suffering there would be joys which would pay a hundred fold for the pains which he bore.\n\nDoubtless he would meet with crosses, but these crosses, as St. Augustine says, are only flowers in the garden, recalling those of the bird. It is true to say that sometimes it seems that it seems sometimes that they are a heavy weight that they carry rather than a weight, that they carry rather than a weight.\n\nDoubtless he would lead a life of asceticism but he would find satisfaction for Jesus, for His Beloved. And not to be satisfied, not even for a moment, by our dear deceased, one must never cease to do good, to give, to take pleasure to others; one must never cease to pray for others; one must never cease to believe in others; one must never cease to help others; one must never cease to have faith in others; one must never cease to love others; one must never cease to have confidence in others; one must never cease to have trust in others.\n\nNo one could be more tender, warmer and deeper than he was in saving them, even when it was necessary to sacrifice himself.\n\nHe who does not understand this, does not understand Jesus Christ in the Old Testament, nor Jesus Christ in the New Testament of His wondrous, His wonderful, His wondrous works. He who does not understand this, does not understand Jesus Christ in the Old Testament, nor Jesus Christ in the New Testament of His wondrous, His wonderful, His wondrous works.\n\nFor this good Father, there was nothing that was more purely concerned; they were all worthy of sacrifice. He died a martyr.

All the private possession of the great missionaries were also destroyed. Temporary accommodation was provided for the children in the shops and storage buildings and they were all kept together, not allowed to go back to the reserves.\n\nSympathy and Condolence\n\nExpressions of sympathy and condolence have come to the Archbishop of Regina, to the Bishop, to the staff of the mission schools, in behalf of Father Hugonnard, from among them is chosen one which follows:\n\nTo His Grace Archbishop Mathieu,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nMy Dear Bishop:\nMay it please your Grace to accept from me my heartfelt sympathy and condolence upon the passing away, (I do not say death) of one of our sisters, Father Hugonnard.\n\nThose of us who were privileged to know the Reverend Father for the past thirty-three years, and who have appreciated his sterling worth, and can now realize what loss not only to his own flock but to the Church at large.\n\nOur thoughts go back to the troublesome times of the 1885 rebellion, when the life and courage of the pioneer was an example and fearless attitude, he was, by the help of God, able to hold back the tide of savagery, and to direct the attention of the white settlers of the Qu'Appelle district.\n\nFather Hugonnard, Father Hugonnard was one of the pioneers of the west who made life tolerable and even comfortable for others of us. He fed the hungry, nursed the sick, cheered the dying, and performed the last rites for the dead.\n\nOld before his time through hard work and privations; yet in whose heart was always kept burning the hope of better things to come; the godly man who kept alive the consciousness of the ancient and enduring traditions of the race.\n\nWe shall see him no more for he has entered into his inheritance; and now we regard this holy life as a model to us as an example for us to emulate.\n\n\"And how he is gone, we can say, He helped the world upon its way, If he had failed in his work Mankind did have some little need of him.\"\n\nWhat greater honor could he crave?\n\nHe did his best, he played the man. His words were straight, his soul was clean. His failings not united or mean. He helped his fellowmen and tried to help them.\n\nNow he is gone we weep. Remember his life is done, And feel the loss we share, Because he is no longer there.\"\n\nAmong the great many who sent expressions of sympathy and condolence were: Archbishop A. A. Simcoe, Toronto; Bishop J. T. McNally, Calgary; Bishop J. J. Briand, Quebec; Lieutenant Governor H. S. Lake; Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa; W. J.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHIS DEATH, THE LAST GREAT ACT OF HIS LIFE\n\nAnother missionary of that rare band of pioneers of Christendom in the West, Father Joseph Hugonard, that diminutive figure which has stood out so strikingly among all that man of earnest purpose, having been called by God to open and tread the trail to the summit of the Great Divide, died at Fort Peck, Montana, yet he lives; the monument to his memory is his life and work.\n\nIn the years as we came down the trail into the deepening shadows with the failing light of day, and stood before and around us, too late for the last call of the bugle, in that late twilight of life, be ours the joy of saying: \"He died today.\"\n\nFor some months indications were not wanting that the venerable missioner was failing in health. The once robust frame was bowed under the great load of care; sickness and disease had taken their toll. Though the end was expected, his spirit was not broken, and he hoped that he might be spared.\n\nBut when the last breath left him in bed the man realized that he could not live much longer. There was still some work to do, there was one more thing to accomplish. The young Sioux brave, who wished to prove himself a true Christian man. And then occurred the crowning act of God's plan for the service of the white man, the zealous priest of the West.\n\nIn the bitter part of the month of January, the young Sioux came to the little chapel on the banks of the cleansing waters of baptism; he wished to prove himself a true Christian man to Manitou of the white man, that particular Manitou whom Father Hugonard prayed to. The old missionary priest had often called, there was work to be done, which he knew would cost at that price, he must once more show that he could give his life to the very end, must be in answer to God's call. In words, \"Pauperes Evangelizantes,\" Father Hugonard rose from his bed, said his prayers, went to the morning, preached in English and Cree, instructing the last pagan he brought to the feet of his Lord, the One Christ who died for the white and red children of the West. He visited the pere and preached in the little chapel in which he had been surrounded by the Indian children. His life was sealed in prayer, his new love and devotion were there, and the young Sioux brave praying priest shone with a new light, for he had heard the voice of the martyr, he had his reward in sacrifice, and Father Hugonard grew tired so that he could not stand. He took him the young brave and while he knelt by the side of the altar, he wished to give religious instruction for the last time, wished to bring to God, A night of rest was given to Father Hugonard, and next morning he rose to the Christian faith the last pagan he had brought to the feet of his Lord, the act of his life; he had to take to his bed, but he did not murmur. Two weeks later he returned from whence he came, Breton, Canada, where his soul belonged.\n\nBut Father Hugonard, he did not murmur, he found no fault, he knew he was going to heaven, and the transition would be easy. When he was attending him he often said, \"O, yes, I have to go, my race is run, I had just so much work to do and Jesus will not let me do any more.\"\n\nHis one great desire was to see his Archbishop, and for many a long year he had learned to love the archbishop, and the satisfaction which Archbishop Mathieu could give him was beyond his power to express. He was notified that Father Mathieu was coming to visit him, and he died. One priest had expressed a desire to see him before he died. Father Hugonard received the bread and blood of the Eucharist, and gave himself through his long years of labor, and through his deathbed agony the sacrament of Extreme Unction, thus giving his soul to God. He had ardently prayed for the consolation of the soul, the assurance to his soul that in passing from this life he had been fortified by grace.\n\nThere was a agony of about five hours, during which the little Indian children gathered around praying Death had conquered, but in death the conqueror was the victor. In peace of soul, he had gone to his Christ, even though the final day gave mute evidence of victory.\n\nThe body was prepared for the shroud, reverent lips prayed for the repose of the soul, and reverent hearts gave thanks for the occasion.\n\nA peculiar coincidence of his death had been noted by Father Hugonard. Father Hugonard ever had a special devotion to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He died on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception at Lourdes to the little peasant girl who had appeared to him and spoke to the day. At twelve o'clock high noon the bells of the mission church tolled the death knell, Father Hugonard gave his soul back to God, the final act of his life, the length of time of the chaplet, the same length of time that the little girl beheld the apparition at Lourdes.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Chauvel, one of the Industrial School teachers has opened up business in the village. Handling groceries, ice cream & refreshments.\n\nNow we find this an injustice as he is steadily employed at the school; he has also cut prices in refreshments, which is unfair, if government employees want to compete with outsiders let them come out from under the wing of a Government School and take the same stand as the outsider, they cannot pay attention to their work and be mixed up with business outside, we don't care what they do providing they don't take away part of our living. I had a talk with Rev. Father Auger about the above trouble, he thought it an injustice and was going to have the matter fixed up, he said he would not stand for any such sort of business, unfortunately he took sick and never was able to accomplish what he considered an injustice, we are only trying to protect the ice cream and refreshment business. You can see where Mr. Chauvel can have a certain amount of influence with the Indians & their children being a teacher certainly is a drawing card.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In regard to boys over fourteen, the half day system should apply to them, but only when their services are actually required. The farming operations in connection with this school should be a paying proposition and the school should pay for the necessary labour out of the profits derived from the farm.\n\n2nd - The same also applies to the stock raising carried on at the school. The Department is not in favour of more cattle being kept than are actually required for school purposes, as in the past this industry has taken up much of the pupils' time at the expense of their education.\n\nRev. E. Lecocq,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLobet, Sask.\n3rd - A return of all the live stock should be sent to the Department through the office of Mr. Inspector Graham at least once a quarter, so that it will be known what stock belongs to the Government and what to the Roman Catholic Mission which adjoins the school and whose trading operations should be kept separate and distinct from the Government stock.\n\n4th - It is the wish of the Department that the teachers employed at this school should be fully qualified to teach English, so that the pupils may have an opportunity of obtaining a thorough English education and learn to speak this language fluently.\n\n5th - As you have already been informed, the Department wishes the practice of feeding visiting Indians to cease and the Agents of the reserves from which pupils are recruited for your school have been informed that this practice is against the wish of the Department and a great drain on the resources of the school and that Indian parents cannot go to the school without a permit and that they must provide their own food and lodging during their visit, which must not last longer than one, or at most two days.\n\n6th - I beg to notify you that in future no Government property of any kind must be sold without permission from the Department, Mr. Inspector Graham.\n\n7th - The practice of allowing children to go home, except during the regular vacation, must be stopped, unless valid reasons are given which meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will see that these suggestions are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The parents complain that he abuses the children, and in face of the complaints as to the treatment our officers find it impossible to ask Indians to send their children to the institution.\n\nIn the interests of the school, therefore, I think that Father Kalmes should be removed to some other field of labour, and I would ask you to see that the necessary steps are taken to carry out this arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

It appears to me that we should expect the classrooms to be open at least two hundred teaching days in the twelve months, instead of which, we are falling far short of that number.\n\nI found the junior girls' classroom crowded, there being no less than fifty small children in a room that should not contain more than twenty-five at the most. The other two rooms were not so crowded.\n\nThe only remedy for this is to divide the children into a morning and afternoon class. Even if the classroom were large enough to accommodate fifty children, it seems to me that the class should be divided, as the children are mere infants and a full day in the classroom is too much. I would particularly recommend that you insist on this class being divided.\n\nDate of report\u2014July 10th, 1917.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR GRAHAM ON THE QU'APPELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.\n\nIn the line of sewing the girls receive good training. They are also taught cooking and housework, but I regret to inform you that they are not being taught to milk a branch of the training which is so essential for girls going back to the reserve, to be farmers' wives. You will perhaps be interested to know why this branch of the work is being neglected but to my mind there is no reason for it and I hope that the Department will insist that attention be given to this part of the girl's education. A number of years ago, I drew your attention to the fact that this work was being neglected. Instructions were received from you that it was to be taken up and a fresh start was made. However it did not last long and I hope you will make your further instructions emphatic, also have the Principal mention in his monthly reports what is being done in this direction.\n\nIn regard to the Boys Inspector Graham considers that they are not being given proper instructions in agriculture. For some time past farming has been carried out on a large scale and the boys have been worked very hard. This defect has now been remedied by employing outsiders to do the farming and neglecting any agricultural teaching for the boys almost completely.\n\nThe Inspector considers that half of the present land properly farmed by the boys under competent direction would give these boys a great deal better training for their future life.\n\nDate of Report: July 10th, 1917.\nOttawa, July 31, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. Inspector Graham, in a recent report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, states as follows,-\n\n\"I found the junior girls' classroom crowded, there being no less than fifty small children in a room that should not contain more than twenty-five at the most. The other two rooms were not so crowded.\n\n\"The only remedy for this is to divide the children into a morning and afternoon class. Even if the classroom were large enough to accommodate fifty children, it seems to me that the class should be divided, as the children are mere infants and a full day in the classroom is too much. I would particularly recommend that you insist on this class being divided.\"\n\nThe Department considers that it would be well to give Mr. Graham's suggestion to divide the class referred to a trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. LeGros, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nAs to the first complaint I must say: That the extensive farming operations carried on at this school have not entailed too much work for the pupils.\n\nLast year we had four horsemen working at our farm and sometimes not a single boy until the month of August when some of the boys helped stocking. When we used the boys at the ploughing, seeding or harrowing it was only by hires, changing them every week and only one, two or three at a time.\n\nIf the Department believes all what the Indians write, we can leave the boys remain idle. We can hire men very easily to do the work and the boys will do all the work of the old Indians.\n\nAny time I heard visitors coming to the School making the following remarks: \"What are all these big boys doing in the yard? Playing football when during the war all school children in white settlements are working, helping to put in the crop. The answer was easy to give.\n\n2. The same also applies to the stock-raising, as in the past this industry has taken up much of the pupils' time at the expense of their education. I must say this.\n\nFor the last four years never any boy of this school puts his feet in the stable during winter or summer the time they should be in the class-room.\nWe have over thirty-five horses and over one hundred head of cattle to look after. Here is how we look after the cattle: In the morning the vice-Principal himself, right after breakfast goes to the stable with about seventy boys. About twenty boys the oldest ones, feed, comb and water the horses. Two other boys milk the cows, eight others clean them and about twelve feed them. About six others feed the hogs. All this work can be done in half an hour.\n\nI have a lot of other boys for any emergency. At four o'clock we repeat the same thing after class. Where is the overwork of the boys?\n\nAll the rest of the time they are free and can play.\n\nAs for raising cattle the school has to buy every year at least thirty heads.\n\nA few years ago the School had rented from the Oblate Fathers a piece of land but it has all been for the interest of the School since not a cent was given to the Oblates.\n\n3. In the beginning, very likely Rev. Father Hugonard obliged to tend to the interests of the Mission together with those of the School necessarily was compelled to put everything in common but for many years this community of goods was put to an end. So be assured that what we are in possession of belongs to the School only, and that those who wrongfully give you false informations are positive of the contrary.\n\nTo lessen the School in the eyes of the Department outrageous lies were told.\n\nMr. Chouval left and the teacher who will replace him has a First class certificate from Nova Scotia and a Second from Regina. He is a young man, single, English speaking by the name of Mr. McLenan. I am quite aware that some will have something to criticise over but very soon I intend to write to you concerning this matter.\n\nWho has ever heard of a man that gives you a friendly advice and behind your back does his utmost to backbite you and tries to draw away the Indians from your School?\nBy this article I sincerely hope that you do not intend to tie up the land. I do not wish to sell an inch of land belonging to the School but when I shall need cattle for table-use or farm-implements I hope that I shall not be forced to go to Ottawa to obtain permission to buy them.\n\nI have nothing to say concerning the 7th article and will have it observed to the best I can, notwithstanding that no one will say to me, \"Send this gas or I'll blow you up.\" In order to be friendly...\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 6, 1917.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has again been called to the fact that none of the girls in your school are being taught to milk and, as it is necessary for them to know how to do this work when they return to the reserve and have homes of their own to look after, the Department would like you to arrange to have a certain number of the older girls given instruction in this branch. It will not be necessary for them to do all the milking.\n\nReference has also been made to the lack of proper instruction in agriculture to the boy pupils. The Department considers it essential that the older boys should be given practical lessons in agriculture under a competent instructor and that a certain portion of the land under cultivation should be set apart for this purpose. Hitherto these boys, while doing hard manual labour, have not been receiving the lessons in agriculture that would fit them to successfully farm their own land when they leave the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. E. Legoo, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted regarding my report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and observe that the different sections of the report will be carefully noted and will receive consideration. I hope that when action is taken, you will send me a copy of the instructions for my future guidance.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 8, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant stating that you hope when action is taken on your report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School that the Department will send you a copy of the instructions for your future guidance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Father Lecocq, the Principal, has been informed that the Department considers it would be well to give your suggestion to divide the junior girls' class a trial. He has been instructed to have the doctor examine the children with tubercular glands and submit a report in regard to them to the Department.\n\nThe Principal has also been informed that the Department would like him to arrange to have a certain number of the older girls given instruction in milking and that it is considered essential that the older boys should be given practical lessons in agriculture under a competent instructor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 1)\nRef. your letter No. 116575-6........of Aug. 8th, 1917\n\n503243\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted, dealing with only some of the matters referred to in my report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. I am sorry that you did not see fit to give definite instructions regarding the dividing of the over-crowded class-room of the small girls. Knowing how your instructions in almost all matters have been ignored by the authorities at the School, I asked that emphatic instructions be given on this point. I see you have seen fit to merely write\u2014\"it would be well to give my suggestion a trial.\" It remains to be seen if your request is carried out. In the meantime, I wish to repeat that it is entirely wrong to tolerate existing conditions. I can get outside medical authority to endorse all I have said on the subject and feel it is too important a matter to let pass without further comment.\n\nI have pointed out to you that Dr. Hall is not Surgeon and as a result there appears to be neglect. If you would authorize Dr. Gorrell of Regina to make a report on the pupils, you would have some information that would be of real value to the Department.\n\nWith regard to the large girls doing the milking,\n\nI regret\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI regret that your instructions were not emphatic. I fear merely saying that you would like to arrange to have a certain number of girls given instruction in this branch will not suffice. Apparently nothing was said about your previous instructions on this important point.\n\nYou are aware that instructions have recently been given to the Principal not to overwork the boys on the farm; also to give more attention to the classroom. These instructions were the outcome of complaints from the parents. I hope that the Principal will not interpret your remarks as cancelling recent instructions on the matter.\n\nI note that nothing at all has been said regarding the hiring of outside labor and the carrying on of farming operations on a large scale\u2014to the extent of renting land from outsiders. I may have been wrong in criticizing these conditions; if so, will you be good enough to advise me as it is no pleasure for me to do so.\n\nI may also add that the new Principal is very seldom at home. At present he is away and has been for three weeks and no one appears to be in authority, or to know where he is. The mail is left unopened, by his order, and generally speaking, things are going from bad to worse.\n\nI undertook to build the laundry at this School in order to save money. I have had little or no assistance from the School, except from a lay brother and I am sorry I undertook the work.\n\nThere is little use in trying to improve conditions here unless the Department follow up matters; it only makes trouble for me referring to these things and not having them acted upon. In fact I think it unwise to do so, under existing conditions.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

But I was called back to Manitoba and besides entertained hopes that that eye would continue to improve and get better & left California.

Sir,\n\nAs you have lately been appointed Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School there are certain matters to which I wish to call your attention in regard to the management of the institution:\n\n1st. The Department is of the opinion that the extensive farming operations carried on there entail too much work on the pupils, which causes dissatisfaction among the parents, who complain that the children are over-worked and their studies neglected.\n\nWhile it is admitted that there is considerable work on the farm which can and should be attended to by some of the older boys, it is not the wish of the Department that boys under fourteen years of age should be required to do farm work, as they should be in the class-room continuously during school hours. With regard to boys over fourteen, the half day system should apply to them, but only when their services are actually required. The farming operations in connection with the school should be a paying proposition and any necessary labour required should be paid for out of the profits derived from the farm.\n\n2nd. The same rule should apply to the stock raising carried on at the school.\n\nThe Department is not in favour of more cattle being kept than are absolutely required for school purposes.\n\nRev. A. J.

A return of all the live stock should be sent to the Department through the office of Mr. Commissioner Graham at least once a quarter, so that it will be known what stock belongs to the Government and what to the Roman Catholic Mission, which adjoins the school and whose trading operations should be kept separate and distinct from the Government stock.\n\n4th. The Department must insist upon the employment of teachers who are thoroughly qualified to give instruction in English, so that the pupils may have an opportunity of obtaining a thorough English education and learn to speak the language fluently.\n\n5th. A strict account should be kept in the books of all buying and selling done by the school and your accountant should keep regular office hours, so that access can be had to the books when required and information given when called for.\n\n6th. The Department would like to be furnished with a complete list of the staff, with the duties assigned to each member and the number of hours required for their performance.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that the foregoing directions are strictly carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, June 26, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter of today's date addressed to the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School calling his attention to certain matters in regard to the management of that institution.\n\nI have to request that you will see that he carries out the directions contained therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

It is impossible for me at this early date of my installation as principal to give a full and detailed report of the management but it is my intention to arrange regulations that may fully correspond with the wishes of the Department.\n\n1st. The extensive farming operations carried on for the past two years was thought to be a good scheme owing to the food conditions caused by the war and as the Department was in favor of allowing the pupils to assist at outside farming it was considered reasonable to apply this privilege at the school, hence the extensive farming. The farming operations for next season will be considerably curtailed in so far as school lands only will be cultivated.\n\nThere is much work on the farm which must be attended to and I intend to see that only the older boys will be employed by the half day system and when absolutely necessary; I am of the opinion however that some boys under 14 years could receive valuable training in lighter farming and gardening but in short periods, this would be a relaxation from continuous class work and would assist in maintaining the health of the pupils. Any boys who may work on the farm will receive practical instruction as the farmer now in charge has had years of actual training and takes an interest in imparting the necessary information for successful work.\n2nd. No more cattle than are required for school purposes will be kept. The number at the present time does not exceed 100 head and this number is not sufficient for the use of the school as it takes about 45 head per year to supply beef for the pupils, as well as a number of hogs, besides from 15 to 18 milk cows are needed for the milk supply. Each summer we are obliged to purchase a few head locally for fresh beef but in the Fall when the cold weather sets in a large number are slaughtered giving a supply of beef till the following June thus reducing the number to be cared for during winter. The cattle industry will not in any way conflict with the education of the pupils except in so far as the feeding of stock in winter time and the milking which is done alternately by the boys and girls and that outside of class hours.\n\n3rd. A return of all live stock will be sent to Mr Commissioner Graham once a quarter commencing September quarter next. We would request that a number of live stock forms be sent here so that we may be able to carry out the instructions of the Department. There is no mix-up nor confusion in live stock trading operations between the school and the Roman Catholic Mission nor can there be any as the stocks are completely separate and distinct the Mission having their own lands upon which they have raised stock for many years previous to the establishment of the school. A wrong impression may have prevailed as the School and the Mission are under the management of members of the same Religious Order but are completely independent of each other the administration being entirely different.\n\n4th. The Management clearly understands the necessity of giving a thorough instruction in the English language and at the present time we think that the teachers now employed are well qualified. When classes resume work after vacation it is my\nintention to frequently visit or inspect the class-room work and if found deficient changes will be made.\n\nThe present employees with whom the pupils come in contact can speak the English language fluently but although difficult at times to engage extra labor who are fluent we will do our utmost to secure those who come nearest the standard if it be only for a short time.\n\n5th. I understand that a custom had been in operation whereby buying and selling outside of the office had been done but remittances made direct to the principal which eventually were entered in the books. This custom I do not approve of and my orders are now that all financial transactions be put through the office direct so that there may be no chance of an oversight or error and regular office hours will be named to insure prompt entry of business transactions and for access or information which may be required.\n\n6th. Complete list of staff with assigned duties is herewith attached.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nPrincipal\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, August 8, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI am in receipt of your telegram and letter, with reference to Father Dugas' visit; he came particularly to endeavour to secure a successor to Father Kalmea; he has a promising man in view, and I trust that he will be able to secure him. He understands, of course, that Father Kalmea cannot remain at the school, and I am certain that he is personally desirous of making the change. From what he says, I gather that he wishes to co-operate with you, and there is certainly no antagonism whatever to our instructions; there are one or two points which he brought up, about which I told him that he must consult you. He is very anxious to get some exchange of land, so that the school farm can be nearer the buildings; I am aware that this was discussed in 1916, and you wrote a letter then, supporting Father Hugonard's recommendation, but, unfortunately, we had no funds at that time; I told\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nFather Dugas to converse with you on this matter.\n\nI am sending you herewith a copy of a letter which he sent in reply to our instructions of the 26th of June, which, you will remember, was written when you were here.\n\nFather Dugas says that some repairs are necessary; I asked him to make an estimate and submit it to you in the usual way.\n\nHe did not ask for any change in the instructions given him, except in one particular, that is the employment of boys under fourteen, and he had some suggestions to offer about a different system of alternating classroom work with outside work, but I told him he would have to consult you and have your support.\n\nHe assured me that all the teachers and instructors employed could speak English well, and that he would support us in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Duncan C. Scott.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Industrial School  \nAt  \nLebret - Sask.  \nAugust 16th, 1918.\n\nSir:\n\nHaving returned from my trip to Ottawa I beg to inform you that I have been successful in securing Rev Father Lalonde from the University of Ottawa to replace Rev Father Kalmes as Vice-Principal and Disciplinarian. As Father Lalonde had a few engagements to Sept 15th next I did not think it necessary to have them cancelled as Mr Commissioner Graham had told me he was willing to wait for some time yet provided I did my best to have a good vice-principal.\n\nI feel satisfied that Rev Father Lalonde will more than meet the wishes of the Department as he is a graduate of the University and had fifteen years of training as a professor and disciplinarian.\n\nHoping you will approve of my action,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa - Ont.\nAugust 20, 1918.\n\nDear Father Dugas,\n\nI received your letter of the 16th instant this morning and am pleased to know that you arrived home safely.\n\nThe appointment of Rev. Father Lalonde as your assistant at this school is approved; I have no doubt that he will successfully conduct the important work that you have allotted to him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. J. Dugas, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nAugust 20, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have today granted my approval of the appointment of Rev. Father Lalonde as Assistant Principal of the Qu'Appelle industrial school. Father Lalonde is an experienced man, and I hope he will be successful in his work at the institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, September 5, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Father Dugas, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, Lebret, Sask., regarding certain equipment which was furnished for the use of the cadet corps in the school in September, 1912.\n\nA demand has been made on the Principal for the return of the articles by Lt.-Col. E.A.G. Hosmer, O.I.C. of C.M.D. No. 12, and also by Major J. Graham, General Staff Officer, Military District No. 12.\n\nFather Dugas states that, having had possession of the articles for so many years, he feels that he should be allowed to keep them, especially the hats and belts, which are used by the boy scouts of the school. If they have to return the hats and belts it would interfere with the scout movement, which is now thoroughly established, as the school would be unable to purchase others, owing to the shortage of funds occasioned by the increased cost of maintaining the school during the war.\n\nThe Department has, therefore, to request that you will, if possible, allow the school to retain the hats and belts, as it would be a pity to interfere with the scout movement there, which has a very beneficial effect on the physique of the boys.\n\nI am enclosing you a copy of the list of the equipment which was furnished this school in 1912.\n\nSirs\u2014Gen'l. Sir E. Fiset, K.B., O.M.G., Your obedient servant,\nDeputy Minister of Militia and Defence.\nOttawa.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, informing me that you have approved of the appointment of Rev. Father Lalonde as Assistant Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and I hope with you that his work at the School will be successful.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan G.

Father Bays, in reference to the appointment of Father Leonard, as Principal at Lebret, in succession to Father Vezina and the appointment of Rev. A. Brachet as Principal at Pine Creek.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that Father Leonard is not qualified for the important position of Principal of the Lebret School, in other words is not big enough for the post. His suggested appointment was not discussed with me as usual under similar circumstances, and I am inclined to think that it was not discussed with me for fear of my objection to Father Leonard. We require a strong man at the School and I would submit that he should not even be allowed to occupy the position temporarily.\n\nIn regard to Father Brachet, I should like to have an opportunity of seeing and interviewing him before I make any suggestion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.C.

As I intimated in my letter of the 20th ultimo, I referred the matter to Commissioner Graham, who has always taken a keen and active interest in the Qu'Appelle industrial school. Mr. Graham is of opinion that Father Leonard is not qualified for this important position, and, under the circumstances, I would ask you to re-consider his appointment, and to take the first opportunity to discuss the matter with Mr. Graham.\n\nI am sure that we are both quite anxious that the school should be conducted in a successful and efficient manner, and, if it is considered that Father Leonard is not capable, I know that you will not object to making the necessary change. I shall await the result of your interview with the Commissioner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. F. B.

He has organized our Sandy Bay School, of which he was the first Principal, and he has satisfactorily conducted our Pine Creek School, for some years; this last School ranks in importance immediately after our Lebret School.\n\nHoping this will prove satisfactory to all,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\nOttawa, December 3, 1919.\n\nRev.

(RC 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 2nd, 1920.\n\nRev. and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th ultimo in which you advise the Department that the privilege of a pass on the railways has been withdrawn from you, and ask that legitimate travelling expenses incurred when recruiting Indian children, should be borne by the Department.\n\nIn reply I have to say that it is not the practice of the Department to pay travelling expenses for principals of any schools when engaged in recruiting. I presume, however, that you are aware that the Railway Act 1919, which greatly curtailed the issue of passes and in consequence of which presumably you did not receive yours, provides that those engaged in religious work as you are may be granted fares at half rates. I would, therefore, suggest that you apply to the management of the railway or railways on which you usually travel and ask that this reduction be granted to you, referring to Section 345, sub-section \"A\" of the Railway Act, 1919.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLetter No 8883.\n\nSir:\n\nAfter carefully investigating the financial condition of the Qu'Appelle School I have decided to place before you its present standing, and the immediate cause for same, and would ask that favorable consideration be given to this particular case.\n\nAs you are aware during the past few years the absolute necessaries for the maintenance of the school has advanced enormously in price and out of all proportion to the increase of grant. Although an extra grant of $10.00 for the current year was allowed, and was of great assistance, yet it was far from sufficient to meet the ever increasing cost of goods and now in the final month of the fiscal year I find our indebtedness to be approximately $1000.00.\n\nThe following articles which are the essentials for the upkeep and healthful sustenance of the pupils are excessive in price, viz; Flour, Beef, Tea, Sugar, Syrup, Clothing, Leather, Coal etc. The purchase of a car of flour and several cars of coal late last Fall is responsible, more or less, for the large deficit but these articles had to be secured. Of course no flour nor coal will be again bought for some months but the greater part of these accounts are outstanding and must be paid sooner or later.\n\nSince I took over the management of the school last Fall I have endeavoured to carry on the work with the minimum expense consistent with the progress and welfare of the pupils and to continue the work successfully, in these particularly hard times, I would respectfully ask the aid of the Department.\n\nTo have a fair start at the beginning of the coming fiscal year, I would propose that the Department might assume a portion of the present deficit by using the balance of the\nof the total grant voted (of the present year) towards the reduction of the deficit.\n\nWith a substantial decrease of the existing deficit, by the surplus of grant voted, together with the increased acreage for production which I propose to carry out this coming season will, I hope, put the school on a solid financial basis for the future so that the actual earning grant will be ample to maintain the Institution as it should be as well as relieve the anxiety of facing a permanent indebtedness.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa - Ont.\nThe Appelle Industrial School\n\n1919-1920\n\nAmt. of Grant provided by\n\nEstimates: 225 pupils @ $150 per cap. = $33,750\n\nThe following amounts have been paid:\n\n1914 June Quarter = $6875.62\n\n1914 September Quarter = $7220.87\n\n1914 December Quarter = $6413.25\n\n1920 March Quarter\n\nAdvances = $5500\n\nBal. owing on June fund = $5835.80\n\nMultia Dept. = $335\n\nTotal = $26,345.54\n\nBalance left from amount provided = $7404.46\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA Ottawa, March 16, 1920\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, draws attention to the present financial position of the school. He states that their indebtedness at the end of the present fiscal year will be approximately $10,000.00. He states that owing to the continued increase in the cost of supplies during the past few years that the per capita grant, although increased by $10.00 per capita for the current year, was not sufficient to meet the expenditure. He requests that the Department comes to his aid and that the balance of the per capita grant, being the difference in the amount earned and the amount of the grant voted, be paid him.\n\nThe per capita grant is provided for 225 pupils at $150.00 per capita and amounts to a total of $33,750.00. For the present fiscal year there has already been paid from this amount as follows:\n\n| Month | Year | Amount |\n|-------|------|--------|\n| June  | 1919 | $6,875.62 |\n| Sept. | 1919 | $7,220.87 |\n| Dec.  | 1919 | $6,413.25 |\n| March | 1920 | $5,500.00 |\n\nSupplies furnished by Militia Dept. and charged to per capita grant ... $335.80\n\n$26,345.54\n\nThe total amount of the earnings due for the current quarter can only be estimated when the quarterly returns of attendance are received and will probably be about $6,500.00. This will leave a balance of approximately $6,740.00 not earned by the school from the amount of appropriation provided.\n\nDuring\nDuring the fiscal year 1909-10 a special grant on account of the deficit was paid, being the difference between the per capita earnings and the amount voted for that year to the total of $1,578.06. Vouchers were submitted for expenditure which could properly be paid by the Department after an examination of the books by Commissioner Graham and were certified by him.\n\nNo assistance has been given in the payment of deficits to any of the residential schools since April 1912, the date on which the agreement for the maintenance and management of the schools was entered into with the various church authorities. In the case of the Industrial schools no agreements were signed, except in the case of the schools of that class in the Province of Ontario.\n\nThe present enrolment at Qu'Appelle is 201 pupils with an average attendance of 171. The enrolment, I might say, has been gradually decreased during the present fiscal year.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive your instructions as to what action is to be taken regarding the request of the principal of the Qu'Appelle School to pay the school the balance between the amount of the grant earned and the amount provided.\nOttawa, March 17, 1920\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, drawing attention to the present financial position of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School and requesting that the Department allow you the balance of the per capita grant, being the difference between the amount earned and the amount voted for the present fiscal year to help you meet your indebtedness.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is very much regretted that funds are not available for the payment of any deficits incurred by the school.\n\nIt is noted that the enrolment and average attendance has been decreasing each quarter at the Qu'Appelle school during the past year and a strong effort should be made to recruit a sufficient number of new pupils to bring the enrolment up to the number of grant earning pupils provided for.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. C. Leonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLeBret, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the returns of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for the quarter ended March 31st, 1920.\n\nI asked the Principal for explanations as to why Wm. J. Bellegerde, Justine Desnomie and Jos Kauizance were shown as in residence 91 days when none of them attended class-room at all. He replied as follows:\n\n\"Wm. Bellegerde was allowed home on your authority April 10th, 1919 and was kept a longer period than granted, he was here at intervals since then but finally kept by his father who claims he has your authority. As it seemed impossible to get this boy back and being nearly of age to be discharged, I decided to write his name off the returns this quarter.\n\nThe case of Justine Desnomie is a similar one. The parents refusing to return the girl, claiming you gave them authority to keep her at home.\"\n\nI do not think the grant should be paid in these two cases. Surely the Principal ought to know better than to take an Indian's word regarding such matters or to suppose that I would give such authority or discharge pupils without advising him. I might point out here that I am convinced he would not have experienced so much difficulty in getting pupils to return to school, if the parents had felt satisfied that their children were really receiving an education. For years the\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nparents have been complaining that there was too much work and not enough class-room education being carried on at this school. The quarterly returns have borne out this contention and I have repeatedly called the Department's attention to this fact.\n\nRegarding Joe Kiwizance the Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"Joe Kiwizance, who is from Nut Lake, was admitted to the school in his 17th year for the purpose of later being an influence towards recruiting at Nut Lake. Being a big boy and here for a short time only and did not care to mingle with the small boys in class was given outside work. Having incurred great expense to recruit this boy for such a short period and having again to pay his fare home we thought ourselves justified to claim for this quarter.\"\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, April 15, 1920\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in regard to the March quarter return of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not allowing grant for William J. Bellegarde and Justine Denomie. In view of the principal's explanations, however, grant is being allowed for Joseph Kiwizance.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nFor the past few months I have been approached by some of our employees for an increase of salary which we believe they are justified in asking for but owing to the high cost of everything which we are obliged to procure we cannot possibly give relief.\n\nUnless an increase can be given we fear we may lose the excellent service which these employees have rendered in the past and besides will interfere considerably in the management of the school.\n\nIf by some way or means an increase of $10.00 per month could be obtained for about six faithful employees, an arrangement could be made to retain these reliable men until such time as conditions become normal. The amount of increase would mean only $720.00 per year and if provided by the Department would, in our opinion, be quite a small amount but a very large amount if the school had to stand the increase owing to the large present deficit we are now struggling with.\n\nThe present salaries of the interested employees range from $40.00 to $75.00 per month, and some are married men with families, which means that their request for an increase is reasonable.\n\nCould we ask the co-operation of the Department in this matter to the extent of $60.00 per month?\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nPrincipal\n\nOttawa - Ont.\nOttawa, April 27, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, in which you request that the Department pay an amount of $60.00 per month to enable you to increase the salaries of six of the staff of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School to the extent of $10.00 per month each.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not contribute towards the payment of the salaries of the staff at any of the residential schools conducted under the auspices of the various religious denominations and it cannot make any exception in your case. No funds are appropriated for the purpose, and it will, therefore, be impossible to comply with your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Leonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a quarterly return of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for the quarter ended September 30th, 1920.\n\nThe attendance in the class-room is still far from what it should be. From the possible number of school days the girls missed 642, without any reason being inserted in the column for such remarks. The boys missed 594 days unexplained, besides a great number for which reasons are stated. The maximum number of class-room days shown on the boys' return is 40, whereas the girls' return shows 43. The boys' class-room should have been open the same number of days as the girls!\n\nThe poor attendance in the class-room has been the subject of repeated letters to the Principal of this school, and very little improvement has resulted. It would appear that something more drastic will be needed, if these Indian children are to receive an education such as we should expect them to get at an institution of this kind.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\nOctober 25th, 1920.\n\nRev. and dear Sir,\n\nThere has been considerable criticism of late years regarding the character of the class-room work conducted at the Qu'Appelle Industrial school. I have just received a report from Mr. Commissioner Graham forwarding a return of attendance for the quarter ended September 30th., which shows that during that period the girls missed 642 days and the boys 494 days, for which there was no explanation besides a great number of days for which reasons were given. This is very poor attendance in the class-room and Mr. Graham reports that although the matter has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the principal, very little improvement has resulted.\n\nI regret the necessity of having to bring this matter to your attention, but there must be a decided improvement in this feature of the work of the institution. I shall be obliged if you will at once communicate with the principal with a view to impressing upon him the importance of the matter, and avoid the necessity of more drastic action on the part of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nThe action of the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School in leaving his duties without the sanction of the Department suggests to my mind that all Principals of Industrial and Boarding Schools should be advised by circular that they must not absent themselves from their duties without the sanction of the Department, and that they should apply for such sanction in the same way as the Indian Agents have been instructed to apply. If my suggestion meets with the approval of the Department, I shall be glad to receive a copy of the circular which is sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 21st, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge your letter of the 14th instant, No.100-14, with reference to the advisability of sending a circular to all principals of Indian residential schools concerning the matter of absenting themselves from their duties without the consent of the Department.\n\nIn reply I regret to say that the Department is not prepared to meet your wishes with regard to the issuing of instructions to principals of residential schools. They are not members of the Civil Service and are really employees of the denominations. Of course we must hold them to a proper administration of the schools, and if you notice that the management is suffering on account of any prolonged absences, you should report and the matter can be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F.Mackenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M.Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOTTAWA, October 28th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been directed to draw your attention to a matter that arose out of my report for the summer months.\n\nIn the case of Sister Brabant, the teacher of the intermediate girls' class room in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, it has been decided to inform the Reverend Principal that her services are not desirable in the class room. I am convinced that this sister, who is a French half-breed, would make an excellent officer in one of the Departments, but in view of her broken English, and very faulty choice of language and pronunciation, we cannot allow her to direct the academic instruction in an Indian school.\n\nWhen I was in your office in Regina you drew the matter to my attention, and I am pleased to inform you that the Department agrees upon the necessity of securing better qualified teachers for class room instruction.\n\nWill you take whatever action you believe necessary in connection with this case in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn a letter to the Secretary dated the 14th inst., I drew attention to the action of the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School in suddenly leaving his duties there without the sanction of the Department, and suggested that all principals of Industrial and Boarding Schools should be advised that they must not absent themselves from their duties without leave from the Department, and I am in receipt of a reply from the Secretary's office stating that it is regretted no such instructions can be issued to the Principals of Residential Schools as they are not members of the Civil Service, but are Employees of the denominations. Although this is so, they are responsible to the Department for the good government of the schools of which they are in charge, and I think the Department is entitled to know when they leave the precincts of the school for any length of time. In this case the Reverend Father Leonard briefly informed me.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nme that he was proceeding to Montreal for five or six weeks; did not state who was left in charge, or give an address which would find him during his absence, and I think his action might well form the subject of a letter drawing attention to the inconvenience which the Department might experience when the Heads of Department Schools absent themselves from duty without at least giving the Department full information beforehand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nUNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA\n\nPERSONAL\n\nOttawa, October 31st, 1921.\n\nMr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPursuant to our recent conversation I am much pleased to ask officially from your Department to head the list of subscriptions for the erection of a Monument to the late Rev. Fr Hugonard O.M.I., Principal of Lebret School.\n\nRev. Fr Hugonard was personally known to you and to most of the Officials of the Indian Department with whom he has cooperated in the introduction of Education among the Indians of the Western Provinces. The Reverend Father has been a pioneer in this philanthropic work and the Indians always remembering him as their father and benefactor have decided to perpetuate his memory. They have appointed a Committee with Very Rev. Fr J.B. Beys O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Missionaries for Manitoba and Southern Saskatchewan, as Chairman.\n\nThe Monument which will cost over $3,000 will be erected in front of Lebret Industrial School, on the property of the Department. The subscriptions will be mostly made up of Indian contributions and that is one of the reasons why the Committee in charge has requested me to appeal to you for a substantial subscription in the name of the Department.\n\nKindly interest the Honorable the Minister of the Interior, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, in this matter. I leave to your judgment and generosity to suggest the amount that will fitly express the Department's appreciation of Rev. Fr Hugonard's efforts and success in Indian Education and Civilization.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-J, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHon. Sir James Lougheed -\n\nAttached is a letter from Rev. Father Guy requesting that the Department should make some contribution towards the erection of a statue to the Rev. Father Hugonard in the grounds of our Indian industrial school at Lebret.\n\nThis is a somewhat unusual request but there may be some grounds for the Government considering it favourably. Father Hugonard was a pioneer missionary and educationalist among the Indians. For many years he was principal of the industrial school. This school is visited by a great many people particularly during the summer months, and a statue of the virtual founder of the school in the grounds would add something to the interest of the institution.\n\nIf anything were to be done a special vote would have to be taken for next year's estimates, as the Department has no funds for such a purpose. I would ask for your consideration.\n\nDuncan Elliott\n\nDeputy-Superintendent General.\nNovember 16, 1921.\n\nMy dear Father Guy,\n\nI have presented to the Minister the request you made under date of October 31, that we should assist in the erection of a monument to the late Rev. Father Hugonard in the grounds of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nThe Minister has instructed me to hold the matter until the Estimates are called for. I can assure you that I will take that opportunity of bringing the matter up again.\n\nWith kind regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that I am in receipt of a communication from the Reverend Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, in which he informs me that he has endeavored to secure another Sister from the Mother Provincial, to take the place of Sister Brabant, who is not a qualified teacher. The Mother Provincial, however, advises that she will do her best to satisfy the wishes of the Department at the first opportunity.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 9th instant, with reference to a successor for Sister Brabant on the teaching staff of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. I have noted that the Mother Provincial will do her best to secure a properly qualified teacher for the Intermediate Girls' Classroom.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that the Department is grateful for this information, and trusts that this change in the personnel of the Qu'Appelle staff will be made in the near future. In the course of a few weeks, if you, or any of your officers, find that a properly qualified teacher has not been nominated, I will be pleased if you will again draw this matter to the attention of the proper Church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nReferring to Nurse Le Drew's report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, I drew the attention of the Reverend Principal to the matters requiring attention, and I have now heard from him that toothbrushes have been provided for the pupils, the ventilation of the class rooms has been attended to; more outdoor recreation has been ordered for the girls, and a few more cows purchased for the purpose of supplying a greater supply of milk to the pupils. This seems to me to be a move in the proper direction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 11, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 5th instant, referring to matters arising out of the report of Nurse LeFrew on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI am directed to reply that the Department learns, with satisfaction, that better ventilation of the classrooms has been obtained; that outdoor recreation has been ordered for the girls; that a more adequate supply of milk is being provided and that tooth brushes have been provided for the pupils.\n\nThis is the largest Indian residential school in Canada and the Department is pleased to learn that every effort is being made to keep it in a condition of the greatest possible efficiency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. A. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask. 14 Jan., 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAs far as Father Leonard is concerned, I think if you knew the gentleman you would say that he is the last man we should have in charge of the largest and most important of our schools. He is not qualified, and has not got the right ideas. I had numerous complaints from the public last year about the manner in which the outside work at the school was carried on, particularly in regard to the garden, which was a disgrace to a public institution, which is supposed to give instruction to Indians. I suppose the Reverend gentleman was annoyed because the Nurse complained about the totally inadequate supply of milk which the children depend upon. The whole the report of the Nurse was favourable to the Institution, but as 90% of the work touched upon by the Nurse occurred under the direction of the Reverend Sisters you can understand that it would be good. No matter how incompetent the Principal of the School might be, the household portion of the work would be up to date. I intend, the first opportunity I get, to discuss with the Reverend Dr. Jeyes the matter of having Father Leonard replaced by a more competent priest, as this school should not continue under the present management.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nIndian Industrial School  \nLebret - Sask  \nFeb 11th, 1922.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier:\n\nI have already received three letters from Mr Commissioner Graham re the removal of Sister Brabant as teacher and, so far, we have been unable to replace her.\n\nLately, the Grey Nuns have appointed, for the west, a new Mother Provincial who is now visiting all her houses and, while here, she promised me to do her very best to substitute though it was difficult at this time of the year to make a change in her teaching staff.\n\nAccording to your wish I have replaced Mr Menard as teacher for the boys, for another. Hoping this explanation is satisfactory,\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOTTAWA, February 17th, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 11th instant, referring to the staff of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state the Department is pleased to learn that you are making an effort to more efficiently cater to the educational needs of the children under your care.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nSir,\n\nOn the 28th of October last, you drew my attention to the case of Sister Prabant, the teacher of the intermediate girls' class room in the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, pointing out that this teacher was not competent to teach the class and asked me to take necessary action with the Principal of the School. On the 2nd of November, the day I received your letter, I took the matter up with the Principal and on the 6th of December I received a report stating that he was endeavouring to secure another Sister but was unable to procure one at that time. I reported this to the Department on December 9th. Not having heard anything from the Principal and allowing two months to lapse I again wrote to him and received his reply this morning stating that the Mother Provincial was there a few days ago and informed him that it was a difficult matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nmatter to make changes at this time of the year but that she will replace Sister Brabant at the first opportunity. It seems to me that this is treating the matter rather lightly and I would ask you for further instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 22, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer further to yours of the 11th instant, concerning the staff of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nInformation is now to hand that Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, on the 2nd of November wrote to you, concerning the necessity of naming a successor to Sister Brabant of the Intermediate Girls' Classroom. As you are aware, the above named teacher has very imperfect English at her command, and it is the Department's wish that she remain in the classroom no longer than is absolutely necessary.\n\nAs this matter was brought to your attention more than three months ago, the Department feels that you should make such presentation of the case to the Mother Provincial that no more time will elapse before a change is made, and the academic needs of the intermediate girls are properly catered to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOttawa, February 22, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 508-14 of the 14th instant, referring to the failure of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School authorities to remove Sister Brabant, the teacher of the Intermediate Girls' Classroom.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I have been in touch with all residential schools in connection with teaching methods and related subjects, and that the Department has been lately in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal, to the effect that the Mother Provincial had promised Rev. Leonard a change at the first opportunity.\n\nI agree with you that this matter has been treated rather lightly, and I enclose, for your information, copy of communication which was addressed to the Rev. Principal upon receipt of the letter which I am now answering.\n\nIn view of the fact that there has been an apparent failure to accede to the Department's wishes in this connection, I would be grateful for information from you, upon the occasion of the first visit of one of your officers to Labret. If no change has been made in the course of a few weeks, the Department will get in touch with the proper authorities and see if a successor to Sister Brabant has been appointed at the time of such visit; a report by your representative concerning the English of the new teacher would be appreciated.\n\nI expect that in the near future arrangements will have been completed with the Departments of Education for the three Prairie Provinces, in connection with an inspection of all Indian schools that are readily accessible to the public school inspectors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclos.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, No.116575-1 regarding the removal of Sister Brabant from the teaching staff of the Intermediate Girls' Classroom, U'Appelle Industrial School. I may say that I received a letter from the Mother Superior of the Sisterhood some little time ago in which she stated that she hoped to make a change in the near future probably at the end of next Month.\n\nInspector Christianson returned two days ago from making an inspection at Lebret and he is very dissatisfied with the manner in which the classroom work is being carried on in the boys' department. His opinion is that Mr. Rossington is an absolute failure, lazy and to use his own words, unfit to occupy the position that he now holds. He also informs me that this man has a very poor pronunciation, uses poor English and urges that he be removed at once. I have never had much of an opinion of Mr. Rossington myself, I know that he takes little or no interest in the boys once they leave the classroom and it seems to me that a change here would be beneficial.\n\nRussell T.

I understand that he has no certificates and the work in the boys' classroom is away behind that of the work in the girls' department. On the whole the report on the Cul Appelle School is very discouraging; we have a poor Principal, the worst we have ever had in this School.\n\nI have brought this to the attention of the Department some little time ago and was told that it would receive consideration but it seems to me that when the Inspector's report is received some definite action should be taken without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nLebret Sask.\nMarch 4th 1922\n\nW.M. Graham Esq.,\nCommissioner, Indian Affairs,\nRegina SK\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe the undersigned Citizens of Lebret, have heard with regret of the action of the Principal of the Industrial School in discharging Mr. G. J. Harrison from that Institution.\n\nWhen the report was first given out it seemed incredible as the above named gentleman is held in respect by every fair minded Citizen.\n\nIt is known that his dismissal was not in any way for non-performance of his duties but for reasons pertaining to the Parish, and as Citizens, strongly object to the Principal's action, as it is altogether out of his jurisdiction.\n\nWe feel sure that Mr. Harrison fulfilled his obligations as a trusted employee and member of the School staff with loyalty and honour during the period of years that he has been here, otherwise comments...\nwould have been heard years ago from the Department.\n\nWe do not know Mr. Warren's feelings in this matter (as he is very reticent about it) neither is he aware of the action the undersigned are taking in regards to his notice of dismissal, and feel sure that you as Commissioner, in charge of affairs, under the Indian Department, will, until such time, that good and sufficient reasons, as to why the action taken by the Principal, that would warrant his removal, that pressure be brought to instruct the Principal to recall the notice of dismissal.\n\nWe have heard in the past from the above named gentleman, that he served long enough at the School and would like to resign when he decided to sever his connection, but apparently through some unseen influence, that has been brought to bear upon others, that his dismissal would be more in order, and as stated before, not through non-compliance of his duties, but petty jealousies on part of few unsettled minds.\n\nWe ask that this petition and communication be treated Confidentially.\nMcLean, owner\nJ.J.

REGINA, SASK., 8th March 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, a report of an inspection which has just been completed by Inspector Christianson on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nYou will note that the Inspector found the class room work, so far as the girls' department was concerned, to be in excellent shape, and even comments favourably upon the girls' intermediate class, which is taught by Sister Brabant, whose removal was requested by the Department on account of her poor pronunciation of the English language. The Inspector's report on the boys' class rooms is not very encouraging, and judging from his remarks it would appear to me that the work there could not be worse. The senior class is being taught by a Mr. Rossington, who, apart from any qualifications he may have as a teacher, is not the type of man who should be employed in an Indian school. I would recommend that the Department take steps to have him removed, and that great care be taken in the selection of his successor. This unsatisfactory state of affairs in the boys' class rooms clearly indicates how important it is that our Indian schools should be visited regularly by Provincial School Inspectors, and I trust that action will be taken to have this done as soon as possible.\n\nI am glad to note that a little more attention is now being given to outdoor recreation, and that the girls are more in the open at the present time than was/\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwas the case in the past.\n\nWith reference to that portion of the Inspector's report dealing with the advanced case of tuberculosis, this case was first brought to my attention by the School's Doctor, who stated that the child was too ill to be removed, and that it was not a case for the Sanatorium. He further stated that the patient was well isolated.\n\nGenerally speaking the school buildings are in good repair, but, of course, in an Institution of this size painting and repairs are always required to be done. I presume the Department have requisitioned for a sufficient amount in the Estimates to cover these items.\n\nWith regard to fire hose, I would strongly recommend that the worn hose be replaced immediately.\n\nIn reference to the stables, the condition in which these are is undoubtedly owing to the fact that the Principal of the school is not a competent man. During the past year I have received many complaints from the public in regard to the manner in which this school is being managed, and you will recall that before Father Leonard took charge there I strongly protested against his appointment, as I felt confident that he would not make a success of the school. I also later recommended that he should be relieved of his duties, and you advised me that the matter was under consideration. The gardens at the school last year were a disgrace, and if any Indian had had his garden in the same condition I would have severely censured him. I have from time to time drawn the Principal's attention.\nattention to the unsatisfactory condition into which the Institution as a whole is drifting.\n\nWith regard to the stock, it is really hard to believe how any man could imagine that cattle could be kept in good condition by feeding them with badly rusted straw. Straw, even of the best quality, is not fit feed for stock unless it is supplemented by hay etc. I have received a report from the Provincial Veterinary Surgeon to the effect that the cattle are only half fed, and that a large percentage of the cows are tubercular. In my opinion the Department should take immediate steps to have the whole herd replaced by a good milking strain, and before the new herd is brought to the school every animal in the old one should be removed. I recall that a few years ago the cow herd at the Battleford Mental Hospital was examined, when a percentage of the animals were found to be tubercular. New cows were purchased to replace those condemned, but after a year, on another test being made, it was found that the newly purchased cows had contracted the disease from those that had not been condemned in the old herd, and had been left at the Hospital.\n\nThe stables, which are in poor condition, are not what I would call good cattle barns, and new ones will require to be built, or the existing buildings remodelled. I, however, do not think it would be advisable to have them remodelled.\n\nYou will recall that a short time ago Nurse Le Drew drew the attention of the Department to the fact\nfact that the pupils at this school were not obtaining an adequate supply of milk, notwithstanding the fact that there were 19 cows there, which only produced about 1\u00bd pails of milk per day. As soon as I heard of this I instructed the Principal to have steps taken at once to increase the milk supply, and a few days later he advised me that a few more cows had been purchased. You can, therefore, imagine my surprise when I learned from Inspector Christianson's report that the milk supply does not exceed 2\u00bd pails per day, which is not nearly sufficient for the needs of the pupils. This alone goes to show that the Principal is not sincere, and that he is not acting towards the Department in a fair manner. A man that requires to be continually under supervision, and whose word cannot be accepted should not, to say the least, hold the position Father Leonard does. Inspector Christianson in referring to him in his report states among other things \"I do not think he is big enough to handle the position he occupies at the present time.\" However, I need not dwell on these remarks as I have already given you my views in regard to him.\n\nWith regard to the four children for whom the school is not receiving a grant, orders were issued to the Principal to have these children discharged, but the Inspector still found them at the school. The Principal states in regard to the Campo children as they lived 45 miles from a railway station he did not wish to send them home during the cold weather, but that he would do so just as soon as the weather got milder. It seems to me that the Principal should have acted on the instructions of the Department without question, and I shall be glad to know what is to be done in regard to these children.\n\nWith/\nWith regard to the brass band at the school, no one regrets more than I do that this band, which for the last 25 years has been an institution at Lebret, should have gone out of existence, although I am not surprised to hear that it has done so, as the Principal, Mr. Rossington, the Teacher, and Mr. Harrison, the Bookkeeper, who was Bandmaster, and kept the band going, have had continual friction among themselves. I received a letter yesterday from the last mentioned stating that he had received notice that his services would no longer be required at the school, where he has given faithful service for over twenty years, and in this connection I have received a petition from some of the inhabitants of the Village of Lebret, in which the school is situated, requesting that an investigation be made in regard to Mr. Harrison's dismissal. I am forwarding this petition to you as I think the Department should take some action with reference to the matter.\n\nThe report as a whole is not a very bright one, but I would particularly draw your attention to the fact that the work that comes within the jurisdiction of the Sisters has all been well done. All branches of the boys' department, however, are a failure, and the training the boys are at present receiving in the outside work instead of being of benefit to them in the future will have the opposite effect. I trust the Department will take steps without delay to have this very disconcerting state of affairs remedied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nIndustrial School,\nLafret March 2nd, 1922\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nOn the last instant I received notice from the Principal that my services were not required after April 1st so I would ask that at the end of March you would have the books inspected so that I may have a clean sheet and avoid any insinuation which might be made after I quit, although I must say that I notice the Principal thanked me most generously for my work. The trouble seems to be about Mr. Rossington and the band at the time of inspection, however, this does not matter. After my long years of service I feel my request should be granted and would like to be assured that my work will be inspected before passing it on to another.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Geo.J. Harrison.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 8th, 1922\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI am just in receipt of a letter copy of which I am enclosing herewith from Mr. Harrison the clerk at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. You will notice that Mr. Harrison has received notice from the Principal that his services are not required after the 1st of April. The matter of the Band which he speaks of, Mr. Christianson informs me that the Band used to be conducted by Mr. Harrison but was turned over to Mr. Rossington last fall and he allowed the Band to drop and while the Inspector was there he made enquiries in this connection and found that this was what had happened which matter was brought to the attention of the Principal. I think myself that this is only an excuse on the part of Father Leonard to get rid of Mr. Harrison. Inspector Christianson's report on the school is going forward today with my comments on this institution.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nRussell T.

(Report on No. 6.)\n\nSister Brabant, Teacher of the Intermediate Girls' Classroom, has very poor English.\n\nMr. Hosington, Teacher of the Boys' Senior Classroom, appears to be lazy and devoid of interest in his work. The Brass Band and Boy Scout organizations, which have been lately under his wing, have ceased to exist. The Inspector and Commissioner Graham both recommend the early dismissal of this man.\n\nThe fire hose in (a) the basement, (b) the boys' play room, (c) the McRobbie chemical apparatus needs to be replaced immediately. (The 4 chemical engines each need a 50 ft. length of rubber hose 1\" inside.)\n\nCertain odd repairs are needed in different parts of the building. The Inspector's report mentions no specific needs.\n\nMr. Christianson states \"that the condition of the stable is the worst feature at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School\". The barns themselves are in a bad state of repair - the manure has been piled up behind the buildings - cows have been found to be tubercular - the milk supply is entirely inadequate. The cattle have been poorly fed. The Inspector's opinion is that the Principal has not kept his hand on matters outside the main building. The important outdoor work has no redeeming feature and the boys grow up with an improper understanding of the farming and the care of stock. It is suggested that the cows be disposed of gradually and the money spent in the purchase of good milch cows.\n\nThe Inspector and Mr. Commissioner Graham both report that everything inside the school and for which the Sisters are responsible was in first class shape; on the other hand, everything for which the Principal is responsible appeared to be neglected. The Principal also lacks dignity and is too familiar with his staff, with the result that they take his orders lightly.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 18, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 502-14 of the 28th ultimo, referring to Mr. Rossington, Senior Boys' Teacher of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. I have noted that he appears to be devoid of interest in his work and that the \"Brass Band\" and \"Boy Scout\" organizations, which have lately been under his care, have ceased to exist. It is understood that the Rev. Principal is aware of this man's lack of real usefulness.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I am directing a communication to the Rev. Father Leonard, explaining the advisability of appointing a strong successor to Mr. Rossington, as soon as arrangements can be made.\n\nIt is noted that the Mother Superior of the Order of Sisters at Qu'Appelle hopes to remove Sister Brabant from the Intermediate Girls' Classroom at the end of this month.\n\nYour communication of the 8th instant, referring to the dismissal of the bookkeeper, Mr. Harrison, is to hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, March 20, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to a matter arising out of the report of Mr. Inspector Christiansen on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. I have learned, with some regret, that Mr. Rossington, Teacher of the Senior Boys' Classroom, appears to have lost his interest in the work among the boys at Lebret.\n\nThe Inspector who has visited the Industrial School in the past, for the purpose of an official inspection, is of the opinion that the senior boys have made absolutely no progress of late. Further, it appears that the band and boy scout activities, which were notable features at Lebret heretofore, are no longer active organizations. When the Department learned that Mr. Rossington had the control of these activities, we felt certain that his services were becoming unsatisfactory.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Deputy Superintendent General that such organizations outside of the classroom as a cadet corps, brass band, boy scout and girl guide movements are of real value in preparing the youth of the Indian race for citizenship. I believe it is not too late to reorganize and put these activities again in a flourishing condition.\n\nConcerning Mr. Rossington, if you agree with the Department that his services have become unsatisfactory, any action that you take towards securing an efficient successor will be approved and appreciated by this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nLes R\u00e9v\u00e9rends P\u00e8res Oblats\n\nSaskatoon, March 18th, 1922\n\nTo Mr. Duncan Scott\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you permit me to draw your attention to certain misleading statements against the Principal of the Liberty Industrial School. I have just been made aware that a group of citizens of the town have lodged a complaint with Mr. W. Graham, the Indian Commissioner, with a view to cast a slur upon him.\n\nIn point of fact their only end in view is 1) to harm the good reputation of the school before the Department and 2) to put the Rev. Father in the wrong. And the worst of it is, at least as far as I can see that these gentlemen are carrying their underhand scheme in a spirit of revenge.\n\nAllow me here, dear sir, to explain my statement: Having been the Vice-Principal of this school for the two past years, and being an eye witness to all that happened there, I am in a position...\nLes R\u00e9v\u00e9rends P\u00e8res Oblats\n\nLebret, Sask.\n\nTo state that the sole reason for the above petition against Fr. Leonard originated about a year ago, at the time he refused to lend the School Hall for the Parish's \"card parties and concerts\", on the grounds that such \"parties\" were creating a great disturbance in the School, contrary to order and discipline, besides adding a little extra expense.\n\nThis action, of course, displeased the aforesaid petitioners, who, ever since were bound to find fault with the management of the School. Slander is their stronger argument. \"Down with Fr. Leonard\" their motto.\n\nFor instance, they accuse him of keeping a poker den, which statement is absolutely false. All his staff can swear to that. They accuse him moreover, of being authoritative in the extreme. As Principal, he has full control and full responsibility over all the departments of the School, and it is only just and proper that he should manage and oversee every one of them. In former times, every employee was his own boss in his respective department, if I may so speak, and as a consequence, many misdeeds were recorded. Mr. W. Graham himself complained that there were too many bosses at the School, and strongly requested Fr. Leonard to take matters in hands and supervise every department, which he did with energy and for the good of the School. Why then blame him for it?\n\nI wish the Department would conduct a fair investigation in this respect.\nLes R\u00e9v\u00e9rends P\u00e8res Oblats\n\n...and it shall soon be convinced that the Rev. Father never exceeded his authority. All his employees, to one exception are ready to stand by my statement if they only have a chance to get a hearing.\n\nThe above petitioners desire him lastly of keeping certain employees idle; the others are unfit for the work confided to them. This statement is in my judgment, the zenith of falsehood. A close investigation would prove the contrary, and I myself, for one witness, can swear that never before was the work done in a more effective way, and by men better qualified for it, and this in every department.\n\nNow I beg to inform you, that the staff of the School, to one exception, I mean Mr. G. Harrison, the sponsor of the petition, is well satisfied with the Principal. They all work hand in hand together, and they trust in the able management of their leader.\n\nAllow me to state further, that the Indians are also gratified with the management of the School. Never before has the list of enrolment attained such proportion, I mean a full house.\n\nBesides, the heavy debt weighing upon the School has been greatly reduced since the past two years. In a word while everything goes so smooth and nicely, why should any one butt in to throw stones?\n\nDear Sir, in concluding, I beg you to bear in mind that the petitioners are for the most part all strangers in the School's affairs. They have signed the petition on hearsay, and Mr. W. Graham himself, if he was just...\nLes R\u00e9v\u00e9rends P\u00e8res Oblats\n\nLebret, Sask.\n\nupright would make an investigation before taking such slanderous petition against Rev. F. Leonard. I trust that the Department will give the Rev. Father a fair dealing and before passing any judgment, will conduct a thorough investigation. For the love of truth and justice, I wish you do it now and quick.\n\nPardon me, Dear Sir, this long letter, which I have written in a spirit of frankness and honesty. You are the god of the place in the Indian Department. I know that you will give it a fair appreciation, and do justice to a little missionary of the Indians.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nLeo C.

M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn view of recent developments, I believe it advisable to review the facts concerning the Principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. Rev. G. Leonard, O.M.I., was temporarily appointed in October 1919. Mr. Commissioner Graham did not approve of this appointment until after Father Boys, Provincial of the Order, interviewed him in Regina. On December 3rd of the same year the Department approved of Father Leonard's appointment.\n\nDuring the past two years there have been complaints concerning Father Leonard's administration, none of which, however, were serious enough to warrant the Department's drastic action. I believe that I would find shortcomings and complaints regarding management in connection with many other institutions if I examined other files. However, I am reviewing the facts in connection with Father Leonard, with a view to having on file the history of any mismanagement that has been charged against him.\n\n1. In the Quarterly Returns for March, 1920, there were included the names of two pupils that were not in attendance. This was done, evidently, for the purpose of drawing grant.\n\n2. In October et ff., there were repeated letters directed to Father Leonard from the Commissioner's office, concerning the poor attendance in his classroom, and the Department wrote to Father Boys in an effort to secure an improvement at Qu'Appelle in this regard.\n\n3. In October, 1921, Father Leonard incurred the displeasure of Mr. Commissioner Graham, by informing Regina that he was leaving for Montreal immediately. (The reason given was the illness of his sister). Mr. Graham suggested that principals receive the permission of the Department, before absenting themselves from their duties.\n\n4. On November 4, 1921, at the request of the Department, Mr. Graham instructed Father Leonard to secure a properly qualified teacher in the Intermediate Girls' Classroom. Several letters were written from Regina and Ottawa in this connection, and it was not until the 8th of March 1922, that a successor was appointed.\n\n5. In December 1921 Mr. Graham ordered Father Leonard to arrange for a more adequate supply of milk, following the Nurse's report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. At the time of Inspector Christianson's visit, about the first instant, there was but 2\u00bd pails per day supplied.\n6. Mr. Christianson's report reveals the fact that the Principal has allowed Mr. Rossington, Teacher of the Boys' Senior Classroom, to lose interest in his work and in boys' activities generally; the brass band and boy scout organizations have ceased to exist.\n\n7. The condition in and around the barn, as found by the Inspector, indicates lack of attention on the part of the Principal to matters outside of the main building. Manure has been piled up around the barn and cattle have been poorly fed. Both Rossington, Christianson, and Commissioner Graham report that, although everything inside the school and for which the Sisters are responsible, is in first class shape; yet, on the other hand, the boys' side and outside work have been neglected. It is charged that the Principal lacks dignity and is too familiar with his staff, with the result that they take his orders lightly.\n\n8. Father Leonard has incurred the Commissioner's displeasure in connection with the assigning of tubercular children to a sanitarium. It appears that the Principal refused to carry out Dr. Hall's wishes when the Medical Officer was acting under instructions from Mr. Commissioner Graham. Dr. Hall reports that Father Leonard stated children with tuberculosis would be better off at school than in the sanitarium.\n\n9. Mr. Graham reports that last year the garden at Qu'Appelle, which is supposed to be an example to the Indians and also to the contiguous farmers, was one of the worst kept gardens he ever saw and was a disgrace to the institution.\n\n10. Lately there has been friction between the Principal and the Bookkeeper, Mr. Harrison. Mr. Harrison has been discharged, and a petition was signed by some of the inhabitants of the village of Lebret, requesting that an investigation be made in regard to Mr. Harrison's dismissal. In this connection the Department is in receipt of a petition from a Priest of the Oblate order at Lebret, asking for an investigation of the slanderous charges made against the Principal and forwarded to Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nFrom another source, the Department is in receipt of Father Leonard's defence. The Rev. Principal is of the opinion that Mr. Graham is dissatisfied with his management and is doing everything in his power to secure his removal. Father Leonard goes into his defence rather fully and asks for an impartial investigation before he is condemned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Featherston\nRegina, Sask.,\n4th April, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Harrison until lately employed as accountant at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, Lebret requested that someone should be sent to take over the books from him, and therefore, asked Mr. R. H. Taylor to perform this duty. As no one had been selected to replace him, the Principal and Mr. Harrison jointly signed the books after inspection.\n\nMr. Taylor took a trial balance, statement of accounts outstanding, a financial statement, and Bank adjustment, and I enclose copies of these documents.\n\nIn his forwarding letter Mr. Taylor advises that the Principal is negotiating with a Mr. McLennan to take up the work of Accountant, and that this gentleman will probably call at this office in connection with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Father Guy, on behalf of the Oblate Order, officially requested the Department of Indian Affairs to head the list of subscriptions for the erection of a monument to Rev. Father Hugonard, C.M.I., late principal of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAt the request of the Lieutenant Governor I attended a meeting at his office yesterday for the purpose of arranging a programme for His Excellency, the Governor General, who is to visit this City and district on the 24, 25, and 26 of this month. It was decided to visit the Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial School on the 26th and there meet some of the leading Indians as well as visit the Institution and it was decided also to have luncheon at that point. It will be necessary, therefore, to have an appropriation for the purpose and I would ask that I be granted authority to spend $75.00 on the actual luncheon as well as authority to purchase what is necessary in the way of glasses and cutlery. As a matter of fact I think that an Institution of this kind should have complete equipment to meet such occasions.\n\nI am leaving for the West tomorrow and will be away two (2) weeks but if the authority is received in the meantime my secretary will look after the purchases and the requirements. I am also having a certain amount of painting done on the verandah and in the room in which the luncheon will be served. I therefore request authority to incur the above expenditures.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nUniversity of Ottawa,\n\nOttawa, Canada. June 16th\n\nMr Duncan G. Scott,\nDep.

Fr Hugonard O.M.I.\n\nThe General Committee (superseding the preparatory one) is being presently organized and it will be an extreme pleasure for me to announce the efforts you have made to secure this grant together with the success that crowned them as evidenced in the liberal gift of the Department. I understand that you will be appointed on the Honorary Committee and you will be notified in due course.\n\nIn the name of the Rev. Fr Beys O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Fathers for Manitoba and Southern Saskatchewan, in the name of all the Oblate Missionaries and the Indians under their spiritual care, I wish to officially offer heartfelt sentiments of gratitude for this new and substantial proof of your appreciation for the work done in favor of Indian Education by the devoted and ever lamented Father Hugonard.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJoseph Guy\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to say that the visit of His Excellency, the Governor General of Canada, to the Qu'Appelle School on the 26th, was in every way a success, and I have today received a letter from His Excellency, congratulating the Department on the work being done at this Institution.\n\nI visited the school on Thursday, June 22nd and closed the boys' class-room. I had about seventy-five boys working; white washing the fences surrounding the Institution and painting the iron fences around the front of the school. I also had the garden trimmed up and the grounds weeded, so that the place presented a favourable appearance.\n\nThe children, both boys and girls, were neatly dressed. The girls in a dark blue uniform with red facings, and the boys all in navy blue Norfolk suits. In addition there were two troopers of Indian Boy Scouts to receive him at the gate. The File Halle Band was in front of the Institution and played the National Anthem as he approached the School.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nHis Excellency was accompanied on his visit to the school, by His Honour, The Lieutenant Governor, the Premier of the Province and two members of his cabinet, the Mayor of the City of Regina, and various other representatives of public bodies.\n\nI felt sure you would be anxious to know how things went and I am taking this opportunity of letting you know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. GRAHAM,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOTTAWA, July 8th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, reporting on the visit of His Excellency, the Governor General of Canada, to the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the visit of His Excellency passed off successfully, and that everything was in readiness at the school when he arrived, and the pupils presented a favourable appearance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am receiving complaints from quite a few Indians about the training their children are getting at the Qu'Appelle School.\n\nThey complain that their children cannot speak English when they leave school, as well as those who do not go to school. They also complain that a great deal of the children's time is taken up with farm work and that they get very little class-room work.\n\nI would be glad to know if the Department are insisting upon qualified teachers being appointed to this Institution. I would also ask if the last appointment of teacher for the boys' room at the Qu'Appelle school was made with the approval of the Department and what qualifications the new teacher has.\n\nIt is the practice of the Department to notify me when teachers are appointed at the various schools but in this case I do not think I have been advised. I would be glad to know what the man's name is and what qualifications he has so that I will be able to answer the Indian intelligently when they make these complaints.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Commissioner\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esquire\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs - Ottawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 29, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 502-14 B of the 19th instant, informing the Department that complaints have been received by you from some Indians, concerning the training offered to the pupils of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. I have noted the remarks of these complaining parents, and I am of the opinion that you have been long enough in Indian work to intelligently attach proper importance to the complaints of parents who have children in residential schools. Occasionally such remarks are well founded, but generally they may be classed as the querulous result of some fancied and temporary personal grievance.\n\nIn reply to the second part of your communication, I wish to state that it is the practice of this Department to notify you concerning changes in teachers at day schools only. The personnel of the staff at a residential school is more or less a domestic arrangement and this Department holds the principal responsible. We expect the church representatives to appoint teachers who will do successful work, not only in classrooms, but in the other departments of educational work. It is only at the time of the annual report that we are offered the names and qualifications.\n\nIf, however, public school or department inspectors find in residential schools teachers who are poorly qualified, then we exercise our prerogative of supervision and we demand a properly qualified successor.\n\nI think you are quite justified in telling any complaining Indians that the Department is taking adequate steps to secure good instruction. When inspectors or any of our officials offer criticisms, departmental action is then timely.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, SASK.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK.\n\n5th October 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have your No. 116575-1 of the 29th ultimo, replying to mine of the 19th ultimo, respecting complaints received by me concerning the training offered to the pupils of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nThe first paragraph of your letter would suggest that I had drawn attention to a matter which is considered by the Department as unimportant and trivial, but the nature of the complaints were such that I consider I should have been remiss had I not taken cognizance of them. I did not deal more fully with these in my letter, as, when you were recently in the West, I had talked with you over the conditions existing at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. My letter to you of March 8th last, enclosing a report by Inspector Christianson on that school, has also apparently been overlooked by you. Inspector Christianson dealt fully with the conditions existing there, especially regarding the training of the boys, and the negligence of the Principal in the matter of supervision and control. In the first paragraph of my letter I drew attention to the conditions existing in the boys' class rooms, and referred to one teacher in particular whose services have since been dispensed with.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI also drew attention to the disgraceful state of the stables, and the consequent lack of care that the stock were receiving, and concluded by commenting that as a whole Inspector Christierson's report was \"not a bright one\"; that all branches in the boys' Department were failures, and expressed the hope that the Department would take steps to have this state of affairs remedied. My letter was acknowledged on March 18th., and I was advised that a memorandum was being prepared for you in connection with the action it was believed necessary to take, since when I have received no further intimation of what it was proposed should be done.\n\nThe attitude of the Department is disappointing, and I might well hesitate in future to call attention to matters which need remedying. I was indeed adopting a policy which the Department itself follows, for I have frequently received requests from Ottawa to investigate into Indians' complaints of various natures. Those which I received and drew attention to were not merely local, but came Agencies to me from the Fisher River and Portage-la-Prairie/ also, and it is significant that many of them are from ex-pupils of the school, who have raised the criticism that their children are not receiving the attention and education that they themselves received. Twenty five years ago Indian parents were indifferent to the teaching and upbringing of their children, but graduates today readily note/\nnote defects in school training which they discover in the conduct of their children at home.\n\nAfter my conversation with you in regard to the Qu'Appelle School, and the information I gave you of the work I myself had to do to properly prepare the place and the pupils for the reception of His Excellency the Governor-General, I thought you would have taken a more serious view of the complaints relating to its management, of which I had been able to form a personal opinion, and which had come directly under my personal observation.\n\nI have not singled out the Qu'Appelle Industrial School for special criticism, nor do I desire to be involved in a controversy with the Church, which, I am sure, is as ready as any other denomination to acquiesce in the Department's demand for better administration. In my letter of the 19th ultimo, I enquired if the last appointee as boys' teacher has the desired qualifications, and if the appointment was made with the approval of the Department. I think I might have received a reply to my query, for if the appointment was agreeable to the Department, I could have met the complaints of the Indians by so informing them.\n\nI am of the opinion that the complaints drawn attention to in my letter of the 19th ultimo, are well founded, and call for recognition of and action by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

GRAHAM\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 16th, 1922\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nAs you are aware, it is proposed to erect a monument to the late Father Hugonnard in the Qu'Appelle Valley, at or near the Industrial School. I have been taking an active part in this movement by soliciting subscriptions from his many friends and admirers. Many Indians would like to subscribe to this cause and a few have done so, but for the majority of the individual Indians the times are hard and some have suggested that the Bands who have funds could vote a contribution from that source. I do not know whether it would be in order to ask them to do this but hope it could be done. The idea is to raise $3000.00 and I thought the three Bands in the Qu'Appelle Agency might be asked for $200. or $250. each. File Hills Bands have no Trust funds but I am sure a number of them will be glad to give as much as they are able.\n\nFather Hugonnard spent thirty-five years working among the Indians under all sorts of conditions and I often hear them speaking about him and expressing appreciation for all he did for them in the old days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the report of Mr. Public School Inspector Stevenson has been drawn to my attention and, although this Provincial Officer has commented favorably on certain phases of the classroom activity at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, there are some points raised by him that call for special attention, with despatch. This department wishes to cooperate with you and our officers in the field in an effort to provide the best possible educational facilities at the largest Indian residential school in Canada. The lighting in the three girls' classrooms and the junior boys' room is entirely insufficient and is injurious to the pupils' eyes. In the spring you will please draw this fact to the attention of Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, who will arrange to have a competent workman go to Lebret and supervise the installation of more or larger windows. The Inspector reports that it will not be possible to provide more window space in the senior boys' classroom, but a brighter appearance will obtain if the ceiling is painted white. This painting should be attended to without delay.\n\nThe blackboard in the senior boys' room should be lowered and the steps at present in use removed. If at all possible, arrange to have more blackboard accommodation in the junior girls' classroom. If there is any expense in connection with the above matters, please requisition to Mr. Commissioner Graham for the material needed. The intermediate girls' classroom should be equipped with some library books and a selection will be made by this department and shipment made to you.\n\nAs you are aware, the classroom work among the boys of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School has never been very successful of late. I believe Mr. Inspector Stevenson has given us a most valuable suggestion when he advises that the junior room be presided over by one of the sisters. Her supervision need not extend beyond the classroom, but primary work in all its classroom phases can be best supervised by a lady teacher. I would therefore request that you will make arrangements, in the immediate future, to release Mr. Arthur Petit from his duties in the classroom and arrange for one of the sisters to take over the work.\n\nThe Department cannot allow Mr. Petit to remain in charge of a classroom. Mr. Stevenson, the Inspector, is known personally to the Department as a fair-minded and efficient educationist. From the facts that he has presented, I am convinced that Mr. Petit's English is not only faulty but positively bad.\n\nRev. G. Leonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI notice on the Inspector's report that there were 52 pupils present in the junior boys' classroom on the date of his visit. This suggests to me that you are still following the half day system largely and perhaps there are not thirty-five boys in attendance in the junior room throughout the whole day. If it is your wish to continue a full day's teaching activity for these junior boys, you should prepare to arrange for a second teacher to supervise the kindergarten or more junior work. This Department will assist you with equipment for hand work such as paper cutting, sand tables, blocks, etc., if you are able to arrange for two Sisters to take charge of the junior boys.\n\nA copy of this communication is being addressed to Mr. Commissioner Graham, so that he will be informed regarding the changes that are to take place and he will cooperate with you by authorizing any expense necessary in connection with such changes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mr. Petit is being released from his duties as teacher in this Class. Mr. Paul, teacher of the senior Boys Class has left here to attend the Provincial Normal School at Regina, to complete his professional training, and we are securing a Saskatchewan qualified teacher to replace him, a Mr. Blanch, graduate from the Regina Normal School.

The Department is pleased that you have taken action in this connection, with such despatch.\n\nI have also noted, with satisfaction, that Mr. Paul is completing his professional training and that the officer substituting for him is properly qualified.\n\nThe travelling nurse's latest report refers to the Sister lately appointed to the school infirmary as an excellent nurse, and the Department wishes also to congratulate the school in this connection. The nurse's report, generally, was quite favourable to those in charge at the school; but I must refer to the meals that are being prepared for the children. Kindly arrange for a little more variety in the diet offered, and insist upon a more careful preparation of the bread. The Department will cooperate in any way possible in the effort to secure the best possible results at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I am sure that Dr. Hall and our other representatives will be quite satisfied to have a recapitulation of the amount of the different varieties of food placed on the tables for the children for each meal of the day, and that it will not be necessary to draw up detailed and comprehensive diet sheets.

The Principal, the Rev. Father Leonard, has been given every opportunity to prove his capacity, and I regret to say that he has not measured up to the standard required at the more important institutions. Qu'Appelle is the banner school of the Roman Catholic Church in the West, and it is in the interests of all concerned to have as the administrative head a man of outstanding character and ability.\n\nFrom our conversations on this subject, I would judge that we are practically in accord on the general principles involved, and I must insist that a new incumbent for this position be found in the immediate future. Please take, without delay, whatever steps you consider necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joe. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th inst., enclosing a copy of a communication that you had written to the Rev. Principal of the Qu'Appelle School, regarding the furnishing of a proper diet sheet for Dr. Hall, Medical Officer.\n\nI may say that I was at this Agency last week and I instructed the Principal on the same lines as your letter indicates. There is no reason why we should not furnish the doctor with a diet sheet from time to time, so that he would be in a position to know what the children are getting in the way of food.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe whole trouble here is that the parents of these children are demanding better care for their children and a better education and training. This school is not what it should be. The Department have been informed of this. I had reason to believe that a change would be made, but this has not taken place, and there will always be dissatisfaction about getting children to attend this school especially those of graduates. I am at a loss to know why the Department have not taken action on the reports that have been sent in by the Inspectors. This school is far from what it should be.\n\nAt the Board's request, I report to Mr. Sury\n\nAs a new teacher is expected in a month,\n\nIt stated action could be expected in a month.\nI am in receipt of a letter from the principal of the Qu'Appelle industrial school in which he makes a request that the salary of the night-watchman in that institution be paid by the Department over and above the grant. I do not see that the Department should be called upon to pay this salary as it is not done in other institutions; the expense is borne by the school out of the per capita grant.\n\nI visited the Qu'Appelle school some weeks ago and I found that the principal had done away with the services of the night-watchman on the score of economy. Personally I think this is poor economy and that the watchman is the last officer around the institution whose services should be dispensed with. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will advise the principal of the school that on no account is he to do away with the night-watchman and that his wages will have to be paid out of the school grant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner,\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Jan. 21, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Commissioner Graham that you have dispensed with the services of a night watchman at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I hasten to inform you the Department is surprised that you have taken any action which jeopardizes the lives of the children under your care. If you have not already arranged for a new incumbent, please do so without delay. The salary of a night watchman will have to be paid, as in the case of other schools, from the per capita earnings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Indian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLehret, Sask.,\nJan. 7th, 1924.\n\nLetter # 9512\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request, I engaged a night-watchman to go through the school and stables every hour from 8 P.M. until 5 A.M., inclusive. This man commenced his duties on Nov. 16th, and has been on duty every night since then.\n\nNow I feel I cannot afford to pay this man out of the Per Capita Grant, as this money is needed for the children and really belongs to them. And, as this is an extra employee engaged for the protection of Government property, I would respectfully request that you take this matter up with the Department with a view of securing us a Bonus for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) G. Leonard\nPrincipal.\n\nW.M. Graham, Indian Commissioner,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Industrial School,\nLebret, Sask.,\nJan. 28th, 1924,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 21st, inst., I beg to say there has evidently been a misunderstanding in regard to the night watchman at this school.\n\nIn speaking to Mr. Graham, he requested that, if I could not afford to pay the salary of a night watchman, I should write to him and he would see we got help from the Department.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter to Mr. Graham, and I cannot see anything in it that would lead him to think we were dispensing with the services of a night watchman.\n\nAs our time sheets will show, this man was kept on pending the Department's decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Feb. 18, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your No. 2520 of the 28th ultimo, with reference to a night watchman at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I have noted that there has been a misunderstanding in this connection. The Department is pleased to be informed that you have not dispensed with the services of this officer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Res. School,\nLebret, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe have been struggling for about two and one-half years to try and get funds to erect a Memorial to Father Hugonard, in the Qu'Appelle Valley, possibly in the grounds of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School. Times have been hard, and it is difficult to get people to give as much as they would like to give. I have succeeded, so far, in getting about $500.00, and I understand you are going to be able to secure a grant from the Department of $1000. Is this right?\n\nFather Hugonard labored for thirty-five years with the Indians of the Qu'Appelle Valley. He was an outstanding man amongst the Indians, as you well know; and many of them look upon him as a great personal benefactor, and his name is a byword on most of the Reserves today. The Indians, I feel, would readily contribute something from their Band Funds, if it were in order for them to do so. I will be glad if you will give me your opinion, as to whether it would be in order to submit a resolution to the Band, to grant a donation from their funds. If we could get assistance of this kind, the outlook would be quite bright.\n\nMy personal knowledge of Father Hugonard and his work, makes me feel that some recognition of his work among the Indians, should be shown by them and by the Government. I trust you will be able to assist in any way you can, to bring about this venture successfully.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nD.C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 22, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the report and recommendation contained in your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say you are hereby authorized to submit to the Department resolutions from Indian Bands in the Qu'Appelle Valley requesting that a grant be made from their funds towards the erection of a memorial to the memory of the late Reverend Father Hugonard, who was active in furthering the interests of the Indians of the district, and who laboured amongst them for thirty-five years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 11th, 1924.\n\nFile: 116575-1B\n\nMr. Allan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith reference to my letter of October 31st, 1921, your letters of November 16th, 1921, and June 8th, 1922, in connection with the erection of a monument in memory of the late Rev. Father Hugonard O.M.I., and the promise, through your kindness, of the sum of $1,000.00 towards said monument, I beg to state that steps are being taken for the erection of this monument within the next year. I therefore take the liberty of asking to again enclose in the estimates this amount of $1,000.00, if such a course is necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy, O.M.I.\nI beg to say that it was my intention to discuss with you while in Ottawa, the question of making an allowance for additional pupils at the Lebret Industrial School.\n\nThis school has at the present time about 237 children in residence, which is twelve over the number they are being paid a grant for. The school building and staff at Lebret are adequate for 250 children, which means no additional cost for fuel or attention. The children who attend this school are from all over the Province of Saskatchewan, and from points in Manitoba, and as the boarding schools at Pine Creek and Sandy Bay have their full number, and the space is available at Lebret for the accommodation of 250 children, it seems to me only reasonable that the grant should be increased to that number. This would mean that the Department would not be called upon to provide extra accommodation at the various schools until this school was filled to capacity.\n\nI would, therefore, strongly recommend that the Lebret School be allowed a grant for 250 pupils.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nIf the funds of the current year provide for this, it will certainly help the Church Authorities out with the work, but if funds are not available I would ask you to have the amount inserted in the estimates to provide for the coming year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, February 6, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 314-11A of the 30th ultimo, with reference to increasing the pupilage at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would indicate the exact number of children that can be accommodated in the dormitories - 500 cubic feet of air per child. The Department agrees that all available accommodation at residential schools should be utilized before consideration is given to enlarging our buildings at similar schools in the neighborhood. When the available dormitory air space is determined, the Department will give further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nReferring to my letter of the 30th of January, File No. 314-11B, asking for authority for additional pupils at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and your reply of the 6th of February, asking me if I would indicate the number of children that can be accommodated in the dormitories at 500 cubic feet of air per child.\n\nI beg to inform you that there is 105,104 cubic feet of air in the boys' and girls' dormitories in this institution, which would provide for 210 pupils. I took the matter of air space up with the Deputy Minister of Public Health in this Province, and he states that this school, or any other properly built school will accommodate children with perfect safety at 400 cubic ft., providing the ventilation through the windows is properly looked after. This being the case there is dormitory space for 250 children in this institution.\n\nFurther I may add that there are other rooms in the school, such as closed-in galleries and private rooms that are used by pupils, with an air space of 22,957 cu.ft. This would provide for about 43 additional pupils, so I think that you could safely authorize the additional pupilage at this school. Personally I think that we can accommodate about 275 children there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 314-11B of the 12th instant, with reference to increasing the pupilage at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. There is great danger in overcrowding at this type of institution, with a consequent impairing of the health of the Indian pupils; and the Department has for years required 500 cubic feet of air in the dormitories per child.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I should be pleased if you would intimate whether it is the intention to use the closed-in galleries and private rooms as regular dormitory accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 17th of March last, #114-0-1 regarding the matter of increasing the pupilage at the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, I beg to say that I have gone into this matter thoroughly and I am now able to give you some further information on the subject, and after consideration of same you will kindly decide whether it is the intention to increase the pupilage.\n\nThe two large dormitories provide for 210 pupils and there is a small dormitory which provides for 11 pupils. There is accommodation in the hospital for 65 beds, and this can be cut down to 35 beds, leaving additional accommodation for 28 pupils, making in all 246.\n\nAt the present time the school is drawing a grant for 235 pupils and there are considerably more than this number in the school; I think perhaps 235 or 240. Would the Department be agreeable to paying a grant on this number? I think myself that there would be no over-crowding. I will see that the children are not crowded into the two large dormitories but that some of them are placed in the various rooms mentioned, off the hospital and in the sleeping porches.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 314-11B of the 8th instant, with reference to the pupilage at the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I have noted that rooms off the infirmary can safely be used for dormitory accommodation and that you will see that there is no overcrowding. I am pleased to inform you that a pupilage of 235 will be allowed as from October first, next. Please advise the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nAs you have perhaps seen by the press it is proposed to erect a monument at Lebret this summer to Father Hugonard. Through your good offices, Archbishop Mathieu gave the Memorial Committee assurance that a thousand dollars has been set aside in the estimates for this purpose. Premier Dunning has likewise given us five hundred dollars on behalf of Saskatchewan. The balance necessary for the required amount is being raised throughout the province - a notable contribution coming from the Indians themselves. Five thousand dollars is the necessary objective.\n\nThe monument is taking the form of a dignified bronze group with a figure of Father Hugonard with an Indian boy and girl in native costume on either side of him. It is to stand on a pedestal of field stone in the parterre of the Lebret School facing the shores of Lake Qu'Appelle. It is hoped to have the unveiling the last week in September or the first week in October.\n\nMight we trespass on the generous amenities of your kindly interest in this tribute to Father Hugonard in asking if you would have the Government cheque forwarded to the Committee. Our Treasurer is Mr W M Graham of the Indian Department here and you could have it made out to the Hugonard Memorial Committee and forwarded to him. Time rushes so swiftly when a matter of this kind is brought to consummation that there are anxious moments until everything is definitely settled.\n\nThanking you kindly in anticipation,\n\nfaithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChancellor\n\nMr Duncan Scott,\nIndian Dept., Ottawa.\n\n(on behalf of\nHUGONARD MEMORIAL COMMITTEE)\nJune 19, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, in reference to the contribution of this Department towards the monument to Father Hugonard.\n\nIncluded in our estimates is an item of $1000.00, which I hope will be available in the near future, but Parliament has not yet passed upon our appropriations. Before payment can be made, it will be necessary to have a voucher showing the expenditure on the monument, when I hope to be in a position to issue the necessary cheque.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Athel Murray,\nChancellor,\nArchbishop's House,\nRegina, Sask.\nQu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask., July 6th, 1925.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDirector Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nFor the last two days I have had the opportunity of visiting Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School and discussing with the Principal, Rev. Fr. Leonard O.M.I., problems relative to the management of the institution.\n\nI feel more than pleased to communicate to you my sentiments with the hope that it will afford you satisfaction to hear good news from the most important of the R.C. Indian Residential Schools.\n\nFirst of all the exterior and interior appearance of the school is to be commended. The garden about which complaints had reached the Department in the past is in such a state that Commissioner Graham himself could not refrain from saying to Rev. Fr. Leonard that he had not seen such a nice one in Regina. The outbuildings are all in first class condition. As the walls and ceiling of all the rooms have been painted and the floor of the halls covered with cork linoleum the aspect is refreshing to the eye and the house appears really homelike to the children.\n\nWhen Rev. Fr. Leonard was appointed Principal less than six years ago the school had a roll attendance of only 137 children. Since he has recruited 117 boys and 121 girls making a total of 238. The present number on the roll is 243 all Indian children with the exception of 3 whom the principal keeps through charity and 2 whom the Department has not thought fit as yet to admit. The above number is the highest ever attained at this school for Indian children and I think that the Rev. Principal is to be congratulated on his success as a recruiting officer. The curriculum of studies is of the highest standard under the direction of certified teachers for the Province of Saskatchewan. The children I have seen seem well developed and all strongly attached to their school. In fact I understand that the reputation of the school has never been better and I must say that requests from every quarter oblige us to consider in the very near future the necessity of enlarging as more than 50 children are waiting for their turn to be admitted, lack of space being the only preventive.\n\nIt may prove of interest to you to know that since his appointment Rev. Fr. Leonard has assured the financial position of the school and that fact speaks highly of his administrative qualities and singles him as our foremost Principal in the district.\n\nI may add that the Principal, staff and employees (13 nuns and 15 men) form but one family all working hand in hand to realize the ideal of a true Indian Residential School according to the desires of the Department and their own convictions.\n\nTrusting that the above details\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwill interest both you and Mr Ferrier and show our ever increasing determination of cooperating with the Department and thereby insuring the success of the work entrusted to us, I remain\n\nYours ever truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nAs you are aware there has been movement here in the last three years to erect a suitable memorial to the late Father Hugonard, who was Principal of our Industrial School at Fort Qu'Appelle for thirty-three years, and who spent about forty years, in fact a long life, laboring with the Indians. He was a man that was dearly beloved by all, and a true friend of the Indians.\n\nFrom time to time I have had suggestions from the various Bands in the Qu'Appelle Agency asking that a certain amount of money be deducted from their funds as a contribution from these Indians toward this memorial. A meeting was held on the various reserves on the 16th ultimo, and the Band concerned practically voted unanimously for a grant to be taken from their funds of $500.00 each. The Resolutions and lists of voters are herewith attached. I will be glad if the Department will send a cheque for the amounts mentioned.\n\nI understand that the Deputy Head of the Department is absent, and if it is necessary I would ask that this be brought to the Head of the Department, as the amount is required almost at once. The cost of the monument will be approximately $6,000.00; public subscription will meet a little more than half of this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith reference to Mr. Graham's request for a cheque for $1500.00 being contribution by the Indians of Pasquahs; Muscowpetungs; and Piapot's Bands, as per resolution passed by each Band towards the monument to be erected to the memory of the late Father Hugonard, I beg to say that payment can be made from the Interest Funds of the Bands mentioned, but I would draw your attention to the Deputy's letter of the 19th June last wherein he states it will be necessary to have a voucher showing the expenditure on the monument before issuing a cheque covering the grant of $1000.00 to be made from the appropriation for Indian Education. I therefore think we should have this voucher before paying the grant to be given by the Indians.\n\nMr. Graham points out that the amount is required at once but I fail to understand why.\n\nI would suggest wiring Mr. Graham for this voucher before issuing cheque.\n\nAug. 7th., 1925.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have donated their full activities to stimulating interest in the festival.\n\nFully 400 western Indians will be present at the festival and will play according to W. M. Graham, Indians are still very much interested in the lives of the old adventurers who came to Canada from France and will be faithfully reproduced on a historic stage.\n\nApart from its dramatic features, the Lebret pageant promises to be the most distinguished gathering of distinguished speakers who will participate in the festivities. Mr. Herbert Munro of Highways, will speak on the life and times of Samuel de Champlain, and D. C. Coleman, Winnipeg's leading authority on the Western Line C. P.

There were a large number of people in attendance at the celebration, and the official visitors included Mr. J.G. Gardiner, Prime Minister of this province, Hon. Mr. Motherwell, the French Consul, and Monseigneur Marois representing Archbishop Mathieu who was ill. The ceremony was very interesting, but was marred somewhat by rain. I would say there were fully two thousand people present, including the Indians. I arranged to have representatives present from most of the reserves and they were camped on the grounds with their highly decorated tepees, and were very much interested in the proceedings. A very large number of ex-pupils were present.\n\nI am attaching herewith a snapshot of the Monument, which is situated about sixty yards from the school in a beautiful little park and about sixty feet from the edge of the lake. I feel sure you will like the statue. The cash outlay was about $6100.00, and in addition to this we put in some work gratis, viz:- digging the excavation and putting in a concrete base ten feet deep, which is below the frost line.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is in the middle of the garden, and of course the grounds are kept in good order by the staff of the school. The monument cost about $5,100.00. $1055.00 was provided by Parliamentary Appropriation, and $1500.00 was contributed equally from the funds of three Indian bands: Muscowpetung, Pigeon and Pasqua. In all $2555.00 was contributed from these sources, and the remaining amount was collected from citizens of Saskatchewan. I beg to send herewith a snapshot of the monument.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nShort sketch of Father Hugonard's life, his illness and his death.\n\nIn the year 1845, Almighty God looked upon a very pious family in the town of Colomb, France and blessed them with a son Joseph Hugonard who has been taken from this world to a better land to receive his reward. Though very young, he left his parents, his home and all the pleasures of the world to become a priest of God who surely had chosen him to be one of the great missionaries of the West.\n\nHe arrived at Qu'Appelle in 1872 and worked very hard to convert the Indians. He remained at the Mission with Reverend Father Magnan his great friend, who shared his sufferings for over 18 years.\n\nTen years after Father Hugonard's arrival in Qu'Appelle he wrote to the Department asking for money to build a school for his Indians. His favour was granted and soon men were at work. Sisters of Charity from Montreal were sent for, and arrived at Qu'Appelle Station October 21st 1884. Father went himself to meet the four Sisters.\n\nHe then went to the different reserves to get children for his school, but this was not an easy thing to do. Many refused and even many threatened to kill him; God took pity on poor Father Hugonard, softened the hearts of the cruel Indians, and a considerable number of boys and girls were sent here where a good training would enable...\nthem to live as white people do.\n\nIn 1904, while Father was on business affairs in U.S.A., the school burned down, but the children did not return home; they remained in little sheds until a new house could be built. Dear Father grieved very much for the school, but he had hopes to have another one built. He went to Ottawa and obtained the favour he was longing for. It was only in 1905 that the school was rebuilt. By this time Father had won the hearts of all the Indians. He converted hundreds of them. Father Hugonard was not one who thought only of himself, but tried continually to win all hearts to God and save souls. He was kind to every body, no matter how badly they had treated him, he was always ready to forgive them.\n\nHe loved his Indians and they loved him as a dear Father. Never did a poor person pass his door without him giving them all they needed for their body and also instructing them in the Christian faith. He had been Principal since the school has been built. Four years ago he was taken very sick and was sent to take a rest to New York; he was well and happy after a time and came back to continue his good works.\n\nHe fell very sick again the next spring and this time was sent to Texas; there he met one of his greatest friends, Archbishop Langlois who had also been sent there to take a rest, and was taken...\naway in June 1915, and he had surely pleaded for our dear Principal. Our dear Father had never again recovered all his strength. He caught cold this winter and took very sick on January 15th, 1917. This was to be his last illness. It looked as if he had only been sent to us by God for the last four years.\n\nHe suffered very much during his illness. On the 30th of January, Reverend Father Cahill Provincial of St. Boniface anointed him. The next day his old friend Reverend Father Magan arrived, and had come to unite his prayers with ours. Though many were said, God will was that he should have him.\n\nHis Grace Archbishop Macdonald, who had been at Quebec for the last four weeks, arrived on Sunday at 1:30 P.M. Father was delighted to see him. His Grace gave him Holy Communion during the night. His agony began on Sunday morning at 7, and was most terrible while His Grace Father, the Sisters and the children were continually praying. At 12:15 P.M. he breathed his last. The dear Father Magan at his bedside seeing that his most faithful friend had left him, exiled on this earth of misery and sorrow then his head on the pillow of the dear departed, kissed his forehead and wept bitterly.\n\nIt was joy in heaven, but bitter sorrow on earth. Dear Father was spared...\nin the parlor.\n\nWe had three services for him. On Tuesday in our chapel, Wednesday in the church; we accompanied the body in going. Thursday in our chapel was the final service. Around the coffin 50 priests formed a perfect crown, praying for their departed friend.\n\nHis Grace spoke eloquently in French and English of Father Hugonard's virtues and good deeds.\n\nReverend Father Leduc of St Albert gave a short sermon in Cree and Reverend Father Etienne in Sioux.\n\nWe accompanied the body to the cemetery where the remains will not be laid in the frozen ground but in the little vault for the winter. Another service will be held in the spring again our hearts will be broken by grief.\n\nWe will not try to paint the meeting of dear Archbishop Langevin and our beloved departed; it is a picture for higher and more skilful painters, a picture for which the colours have not been found yet upon this earth.\n\nThere also came to welcome him the innumerable souls of infants, old men and women, christianized by dear Father. What an everlasting joy must fill each breast.\n\nWe also shall inherit of the\neternal beatitude if we follow the instructions of dear Father Ligonard to whom we owe our salvation and for which our gratitude will be beyond capable expression.\n\nMay he rest in Peace.\n\nEdna Trottier.\nEd. and Funeral of Father Hugonard. Feb. 21, 1907\n\nI feel great sorrow that we lost this historic school was caused by the death of its venerable founder, the most Reverend Father Hugonard. Although he had grown old, we never expected him to be so suddenly taken away from us so soon, but it was true that he should receive the crown of bliss for the hardships he underwent in this part of the country which he so dearly loved.\n\nHis life was one of constant sorrow and hardship, but despite of the dehumanizing trials and tests he went through, still he persisted in his work for which he sacrificed so much for, that of converting the Indians. His zeal for this work led him to build the industrial school where he had the happiness of seeing so many children taught and brought up in a way which was so pleasing to the one who had sent him. Since he had built the school, never had so many prayers been offered up to God than at his death by the children of his school and many people who remembered in some way the kindness he showed to everybody. During the three days before his burial priests and bishops from the country around came to offer a prayer for him and see his beloved face for the last time. People from the neighboring villages came streaming in the room where he lay for the last time that they should thank the Almighty for sending such a future spouse amongst them.\n\nFuneral services were offered up for his soul by his venerable brother missionaries that came straggling in as soon as they heard that our...\nof them was dead. Not only did priests come but\nthe Governor with many of his people also came\nto offer their prayers as a gratitude for this good\nFather had done in this country. The unwound mission-\nary died on the eleventh of February 1917 and on Thurs-\nday following he was consigned in the cemetery\nhouse. During the morning a last Requiem Mass was\noffered by the Bishop from St Boniface for Father\nKugonish. At the Mass I was honored with my niece to be\nthere from St Boniface and I was so glad to see our\nchapel filled with visitors, including the Governor from\nRegina, praying for one who was so dear to us. At the\nsprinkling of his body with holy water I stood at his head\nand looked on his peaceful countenance for the last time\nand many were the sad feelings that stung up in my\nheart when I recalled that affectionate face smiling upon\nour chapel in the same chapel where he now lay with no\nlife to stir those blessed lips again. When Mass was over\nthe body was taken out and the sad procession began to\nthe little parish cemetery. I and another went near at the\nhead and when we got to the little house where the dead\nwere wont to be placed for the night, we waited for the\ncoffin to come in. We had not long to wait for this soon\nappeared in of the oldest missionaries who were present at\nthe Funeral bearing in their midst one of their fellow\ncomrades. When the body was consigned in the little\nhouse the people turned and went to the school or to\ntheir homes. On the evening of this sad event the\npriest and people who came from distant places\ntook their departure after showing their great\ngratitude to one who was dead but who was\nand will be the pride of the country for many\nyears to come.\n\nBy Willie Yuzieapi\n**Trial Balance at end of Fiscal Year March 31st, 1928.**\n\nQu'Appelle Industrial School, Lebret, Sask.\n\n| Account Description                  | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|\n| Stock account                       | 333.51   |\n| Indian Department account           | 37,488.59|\n| Miscellaneous Income account        | 940.44   |\n| Clothing account                    | 3,578.98 |\n| Freight and Express account         | 2,073.47 |\n| Fuel account                        | 3,721.37 |\n| House Equipment account             | 699.75   |\n| House Expense account               | 3,356.35 |\n| Provisions account                  | 10,042.35|\n| Repairs and building account        | 60.00    |\n| Discount account                    | 32.79    |\n| Farm Equipment account              | 1,436.80 |\n| Farm General account                | 1,822.73 |\n| Shoe Shop account                   | 1,470.54 |\n| Extra Labor account                 | 2,120.05 |\n| Travelling Expense account          | 949.74   |\n| Salaries account                    | 11,082.50|\n| Macdonald-Chapman, Ltd.             | 209.17   |\n| Prairie City Oil Co.                | 145.85   |\n| W.H.

I may state that no advance had been obtained on account of the March Quarter grant. The returns for that quarter called for $9124.42, so that when this grant is taken into consideration there would be a surplus of $5349.53 instead of a deficit at the end of the fiscal year. I am also submitting a trial balance from April 1st. to April 21st., 1928. The outstanding accounts amount to $655.85, and the April salaries, after deducting an advance of $50.00, amount to $745.00, so that when the balance of the March Quarter grant is received the surplus will amount to $7031.83. This appears to be a very good showing, but after looking over the farming equipment I find that very soon a considerable expenditure will be involved in replacing implements and machinery which are pretty well worn out. The financial showing of the institution I consider is in a very satisfactory condition.

The absentees comprise 22 boys and 24 girls, and the reasons for their absence are as follows:\n\n|                | Boys | Girls |\n|----------------|------|-------|\n| Allowed to remain at home to assist parents | 4    | 2     |\n| At home by Doctor's order                    | 7    | 10    |\n| In Sanatorium                                 | 1    |       |\n| In Regina Hospital                            | 1    |       |\n| Married                                       |      | 1     |\n| Hysterical                                    |      | 1     |\n| Transferred to other schools                  | 1    | 1     |\n| At school in United States                    | 1    |       |\n| Discharged in April                           | 1    |       |\n| At home on account of deafness                | 1    |       |\n| Died in April                                 | 1    |       |\n| Did not return after the holidays             | 4    | 9     |\n\nAfter making full inquiry it would appear that there are probably a number of pupils who were permitted to go home to convalesce following sickness, who might be in a condition to return.\nInspector Murison's report on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nto return, and others who did not return after the holidays. It might be advisable to notify the Agent regarding them. The total number coming under this class would be about 17. I made a careful examination of the register, and I am satisfied that the pupils for whom grant is paid are entitled to admission under the regulations. There are a number, however, being carried on the register that I think should be written off. I noted that the girls were neatly and tidily dressed. The boys were very neatly dressed on Sunday, but during the week they did not present so good an appearance, although warmly clad. The yard was very muddy, however, and it could not be expected that they would be dressed up in their best clothes under these conditions. There were seven cases in the hospital, one of which, a pneumonia case, was quite serious. This latter is a boy from Keeseekoosne reserve, the son of Antoine Quewezance. The pupils generally, I thought, presented a healthy appearance. I was present during the meal hours, and while the food was plain, they appeared to get plenty of it.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., May 2nd, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the Qu'Appelle Industrial School, which was recently inspected by Mr. Murison. You will notice that the office work at this institution is in good shape as are also the finances.\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the farming implements, it is not the duty of the Department to replace these implements and, if the school expect this, they should be told they are mistaken. I make these remarks as I feel that they have allowed the implements to run down and get in poor condition.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the attendance. It is absolutely wrong that there should be 46 children out of the institution with an enrolment of 259. A great many of these have been out for a long period; in fact, there seems to have been very little interest taken to have them returned and our Agents will have to take some of the responsibility for this condition. I am not instructing the Agents regarding this as I understand this is a matter which the Department are dealing with themselves. As long as this present system of allowing children to return home, on the excuse that they are needed to assist their parents, without having the matter thoroughly investigated continues, the results will be very unsatisfactory. Our Inspectors will tell you that a child is more often not required at home than required, and the Principal is not in a position to know whether the child is needed or not; Principals do not visit reserves. At one time Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwe had a complete check on this system and a pupil was not allowed to go home unless his case was first thoroughly investigated by an Inspector, which is not the case now. I have had several conversations with the Department on this matter, but up to the present I have not been able to convince them that the present system is not satisfactory.\n\nThe out-buildings at this school are in a sad state of repair. You will notice that I have asked for $1,000.00 in the Estimates for repairs to the buildings; I hope this has been allowed.\n\nI would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the playroom and lavatory in the boys' department. This condition has almost always existed; it is impossible to keep this up to the standard in which it should be kept. The joists in the main building have apparently rotted away. This will necessitate considerable expenditure and I doubt whether the $1,000.00 asked for will be sufficient.\n\nWith reference to the laundry, I have asked that $6,000.00 be allowed to put a decent laundry in this school, as the present one is far from what it should be.\n\nI note that some money has been spent during the winter in doing minor repairs about the buildings. This is the first intimation I have had that this money was authorized and that the work was being carried on. The walk leading to the ice house is reported to be unsafe; in fact, all the walks are unsafe. I would draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding the storage facilities not being satisfactory. I have also asked for $1500.00 to put this right.\n\nThere does not appear to be a sufficient number of cows to supply milk for this institution. You are aware\nare aware we supplied some cows a few years ago and by this time there should have been a large enough number, by natural increase. The farming has been carried on in a profitable way, as the finances of the school show.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMay 8, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 314-11 of the 2nd instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hurison's report on the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I am particularly pleased to get this statement, as it is the first general report on this school that has been forwarded to me for some time. I should be grateful if you would have one of your officers inspect there at least once a year in future.\n\nI note that there were 46 children on the roll who were not in school. This, of course, is too many. I have directed that there be a careful checking of the latest quarterly report, and arising from this, the Reverend Principal will be written. The school appears to be in good financial condition and is doing satisfactory work on the whole. You will receive a further communication with reference to the buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

This inspection I completed Thursday, May 29th.\n\nIn order that the living conditions may be thoroughly understood, I feel it necessary that the Department know the condition of the building, its equipment and the work carried on. Then, to understand it from the boys' side, I will describe the outside work, both in relation to farming and stock raising. The playgrounds and the equipment for recreation will also be discussed. In regard to the food, I will set down the menu as observed at each meal, and will give other information obtained from the Sister in charge. However, on this, and the question of health, I will not do more than pass on my impressions as no doubt a full report on this will be made by Dr. Corbett.\n\nOn the first floor of the main building is the Principal's office, the parlor, the guest chamber, and other staff rooms. These I found to be well furnished, tidy, and well kept. The halls were bright and spotlessly clean.\n\nThe girls occupy two dormitories. The small girls are on the first floor, and I found 68 beds in this\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nin this room. The room measures 65' x 50' with a 10'6\" ceiling. All the beds were neatly arranged and nicely made. I examined the bedding on a number of beds, and the sheets and blankets were clean. Each girl was provided with a towel and toothbrush, and I found a night robe neatly folded under each pillow. The toilets and wash basins were all in working order and clean. The outside windows were off, but screens are needed. Of the fourteen windows only four have screens. The windows are located part on either side of the dormitory, thus making the room very bright and easy to ventilate. The floors, I understand, are scrubbed each week, and the spotless condition in which I found them gave every indication that the work was well done.\n\nThe senior girls' dormitory is on the second floor, with 59 beds. The room measures 50' x 60', with a 12' ceiling. At one end of the dormitory is a door leading into a sun room 12 ft. wide and 40 ft. long. This room has 9 large windows facing south, all of which I found to be well screened. The woodwork is painted white, and was clean. Five beds were arranged along the wall, all nicely made with white bedspreads and pillow covers. Here, as in the smaller girls' dormitory, I found the bedding clean. The girls are each provided with an individual towel, toothbrush, and night robe, and the toilets were clean and in good working order. The floors were clean and free of dust. In some places they are badly worn and will need renewing. There are 14 windows, and these are arranged part on either side of the dormitory, 4 of which were provided with screens. The storm sash were still on the other windows, but were on hinges from the top, and most of them were opened allowing\nallowing an abundance of fresh air. More screens are needed as it will be impossible to keep the windows open when the flies and mosquitoes become bad.\n\nThe fire escape ladder is in good condition. The exit to this ladder is through a window which is $3\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. above the floor. This would be very awkward in a rush, and a suitable step ladder should be kept by this window. The condition might also be improved by having the window placed on hinges to open out against the railing of the fire escape platform.\n\nOn the third floor of the main building is a small room, measuring 30' x 22', with a 12 ft. ceiling. This is used by the small boys and accommodates 16 beds. The beds were clean and nicely made. The room is provided with a toilet, bath-tub, and wash basins, all of which were clean and in working condition. The room has three windows, but no screens. The storm sash were still on, but were hung from the top and could be opened. The fire escape is through a window $3\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. from the floor. This could be improved as suggested for the girls' dormitory.\n\nThe big boys' dormitory is 65' x 50', with a 10 ft. ceiling. There are 90 beds and all, I understand, are in use. Flannel sheets are used for the boys, instead of the cotton, and some of these were badly soiled. The sheets are only changed once each month, which I do not consider often enough. The boys are provided with towels, but I found no tooth brushes in use. A supply of new ones were on hand, but apparently the Vice Principal had neglected giving these out. The boys have no nightgowns, and sleep in their underwear. This dormitory has 14 windows, but only 4 are provided with screens. The outside windows are still\nare still on, but could be opened as desired. I found the room well aired, and the floors clean. The wash basins and toilets were all working and in good condition. Two rows of beds, numbering about 30, have wooden frame springs, which are in poor condition. The springs sag badly, and the wire has given away in places.\n\nThe girls' hospital ward No. 1 has 7 beds, and measures 24' x 34', with a 12 ft. ceiling. It has two windows. The storm sash was still on. There are no screens. The room was very clean, and the beds neatly made.\n\nThe girls' hospital ward No. 2 is 16' x 34', and 12 ft. high. This opens on a sleeping balcony 12' x 24', with a 9 ft. ceiling. The ward accommodated 5 beds, and the sunroom had 4 all nicely made with clean white bedding. The balcony has 5 large windows with full size screens. It is painted white, and faces south, so that abundance of sunshine may get in. The two windows in the main ward need screening. I do not think these wards could be improved on, and the care and keeping of same was past criticism.\n\nThe hospital ward No. 1, for the boys, is 24 x 26, with a 12 ft. ceiling. Four beds were neatly made, and the room was clean. It has three windows all needing screens, as well as a door leading to the fire escape. The storm sash were on, but open.\n\nWard No. 2 is 24 x 26, with a 12ft. ceiling, and has 6 beds neatly arranged and nicely made with clean white linen. There are 2 windows. The storm sash is still on, and there are no screens for the windows.\n\nThe hospital dressing room is well provided with basins and medicine. The room was clean, and all utensils and medicines were neatly arranged on shelves.\n\nThe hospital\nThe hospital kitchen is about 14 x 24 in size, and is provided with a kitchen range, gas stove for sterilizing purposes, as well as dishes, and other necessary articles. The sinks were clean and in good working condition, and the entire room was in perfect order.\n\nThe operating room is 18' x 34' with a 12 ft. ceiling. This is furnished with a wheel table, operating table, cot, wheel chair, scales, ray lamp, screen, tables and stools. There are two windows, but no screens. The storm sash was still on, but open. This room appeared to be exceptionally well furnished, and was in A 1. condition.\n\nThe pharmacy appeared to be well stocked with medicines, all of which were neatly arranged on shelves and labelled.\n\nThe sunroom off the main hall is 12' x 24' with a 9 ft. ceiling. This is provided with 3 beds, and could be used for either the boys or girls in case of sickness. It is furnished, and in the same condition as the sunroom off the girls' hospital ward.\n\nThe small girls' playroom is on the ground floor, and is large and roomy. The floor is badly worn, as is also the floor leading to the playroom. The toilets were all clean and in good condition, except one. The bowl is broken, and a new one should be provided. These girls are supervised by a Sister when in the playroom.\n\nThe senior girls' playroom is practically the same, although the floor is in better condition. The toilets were all clean and in working order. A Sister also supervises these girls. There are no screens on any of the windows.\nthe windows, and I would especially point out the need for them on the windows of the lavatories. These windows should be kept open, and screens are essential.\n\nThe boys' playroom is very large. This, also, is on the ground floor. Some repair work has been done in this room during the past month, but there is yet need for more. V-Joint boards are needed on the wall, and the table and benches should be repaired or discarded. The cement has given way on one section of the floor, and should be renewed. This room has received hard usage in the past, but we must remember it is the only room for the boys, who number about 110. The room needs a thorough cleaning, and should be painted. I was informed it was last done in 1922. The shower bathroom, which adjoins the playroom, was clean and in good working condition. The lavatory was not clean. The bowls were all in working order, but had not been kept clean; in fact, the whole room needed a thorough washing. The urinal stalls were also dirty, and no water was running in them. I think if a proper float or trap were installed so that, at intervals, water would be flushed down the walls of the bowl, a big improvement would be found. The storm sash were all on and there are no screens for the windows. Here, again, screens are urgently needed, and the windows should be kept open to allow plenty of ventilation. I was informed by the Assistant Principal that the toilets could not be cleaned and made white, but in this he was wrong. I might add that under the Reverend Principal's instructions, this place was cleaned up before I left.\n\nThe kitchen I found to be clean, and in a very tidy condition. The sinks were clean, and all taps in working order. The pantry and store room connected with the\nwith the kitchen was tidy, and the supplies are well arranged. The frigidaire was in good condition, and well supplied with fresh meat. A quantity of milk was also kept in it. This is a heavy department of the school, and is in charge of two Sisters. The food appeared well cooked, and on all occasions there appeared plenty. The meals served while at the school were as follows:\n\nMay 27th. - Supper\nSoup with meat & vegetables\nBread\nMilk for the little ones\nTea\nHot Biscuits\n\nMay 28th. - Breakfast\nPorridge with brown sugar\nBread & Lard\nTea\n\nDinner\nMeat & vegetables (Mulligan)\nPrunes\nBread & Tea\n\nSupper\nMeat (flour gravy)\nBread\nTea\nSyrup\n\nMay 29th. - Breakfast\nHolidays & Sundays - no porridge\nBread & Lard\nTea\nMilk for the little ones\n\nDinner\nMulligan (Meat & few vegetables)\nBread\nTea\nApple Sauce\n\nThe Sister informed me that the potatoes are sometimes boiled, and the meat is sometimes chopped fine and baked with the potatoes on top.\n\nNo grease (lard) is served if meat is provided.\n\nThe desserts are made up of syrup, prunes, apples, rice with raisins, and often just hot biscuits.\n\nMy impression\nMy impression was that bread made up the main portion of the meal with plenty of tea, and yet I would not infer that a fair amount of other foods are not provided.\n\nThe dining room is about 75 ft. long and has three rows of tables the full length of the room. The boys occupy one half, and the girls the other. The meal is all served before the children come in, and is supervised by two Sisters and the Assistant Principal. I noticed that a number of children received Cod Liver Oil after each meal.\n\nThe sewing room is large and well lighted. It appeared to be well provided with sewing machines, and I found the work all neatly done. The girls are taught to make clothes for the boys and for themselves. The work is supervised by the Sister in charge, and I believe the girls are receiving an excellent training.\n\nThe laundry is situated in a building apart from the school, but is connected by a covered passage-way. The building is in good repair, and is equipped with a large washer, and extractor for drying the clothes, also necessary tubs. The upstairs has a specially fitted drying room, and is provided with a large mangle for ironing the sheets. The room is well lighted, but should have screens for all the windows as I found the place very hot and stuffy. The sewing departments are closed on Mondays, and all the girls assist in the washing. This does not appear to be a satisfactory way as, under this method, the bed sheets are only washed once a month, and the boys' clothes twice. The Sister explained that the washer would not accommodate all the clothes to enable the sheets to be washed twice a month, and the children to have clean clothes each week. She claimed another washer would be needed if this were to be done. Personally, I see no reason why part of the washing\ncould not be done on Mondays; this could be the girls washing and their sheets. The boys' could be done Wednesday, and the staff's on Friday, leaving Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday for the ironing. In this way the work could be carried on with the present equipment, and the laundry department would be in operation each day of the week, thus giving the girls a training in this, as well as in mending, sewing and cooking. However, if the work must be done in one day, I have no doubt another washer is needed, because at present I do not think the children's clothes are changed often enough, and the sheets should be washed at least once every two weeks.\n\nThe bakery is a fairly new building, and is equipped with a mixer and two large ovens. The place was clean, and the bread seen was good. The flour used is a standard second grade \"Key Note\", made by the Robin Hood Milling Co. A large supply of flour was stored in the storeroom attached to the bakery. I understand baking is done three times a week, and that 4 cwt. of flour is used at each baking. The number of loaves baked at one time was claimed to be 200, and that should equal 400 standard size loaves such as are sold in the cities. The baker claimed that some weeks he was obliged to bake extra in order to have sufficient. It will be noted that the girls receive no training along this line, which I consider is a mistake. Surely, after spending six to eight or ten years in a school, a girl should know how to bake bread and not have to return home and continue making bannock, as unfortunately is the case.\n\nThe garden is situated west of the girls' playground, and is an ideal spot for the purpose. All the seeds had been put in and the plants set out, some of which I found damaged by frost. This work is looked after by Mr. Dahl, and\n\nI understand\nI understand that, as a rule, they have abundance of all vegetables. The boys appear to have little part in this work, although at certain times they assist in the weeding. This branch of training I consider important, and feel that the boys should have more instructions along this line. Mr. Dahl, the gardener, is a man up in years and speaks very little English. He appeared to receive more assistance from his wife than from the boys.\n\nThe root cellar is built outside the school, and is underground. The walls are built of stone, and the roof is cement covered with earth. A few potatoes and carrots still remained, and these I found to be sound and in good condition. The Principal purchased a car of potatoes last fall, but as a rule they raise sufficient for their own requirements.\n\nThe carpenter shop is in good repair, and is well outfitted with tools. I found two men busy at work and one Indian boy. I understand that at times the boys are given some instructions in this work.\n\nThe shoe shop is in poor condition, and past repairing. Three men are kept busy repairing and making the shoes required for the children.\n\nThe horse barn was clean, but certain repair work is needed. The outside doors need to be renewed, and also the one leading to the feed room. I also noticed that a number of mangers needed renewing. Two carpenters are kept, and yet it seems strange that this repair work is left undone. The horses seen were in good condition, and appeared to be receiving good care.\n\nThe cow barn was clean and in good repair, except that new doors were needed at the north end. This barn is a fair\nis a fair size and accommodates 24 cows. At present 16 are being milked, and from these they receive about 140 lbs. in the morning and 120 lbs. at night, a total of 260 lbs. or 26 gal. Some years ago, the Department furnished this school with a number of holstein cows, and I have no doubt that had proper care and judgment been used, the school could now have had 24 cows of high producing merits. However, this was not done, and today we have a herd of 45 females, some outstanding and others, no doubt, very ordinary. In order that these cows may be properly cared for, it will be necessary to have more barn room. The present barn could be enlarged to accommodate 40 cows, which would mean additional space for 16 head. A herd of this size, well selected and properly cared for, should supply each child with at least 1 pint of whole milk per day, leaving sufficient to be used in cooking, as well as enough to teach the girls the art of butter making, of which, at present, they know nothing. I feel this to be an important branch of training and one that should not be neglected.\n\nA small shed, 18x30, was built some years ago to accommodate the calves and yearlings. This I found in good repair and suitable for the purpose for which it was erected.\n\nThe piggery is well built and in good repair. At present they have 9 sows and 25 small pigs. The fences about the pig yard are in poor condition, and will need to be re-built.\n\nThe crop this year amounts to - Wheat, 135 acres; Oats 110 acres; Barley 65 acres; Sunflowers 12 acres, with about 160 acres left to summerfallow.\n\nThe playgrounds\nThe playgrounds for the boys were tidy and free of all litter. They are supplied with a baseball outfit, and a football.\n\nThe yards about the old coal shed need to be cleaned, and the shed should be taken down as it is past repairing, and in a dilapidated condition. I would also mention the yard about the chicken house, which is very unsightly, and should be cleaned and made tidy. The chicken house is quite close to the school, but the Reverend Principal claimed that if it were away any distance, the boys and outsiders would steal both the eggs and the chickens.\n\nThe playground for the girls is south of the school. It is well drained and dotted with beautiful shade trees. The old swings are no longer safe, and new swings and teeters would greatly add to the enjoyment of the children.\n\nI visited each classroom, and in all cases they were clean, tidy, and well aired, but in all cases screens are needed. The work is arranged as follows:\n\nSenior boys in charge of Mr. J. R. Paquin.\n\nThe grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 17     |\n| IV    | 12     |\n| V     | 10     |\n| VI    | 9      |\n| VII   | 1      |\n| Total | 49     |\n\nThe junior boys are in charge of Mr. E. J. Dahl. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 32     |\n| II    | 31     |\n| Total | 63     |\n\nSenior girls\nSenior girls in charge of Miss M. H. Rinaudo. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| V     | 10     |\n| VI    | 10     |\n| VII   | 11     |\n| VIII  | 12     |\n| Total | 43     |\n\nIntermediate girls in charge of Sister Bail. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| II    | 8      |\n| III   | 17     |\n| IV    | 14     |\n| Total | 39     |\n\nJunior girls in charge of Sister Greyeyes. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 30     |\n| II    | 10     |\n| Total | 40     |\n\nAll the children appeared well along in their grades, and some of the children speak out exceptionally well and clear. I found the registers all marked, and the attendance shown is excellent. The greater number of children attend school all day, and this especially applies to the boys.\n\nThe fire hose are in good condition, and I found all fire extinguishers filled and in convenient places. Some of the exits can be improved by a step ladder, as mentioned before, and the placing of the windows on hinges to open out. The fire gong rings at several different stations and appeared to be in good condition. Fire drill is not observed often enough as it had only been carried out on one occasion this year, previous to my visit. The children were just in bed on the night.\nthe night I rang the bell, and all were out in two minutes, except the senior girls who required slightly over four minutes. If the improvements suggested were made and more frequent fire drills observed, it would greatly lessen all danger, should a fire occur.\n\nI am attaching to this report a time table, which outlines clearly how the time of the boys and girls is taken up, and I understand this is adhered to throughout the year.\n\nThe girls were neatly dressed and clean, all having their hair neatly cut and combed.\n\nThe boys were fairly well dressed, but one can readily understand that with only changing their clothes twice a month, by the end of two weeks, they are, to say the least, badly soiled and somewhat in need of repair. They appeared fairly clean in person, but their hair, in many cases, was ill kept and poorly cut. There was undoubtedly lack of care and interest.\n\nIn regard to the children's health, which subject will no doubt be dealt with by Dr. Corbett, I have only to say that of the 230 children, I did not see one who was really in poor health. The children were strong, and in good condition, and apparently ready for each meal. There were no bad glands and very little indication of eye trouble. The senior girls are an exceptionally fine lot of robust healthy children, some weighing over 160 lbs. I believe there are some cases of bad teeth needing attention, as well as some diseased tonsils, but no doubt these matters will be discussed by Dr. Corbett.\n\nThe work\nThe work over which the Sisters are in charge could receive little criticism, but I was not satisfied with the work of Mr. Leveque, the Vice Principal. As pointed out elsewhere, the boys are only bathed once in two weeks, and there is no reason for this as the shower bath is in good condition, and there is abundance of water. The toilets were unclean, and the stairway ill kept. The boys' hair was untidy and poorly cut, and tooth brushes were not in use. The supervising of the above, I understand, are some of Mr. Leveque's duties, but there is no doubt he had become careless and indifferent. I do not mean that the man is incapable of doing the work, but he undoubtedly needs checking up by the Principal. This slackness in the Vice Principal would indicate to me a slackness or indifference on the part of the Principal in checking up on those he employs.\n\nThe staff consists of the following members:\n\nRev. Father Leonard\n12 Sisters\nJ. T. Leveque\nP. L. Blanch\nR. Paquin\nE. Dahl\nMiss M. Rinaude\nJ. Dahl\nL. Plais\nM. Simon\nJ. Condon\nJ. Z. LaFleur\nJ. Parisien\nF. Dahl\n\na total of 25. This is undoubtedly a large staff, and gives every indication that an effort is being made to care for the children and give them proper supervision. There are, however, certain phases of the work which I feel...\nfeel is neglected and which I have touched on in this report, namely, the girls receive no instructions in making bread, nor in butter making, and the laundry work is all jammed into one day, instead of being spread out over the week, thus giving the girls the practice and instruction day by day which would fit them to do the laundry work required in the average home. It will be noted that only about six or eight boys work on the half day system; the majority attend school all day. It appeared to me as though the instructor did most of the work instead of instructing the boys and seeing that the work is properly carried out. I am inclined to think that some boys could be kept busy each day in the garden, and on the farm, as well as in the various stock barns, and if this were done and properly supervised, the garden and hoe crops would be well cared for, the stock would be in excellent condition, the barns nicely whitewashed and kept in good repair; the yards and fences would be in A.I. condition, all of which would be excellent training for the boys and should reflect on living conditions in later life.\n\nI realize this report is length, and yet I would not wish to close it without mentioning the courtesy I received both from the Rev. Father Leonard and his staff. The Rev. Principal made it clear from the beginning that I was free to carry on my inspection as I saw fit, and any assistance needed, either from himself or staff, would be freely given. I found myself free to go throughout the building, and on all occasions my enquiries\nenquiries were answered freely and to the point. I trust that in the above report, the Department will find all the information required.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I visited the Qu'Appelle Indian School on May 27th. In company with your Inspector, Mr. Hamilton, and would report as follows:\n\nGeneral Hygienic and Housing Conditions\n\nThe playgrounds for the boys and girls were both clean and well kept.\n\nThe school buildings in general are in good repair, and scrupulously clean. I visited every part of the buildings and found the same ideal cleanliness and tidiness everywhere apparent, with the exception of the boys' lavatory in the basement, which, though of excellent structure, was not as well kept as it should be. There is a good terraza floor and the walls are of glazed brick; the compartments are steel, so the room should be easily kept in perfect condition. The closet bowls were coated at the bottom and up to the top of the water line with a brown scale which can easily be removed by scraping, and should not be allowed to collect again. The urinals were in a similar condition, and lacked automatic flushings. These conditions should be easily remedied, and should not be allowed to recur. The windows of this lavatory lack screens. The lavatories in all other parts of the building were in excellent condition. The taps are working, and water supply good.\n\nThe dormitories, with their beds, were all clean and well aired. The storm windows are still on nearly all the windows of the second and third floors. They open on hinges at the top, but should be removed and proper screens of wire netting put on to keep out the flies.\nThe hospital rooms and sun balconies were very clean, and well equipped.\n\nThe kitchen and dining rooms, the food storages, frigidaire and vegetable cellars, also the recreation rooms leave little to be desired in an institution of this kind. The laundry, bakery, carpenter shops and barns were in good order, and sanitary condition. The sewage disposal plant is in good working order, and very satisfactory.\n\nI examined all the children in the school and found them in excellent condition. There were very few cases of enlarged glands or sore eyes, and these mild in character and receiving appropriate attention. I found very little evidence of head lice, and none of body vermin. There were no children showing signs of active tuberculous lesions, and the general health of the children is excellent, especially for the spring of the year. I believe they have come through the winter very well. All the children in the school have frequent physical examination, including X-Ray plates of their chests, so any unhealthy condition should be discovered early, and I believe receives appropriate care. I found several cases of enlarged tonsils and diseased teeth which require attention, but the number of these is not great. I find that the boys sleep in the same underclothing that they wear during the day, and that their underclothing is changed only once in two weeks. I would advise that the boys sleep in night clothing, and that the underclothing be changed once a week.\n\nRegarding the food supplied, I found this in general to be of good quality, and sufficient quantity. In some respects, however, this might be improved. More milk should be used and a minimum of a pint a day for each child should be provided. Through the winter the amount supplied fell far below this requirement. Butter, too, has been used in very small quantity, being replaced by lard. However, cod liver oil is used quite freely and to some extent makes up for the deficiency of vitamins, but I would urge that butter be used much more freely in place of lard. With the adoption of these suggestions I believe an otherwise excellent school would be improved and brought to high standing.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 10, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 314-11 of the 5th instant, enclosing reports on the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School from Dr. Corbett and Mr. Inspector Hamilton. These are what is required at this time, and I am very pleased to have the report in such detail. Mr. Hamilton's constructive criticism is so useful in this case, that I am more than ever satisfied that our Inspector's time should be largely given to the important function of inspection.\n\nI am enclosing copy of the official letter which is being directed today to Father Leonard. You will please arrange for screens on the main building where needed; for automatic flushing of the urinals in the boys' playroom; for stepladders leading to the windows at the fire escapes where needed and for the placing of these windows on hinges. In due course, you should let the Department have a recommendation regarding additional cow barn facilities.\n\nI should like you to arrange another inspection of the Qu'Appelle School in the early fall, with a view to learning if the improvements and changes directed in the Secretary's letter to the Principal have been carried out. In this connection I am particularly interested in fire drill, boys' gardening, girls' bread and butter making and the general cleanliness of the boys.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 10, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of detailed reports on the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School from Dr. F. A. Corbett of Regina and Mr. Inspector Hamilton. There are certain improvements which must be made without delay, and, knowing your interest in the welfare of the pupils, I write, confidently expecting that you will make what changes are necessary, without delay. I may say that Mr. Commissioner Graham is being authorized to provide screens for the windows where needed and to make a change in the boys' playroom lavatory. Mr. Graham is also being authorized to arrange for stepladders leading to the fire escapes and to place hinges on the windows that should open easily. I am considering for future estimates your need for more cow barn facilities.\n\nFire drill must be practised regularly. The Department allows no exception in this important matter. More variety is needed in connection with the food supplied to the children, and further, larger quantities of milk and butter must be served. The boys should receive a thorough training in gardening. It is reported that the garden is looked after largely by Mr. and Mrs. Dahl. It is quite proper for him to supervise the work, but it should be done by the boys of the school, for training purposes, if for no other reason.\n\nThe girls should receive regular training in the baking of small batches of bread. At most Indian residential schools, it is the practice to have a few loaves made by the older girls, once a week. The work should be done in the kitchen and not in the bakery.\n\nRev. G. Leonard, O.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwhere there are facilities for baking bread on a large scale. Practice in this art should be given, using only that equipment which the girls will find in their homes upon graduation. The older girls should also receive training in making butter.\n\nThe sheets on the boys' beds should be changed at least once every two weeks and the boys' underwear should be changed at least once a week. They should not be allowed to sleep in their underwear\u2014nightgowns must be supplied. Of course, this improvement will mean considerable increase in the laundry work, which will, of necessity, be spread over three or four days. A slight adjustment in the duties of the Sisters and elder girls will make this possible without the work becoming laborious.\n\nThe boys must be bathed at least once a week. Their hair should be kept neatly cut and brushed and their teeth should be cleaned regularly. The boys' playroom lavatory must be kept clean and sanitary at all times.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your No. 114-0-1 of the 10th instant, acknowledging receipt of the reports from Doctor Corbett and Mr. Inspector Hamilton on the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I am glad to know that these reports are satisfactory.\n\nI note in your letter of instructions to Father Leonard that you have said nothing about the milking of cows by girls in the school. This is, as you know, one of the most essential branches of training in the school. We are continually fighting with the Indians about the milking of cows. We have a splendid medical organization now, but I think that we are working from the wrong end. We should have health officers who would insist upon the Indians keeping and milking cows. If the Indian children are given this training at school, it will help somewhat in the matter.\n\nI note that you state that it is the practice at most schools to have a few loaves of bread baked by the older girls. There are very few schools where the girls get this training regularly. In fact, some of the schools do not give any training along this line.\n\nThis has been pointed out from time to time by the Inspectors, and I have certainly done so often enough myself. Butter making is not carried out to any extent. However, I am circularizing the Principals of the various schools and requesting them to instruct their pupils in these matters, and I would like the support of the Department in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I note that you are circularizing the Principals in this connection.

A diagnosis of St. Vitus' Dance, a condition very rare among Indians, was finally made. By the end of the month there was marked improvement, and she was therefore discharged to return to the dormitory and class room.\n\nLately, when it was noticed that there was a tendency for her nervous symptoms to return, Agath was asked to attend school for only part of the day, and to rest the remainder of the day in her own bed in the dormitory.\n\nI am informed by the Reverend Sister Superior that recently Agath committed an act deserving punishment. The Reverend Sister in charge of the girls, instead of administering the usual methods of punishment, informed the girl that she would be denied the privilege of attending the school concert with the other girls, and must remain in her own bed in the dormitory. This, to me, was a very rational attitude to take. To have administered the usual method of punishment in her case possibly would not have accomplished the desired results, and might have left the school officials open to criticism because of Agath being a nervous case.\n\nI have visited the School regularly and frequently, and at all hours, and I know of absolutely no grounds for the statement contained in the wire to the Department.\nW. Murison, Esq.,  \nApril 14, 1932\n\nRe: Agath Pascal\n\nAt present this girl is well nourished and appears healthy. Her nervous symptoms are aggravated by any excitement, and she will require further supervised rest and quietness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMedical Superintendent,\nQu'Appelle Indian Health Unit.\n\nW.

REGINA, SASK., 18th April, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nReferring to my telegram to you of the 12th instant, with reference to a complaint telegraphed in by Mr. E. G. Craig, of Fort Qu'Appelle, that Agatha Pascal, a pupil at the Qu'Appelle School, was imprisoned in bed, I might inform you that I have made full enquiries into this matter and I am satisfied that the report was not justified. I am enclosing herewith a report which I received concerning this girl from Doctor A. R. Simes, Medical Superintendent of the Fort Qu'Appelle Indian Health Unit, which speaks for itself.\n\nI might also inform you that I endeavored to get in touch with Mr. Craig, but have not been able to. A messenger was sent asking him to call me up as soon as possible. This he has not done. When visiting the Pasqua Reserve on the 16th instant, the grandfather of this girl, an Indian named Keeneecoose, asked me if I had heard anything from the Government regarding a complaint he had got a white man to send in for him with reference to the treatment of his grand-daughter, Agatha Pascal, at the Qu'Appelle School. This old man is very deaf and apparently did not understand what the Sisters told him regarding the reason for placing his grand-daughter in the Hospital. I explained the matter fully to him and he expressed himself as being satisfied with the explanation.\n\nI trust the foregoing will explain the situation to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

I have learned that there are no grounds for complaint in this connection. Mr. Inspector Murison, of Regina, writes that he has asked you to get in touch with him so that he can lay the facts before you.\n\nFor your information, I wish to quote from Mr. Murison's report of the 18th instant:\n\n\"When visiting the Pasqua Reserve on the 16th instant, the grandfather of this girl, an Indian named Kooseseewa, asked me if I had heard anything from the Government regarding a complaint he had got a white man to send in for him with reference to the treatment of his grand-daughter, Agatha Pascal, at the Qu'Appelle School. This old man is very deaf and apparently did not understand what the Sisters told him regarding the reason for placing his grand-daughter in the hospital. I explained the matter fully to him and he expressed himself as being satisfied with the explanation.\"\n\nDr. A. B. Simes, our Medical Superintendent, who sees this girl every day or two, has reported on the 14th instant as follows:\n\n\"During the first week of January, 1932, this girl was admitted to the School Hospital for observation and treatment on account of her appearance very nervous. A diagnosis of St. Vitus' Dance, a condition very rare among Indians, was finally made. By the end of the month there was marked improvement, and she was therefore discharged to return to the dormitory and classroom.\n\nLately, when it was noticed that there was a tendency for her nervous symptoms to return, Agatha was asked to attend school for only part of the day and to rest the remainder of the day in her own bed in the dormitory.\n\n\"I am informed by the Reverend Sister\n\nE. G. Craig, Esq.,\nFort Qu'Appelle,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSuperior that recently Agatha committed an act deserving punishment. The Reverend Sister in charge of the girls, instead of administering the usual methods of punishment, informed the girl that she would be denied the privilege of attending the school in concert with the other girls and must remain in her room in the dormitory. This, to me, was a very rational attitude to take. To have administered the usual method of punishment in her case possibly would not have accomplished the desired results, and might have left the school officials open to criticism because of Agatha being a nervous case.\n\n\"I have visited the school regularly and frequently and at all hours, and I know of absolutely no grounds for the statement contained in the wire to the Department.\n\n\"At present this girl is well nourished and appears healthy. Her nervous symptoms are aggravated by any excitement, and she will require further supervised rest and quietness.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nApril 22, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nI have your 314-11B of the 18th instant, with enclosures, concerning Agatha Paschal, pupil of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. I wish to thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Mr. Greig is receiving a letter from the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Sister Herman was in charge. Both she and the Sister were working at the mangle, one at each end. The mangle is equipped with a guard rail. The Sister noticed her putting her hand over the guard rail to push the clothes through and warned her twice against doing this. However she did it again and her hand caught in the mangle. When the Sister heard her scream she stopped the mangle immediately and called the engineer, who lifted up the mangle and released the girl's hand.\n\nNurse Oliver was in the school at the time and dressed the hand. The following morning Dr. Simes came and dressed it again and took the girl to File Hills Hospital where she remained about ten days and was then taken to the Grey Nuns Hospital, Regina, where her fingers were later amputated.\n\nI might mention that this mangle has been in use at this school for several years and all the girls are familiar with its operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFB.\nOttawa, May 18th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Department is now in receipt of a complete report regarding Florence McLeod's accident. It appears that this girl was working in the laundry on December 23rd, last, and that a member of the staff was in charge. Both the member of the staff and the girl were working at the mangle - one at each end. The mangle is equipped with a guard rail. The member of the staff noticed the girl putting her hand over the guard rail to push the clothes through and warned her twice against doing this. However, she did it again and her hand caught in the mangle. The girl screamed and the mangle was stopped immediately, and the engineer released the girl's hand.\n\nNurse Oliver was in the school at the time and dressed the hand, and the following morning Dr. Simes dressed it again and took the girl to the File Hills Hospital, where she remained about ten days, and was later taken to the Grey Nuns' Hospital, Regina, where her fingers were amputated.\n\nThe mangle at this school has been in use for several years, and all the girls are familiar with its operation. You will note from the above that there is a guard rail on the mangle and that a member of the staff was in charge of the girls who were working and had warned Florence McLeod not to put her hand over the guard rail. The Department feels that all the necessary precautions were taken, and, while the accident to Florence McLeod is regretted, it was through no fault of the school management.\n\nWilliam Hall, Esq., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Etc.,\nLemberg, Sask.\n\nA.

M. Doder, attended the ceremony on the occasion of his visit to the west, joined by Bishop Monahan, Murdock of the department of Indian affairs in the official opening.\n\nHistoric Site\n\nLast May, when the war blazed, Friday it was dedicated in brief ceremonies attended by heads of the Roman Catholic church in Saskatchewan, by fathers in the district surrounding the Lebret Mission and by Indians from the area.\n\nThe new school stands on the site of an old mission built some time ago. Behind it rise the hills of beautiful Qu'Appelle valley. Across the church grounds flows and in front lies Echo lake.\n\nCenturies of freedom stand as the nation of Father Huguenard, pioneer missionary who spent his life among the Red Men.\n\nInto this setting Friday went Cardinal Villeneuve, guest of a prince of the Roman Catholic church, accompanied by Bishop Monahan in his purple robes of office and others of the clergy.\n\nChildren of St. Gabriel's convent at Lebret and of the public school greeted the cardinal on his arrival, standing on the steps of Sacred Heart church. Flags in the pagan colors of gold and blue waved in the breeze and children sang \"God Bless You.\"\n\nBells in the church steeple clang out a welcome.\n\nChildren Sing\n\n\"That's very fine,\" said the cardinal, commenting on the children on their singing. Standing on the church steps nearest the dome were the children of St. Gabriel's clad in red, and wearing a mantle of blue with white cross.\n\nIn front of these, dressed the same and wearing a green sash were girls of the Holy Angels Children of Mary.\n\nSmall boys in red caps stood in front of these, members of the society of Holy Angels. Others dressed in red and white and black.\n\n(Continued on Page Two.)\n\nIndians Honor Cardinal\n\nIndian students paid honor to Cardinal Villeneuve on Friday when his eminence visited the new school at Lebret. The Indians, themselves, attended the distinguished visitor as he chatted with one of the sisters of the institution, Indian boys and girls grouped around them.\n\nCardinal Villeneuve spent the night at the Oblate residence near the school and the lake after attending a musical concert put on by the Indian students at the school.\n\nFRIDAY morning, the address were given in Sacred Heart church by Mr. F. P. O. Murray, chairman of the school board in French and by M. Salomon, school teacher in English.\n\nGuests at the banquet Friday night included Cardinal Car- dinal Villeneuve; His Excellency Archbishop Monahan; Regina; Bishop Murdock; Bishop Macdonald, Murr- der, Sask.; Mgr.

Edwards)\nDirector - Radio Service.\n\nSchools Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing copy of correspondence exchanged with Reverend M. de Bretagne, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask., in regard to the licensing of two radio receiving sets, used at the school for the entertainment of pupils and staff.\n\nIn reply I have to say that this is a new school building and was furnished throughout by the Department. The two radio receiving sets, while not purchased by this Department, are considered to be government property and form part of the equipment at the school. It is considered the Principal would be entitled to operate these sets without license.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. P. Edwards, Esq.,\nDirector - Radio Service,\nDepartment of Marine,\nOttawa.\nIn the basement of the main portion of the building are located pupil and staff dining rooms, boys and girls recreation rooms, toilets, baths, shower baths, etc. The rear wing contains the kitchen, scullery, cold storage room, laundry and boiler room.\n\nIt is worthy of mention that the basement of all Indian residential schools is practically a ground floor as the level of the basement floor is only 12 inches below grade, thus providing a maximum amount of light and ventilation. On the ground floor are located the class rooms, sewing room, staff bed rooms, offices, and a large chapel. There is also a large room for the accommodation of Indian parents when visiting their children. The first floor contains principally the dormitories, the Sisters' living quarters, and a few offices for administrative purposes. The second floor is entirely devoted to dormitories and a few staff bed rooms for supervision. The building is heated by steam and water supply and sewage disposal systems have also been installed.\n\nSTREAM FLOW IN MANITOBA AND NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014 Precipitation in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario during June was generally below normal as was also the run-off. In the southwestern portion of Manitoba the records of the Assiniboine river indicate that run-off was 36 per cent below the June average whilst in the area south of Winnipeg run-off, based upon the records of the Red river, was only 19 per cent of normal. The records of the Swan river indicate that in northern Manitoba run-off was 28 per cent below the average. The records of the English river indicate that run-off in northwestern Ontario was 3 per cent greater than the June average.\n\nThe mean outflow of the lake of the Woods during June was slightly greater than in May and the level of the lake lowered not quite two inches. The mean outflow from Lake Seul was only about one-third of the mean outflow for May and the lake level rose almost one and one-half feet. The average flow of the Winnipeg river in Manitoba was the same as during the previous month although towards the end of June the flow of the river was diminishing.\n\nThe levels of lakes Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Winnipegosiss were all from six to eight inches higher at the end of June than they were a year ago.\nNET INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS COMPLETED\n\nModern Structures Erected by Department of Indian Affairs For Education of Indian Children\n\nOttawa, Canada.\u2014Marked progress has been made in Canada in recent years in the extension and improvement of facilities for the education and vocational training of the Dominion's Indian population. New school buildings, modern in every respect, are replacing old structures and better qualified teachers and instructors are being attracted to the Indian schools. There are 79 residential schools, 276 day schools, and 10 combined Indian and white schools in operation under the supervision of Honourable T. A. Crerar, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and Minister of the Interior. Eighteen thousand Indian children in Canada are enrolled in the schools and of this number 8,900 are in residential schools.\n\nTwo of the most recently erected buildings of the residential school system are those at Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Lebret, Saskatchewan. These, like other schools under the Department of Indian Affairs, are operated in co-operation with the various church authorities engaged in Indian work, a method of carrying on the education of Canada's Indian youth which has worked out most satisfactorily.\n\nThe Shingwauk Indian Residential School at Sault Ste. Marie is conducted by the Church of England in Canada. The new building was opened on October 3, 1935, under the principalship of the Reverend C. E. Rivers, M.A., replacing that built in 1875 and is one of the finest in Canada. The school has accommodation for 150 pupils and staff and is steam-heated and fireproof throughout. The new building is of steel construction, with re-inforced concrete floors, tile partitions, steel stairs, and fireproof connecting doors. The outside walls are faced with brick and trimmed with stone. The main building is H-shaped, the centre portion being 80 feet long and the end wings 65 feet by 32 feet. The centre portion contains accommodation in the basement for dining rooms for the pupils and staff, boys and girls recreation rooms, toilets, baths, wash rooms, shower baths, etc. There is a wing at the rear approximately 70 feet by 50 feet which contains the kitchen, store rooms, boiler room, laundry, and cold storage. On the ground floor are located the class rooms, sewing room, and staff living quarters, together with a spacious assembly hall. The first and second floors contain the dormitories, clothing stores, staff bedrooms, and a well planned infirmary for the boys and girls.\n\nThe Lebret Indian Residential school in the Qu'Appelle valley of Saskatchewan was officially opened on May 29, 1936. The Oblate Order is associated with the Department of Indian Affairs in its management under the principalship of Rev. M. DeBreugnons, O.M.I. This school replaces that destroyed by fire in November, 1935, and provides accommodation for 250 pupils and the necessary staff. The building is of re-inforced concrete construction throughout. It has a frontage of 246 feet, with a rear extension 115 feet deep.\n\n(Continued on Sheet 326)\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 18, 1936.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the \"Canadian News Bulletin\", issued by the Department of the Interior, giving certain particulars regarding the two new residential school buildings, viz.: Shingwauk, Ont., and Lebret, Sask.

I may say that I have learned that there were one or two cases in the past and I understood that they were relatives of some Indians in Qu'Appelle Agency, and as the Bureau of Child Protection paid a slightly higher rate than the regular per capita grant and these payments became a part of the school funds the former Principal did not consider it was against the interests of the Indian Department.\n\nHowever, I assure you that no such cases have been in the school since I have been Principal, and in future no such cases will be admitted before receiving the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Fr De Bretagne, Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, in which he calls my attention to the fact that although he has over 250 children in his school, he is receiving the grant for only 235. In view of the fact that the school was built for 250 and that Fr De Bretagne was never told to recruit less than that number, would it not be possible for the Department to allow for the present fiscal year the grant for the number of children for which the school was built?\n\nFr De Bretagne points out that the school having been constructed for a pupilage of 250, it is uneconomical to operate it with less than that number. It is, in fact, quite impossible to manage without the full grant, as such expenses as heating, lighting and staffing are the same whether the enrollment is 235 or 250. Therefore it does seem that his claim for the payment of the grant for 250 is quite reasonable.\n\nHoping that you will take Father De Bretagne's request into serious consideration and will favorably act upon it, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We regret that the Department apparently overlooked our letter, as we had no reply to it.\n\nWhen the new school was built it was understood that it was to accommodate 250 pupils and we naturally supposed that the grant would be paid up to this amount. With this in mind we did considerable recruiting and have now reached this number of pupils. However on our last quarterly return the per capita grant was only paid for 235 pupils though our average attendance was over 240.\n\nAs you know we were paid up to 235 pupils in the old school and this school being larger with more modern conveniences necessarily means more expense to operate.\n\nWe trust that the Department will pay our next quarterly grant on a 250 pupil basis.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFB.\nApril 21st, 1937.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy Dear Mr Phelan,\n\nI notice by the returns of the March quarter that McIntosh is running quite below its authorized pupilage. As this condition may last during the balance of 1937, may I suggest that its pupilage be reduced by 5 and that the increase be given to Qu'Appelle. I am not proposing that this be made permanent as Qu'Appelle has been promised an increase of 15 pupils for the 1938-39 fiscal year. I can not but regret that this increase pupilage for the above school was not provided for in the current estimates. Had this been done, a change in the existing pupilage of McIntosh would have been necessary in order to provide increased revenue for Qu'Appelle.\n\nThe above is a suggestion and I am not over-pressing for its adoption but should you see fit to do so, the Qu'Appelle school would be materially benefited by the change.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDoctor Harold W. McGill, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nWhen plans were being prepared for the Lebret Indian Residential school, we requested that it be built for 250 pupils. Our request was granted and plans were made for a school to accommodate that number. We were therefore painfully surprised when we were informed that instead of funds being provided for a pupilage of 250, only 235 were provided for. This means that since the school was opened it has been short of 15 pupils and has suffered in consequence an annual loss in revenue of $2,550.00. This loss has been felt all the more in view of the cut in the grant of 15%, 10% and finally 5%.\n\nThe overhead at Lebret is absolutely the same whether the pupilage is 235 or whether it is 250. The only difference in expenses for the extra 15 pupils comes from the amount of food and clothing required to keep the extra 15. For any one who has any experience in the management of educational institutions, this extra cost is known to be very small in comparison of the lost revenue. We therefore hope that provision will be made in the supplementary estimates to provide for the full pupilage for which the school was built.\n\nHoping that you will consider our request favorably, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEDITORIAL\n\nA special newspaper, however small, seems to be very badly needed by our Indian population. To support this statement I can bring the following reasons: First, our Indians are brought up in our schools, with the knowledge of the English language, the ideals of the white people, and therefore it seems necessary to devise some means of following up with the civic and religious education, the rudiments of which were given in the school: a monthly, or better still, a weekly news bulletin, answers this need in part. Second, there is a widespread belief among Indians must be counteracted by the spread of truth; here again a paper can have a great influence on its readers: the different movements of the day need analysis and explanations which only a paper can give, on account of its frequency and facility of distribution. Third, our Indians have not, generally speaking, a very well developed sense of culture: a bulletin or newsheet, regularly distributed to them, might help them acquire a desire for information, a platform to express their views, wishes, and opinions, a medium for the authorities to teach civics, health and sanitation, moral advice, etc., to suggest divers means of bettering their lives. Fourth: in a paper such as ours aims to be, we seek to create a link between the parents and their children who are away from them for the greater part of the year, a link which the parents appreciate very much indeed. Fifth: the distribution of a specifically Catholic paper in the Indian homes is intended to teach two lessons: (1) the need of Catholic literature in the home, (2) the need of supplementing secular reading on Sundays with religious and devotional reading. Not only children, but adult Protestants belong to Sunday School classes, and every one goes home with a religious paper, which he or she is expected to read as a pious exercise.\n\nTrue Catholics, on the other hand, feel that they do not need a Catholic paper, because they attended denominational schools, where they had a course of religious instruction extending over many years. Yet they find themselves unable to answer questions asked about their religion by their friends, or about pagan practices which the Church disapproves, or about accusations directed against Catholics, occasionally, in secular papers or magazines.\n\nSchools are growing rapidly among people who are interested in questions and problems of the day. Now, a short sermon, attended by a few, or a conference given occasionally, does not suffice to instruct the minds in a sufficient degree to enable them to counteract all the errors and all the evils which are brought to the homes by the non-religious dailies or magazines.\n\nIn every Catholic school the children are taught to be obedient to all authority, both as well as ecclesiastical, and to be reverent, and to love GOD above all things, to love his neighbor as himself, and to cultivate habits of prayer.\n\nThe Catholic Press, especially, brings to the homes these same teachings. It is therefore the duty of all Catholic people to patronize the Catholic Press, and to read it, in order that they may learn the truth of what is happening in the Kingdom of Christ, co-extensive with the world. It is certainly unpardonable to read, with a family, the daily happenings of a secular nature and to be indifferent about learning what is happening in the world of religion. In reading the daily press, Catholic news, whether international or local, are often unintentionally distorted by non-Catholic reporters who do not very often comprehend the things behind the news.\n\nIn conclusion, we might express the wish that in our paper, we want the whole-hearted co-operation of all those who are able to give to us. We want to make this little paper as interesting and as useful as possible to those for whom it is intended. Every field: educational, religious, medical, historical, and even scientific (such as agriculture or home economics), will be given attention. The news element will be taken mostly from happenings at the Boarding Schools, and in the Missions, because the daily press, and other means of information can bring other news much sooner than a monthly bulletin.\n\nG.

It was not the wealthy civilization of the Aztecs which was destroyed and replaced in the XVIth century, when they came in conquest of Mexico. What impressed everyone at that time was the number of the two hundred or more temples of the Montezuma's city, dominated by the pyramidal temple of the sun-god, a pyramid which, according to its dimensions, red and thirty steps, were offered each year, thousands of human victims as a sacrifice. The whole life of the ancient, semi-pagan, spiritual and military, had religion for a dominating factor.\n\nIn the XVIIIth century, the first French missionaries reported carefully the beliefs, traditions and customs of the Indians of the prairies. Although their religious life did not allow them to build temples, but every detail shows that the old Indians were eminently religious. And this, in spite of many setbacks, the religious life was outstanding instance of what is called Tradition. As their languages, the beautiful and inflexible languages, the art of which is the astonishment of the white people, were kept from generation to generation without being written down, so their traditions were after thousands of years, still enlightened with the purity of natural religion and moral law and the last word of the primitive revelation made by God to the first man.\n\nAt least 5000 years before Moses ever wrote the first line of the Pentateuch, God gave to mankind a Revelation which was kept jealously by the Patriarchs. Yet, it is from that common treasury that all the nations have drawn their main lines of their religion. But, too often, History tells us that, with the exception of the Jews who had a special alliance with God, ignorance, breed, private interests, national pride and shameful passions had obscured and distorted the purest Revelation. God's holiness and immorality became the cancers of the religious, which, without the direct contact with God for the Jews, became what we call paganism.\n\nThe particular case of the Indians displays the antique beauty and the lamentable mistakes. They were sent in exile far away from the common Father of Heaven, sinful, yet longing for the lost Paradise in the longings for the land of their forefathers scattered over the world, differentiated in many races, under the variety of climates and ways of life, they remained bound by the same ideal and the same common belief. The white or the black, the red or the yellow possessed with their common origin the same common religiosity. But, only more among those who were in the best of the first Revelation are the Indians who kept a great deal of it. God, our Maker. Altruism, who provides, compassion who prophesies, need of prayer, of penance, of sacrifice; the cult of the dead; the necessity of morality and charity which have become overburdened with superstitious rites and magic, how it degenerated into bloody polytheism, how it lost the respect for the sacred, how it identified itself with immorality. Yet, the young Indians should respect their old peoples, pagan of the old type. If they do not laugh at them, they should explain to them what is right and what is wrong in their belief, and help them climb towards the Light. God, the Faith, the old pagan who is godly, who has seen the light, the Lord of Gods, but who through immorality, laziness, selfishness, a shameful and sinful life, has lost the faith, believes no more, has abandoned himself to paganism in his elders. The old dignity pagan is climbing the mountain toward the Light, the modern godless pagan is falling down away from God's spirituality.-Fr.

Her mother died when she was only three days old; when the child was two her father departed for the happy hunting grounds three years later.\n\nSo the Indian girl was left an orphan. She lived on her old miserable looking grandmother called Tewegan\u2014the Drum. This squaw was already seventy years of age, yet the great sorceress of the place.\n\nBoth of them, the child and her guardian, lived in an old shack, built some twenty-five years ago, on an elevation in the centre of the waters of Rainy Lake. Many others who escaped the fury of the waves were killed on the railroad track, running through the Couchiching reserve.\n\nOne winter afternoon, two Grey Nuns and the Missionary of the Fort Frances Indian Boarding School went out to visit the poor people of Scandijaming. It was in the middle of January, the weather was very cold and a heavy blanket of snow covered the forest and Rainy Lake. Everything looked dark there in the open space far away over the great lakes; a thick bush of poplar trees protected the village from the north wind. We could see a tiny streak of white smoke rising into the air from most of the houses. But one cabin seemed to be without smoke. The Indians were quiet. And what did we see there? In one of the corners of the old dilapidated shack, on a pile of green spruce branches, was lying a little girl. She cried when she saw us coming to her. With one hand, she covered...\nKitchitwa Joseph\n\nKekitch itai natose akimititi Nishapini- ke ki kitchikijilikitit mekitchitwa Joseph.

The child, in its extremities of the shaggy, on a wooden box, sat on an old squaw; the figure of a person, who once wore a woman's dress but was just one wrinkle away from being just like an Egyptian pachnichie. The old woman was smoking, not real tobacco but \"kilo\"; it was reputed to bark the Indians find in the bush.\n\nIn the middle of the floor stood the silent stone, an object of another sort; it had no feet; It was wood, the child and the savage, shivering, as there wasn't a piece of wood in the house. We were in the presence of two pictured pictures: Sisters, white and brown. But not less, because, in my long missionary career, I had more than once witnessed such scenes, and that which I could read in the Sisters' minds. I simply said to them: \"This is dire poverty. The only way to help these poor people is to take them both with us to the mission. There, we will feed them, cloth and heal them.\" Christian charity commands us to do so.\n\nWe hurriedly visited the other Indian houses; most of them were shabby looking huts, and in some cases, their occupants had very little food.\n\nThe hunters on the reserve were very few, so many of the men folks had died off. Generally, when a hunter had killed a moose or a caribou, the meat was immediately divided among all the members of the band; yet whoever was still for so many people! Most of them had only one \"bannock\" to eat.\n\nComing back to the lonely cabin of the sick girl, and looked at the two little sisters, went up to Kitchikons, wrapped her in a thick warm blanket and together brought her to the sleigh. The old woman, after feebly raising her eyes a pair of bear claws above her head, carrying the devil's drum and her medicine bag, started off for the mission. With a torn blanket thrown over her head, she smiled as she tried to get into our sleigh. At five o'clock that afternoon, our sleigh reach\u2014 ed the mission of Fort Frances.\n\nThe boys from the school had seen the two nonne carry out a mysterious operation. They noticed a once little girl under the heavy blanket; the pitiful sight excited their pity. A few of them started to Sisiq's carry Kictikons, the Little-Snow, into the school.\n\nTewagon and his grandmother Tewegen were brought into the infirmary of the institution, where they peacefully and happily spent the first night of their missionary ad\u2014\n\nventure.\n\nA.

We are very sorry however to see you have carried the article headed \"Hungry Indians cut off by snow as drifts reach new peaks.\"\n\nThe success of our work depends entirely upon our securing the confidence and co-operation of the Indians.\n\nThe fact that this article was carried by a paper issued by the Church will be accepted as proof by the Indians that this condition does exist, and will certainly not tend to assist, but rather to destroy the confidence of the Indians in our Department.

In the morning he and his entourage had visited the Indian village at Mallard Cove as guests of Dr. McNab and Mrs. McNab. There, too, Mrs. McNab, wife of Lieutenant-Governor A. P. McNab and Archbishop P. J. Mancini, Regent of the Order of St. John, joined the party.\n\nAfter lunching at the old fort with a visit to the new, modern Indian school at Lebret, run for the federal department of Indian Affairs by the French Oblate missionaries under Father Laviolette, they proceeded looking Father M. de Bretagne.\n\nAnd that Father de Bretagne came from France, culturally was discovered by a delighted Governor-General himself, who, however, happened to comment he had been given the name of Bretagne of France whereas the priest came, and had been given the name of Bretagne of Canada. Near Esthene, home of the de Bretagne family. Did he know them?\n\n\"I only wish my wife were here,\" said Father de Bretagne. \"She would love the Indians.\"\n\n\"I have the honor of being a Cree chief\u2014and chief of about ten thousand Indians,\" said he. \"I always feel that, as His Majesty's representative, I am responsible for the prosperity of the Indian people. I am delighted to think you feel this sympathy with me. You are doing the right one. As for you boys and girls, you are the future of the Canadian peoples. You have a real contribution to make to the prosperity of the country. You feel that Canada's record for Indian affairs has always been a creditable one.\"\n\nHe reminded the Governor-General that King Edward VI had always been interested in the young people, and as a young man himself, he would tell him the young people of Canada would be found anywhere in the empire.\n\nHis Excellency was taken on a tour of the building by Father de Bretagne, who pointed out the models painstakingly built to illustrate the first two schools churches erected in the valley, and the original Indian school destroyed by fire. He showed the school model, perfect even to the tiny stones of the basement, and the model of the school, representing the 1,100 work hours by students of the school on the opposite side of the lake.\n\nThe dinner proved an affair which was not spoiled by the winds that swept the valley. Course were paid by the visitors, especially N. T. Green, present- ing Secretary of State. Mr. Reed, governor-elect, also had dinner with the Governor-General for the playing of the Lebret Indian Band. The band was conducted by direction of Father Laviolette. The band won the eastern Saskatchewan festival and took second at the provincial festival in Regina, their first year of competition.\nSISTER ENDS 42 YEARS WITH INDIANS TO ENTER CONVENT\n\nLebret Grey Nun Who Arrived in Ricketty Wagon Leaves in Streamlined Car\n\nBy ANDY MCDERMOTT\n\nLEBRET, May 16\u2014It was spring. The wind blew fitfully across the prairies, stirring up dust that just blew the greening tall grass in a sea that stretched as far as the eye could reach. There were no houses or buildings to break the rolling distance.\n\nSister Marianne, just 27 and full of zeal and religious enthusiasm, sat with other members of the Grey Nuns in a rickety old wagon. They had been driving across a winding trail. Suddenly, before her was a beautiful view. Ahead lay the little settlement of Lebret, the place she had come to which she had pledged her life.\n\nSaturday evening, June 42 years later, Sister Marianne felt the weight of the growing years, sat with other members of the Grey Nuns as a beautifully riding motorcycle sped along the highway of the Qu'Appelle valley and mounted the smooth gravelled highway to the plains.\n\nIt was nearly dark when she looked down. Lebret was shining in the valley. A purple haze covered the valley. A fifth wheel stirred in the haze. There was some green here and there but a dark, stretch everywhere else.\n\nSister Marianne sighed, and turned at a nearby house, at the valley that had been her home for so long, for so many years.\n\nRetire To Pray\n\nFor Sister Marianne, who was going to St. Boniface and a well-earned retirement. For her, the work of many years, especially the Indians of the Qu'Appelle was ended. Her prayers would have to replace manual work.\n\nWhat she was thinking was not only about her own life. Dios she had hoped so long. Indian Head was not far away and there was a new, modern, streamlined train to take her swiftly eastward. It had been a busy day. The Sister Nuns with her were all of them very fond of Lord Tweedsmuir, the governor-general; how pleased the Canadian boys had played so well; how pleased His Excellency was at their success; how he had addressed presented to him; how he had taken such an interest in the children and talked with him.\n\nShe listened to their descriptions of him for she had not felt well enough to take part in the celebration she had seen many governors-general on visits to the school.\n\nAnd so Sister Marianne left Lebret for the Qu'Appelle valley and the convent, and the Indians she had come to love so much.\n\nThe Christian Cree\n\nShe smiled to herself as she looked at the Indians who rode in the same car. There was Sister McQuillan, superior of the convent.\n\nBut, it was neither at her, nor at Sister Marianne she looked. There, tending young ones, her teaching aid Sister Grey Eyes, a native Cree to whom the teachings of the Catholic Church appealed so much she, too, offered her life to God. That was her.\n\nSister Marianne sighed. She felt happily tired.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The son of Jean Hugonard and Francoise Rival. Joined the Oblates of Mary Immaculate October 18, 1873.\n\nOrdained to the Priesthood February 24, 1874. Arrived at St. Boniface May 23, 1874. Died February 11, 1917.\n\nFrom the date of his arrival at St. Boniface in 1874 until 1885 he was a Missionary among various Indian tribes in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nIn speaking to the Canadian Club of Regina on May 25, 1916, Rev. Father Hugonard spoke in part as follows regarding these early days:\n\n\"I am glad to congratulate you upon the interest you take in the Indians of this Province, and am honored in your having asked me to address you on the subject here today.\n\n\"I wish I had a better command of the English language to enable me to relate my experiences and impressions more interestingly, but the first language I had to learn when I came to this country in 1874, was that of the Cree Indians as there was no need for English then or for years afterwards.\n\n\"The Indians are no longer the lords of the prairie, having at last settled down on Reserves of their own selection; but forty-two years ago, with the exception of four Hudson Bay Officers and three Missionaries, the Indians and the Halfbreeds were the sole occupants of our beautiful plains and practically formed the whole population of Saskatchewan.\n\n\"In what I have to say, I shall chiefly confine myself to the Indians of the Southern part of Saskatchewan, mostly those grouped in Treaty No. 4 amongst whom I have spent the last forty-two years.\n\n\"In the old days what long trips we took through the prairie, when the only occupants were the Indians, antelope, buffalo and that disturber of the night, the coyote. I never expected them to turn into a huge bounding massness so quickly become vast fields of grain, intersected by railways, dotted with thriving villages and towns, and supporting a happy and progressive white population drawn to our fertile prairies from the four quarters of the globe, mingling together and becoming good citizens of Canada and the Empire. If some of us had chanced to camp or build our midday fire, thirty-five years ago, or even less, on the spot where this commodious clubhouse now rises, they would have been visionary enough to have expected in his lifetime to behold the flourishing City of Regina, this emporium of Saskatchewan, with its churches, schools, public buildings, parks, and magnificent Houses of Parliament; with its population of over forty thousand people, what white man would have believed such a dream, what Indian could have understood it in the least; to behold in one spot more people than these simple nomads had any conception of.\"\nRegarding Father Hugonard's first association with Indian educational work the Manitoba Free Press in its issue of February 21, 1894, contained an article reading in part as follows:\n\n\"During the Parliamentary Session of 1883-84 the late Sir John A. Macdonald, the Premier of Canada and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, without the solicitation of any religious denomination, advised Parliament to vote sufficient funds for the erection of three industrial schools for the education of Indian children in the Northwest. It was then decided that one of the three should be located at or near the Forks Qu'Appelle and as he considered that religious teaching would be essential to the success of the civilization of the Indian element he requested His Grace Archbishop Langehe of St. Boniface to recommend some person duly qualified for the position of Principal who would be acceptable to the Indians and who would strive earnestly to make the institution a success. Rev. Father Hugonard received the appointment as Principal when the erection of the Qu'Appelle Indian residential school was finished in the early part of 1885.\"\n\nRev.

In May we were summoned at Moose Jaw for the Provincial Festival and the Adjudicator pointed out to the audience the immense progress made by the Indians who were able today to compete in the classical music with any white musicians.\n\nOn the 25th it was the King's visit. We were asked only at the last minute by the Leader's Manager, Mr. Sweeney under the instigation of W.M. Graham who has always great interest in our School. There as elsewhere these Boys appear it is always a great success, they are very popular and sympathetic and I think it constitutes such a good advertisement for the efforts we do in the School to civilize them that it constitutes an asset as well for the acknowledgement by the public at large of the work done by the Department in the Education of Indian Children.\n\nI wish to send you some snapshots of the Band but you will not see of course the colour what constitutes a good part of its attraction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn the presence of the success obtained by them and their popularity, I wonder if you would see any objection that they accept an occasional invitation to take part in some picnic of nearby town or village under the reservation of course that it would not interfere too often with the routine of the classroom. I consider indeed that it does much good to our Boys to appear so in public and to learn how to behave in such occasions.\n\nOwing to the fact that you were a capital instrument in the foundation of that Band I thought you would like to hear about its good results.\n\nI remain yours very obediently,\n\nRev.

Father de Bretagne, the Principal, is a comparatively young man in his late 40's and the Assistant Principal, who is his brother, is a much younger man. There is also a young Father there who looks after the Missions. As this school had been \"in the hands of dead wood\" for so many years, it was encouraging to see new management there.\n\nI found the main building in a state of repair, furniture and furnishings all well kept, and I particularly noticed that if anything is out of order, it is immediately repaired. The same is to be said about the out-buildings, which are, of course, numerous at this Institution. I found everything in order wherever I went and a place for everything. During the past year an addition was put on one of the barns as the Principal informed me that they did not have enough room to take care of their cattle and horses. This addition was paid for from earnings and I also noticed in going around, that a great deal of repair work had been carried on during the last two or three years by the Principal and his staff. In fact the Principal informed me that he has purchased 6 carloads of lumber from the Coast since he took charge of the school.\n\nThe school has quite a number of cattle and many cows are milked to provide the children with all of the milk they require. The only time butter is made at the school is during the summer holidays, when the children are away. Both the horses and cattle are in good shape and the day I was there they were beefing fat cattle for winter use at the school. The school also farms a considerable amount of land but the crops were . . . .\nbut the crops were poor last Fall and the Principal informed me that he would have to buy potatoes before the Winter is over.\n\nFrom the information received during a chat with the Sister Superior and some of the teachers, I consider that the girls are getting a very good education and training in this school. However, I was surprised to learn that very little manual training is being taught to the boys, particularly since I have understood that a special effort was to have been made at the boarding schools to teach this subject. The children all looked well and out of 278 there were, I believe, only 3 who were laid up with colds. I checked the clothing that was supplied to the children and found that this was exceptionally good, with 4 and 5 changes of everything.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a very fine institution with a good staff. The Principal is an outstanding man and practical in all his work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

The school is operated by the Government, in cooperation with the Catholic Church, and has an authorized enrolment at this date of 250 pupils. An allowance of $170 per annum per pupil is granted by the Department. This allowance covers instructional costs and the food and clothing provided for the pupils.

Williams\nDear Sir,\n\nRe- Yours April 25th -\n\nIt is quite a long time since you extended to me the kindness of sending me a copy of the magazine \"Country Life\" of B.C. relating the activities of Lytton Indian Residential School, and I did not yet answer.\n\nThe reason of this letter is simply to let you know a little about our School that one day had the pleasure of receiving your visit and to which you seem always interested.\n\nI am still in bed, having fallen on a knee a month ago, and this prevented me to write to you sooner. However I try to keep our boat afloat in spite of the difficulties created by the War and the many losses in our Staff by departures to the Army. The day we find an opportunity to publish in the Press some data about our work as well as the Departmental help to carry it along, I will not miss it. The Leader of Regina however is very sympathetic to us, we never refused any invitation to participate with our Band to any of their public national or provincial festivities and the place here is well known throughout the Province. Lately we took our share in the musical competition and we picked up the first prize at the Festival, where we are registered in Military Band Class B. It is a very good result when we realize that our Boys are of an average of 13 and 14, the oldest being only 15. Rev. F. Laviolette deserves all the credit as well as our Teacher Mr. H. McCue.\n\nWe would have advertised by our participation to the local picnics if unhappily we were not quarantined.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI take the liberty to enclose a copy of the program of this Festival.\n\nI wish to report too the efforts of our members of the Staff working at the Farm. We have now a cow-stable that is a real advertisement for the Department by its appearance and its irreproachable cleanliness. The Health Inspector is already sending here visitors to show them what could be done in that line. The Boys have painted the inside of the barn reserved for the Cow stable in aluminium and gray, we extended a calf addition; we altered a part of another building in a farmer's residence. This last one is a pure Indian, one of our ex-pupils and he does better than any White Farmer we got before.\n\nThis last Winter we fixed a decent place for Ice-house and built another residence for an employee in the rest of a building that was of no use to the School.\n\nWe have employed for this work another Indian from Crooked Lake and our big Boys. We managed to do all this work without requesting any help from the Department to which we save a lots of money, we consider, if we would have been authorized to make that expenditure.\n\nOn our 3 lands we were badly in need of water in these last years, and we dug ourselves one dugout and succeeded to secure help for digging two others by the drag-line, what is an asset in this part of the country.\n\nI think that these details will be pleasing to you to hear. Hoping to have some time again you visit, I remain\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nR.A HOEY\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training - OTTAWA.\n\nRev.M de Bretagne O.M.I\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 5, 1947.\n\nDear Father de Bretagne:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein. It is a pleasure to note the steady progress that has been made at the Lebret Residential School in recent years.\n\nI am anxious that you should convey to the members of the Band the congratulations of the officials of this Branch for their achievement at the Musical Festival held at Indian Head, April 28 and 29. This accomplishment in my judgment reflects great credit, not only on the pupils but upon the teacher responsible for their instruction.\n\nI note you refer to the barn and to certain interior painting. I am anxious to know if you have been able to extend the barn buildings during the last year or two. If I remember correctly, you intimated to me at the time of my visit that it was your intention to do so.\n\nI was somewhat disturbed to learn of the injury to your knee. By the time this letter reaches you, it is my hope that you will be well on the way toward complete recovery.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev.

However, I did not report on this institution at that time.\n\nBuildings\n\nWhile I was at the school I went over the main buildings, equipment, and all out-buildings, and they were in first class shape.\n\nGeneral\n\nIn reporting on this institution there is not a single thing I can find fault with as it is the finest institution I have ever visited. I saw all of the children and I was particularly impressed with how well they were dressed, how well they looked, and how happy they were. I also took particular notice to see what the feelings were between the children and the staff, and everything that I saw seemed to be A 1. In other words the children did not seem to be afraid of anyone and I believe I am quite safe in saying that the children at this school spoke up better than I have ever heard them in an Indian institution. As you all know, the work of the Principal is outstanding and he also appears to have a very good staff.\n\nFarm Produce\n\nThey harvested a fine crop of grain this year, also all kinds of garden vegetables and potatoes were grown. The meat for this institution is all beefed there from the Shorthorn herd that they raise at the school. I also noticed pork, chickens, etc. in the refrigerator.\n\nI spent the forenoon from about 8.00 a.m. in the morning until 12.00 o'clock noon going around the cattle, horses, pigs, etc. and really it does one good to visit this place and see how Father de Bretagne carries on. Everything is in order and he is always making changes where he can bring about labour saving devices. His stock is of the best and I saw very fine horses, a herd of fine Holsteins, twenty-six of which were milking at the time I was there. He also has a Shorthorn herd for beef. There are fine bacon type hogs kept there, in fact all of the stock at the school seems to be of the very best.\n\nHis machinery is...........\nHis machinery, which is practically all new, is kept in an implement shed and is in first class shape.\n\nBy the appearance of the children I would say that they are well fed. Also, when you go around the storehouse, refrigerator, etc., and see all of the food lying around which is produced and provided right there at the school, such as beef, milk in large quantities, pork, ground flour, etc., you realize that this school can afford to feed its pupils well but that is just the difference between good management and poor management. I have seen schools where the opportunity was just as great as at Lebret but on account of mis-management they did not take advantage of their resources the way this man does.\n\nI did not start out to make a long-winded report but I feel that there is so much to tell about this school that is good that I would like to let other people know about it. The Government of Canada have every reason to feel proud of this school because it certainly is a splendid institution and Father de Bretagne and his staff deserve a great deal of credit for the work they have achieved.\n\nThe school was audited by Mr. Butchart, the Auditor, last Fall, and you have his report on this institution I believe.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nP. S. In the Fall I was down at Estevan to visit an English Flying School for the purpose of giving them a talk on Indians. This is a large school composed entirely of men from the British Isles, and some of the officers there seem to be greatly interested in Indians and wanted to know something more about how they were treated, their habits, etc. I have therefore arranged for the two senior officers there to visit Lebret some time in May and I feel that they will be very pleased with their visit.\nRegina, March 8, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nReport on Qu'Appelle Industrial School.\n\nI wish to inform you that I have just completed an inspection of the Qu'Appelle Industrial School at Lebret.\n\nI find that my last report on this institution was dated November 28th, 1940, but I was down there during the Summer of 1941 in company with Dr. McGill.

Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, reporting\non your recent inspection of the Qu'Appelle Resi-\ndential School. The officials of this Branch are\nvery pleased to learn that you found everything in\nsuch splendid condition.\n\nI note from the post script in your letter\nthat you are arranging to have some of the R.A.F.\nofficers from Estevan visit this school in May.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttention Mr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nReverend Father M. Lavigne, Provincial of the Oblates, Province of Manitoba, has advised me that it is his intention provided the Department gives its approval to appoint Rev. Father Paul Pich\u00e9 as Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian School to replace Rev. Father M. de Bretagne.\n\nIt is with a great deal of reluctance that Father Lavigne is taking this step but circumstances render it necessary, as Father de Bretagne must be given as complete a rest as possible. Later on, it is Father Lavigne's intention to appoint Father de Bretagne as General Lecturer for all our Indian Schools.\n\nRev. Father Pich\u00e9 who will succeed him can be recommended without the least hesitation for this post. He is Saskatchewan born and educated, having attended Gravelbourg College at Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan, and the Oblate Seminary at Lebret. He taught Holy Scripture in the latter Institution. Two years ago he was appointed principal and rector of our Junior College in Saint-Boniface. We had fully expected to leave him in charge of this Institution for several years, as he proved to be a good educationist. However, we consider that the Lebret School must have a first class man as director, and we have therefore chosen him for this post.\nIndian work and education are not quite new to Rev. Father Fich\u00e9, as he was a student at the Lebret Seminary, when the Qu'Appelle boys were there in residence after the fire which destroyed the school.\n\nWe have every confidence that Father Fich\u00e9 will prove to be a worthy successor to Rev. Father de Bretagne and that the excellent work done by the latter will be continued by him, and that the school will lose none of its prestige.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOF/SL\nThe Hon. R.A. Hoey  \nSupt. of Welfare and Training,  \nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret to notify you of the necessity wherein I am \nto withdraw Father Maurice de Bretagne as Principal of the In-\ndian school at Lebret. His health has been bad for a long time, \nand twice last winter he asked me to be removed.\n\nIt may be superfluous to praise him and the work he has ac-\ncomplished. It is there to be seen and is the favorable comment \nof all who happen to pass by.\n\nThe only difficulty was to find a man equal to the task he \nhas left. Thanks, God, I feel confident that I have the man. It is Fa-\nther Paul Pich\u00e9.\n\nThe main qualification of Father Pich\u00e9 is that he is an edu-\ncator 'par excellence'. He has it in him. I will throw him from \none of our main educational institutions where he was Superior. \nThe education of children is the object of his life and he is \nexceptionally popular with them.\n\nWith the Indians he has had experience, having done missiona-\nry work amongst them occasionally and is liked by them.\n\nAs for School's reliever, Father Jeannotte at Lestock, four \nyears ago for a few months and at different times taught music \nand different subjects at the School of Lebret.\n\nHe speaks English perfectly.\n\nHe is a man with nice manners and cordial disposition.\n\nI have no doubt that he will be a credit to the school as he \nhas always been to our Order.\n\nI am absolutely confident that he will fulfill the require-\nments of the department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Lavigne, O.M.I.  \n(Provincial)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\nOttawa, August 25, 1943.\n\nDear Father Lavigne:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 23, in which you notify me of the resignation of the Reverend Father Maurice de Bretagne from the principalship of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School, and in which you notify me of the nomination of his successor, Reverend Paul Piche.\n\nIt was with extreme regret that I learned of Father de Bretagne's ill health and resignation. The Lebret school is, as you know, a somewhat large institution and an institution at which the duties and responsibilities of the Principal are very exacting. Father de Bretagne has done excellent work at Lebret and has made a worthwhile contribution to the cause of Indian education over a period of years. I am anxious that you should convey to him our heartfelt thanks and our sense of appreciation. It is our hope that his health will be restored quickly and that he will not be wholly removed from missionary effort amongst the members of our Indian population.\n\nThe nomination by you of Father Piche is acceptable to the Department and approved. In view of the critical times in which we are living, I feel that we are fortunate in being able to secure the services of this young priest for the principalship at Lebret.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Paul Piche, O.M.I., as Principal of the Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School to replace Rev. M. de Bretagne, O.M.I. This change in the principalship of the Qu'Appelle School will take place immediately and I trust that you will give the new Principal every possible assistance.\n\nRev.

During Father de Bretagne's regime as principal he seeded down 250 acres of hay land on the farm which is situated on top of the hills. This was a step in the right direction as it was getting hard to procure hay in that part of the country.

Provencher, asked the Bishop of Montreal for Sisters, to teach and take care of the sick in the Colony. Msgr. Bourget asked the Grey Nuns to send volunteers. After a long and perilous journey, four Grey Nuns arrived in St. Boniface, on June 21, 1844.\n\nThey devoted themselves to the care of the souls and bodies of the population of the Colony. The Metis and Indians were, from the beginning, the particular object of their solicitude. Thus, in 1846, they received, as a New Year's gift from the Bishop, an aged Assiniboine woman who was entrusted to their care. Many Indians in the Colony have received hospitalization and religious instruction from the Sisters. When the Sioux fled to Canada after the Minnesota outbreak, the Grey Nuns looked after a great number of them, and gave generously of their meager provisions to the poor starving refugees.\n\nThe Grey Nuns came to Qu'Appelle Indian School in 1884; Sr. Lalumere was superior, accompanied by SSrs. St. Arnold and Bergeron. For sixty years they have worked at the education of the Indian children of the Qu'Appelle Valley.\n\nOther foundations of the Grey Nuns for the welfare of the Indians are: St. Albert, Alta., Fort Chipweyan, N.W.T., Kenora, Ont., Lestock, Sask., Fort Totten, N. Dak., Saddle Lake, Alta., Fort Francis, Ont., Forts Resolution, Smith, Simpson, Providence and Aklavik in the N.W. Territories, and recently, Berens River, Man.\n\nThe first Sister to join in the West was Sister Connolly; her mother was Indian. Now the Sisters of Indian origin number 13, three full-blood, and ten Metis.\n\nAD MULTOS ET FAUSTISSIMOS ANNOS!\nPROGRAM\n\nO CANADA\n\nLUSTSPIEL OVERTURE (Keler-Beln) ........................................

He was appointed at the Qu'Appelle Mission in 1874. Qu'Appelle (which takes its name from a beautiful Indian legend) was a fur trading post. Nearby, in the Valley, on the banks of the river, a Catholic Mission was established in 1865; its first resident priest was Fr. Decorby, who came in 1868.\n\nFather Hugonard was the founder and first principal of the first Indian industrial school in Canada. The Qu'Appelle Indian School was erected in 1884, by the Government of Canada, for the education of the Indians of Southern Saskatchewan (then Assiniboia). Fr. Hugonard died in 1917.\n\nQu'Appelle Indian School\n\nUnder the competent leadership of Father Hugonard, the school developed from 15 pupils in 1885 to 229 in 1894; boys were taught all manner of trades and girls were trained in domestic arts. The school attained a great reputation; it was visited by the Governor-General of Canada, and by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. The first school was destroyed by fire in 1904. The second one, built in 1905, was again gutted by fire in 1932. It was rebuilt through the efforts of Fr. G. Leonard, its principal (1919-1936), in 1934 and opened in the spring of 1936. Cardinal Villeneuve visited the school in 1936.\n\nA Mission Center\n\nSince the earliest times Qu'Appelle (now Lebret) has been a mission center for the Crees, Saulteux, Sioux and Assiniboines who live in Southern Saskatchewan.\n\nMay it live long and prosperous, and continue the work of christianization and civilization of the prairie Indians!\nMonday, May 29th\n\nDINNER  \n(Parish Hall)  \n5.30 p.m.\n\nENTERTAINMENT  \n(Parish Hall)  \n8 p.m.\n\nTuesday, May 30th\n\nPONTIFICAL HIGH MASS  \n(Parish Church)  \n9.30 a.m.\n\nALUMNI ASSOCIATION  \nELECTION OF OFFICERS  \n(Indian School)  \n2 p.m.\n\nEX-PUPILS' DINNER  \n(School Dining Rooms)  \n4.30 p.m.\n\nCONCERT BY THE INDIAN CHILDREN  \n(Parish Hall)  \n7.00 p.m.\nQU'APPELLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nLebret, Sask.\n\nMay 1944.\n\nDr. H.

It is unnecessary to state that I appreciate very fully the courtesy that prompted you to extend this invitation.\n\nMay I state that the House of Commons is still in session and that the estimates for this branch of the Government Service have not yet been passed? This means that my duties here will prevent me from leaving Ottawa at any time during the weeks immediately ahead of us.\n\nI hasten, however, to extend my personal congratulations to you and to the Sisters in charge of academic studies at the school, on the completion of long years of service in Indian educational effort. The Lebret school has come to be recognized as one of our outstanding Indian schools and one that has made an unusually fine contribution to the cause of Indian advancement since its establishment. Please accept, and convey to the members of your staff and to the pupils enrolled at the school my sincere personal regrets that a combination of circumstances prevents me from being with you on this historic occasion.\n\nI am today communicating with Mr. M. Christianson, Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina, asking him to represent the Indian Affairs Branch at the celebration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend Paul Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would be deeply appreciated, however, if you could find it convenient to be present and to represent the Indian Affairs Branch at the Dinner to be served in the Parish Hall at 5:30 P.M. on May 28.\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of the invitation, I informed the Principal that it was my intention to ask you to represent the Branch at the celebration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nMr. M.

There was one Archbishop from Regina and two Bishops there. All the Indian Department Agents and employees from the near by Agencies were also there. In last night's Leader, which you receive in Ottawa, there was a write-up on the celebration; therefore it will not be necessary for me to go into the matter any further, than that it was a great success.\n\nI might also mention that His Excellency, Archbishop Monahan of Regina, in his speech at the Banquet on the 29th gave our Department due credit for the way they had co-operated in every way with the Church in making it possible to have this fine school for the Indians in the Qu'Appelle valley.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

McGill,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nLebret Indian youngsters highlight Athlone trip\n\nBy KEN LIDDELL\n\nAbout 150 Indian boys and girls, dressed like 75 times twins and singing songs about the greatness of Canada, made a colorful picture at the base- ment of Lebret Indian school Saturday to highlight a Qu'Appelle Valley visit by Canada's governor-general, the Earl of Athlone, and Princess Alice.\n\nWithout a doubt the Indian students were the most unusual sight to greet the vice-regal party in a stormy visit to Qu'Appelle, Indian Head, Lebret and Fort San.\n\nRain came down all day long to make the journey far from a pleasure jaunt. Car tracks down the centre of highways were like two running rivers and the procession left a wake like a battleship. Facing the procession was an escort car, R.C.M.P., always watchful through a rain-speckled windshield to find out if the next spot was just a peculiar puddle or another pothole.\n\nEverything was damp except the spirits of the people of the towns visited. All had made elaborate arrangements for outdoor ceremonies, at the last moment arranged to move the crowds into town halls, theatres or schools.\n\nEverywhere the party was greeted with the traditional cheers, waving of flags. Everywhere there was the custom of presenting an address of welcome to the governor-general and Princess Alice. Almost only at Lebret Indian school was there any variation in this honored custom.\n\nThere, two Indian girls started out well with their reception notices but they got a bit mixed up. They offered the flowers to the Earl of Athlone and the address to Princess Alice.\n\nStraightened Out\n\nThe governor-general and the princess smiled, switched gifts and settled back to hear the Indian boys' band play a Strauss waltz.\n\nWearing raincoats and rubbers, with Princess Alice also carrying an umbrella when the drizzle turned to a steady rain, the distinguished visitors took their time when outdoors, didn't appear as worried by the weather as were their aides.\n\nWith the party were Mrs. A. P. McNab, Premier and Mrs. W. J. Patterson; Col. A. G. Styler, lieutenant-governor; Lieut. H. E. Droke, also an aide; Miss Anna McConnell, secretary; Assistant Commiss. M. A. R. Garnon, R.C.M.P.; Dr. F. H. Auld, deputy minister of agriculture; George Spence, director of P.F.R.A.; Sqn. Ldr. P. E. M. Leith, aide-de-camp to the governor-general; Miss Vera Grenfell, lady-in-waiting, and Sir Shuldham Redfern, B.C., V.O., secretary.\n\nFirst stop came at Qu'Appelle where 400 persons gathered in the school auditorium to greet the distinguished visitors. The Earl of Athlone inspected a guard of the Veterans' Civil Security Corps, under command of C. E. Stone, and the party was then escorted to the hall by Mayor Frank Amas.\n\nPrincess Alice's address was read to the governor-general while Shirley Serr presented a bouquet to Princess Alice.\n\nCouncil Members Presented\n\nMembers of the town and municipal councils presented to the visitors included Mr. and Mrs. E. Krauter, Mr. and Mrs. T. H. Ellis, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Kraus, Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Stone, Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. Alex Ferguson, Reeve W. H. Acres.\n\nAlso presented was J. H. Smith, chairman of the school board, and Mr. Hamblin, H. J. Wilson, representing the Red Cross, and Mrs. A. G. Rawlinson, the Red Cross auxiliary.\nAt Indian Head the auditorium theatre was crowded long before the party arrived. On the side-walk outdoors stood a group of veterans of the service corps under J. Adair and in the lobby a guard of No. 47 Indian Head squadron of air cadets under P.O. W. F. Christian.\n\nThe party sat on a platform below the stage while as a backdrop there were four girls standing on the stage each holding a large Union Jack. They were Kay McKnight, Beth Nichols, Louise Fisher and Helen Wilson.\n\n**Sons in Services**\n\nIn that setting Mayor A. Adair, who greeted the visitors with Mrs. Adair, delivered a address of welcome and later presented Mrs. C. Hubbs, 60-year-old pioneer, and mothers who have at least four sons serving, including Mrs. A. Bois, Mrs. T. M. McLellan, Mrs. J. S. Hamilton, Mrs. Ed Barnes, Mrs. M. H. Allen, Mrs. T. Nichols, Mrs. H. L. Pickering, Mrs. M. Thompson and Mrs. H. Glass. Between them their families have contributed 42 outstanding services. Also presented was Dan McDonald, president of the Canadian Legion and Mrs. McDonald.\n\nInvited to the ceremony but unable to attend was Mrs. E. J. Brooks, 92, whose husband served in the Riel rebellion and on the Riel jury.\n\nFrom the auditorium the party proceeded to the Dominion forestry farm near Indian Head where a luncheon was served with Major Walker acting as host. The rain spoilt plans for a luncheon on the lawns. From there, the party went to the Dominion experimental farm where the members were shown around by W. H. Gibson.\n\nThe party then back-tracked through Qu'Appelle to Lebret where they were greeted at the Indian school by M. Christianson, Regina, superintendent of Indian agencies, and Fr. Fiche, school principal. Fr. Laviolette, Mrs. A. B. Symonds and Mrs. Clayton Hall.\n\nThere, in the auditorium, the most colorful episode of the trip awaited the party. In the centre was the Indian boys' band. Seated in front of the band, at the feet of the governor-general and Princess Alice, were Indian children in their native costumes, faces painted and feathers in their hair.\n\nOn one side, looking like a painted backdrop, a solid picture of similarity, were about 75 Indian girls, colorful in red dresses and white caps; the Indians practically all the same. On the other side were about the same number of Indian boys, each wearing blue and red windbreakers.\n\n**Colorful Picture**\n\nThese children stood as motionless as rocks until they sang two choruses of \"The Welcome Song\" and \"Ring Ye Bells of Canada.\" It looked like a picture on a screen as their mouths opened at the same time, their heads nodded this way and that in unison. Then the conductor raised his baton for the last note and the stone-like faces were there again.\n\nAn address of welcome was read by Miss Alma Dumont, a student, who referred to the pleasure the Indian children experienced in 1939 when they saw King George and Queen Elizabeth in Regina. A bouquet was presented by another student, Eunice Stanley.\n\nIn replying the governor-general said he did at the other gatherings addressed his remarks principally to the children. He urged them to study and work hard at school. He told them that when they left school they would gain valuable experience but they...\ncould not go back and regain the background which schooling would give them.\n\nAs he had at Qu'Appelle and Indian Head, he brought cheers from the children when he told them they would have a school holiday on Monday as a souvenir of the visit.\n\nFort San Final Call\n\nFinal call came at Fort San and there members of several organizations, after spending two hours huddled in cars or verandahs of houses awaiting the party, formed a guard of honor in the rain.\n\nLined on the driveway to the San were the Scouts' Summer Corps of the district under M. Crosby of Balcarres; the boys' cadet corps, carrying rifles, under M. P. Smith of Fort San; the girls' cadet corps, trim in khaki, forming the Queen Bessie of Fort Qu'Appelle; members of the Allied Post club, under Joan Hall, secretary, and Violet Smart, president, and members of the I.O.D.E., under Gertrude Grass, regent.\n\nRain Makes No Difference\n\nBy this time the rain was tumbling down but the governor-general and Princess Alice took their time making those in charge of the various groups, walking through the ranks.\n\nPrincess Alice seemed particularly interested in meeting members of the Allied Post club of which she is honorary president for Canada. The club, with branches throughout the Dominion, sends comforts to men overseas.\n\nThe party was then escorted to one of the San buildings where Dr. R. C. Ferguson introduced ex-servicemen patients, and an inspection was made of other buildings.\n\nA visit had been planned to the dairy farm of Ernest Strawick but this was not made because of road conditions.\n\nTo conclude the day the entire party were guests of Dr. and Mrs. Ferguson at a buffet supper. Afterwards, members of the Fort San staff were presented.\n\nThe party then slipped back to Regina.\nIndians mark early arrival\n\nLEBRET, Sask., April 21 (Special)\u2014Centenary of the coming of the Oblate Fathers to the west was marked at the Indian school here April 18, with a commemorative program. Fr. Piche, principal of Lebret Indian school, celebrated mass in the morning for the opening ceremonies.\n\nIn the afternoon the program directed by the Grey Nuns was highlighted by scenes from the lives of the Oblate missionaries, depicted by pupils of the school. The Indian Band provided the musical part of the program. This was followed by a banquet attended by the priests of Lebret, the Oblate Sisters, school priests and students, and members of the Oblate congregation from adjacent points to Lebret.\n\nThe day concluded with the solemn benediction of the Blessed Sacrament in the school chapel.\nIndian Residential School\nLebret, Saskatchewan\n\nJune 28th 1945.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nI wish to express my sincere thanks to the Indian Affairs Branch for the permission to close the School on June 20th.

F. Pratt, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary to the\nMinister of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nThe Minister is in receipt of representations from Father P. Piche, Principal of Qu'Appelle Indian Industrial School, Lebret, Saskatchewan, in which he states that the grant which they are receiving at the present time from your Department is for 250 pupils only. He points out that they have had to keep an extra number of pupils during the past eight years to meet the obligation of the Government to provide for the Indian children's education in that district, and as they had limited the attendance to 250 pupils more than 130 children from the surrounding reserves would have been left without education.\n\nHe points out that the Indian population is rapidly increasing and they have been forced to limit the number of pupils to 275 during the past few years. They therefore had to postpone the admission of many children of seven and eight years of age.\n\nFather Piche states that while the school was built for 250 pupils they can accommodate 275 and is now requesting that your Department reconsider the grant with a view to increasing it to cover 275.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.

M. Allan, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R. E. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn my return from my visit of the Alberta schools, I was asked to stop at Lebret to look over the present needs of the school with the Principal.\n\nIt will be interesting for you to know that Family Allowances seem to have had no adverse effect, whatsoever, on their recruiting as they have at the present time 232 children. This is 32 above the number authorized and paid for.\n\nIn view of the fact that the school has ample space to accommodate the number now present, the Principal has asked me to request that an increase of the authorized pupilage be made immediately and become effective as of October lst. I believe that this school has carried that extra pupilage for the past several years without asking an increase, but it cannot carry on any longer without receiving extra compensation for the very substantial outlay which has to be provided for these 30 odd extra pupils.\n\nI understand that the Principal has requested Honourable Gardiner to present his demand to your office. It is possible that this has already been done. In that case, I hope you will consider the present letter as corroborating what Mr. Gardiner may have stated to your Department.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, October 30, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nQu'Appelle Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Melville, Sask.\n\nThe present authorized pupilage at this school is 250. During the past few years the school population in the agencies served by this large residential school has apparently increased, as each year the school has been obliged to accept more pupils than the number officially authorized.\n\nAt the present date this school has 282 pupils and I am informed that practically all these children have been sent in voluntarily. Reports received from our officials indicate that excellent work is being done at the school, and from the large enrolment it is quite evident that the Indians are satisfied with it. A request has been received to increase the authorized pupilage from 250 to 280, and I would appreciate it if the Minister would approve the increased number, effective October 1, 1945. Funds for the purpose are available in the current year's appropriation.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Mr. Hoey -\n\nRe - Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School - Your File 114-0-1.\n\nI have discussed with the Minister your memorandum of the 30th ultimo in the above matter. Before approving of your memorandum the Minister thought that he would like to know whether many other similar requests will be made. The proposed increase in pupilage for the above school will mean an increase in your vote and if granted will likely result in other applications being received which in the end would materially increase the cost of the grants paid for Residential School training.\n\nThe Minister inquired if any consideration had been given to providing improved Day School training to some of the Indians in the area which is now served by this Residential School.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, November 6, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith a request for an increase in the authorized enrolment at the Sacred Heart Indian Residential School, Peigan, Alberta, and St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, New Westminster, British Columbia.\n\nIn this connection, may I refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of November 2nd, in which he asks if consideration has been given to the establishment of improved Indian Day Schools on the reserves from which Residential School pupils are recruited. The records indicate that an educational survey was undertaken at the Peigan Reserve by Mr. Doucet about three years ago. Mr. Doucet, in his report, stated that the condition of the roads on the reserve, the scattered settlements and climatic conditions, in his judgment, render the operation of an Indian Day School impracticable. No educational survey, so far as I am aware, has been made at St'Appelle or at St. Mary's Mission at any time since I entered the department. I am of the opinion, however, that the need for thorough educational surveys at Residential Schools and on reserves throughout the Dominion is becoming a matter of considerable urgency. Should such surveys be undertaken, however, at the earliest possible date and should it be decided to establish improved Day Schools on a number of reserves, it is not at all likely that these schools could be established and in operation at any time within the next two years; in the meantime, our Indian Agents in the administration of Family Allowances are called upon to certify that educational facilities are not available for groups of Indian pupils before such pupils or their parents qualify for allowances under the Family Allowance Act.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAllowance Act. It is somewhat difficult for an Agent to do this if he is aware that space is available at Residential Schools in his Agency. The Qu'Appelle School is a spacious building, fully fireproof and is capable of providing instruction for at least 265 pupils; as a matter of fact, they have 280 pupils enrolled at this date.\n\nSt. Mary's Mission is a Church-owned school and the Principal and Father Scannell, who discussed the enrolment of this school with me recently, assured me that they had ample accommodation for 310 pupils, with 185 enrolled at that date.\n\nThe Peigan School is a Government-owned school with a comparatively small enrolment of fifty pupils. I notice from the last audit report that a large staff is employed at this school, which, if reduced, would no doubt enable them to enrol an additional fifteen pupils.\n\nMay I suggest that consideration be given to these requests on the understanding that thorough educational surveys will be undertaken on the reserves served by these institutions just as soon as officials qualified to undertake this work are available. While funds are available for this increased enrolment in the present fiscal year, these requests if granted would mean an additional expenditure during the fiscal year 1946-47 of approximately $20,000.00. Such requests, if granted, should also be granted on the understanding that the authorized pupilage at each of these schools may be substantially reduced just as soon as improved Day School accommodation can be provided. This decision on the part of the Department would discourage or tend to discourage the building of additional classrooms to accommodate pupils who may be seeking enrolment during the next two or three-year period.\n\nDirector.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNOV. 5, 1945\n\nRequest for increased pupilage at Qu'Appelle Indian Res.

I wish to state here that they have at present a splendid shop. It will, however, require interior decorating which they hope to be able to do before the opening of the school next September. There are three Manual Training Instructors at this school. The problem of integration is rather different when the Instructors have not been trained for this work, (one of the Instructors followed the course given by the Department last November).\n\nThis school has a good start and I hope that by next visit the improvements will be more prominent. It must be kept in mind that the shop was repaired by the pupils themselves. Greater benefits would have been obtained from this work if the Mathematics, etc had been integrated to a greater extent. It was, however, as far as it went very good training for the young people and I wish to state again that they have made a good job of their shop. I have encouraged a qualified teacher at this school to attend the general shop course to be given in Brandon or Winnipeg this summer.\n\nThe Manual Training students deserve commendation for the work done on their shop. This was good training for them. More planning, however, should have been done by the pupils themselves. In fact, a class discussion followed by a sketch of the situation would have brought into play many educational factors. The pupils plan to paint the interior of their shop this fall.\n\nThere are three Instructors employed at this school. One of these assisted at the short course given by the Department last November. The problem of integration is rather difficult when the Instructors have no training for this work.\n\nA.J. DOUGET.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 28, 1946.\n\nRev. Fr. P.

The information that we have available regarding the Qu'Appelle School indicates that there are the following dormitories:\n\nA. Boys  \n   72x30x11  \n   30x30x11  \n   72x30x11\n\nB.

As you know, the Department desires to have in each dormitory, 500 cubic feet of air space per pupil. This would mean that there is air space for approximately two hundred and forty-five pupils in the six dormitories mentioned above.\n\nOur reason for increasing the pupilage a year ago and thereby reducing the air space per pupil was due to our knowledge of the fact that the Qu'Appelle School is a comparatively new building and the dormitories are probably more airy than in older buildings. However, at the present time we feel that we have authorized as many pupils as the school should accommodate.\nWe will be glad to have any representations in the matter that you care to make.

However, as there are still children in our district who are not attending school, I feel that provision should be made for their education.\n\nI noticed in your figures of air space of our dormitories, that you did not take into consideration the additional area which extends 20 ft on the width of 30 ft. In the Senior Girls dormitory as this space is not needed for beds, we use it now as cloak room.\n\nIn the three dormitories for the girls, we have the following number of cubic feet:\n\nSenior Girls dormitory:\nMain area... 72x30x11\nCorridor... 15x4x11\nAddition area in the wing: 30x20x11\nAir space for approx. 62 girls.

We greatly appreciate this favor.\n\nWe are completing our catechism survey and the analysis of the two Catholic Readers (Faith and Freedom and Cathedral Basic Readers). We hope to be able to send you the results of our studies in a near future.\n\nI am pleased to send you under separate cover, a copy of a work done by one of our teachers, Mr. F. Verreault B.A., on local history. The aim of this work is to have the pupils more interested in Social Studies. They begin with a study of the Qu'Appelle Valley and the Indian Reservations and work outwards to a study of the province of Saskatchewan and then a study of Canada. We feel that this experimental Social Studies course will appeal more to the pupils than the regular book of Social Studies. Our inspector, Mr. Gould was very much interested in this course and wants to submit it to the curriculum director of the Province.\n\nThe choice of our school for the Cooks' Course which is planned for this summer, honors us. Miss Lock of the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Health and Welfare has visited our school on May 8th and 9th and preparation for this course has been discussed. The Indian Affairs Branch may rest assured that we will give our full cooperation to make of this course a success. It should be of a great benefit for all the schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nP.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSir:\n\nAbout seven years ago the Indian Affairs Branch organised, under the direction of Mr. A. Deucet, Vocational Training Courses for the boys and girls of the Indian Schools. The program of training was enthusiastically accepted by everyone concerned, because they saw in this program an answer to the needs of Indian youth.\n\nThe three-year vocational training course has proven successful in all our schools in regards to domestic training for the girls. But we regret that the vocational training courses for the boys have not met with the same success. The Principals of our Indian schools are unanimous in attributing this partial success to the following causes:\n\n1. The premature age at which the pupils were expected to receive this training. (It is usually given in white schools to pupils aged 15 and over, or after Grade 8. How can one expect pupils under 16 to follow school work and vocational training simultaneously with success.\n\n2. The difficulty in organising efficient courses in\nthe smaller schools. A competent instructor is necessary for each of the major courses; in a school of about 100 pupils the number of boys who can take vocational training does not justify hiring several competent instructors; it is practically impossible to find one instructor competent to teach all the courses; necessarily the training given the boys in small schools cannot fulfill the desires of the Indian Affairs Branch officials.\n\nA TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\nTo give an adequate vocational training to the Indian boys we propose to the Indian Affairs Branch the establishment of an Indian Technical High School in the premises occupied by the Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret, Sask.\n\nThis Indian Technical School would admit pupils from all the Indian Schools in the Prairie Provinces. Such a school would answer the numerous requests made by the Indian parents who desire technical training for their children.\n\nA large number of pupils have also expressed the same desire. A recent survey made at the Lebret Indian School shows that out of 22 boys (Grades 7 and 8):\n12 wish to be trained in agriculture and mechanics\n6 asked for carpentry training\n1 wanted to be a shoemaker\n3 wanted to continue their regular studies in the higher grades.\n\nSince there are few other industries but agriculture in the prairie Provinces this explains why the majority of pupils want training in mechanized farming.\n\nThere is a possible field for the boys trained in carpentry in the projected housing program on the reserves.\n\nThe proposed establishment of a technical High School would answer the often repeated pleas of the witnesses who appeared at the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\nCf.

We are aware that the goal of education is their eventual assimilation but for the majority of Indians it is not possible to achieve this aim while the pupils are still in a formative stage. As the teachers would not easily understand and adapt themselves to the psychology of the Indian, this would be detrimental to the Indian pupils.\n\nAssimilation cannot be achieved by intermingling Indians and whites, but by the gradual uplift of the Indian cultural social and economic standards through education and welfare work. The proposed Indian technical High School would strive to attain to these higher standards.\nThe Qu'Appelle Indian School at Lebret is ideally located and equipped for the establishment of the proposed central technical High School:\n\n1. It has 7 classrooms, a large farm, well-equipped shops, a dairy herd, etc.\n\n2. It is located in the center of the Prairie Provinces; it is served by two daily trains and bus routes; it is on a main highway; near the Indian Hospital at Fort-Qu'Appelle; hockey and baseball leagues are organized with neighboring towns (Indians Head, Fort-Qu'Appelle, Qu'Appelle, Balcarres, et al.)\n\n3. It has adequate housing for staff and personnel.\n\nThe main building of the Qu'Appelle Indian School could not possibly accommodate more pupils than at present (300). The establishment of this proposed school would require additional accommodation for the younger pupils. To provide for this accommodation the Oblate Fathers are willing to dispose of the Lebret Seminary, (which could house between 150 to 200 pupils), either by renting or selling it to the Indian Affairs Branch.\nThe main building of the Seminary has 4 stories, it is over 200 feet long and 50 feet deep, with a 3-storey wing 100 x 30, there is a two storey annex connected with the main building. The entire building is equipped with automatic sprinklers which provide for adequate fire protection. It has a fully equipped kitchen, several outbuildings, a dairy barn, shop, gardens, playgrounds, etc... (Cf. Plans of the building)\n\nThe Seminary building would be under the same administration as those attending the technical High School: one Principal and one bursar. The Sisters would perform the same duties in both establishments. Vocational training for the girls would continue as previously. To answer the desires of the pupils who wish to take the regular High School studies new classrooms would be opened as required; the pupils of other Indian schools would be admitted to the regular High School courses.\n\nSpecial training would be given in Field-Nursing (according to the Manitoba curriculum), to provide for the need of practical nurses both in Indian hospitals and in nursing stations.\n\n**TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM**\n\n1. A complete course in agriculture (three years):\n   a) care handling, management, feeding, breeding, and judging of all classes of livestock.\n   b) Judging of all classes of grain for seed purposes.\n   c) Identification of weeds and weed-seeds.\n   d) Study of soils, crops and crop rotation.\n2. As adjuncts to the agricultural course:\n   a) mechanics\n   b) poultrying\n   c) gardening\n   d) metal work & blacksmithing (farm machinery repairs)\n\n3. A complete carpentry course (3 years) as outlined in the actual Indian Affairs Branch program.\n\n4. Special courses:\n   a) engineering\n   b) shoemaking, harness repairing\n\n5. Classroom subjects:\n   a) English\n   b) social studies\n   c) health\n   d) vocational guidance.\n\n(Note): Short courses could be given ex-pupils during the winter months, in agriculture and mechanics.\nThe special advantages of this project are:\n\n1. It provides for both adequate vocational training,\n   and regular High School courses.\n\n2. It would be economical to operate, because of one\n   management.\n\n3. The use of the Seminary would provide for the immediate\n   accommodation required, thus a new construction would\n   not be necessary.\n\n4. The younger pupils would have the added stimulus of\n   looking forward to technical school training.\n\nIn putting forward this project we hope to fulfill the desires\nof the Indian Affairs Branch in promoting the educational advancement\nof the Indians of the Prairie Provinces.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The program of training was enthusiastically accepted by everyone concerned, because they saw in this program an answer to the needs of Indian youth.\n\nThe three-year vocational training course has proven successful in all our schools in regards to domestic training for the girls. But we regret that the vocational training courses for the boys have not met with the same success. The Principals of our Indian schools are unanimous in attributing this partial success to the following causes:\n\n1. The premature age at which the pupils were expected to receive this training. (It is usually given in white schools to pupils aged 15 and over, or after grade 6. How can one expect pupils under 16 to follow school work and vocational training with success simultaneously?\n\n2. The difficulty in organizing efficient courses in the smaller schools. A competent instructor is necessary for each of the major courses; in a school of about 100 pupils the number of boys who can take vocational training does not justify hiring several competent instructors; it is practically impossible to find one instructor competent to teach all the courses; necessarily the training given the boys in small schools cannot fulfill the desires of the Indian Affairs Branch officials.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Adams\nPrivate Secretary\nOttawa, October 9, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Proposed Technical School - Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Adams' memorandum of October 6 with reference to the above.\n\nOur memorandum of June 25, 1948, outlined the situation to that date. Since that time we received a copy of a letter which was forwarded by Reverend P. Schaeffer, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, to the Principal of the present Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School. Father Piehe left this letter in our Branch when he visited the Education Division during the month of August. I enclose copy of this communication for your information.\n\nAs mentioned in Mr. Adams' memorandum, the Donald Inspection Limited were requested to have their engineer inspect the building but we have not yet received any report from this firm.\n\nI wish to direct your special attention to the last paragraph of our memorandum of June 25. Before a final decision is made, I feel that it is most important to determine the number of graduates from our Indian day and residential schools in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba who might take advantage of the technical courses proposed at Lebret. Our Educational Survey Officer has been extremely busy all year in connection with our program for the erection of new day schools and while he made some enquiries regarding the proposed technical school when he was in the West in July, the information that he received is not yet sufficiently definite. He is leaving for Saskatchewan and Alberta next week and is being directed to forward us a report before the end of the current month. As soon as his report and the report of the Donald Inspection Ltd. are received, they will be brought to your attention.\n\nActing Director.\nQU'Appelle Indian Residential School\nLebret, Sask.\nNovember 16th 1948.\n\nMr. J.M. McKay\nDirector of Indian Affairs\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McKay,\n\nI recall with pleasure having met you last July in Mr. Hoey's office, and I rejoice at your recent appointment as Director of the Indian Affairs Branch. My most sincere congratulations.\n\nI have learn with great satisfaction that one of your first acts as Director of Indian Affairs Branch was to increase the school grant. It is certainly in accordance with the higher cost of living. But I am very sorry, Mr. McKay, to inform you that according to the last grant received recently, our school has been omitted for this increase. I would greatly appreciate your attention on this matter. It is our ambition to keep the standard established by the Department in this school.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nRev. Paul Piche O.M.I.\nPrincipal,\nQU'Appelle Indian Residential School,\nLebret, Sask.\nOTTAWA, December 1, 1948.\n\nRev. Paul Piche, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Residential School,\nLebret, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Father Piche:\n\nI have received your letter of November 16th and should like to thank you very much for your congratulations and good wishes on the advancement received by me in this service. I greatly appreciate receiving this kind message from you.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the per capita grant rate at the Qu'Appelle School and quite understand your anxiety in this regard. You will be interested to know that this matter is under consideration at present and as soon as a definite decision is made the information will be passed on to you without delay.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Director.\n\nDMM/BM\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 15th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this day of 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 15th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 15th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby verify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 15th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red Appellee Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 10th, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at this [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForms No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the La Cappelle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Appellee Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFont No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at this [Date] 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [December 31st, 1944].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: [January 15th, 1945]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis .................................................. 19 ....\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 15th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nthis: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 2nd 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 3rd 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School name] School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [Sept. 30th, 1945].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Oct. 4th, 1945]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ____________________________\n\nthis ____________________________ 19 _____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 405\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 4th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 7th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 7th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QUAPPPELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LEBRET School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QU'APPELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LEBRET School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return, and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance QU'APPELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL LEBRET and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QU'APPHELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LEBRET School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 15th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QU'APPELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LEBRET School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 15th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 15th 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QU'APPHELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LESBRET School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the QU'APPHELLE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL, LEBREY School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at this School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered for the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Appelle Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Dec. 31st 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 10\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: December 31st, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [December 31st, 1946].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: [December 31st, 1946]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [this date, 1946]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 11, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 468\nReop.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended [March 31st, 19__].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated ____________________________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition, etc., of the pupils attending the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 3rd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return, and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [date].\n\nPrincipal [signature]\n\nDated [date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [location]\n\nthis [date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I A. 403\nRepr.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Ignatius School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 3rd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red Appelle Res.] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 4th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 4th, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [In Appelle Res.] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 4th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red Apple] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 4, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the La Cappelle R.C.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 5, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 5, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence, all pupils entered for the Return and included by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of Indian Residential School] for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...QU'Appelle Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended...June 30,...1948.\n\nPrincipal...\n\nDated...July 9,...1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...this...19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Roll, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, as ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter in which pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 17, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

(RG 10, Volume 6327, file 660-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 6, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 6, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nthis [Month] 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by noting the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red River Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 6, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 6, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Month] 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Appellee Residential School] School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 4, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended [January 30, 1949].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [January 4, 1949]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1095            | Charles Kaisawatum    | 12\u00bd | 1   |      | Piapot          | 3             |                   |                        | 2-9-45                     | 91         | At hospital Discharge applied for.                                                             |\n| 1096            | Robert Desjarlais     | 11\u00bd | 1   |      |                 | 4             |                   |                        | 2-9-45                     | 91         |                                                                                               |\n| 1097            | Lloyd Desjarlais      | 11\u00bd | 1   |      |                 | 4             |                   |                        | 2-9-45                     | 91         |                                                                                               |\n| 1098            | Leo P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Red River Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended [January 30, 1949].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [July 4, 1949]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [this date,

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, can payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at this School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 3rd 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0922            | Stella Lavallee       | 22  | 1   |      | Okenis         |                    |                        |                           | 1-9-49     | Practical Nursing Course : St. Bon Dept. letter Aug. 9th 660-22(22)                             |\n| 0999            | Mary Dumont           | 21  | 1   |      | Peepeekisis    |                    |                        |                           | 1-9-49     | Post Training.                                                                                  |\n| 01039           | Dorine Maskeg         | 15\u00bd | 1   |      | Piapot         |                    |                        |                           | 10-4-38    |                                                                                                  |\n| 01043           | Dorothy Dumont        | 17\u00bd | 1   |      | Okenis         |                    |                        |                           | 1-9-48     |                                                                                                  |\n| 01046           | Irene Nokusais        | 17\u00bd | 1   |      |                |                    |                        |                           | 1-1-49     | Practical Nursing Course.                                                                     |\n| 01056           | Antoinette Desnomie   | 18  | 1   |      | Peepeekisis    |                    |                        |                           | 11-9-38    | Post Training.                                                                                  |\n| 01060           | Linda Anaquod         | 15\u00bd | 1   |      | Muscogptung Pasqua |                    |                        |                           | 1-9-49     | High School .

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1949\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 19[Redacted].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 3rd 19[Redacted]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Redacted]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 5th 1949\n\nI have carefully

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND ON RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 01184           | Loretta Bellegarde    | 12\u00bd | 1   |      | L.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 01142          | Marina Desnomie | 14\u00bd | 1        | Peepeskisis    | 7                 | Cooking & Housekeeping | 2-9-42                    | 92         |\n| 01145          | Lidivine Talor  | 14\u00bd | 1        | Oak River      | 7                 | Do                     | 2-9-42                    | 92         |\n| 01146          | Pearl Maple     | 14\u00bd | 1        | S.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated Jan. 5, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\n| Number | Name of Pupil       | Age | Boy/Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|--------|--------------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 1159   | Clifford Hieagle   | 12\u00bd | 1        | Oak Leka        | 3             |                  |                        | 1-9-47                    | 92         |\n| 1160   | Donald Ross        | 12\u00bd | 1        | Oak River       | 5             |                  |                        | 1-9-47                    | 92         |\n| 1161   | George Kenequan    | 13\u00bd | 1        | Day Starr       | 6             |                  |                        | 1-9-47                    | 92         |\n| 1162   | James Gordon       | 14\u00bd | 1        | Gordon's        | 6             |                  |                        | 1-9-47                    | 92         |\n| 1164   | Ervin Toto         | 9\u00bd  | 1        | Muscowpetung    | 3             |                  |                        | 1-9-47                    | 92         |\n| 1165   | Denis Geo.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter for all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Residential School for the Quarter ended [Dec 31, 1949].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Jan 5, 1950]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at [This Date, 19__]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whose grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Agency**\n\nREPORT of the Qu'Appelle Indian School, School at Lebret, Sask., Reserve for Quarter ended March 3, 1950.\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 01183           | Florence Ward  | 13  | 1        | L.B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 12, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent [Signature]\n\nDated at this [Date] 19[Year]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.
