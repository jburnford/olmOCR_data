This bird is a native of the far north and is seldom seen here.\n\nThe assessment of the Edmonton school district for the year ending June 30th, amounts to $896,568, $223,873 being personal property.\n\nThe annual meeting of the Edmonton Bible Association was held at Mr. McTaggart's shop on Tuesday evening. The secretary read a communication from Col. Macpherson, stating that the deputation had received no answer to their petition concerning the sale of the association. It had been decided that an order for the necessary amount be sent to the association, and the money stored here on receipt, by the department of the price fixed. Also that the officers of the association be elected as would be allowed. Messrs. Stott and J. A. Macdonald were appointed auditors, and the meeting adjourned until next month, when they will meet as at the same place.\n\nDr. McKay, H. B. chief trader of the Slave Lake district, arrived from Slave Lake on Friday. He experienced a heavy snowstorm at the Athabasca Landing, but was enabled to proceed and met success at Slave Lake and horses are wintering out well. The moose and caribou country is reported to be in good shape, and there is plenty of game.\n\nA school meeting was held in Saskatoon district, on Monday last, at the call of the inspector of Catholic schools, Rev. P\u00e8re Leduc. Considerable interest was manifested in the proceedings of the management of the district. He called upon the trustees to produce bonds for the school, which they refused to do. After somewhat animated discussion the meeting was closed and the inspectors returned to Edmonton. The Board of Education at Regina, he received an answer by telegraph that as soon as his complaints in writing were received a new election of trustees would be ordered.\n\nThe concert at Port Saskatchewan in aid of the school fund, which was attended, there being considerable delegations from Edmonton and Clover Bar in attendance. A short review of the programme was given in the schoolhouse, and refreshments were afterwards served in the Palace Hotel near by. The proceeds from one and above all places amounted to some $600.\n\nBATTLEFIELD.\n\nFrom the Herald of March 19th.\n\nA brigade of carts\u2014pulled for the railway on the 19th.\n\nMessrs. H. F. Montgomery and Wm. Ferrier have been invited to pay a visit to their friends.\n\nAt a meeting of the Protestant School Trustees, held last evening Mrs. A.

Several hordes belonging to local merchants are about to leave. Freighters generally are getting ready to take the road as soon as there is a thaw.\n\nFORT MACLEOD.\n\nFrom the Gazette of March 22nd.\n\nA gun club has been formed at Macleod. Guns ball shooting will be the leading amusement of the club.\n\nA large get together was held on Wednesday night, seventeen carts on the road. About seven miles of the road was covered.\n\nRev. R.

A building committee has been formed and the site selected, and it is expected that the building will be completed by September.\n\nA small flock of geese passed north over Macleod on Monday afternoon. So far we have heard nothing of the geese this season. These geese had not ordinarily been seen, for they were running their normal right into a snow storm.\n\nMacleod Creek is at length to have a postoffice.\n\nMEDICINE HAT.\n\nFrom the Times of March 20th.\n\nThe thermometer was only 65 degrees above zero last Sunday.\n\nFor the necessaries amongst us who have been away from home, two cricket clubs and several fast houses, we ought to put in a pretty lively summer amongst the Indians of this quarter.\n\nCapt. Norrie, for the past eighteen months in charge of the Mounted Police here, is about to be transferred to British Columbia.\n\nIt was on the 14th inst., that the ice broke up in the Saskatchewan river. What could the people have thought? That the first bit of ice was clear of the river this early season? However, they may consider themselves lucky if the six feet that remained on the river is all that should proceed in carrying out our plans once more.\n\nLast Tuesday Geo. Macdonald, while driving his team of oxen across the Deer ranch, came very near calling for a check for the other shore. At this season, however, the river is generally frozen over for a very large part of the year.\n\nThe Seven Persons River is inevitably high, though the river is not so high as usual. But George had no fear of what might happen to him.\n\nOn the 19th inst., Mr. Steele, an eastern territorial steel of sheep, by his method forth into the raging river, was swept away by the current.\n\n\"Prepared,\" says Hugh Dempsey, would say, may the capillary apparatus of the human system stand the pressure. The question of the sheep's capability could only be told in Mr. Macdonald's graphic style, and he yet fails to tell the story. The death of Steele was tragic in the extreme, and it is with a sense of pleasure that we hear that the sheep has been found on the North American continent that George and his steel, though separated by the water, have again met on this side of the Seven Persons.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nEx-Ald. Hartop, of Guelph, Ont., has abandoned the United States. His habitation is in Canada.\n\nEdward Turner, a young man who lived near Trenton, shot himself fatally with a shotgun yesterday.

S., started for Montreal's Bank, and thinking Mr. Carriere would be there, went in and asked to see him privately. When they got into the office Steele drew a revolver and pointed it at Carriere, who made a flesh wound only, and a struggle ensued during which Carriere was shot dead. A moment later Steele fell to the ground. A minute after the first shot was fired, and four men overpowered Steele. His poverty impelled him to attempt to rob the bank. Carriere's wounds were not serious.\n\nThe Governor-General of Canada has approved the charter of the Canadian Rock Lake, South Valley and Brandon Railway Company, passed by the Manitoba legislature.\n\nA bill in council has been passed, subjecting all patents issued by the Government for land and minerals to a clause rendering fishing rights.\n\nHeck's boat house, Toronto, was burned on the 26th ult.

The appeal also concerned the judgment against the Canadian Shipping Company damages against the Toronto Mail for a libel contained in an article published 29th June, 1882.\n\nIn the arrival of the 350 Italian passengers of the steamer Beaver Scotia in the harbour late this morning and the 27th ult., the same that followed beggared description. They rushed into the Roman Catholic chapel seeking shelter for food like ravenous wolves. The force of the mass of people was so great that the officers who were present had to use their orders to keep the crowd back. The strong men crowded to the front with uplifted arms and their stern countenance seemed to say to the Italians, \"Bread, bread!\" It was impossible to regulate the distribution of food. The poor fellows were obliged to take milk and beer added to their portions.\n\nThen A. Harding, the tileworks stage driver, came among the ill-fated, most of whom sat on the deck, and offered them refreshment. He was joined by Ferguson, a coach driver, on May 29th.\n\nPat Gunnan and Mat Turney, baymen, came on board and offered assistance, saying they had been on the scene of the disaster at the Kansas, which arrived on the 23rd ult., fourteen days from Liverpool. The harvesters were most anxious and well with weight. All the food the two young men were able to obtain was the particles of flour that had been thrown on the cleaner, and all the water they could get was that furnished by the \"sweat\" of the steamer. They are both in a very critical condition.\n\nJackson Marion, the murderer of John Cameron, was hanged at Beattie, Neb., on the 26th May, 1882. He was born in Oregon in April, 1872, nearly fifteen years ago, while driving to Grasshopper Falls, Kansas, to work on the St. Joe & Denver railroad grade.\n\nSTRAYED.\n\nStrayed north from Humboldt, in November last a team of black ponies, one mare and two colts, aged three, four and five years old, brown, these animals lost across the prairie near the town of Humboldt.

Remember that she's been raised kind of tender-like. Two and a half years, and she's never been out an acre of corn a day till all that she is used to doing.\n\n\"Take her light work, such as making rail fences, and digging post holes, and burning brush, and so forth, but don't let her do too much work. She mustn't ask too much of her. It's hard work for old dad to give his little Skinner girl a birdling. He hasn't got two cents worth of birdling left in his taters now.
