Hallick who tested out five different makes and he selected ours as being the best from every point.\n\nWe are enlarging on this particular item for the reason that we are under the impression that you are not aware that there is a Canadian machine which will do all that any American machine can claim, and more.\n\nTrusting you will give this due consideration and hoping that our quotation meets with your favour, we remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nLEB/SCC.\nJOHN BURNS & COMPANY\n\nEncl.

Cream Separator\n\nWe thank you for your enquiry dated November 2nd calling for a quotation on a 1000-lb. Cream Separator f.o.b. St. Albert, Alta. We are returning this form duly signed and quoting our very best cash figure for the machine in question.\n\nOur nearest sized machine has a capacity of 900 lbs. and we feel safe in offering you this size as capable of caring for the requirements of that Station. When this machine was first put on the market we advertised it as 1000 lbs. capacity but found that it did not actually come up to that capacity, and we accordingly changed our rating to read 900 lbs. We feel, however, that this is very conservative and we trust that we may hear from you favorably and by return of mail.\n\nWe are enclosing a folder descriptive of our Cream Separator, and also another folder descriptive of a new type Governor Pulley we have designed for use with power Cream Separators. It is, of course, very important that a Cream Separator be run at the proper speed, and we feel sure that this Governor Pulley would soon pay for itself in saving in wear and tear on the Separator. As you will see, it is of a very efficient type, being built on the principle of the clutch plate common on high grade motor cars. If you wish to consider the purchase of this equipment with the Separator our price would be $15.00 f.o.b. St. Albert.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMASSEY-HARRIS COMPANY, Limited\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant to Sales Manager\nOttawa, Nov. 9th, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, receipt of your tender for the supplying of a cast iron stone jacketed kettle, cast iron steam cooker and a hand power potato peeler for delivery at St. Albert, Alta., and to inform you that your quotation for this equipment, not being the lowest received, has not been accepted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

If the school is lighted by its own generating plant, it would not be advisable to connect the motor for operating the cream separator, as this would exhaust the batteries. You should also state the phase, cycle and horse power of the motor required and whether alternating or direct current is used.

The voltage being 110/115 the power is direct.\n\nThe motor supplied should be one that the separator will stand and the firm who supplied the separator will be able to say what pulleys &c will be required and also the best kind of motor or the one most suitable for that particular kind of separator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Dec. 28, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis Department requires for the use of the St. Albert Indian Residential School a small gas engine to operate the 1000 lb. capacity cream separator, which we ordered from you under cover of the 9th ultimo.

You should consult the man in charge of the electrical equipment at the school, and ascertain the size and type of the motor, as well as the attachments required, and it would then be more satisfactory if you arranged for the purchase of same.\n\nI enclose herewith the catalogue of the Renfrew Machinery Co., Ltd., Renfrew, Ont., from whom the separator was purchased, showing their power attachments. This Company state that if the proper transmission is used a 1/4 H.P. motor is sufficiently large to drive the cream separator satisfactorily. However, after you have consulted the school electrician, you may arrange for the purchase of a motor of a type and H.P. considered satisfactory. Competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained. The attachments required can be purchased from the Renfrew Machinery Co., and you should communicate with them stating exactly what is required.\n\nWhen the motor and attachments have been purchased, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred. The motor and attachments should be purchased at an early date, and the account forwarded for payment before the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nIf it should be decided that it is not feasible to operate the motor from the electric light plant at the school, a 1 or 1-1/2 H.P. gas engine which is sufficiently strong to drive the cream separator can be purchased by you instead of the motor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

ALBERT RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, Edmonton Agency.\nDated February 26, 1924.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the necessity\nfor providing the junior classroom with ten No.\n3 desks. They have not sufficient seating capa-\ncity for the pupilage and are making shift by\nusing tables and chairs. The teacher's desk is\nalso a poor affair.\n\nW. Murison,\nInsp.\nOttawa, March 22nd, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on a recent inspection of the St. Albert Indian Residential School, has drawn attention to the need for providing 10 school desks and a teacher's desk for the junior classroom. Please state whether double or single school desks are required. Desks are manufactured in the following sizes, viz:\n\nNo. 6 for pupils 5 to 8 years,\nNo. 5 \" 7 to 10 \"\nNo. 4 \" 9 to 14 \"\nNo. 3 \" 12 to 16 \"\n\nYou should consult the Principal and state the size of the desks and the number of each size required for the junior classroom. As it would be advisable to have desks of the same type as those at present in the school, please state the name of the manufacturer of the desks on hand.\n\nAs soon as we have full information as to the desks required, consideration will be given to the placing of an order for the supplying of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nRenfrew Machinery Company Ltd.,\n\nRenfrew, Ont.,\n11th March, 1924.\n\nGeo. H. Race Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of Feb., 27th and supplementing ours of March 5th, we are pleased to send you herewith leaflet describing the type of motor on tripod stand, and pulley for separator, which will convey to you the idea which we had in mind of operating your Renfrew Cream Separator by electric motor. This outfit complete consists of \u00bd H.P. motor with stand and cord and pulley for separator and can be furnished for $79.50 complete.\n\nWe note that it was your intention that the separator ordered be electrically driven. However this does not appear to have been referred to in any of your correspondence leading up to the sale. We regret exceedingly that you did not order the type of machine you now appear to want, but if you still desire a self-contained, electrically driven separator same as illustrated on the cover of instruction book which we are sending you in preference to the apparatus detailed on the illustrated leaflet, we will exchange machines for you at an additional cost of $75.00 providing you will undertake to pay transportation charges.\n\nThe electrically driven machine is originally $65.00 higher priced than the hand-power machine and as you will understand a machine that has been in use even for a short time is considerably depreciated and would cost quite a lot to restore it to its original new condition, therefore in quoting you a price of $75.00 it is only $10.00 in excess of what you would have paid for the size 10 electric machine in the first place and this as we understand it, is what you require.\n\nWill you kindly give the matter your consideration and tell us which of the above propositions will suit you best. If you would desire to have the new size 10 electric separator, let us know and we will ship it along to you at once and on its arrival you can return the machine you now have.\n\nWill you please be sure and ascertain the correct power you have. In one of your former letters you refer to this as 160 volts and later it has been referred to as 110 to 120 volts. It is quite important that we have this correct so as to furnish suitable motor.\n\nAwaiting your reply, we are,\n\nYours very truly\n(Signed) H.J. Smith\nOrder ans Sales Dept.\nSir,\n\nHaving reference to your letter of the 16th January last, in the matter of power attachment for the cream separator which was shipped to the St. Albert Boarding School, some time ago, I now beg to forward herewith copy of a letter which I have received from the Renfrew Machinery Company, from whom the cream separator was purchased.\n\nIn this connection I would say that I have taken up the matter with the electrician and the Principal of the school and I believe the most satisfactory way would be to return the separator which we have and replace it with one with self-contained, electrically driven motor, at the additional cost.\n\nI note the company state that they will charge an additional $75.00 to make the exchange but they state that the original additional cost is $65.00, $10.00 difference they explain is on account of the depreciation of the first machine. In this connection, however, I would state that the machine which was received from them in the first instance, has never been unpacked consequently there has been no depreciation.\n\nMay I be favoured with the necessary authority to make the exchange as soon as possible as the cream separator is badly needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 27, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Renfrew Machinery Co., Limited, with reference to the question of power attachment for the cream separator which was supplied for the use of the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say the Department agrees that the most satisfactory way would be to return the separator which was supplied and have it replaced with one having self-contained, electrically driven motor. We note that the difference in price which is asked by the company for making the exchange is $75 and transportation charges. As you state that the machine which was received from the company in the first instance has never been unpacked you should insist that the amount of $10, requested on the grounds that a second hand machine would be returned, should not be paid. As this machine has not been in use, it could not have depreciated in value. You may therefore arrange with the above named company to furnish the new machine with the necessary power attachment and return the one first supplied by them. Properly certified vouchers should be forwarded, covering the expenditure in the exchange of the two machines, together with receipts for freight charges.\n\nWe note that the company desires to be informed as to the correct voltage that will be used in operating the separator. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H. Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir,\u2014 Ref. 110-1-5, 22nd March, 1924.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, I beg to inform you that I have spoken to the Principal of the St. Albert Boarding School, with regard to the desks required, and am informed that the following would be most suitable, viz.:\n\n10 desks No. C. Christie's catalogue @ $9.00\n10 rears No. C. \" \" 8.75\n1 Teacher's desk,\n7 drawers 26\"X50\" \" 44.75\n\nThe Principal also makes a request for 2 school clocks with calendars, quoted in Christie's catalogue @ $12.75, and I would recommend that the above be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1924.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease forward your lowest quotation F.O.B.

As soon as the order has been placed you will be advised.\n\nRegarding the request of the Principal to be supplied with two school clocks, I beg to say that we do not furnish equipment of this nature to residential schools. It is considered that this equipment should be purchased by the school from the per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nI may say that the school desks which this Department previously supplied were manufactured by the Canadian Office & School Furniture Co. Ltd., Preston, Ont., and, as it will be necessary to have uniformity in the desks in use in the classroom, the same make of desk will be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

She told me this would cost less than $10.00. I authorized her to make the purchase, and I hope the Department will approve of my action and pay the attached voucher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

By doing this we would effect a considerable saving in the cost of the work. I can only think, after noting the size of these pavilions, that they possibly have in view the matter of providing accommodation for the white boarders, and these of course should not be a charge against our Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

I wish to point out that the pupilage at this institution is 100, but, before advising you definitely concerning the building activity, I will make certain enquiries and will have another communication for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan S. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, June 7, 1924.\n\nDear Sister Gosselin:\n\nSome weeks ago I sent Mr. Commissioner Graham of Regina, the plans for the outdoor pavilions for the use of the Indian pupils at the St. Albert Indian Residential School and instructed him to arrange for their erection. The Commissioner reports that these pavilions provide seating accommodation for 81 pupils each. The Indian pupilage at the school is only 100 and Mr. Graham suggests that we reduce the size of these pavilions to 28 by 30 ft.\n\nPlease let me have an expression of your wishes in this connection and intimate what are the exact uses to which these buildings will be put. It was my understanding that the Indian pupils had a playground of their own and that both the pavilions were to be erected there.\n\nYou might also inform me if one building is for girls and one for boys.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

As you have been so kind as to ask us to let you have an expression of our wishes in this connection, we beg you to kindly let the pavilions be built in the dimensions that we are now forwarding you, namely, 24 X 40.... No doubt for the present, the pupilage is only 100, but we hope in the near future, that the St. Albert Boarding School will be filled up with Indians as is, and has always been our desire... Then we will not have to go back again on these erections for enlargement. However, Honorable Sir, we do not want in any manner to go against your wishes;... In regard to these pavilions, each one will be erected on each of their respective playgrounds; one for the boys, and one for the girls, and will be for the pupils of our Indian school only.... Trusting to receive a favorable answer from you in regard to these pavilions that are really necessary for the comfort of our pupils.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSister Guerin.\nOttawa, June 23, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWith further reference to your No. 403-11A of the 26th ultimo, regarding the two dining and recreation pavilions to be erected at the St. Albert Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that a communication has been received from the Rev. Sister Superior containing an expression of her wishes in this connection. She requests that the dimensions of each be 24 by 40 ft., one to be erected on the boys' and the other on the girls' playground. As you were advised, $4,000 has been provided for this purpose and for putting up proper fencing around the outside.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will comply, in so far as the funds provided will permit, with the Rev. Sister's wishes regarding the size and other particulars in the erection of these pavilions. The principal states that they will be for the use of the Indian pupils only.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

I promised the Sister I would bring this matter to your attention. I would say that $1200 would go a long way towards repairing these balconies.\n\nShe also asked if they could be supplied with 90 yards of awning for the dining pavilions that were erected by the Department a year ago. I think this material should be supplied.\n\nShe also asked for swings for the playground. I am attaching cuts of what they require. If you decide to grant these requests we could possibly buy these swings in the East and they could be shipped out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nW.M.

I regret to inform you that there are no funds available for these purposes. As you are aware, this institution is largely used for the education of children that are not wards of this Department; and I consider that capital expense, except under quite exceptional circumstances, should be met by the school authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA.

Our wards comprise approximately five-twelfths of the pupilage at this institution and I have promised that the Department will meet five-twelfths of the cost of this improvement. Competitive prices should be secured before making purchase, and, when you are submitting the receipted account for the total cost to the office of Mr. Indian Agent Race, you should attach thereto the written offers of the firms that were asked to quote.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At the present time, as our means cannot permit us to make such a purchase, we have come to the conclusion, that we will have to let the work go, (though the corridors and stairways are in a very bad condition), until we see through to meet this expense.... Permit us Kind Sir, to ask you, if some day or other in the near future, we see through to meet this expense, could we still count on the Department for the same help as they have just offered us........\n\nIn waiting for an early reply,\nI have the honor to be,\nYour humble servant,\nOttawa, January 13, 1926.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the supplying of linoleum for the corridors and stairways at the St. Albert Indian Residential School. I note that the total cost of this improvement will be over $4,000. At some future date, the Department will give favorable consideration to meeting five-twelfths of the cost in this connection, as our wards comprise approximately this portion of the pupilage. In view of the large sum involved, it would be well for you to make the request in the fall of the year, previous to the season you wish to make purchase, so that the Department will be able to arrange for an item in the Appropriation.\n\nYou will understand that this cannot be authorized unless the money is voted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

The small ones now in use are too small for them to sit in a natural position. The Inspector made comment on this at his last visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 2nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting that a number of desks be supplied for the use of the St. Albert Indian Residential School, as follows:\n\n6 to replace broken desks,\n10 new desks for the older boys and girls.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that desks were last supplied this school in August, 1924, and I would refer you to letter of the 29th of that month in which you were informed of the name of the firm by whom they would be supplied. You may place an order with the same firm, viz. The Western School Supply Company Ltd., 1402 Rose St., Regina, Sask., to supply the 16 single desks now required. You should consult the Principal of the School as to the size and number of each size required, and you should then place the order with the above named firm, asking them to supply the desks F.O.B. St. Albert at their lowest possible price.\n\nYou should also forward accounts, in duplicate, from this firm, and when the desks have been delivered, if in good condition, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Race, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n27th May 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that the present laundry at the St. Albert Boarding School is not at all what it should be. On my last visit I looked it over and found that it is in connection with the engine room and thoroughfare to the engine room. In the laundry is much machinery which although protected by iron rails is not sufficient for safety.\n\nIt does not appear to me that there is adequate room for the work which is carried on there apart from the undesirable fact that the engineers and other workmen have to pass forwards and backwards when going to or coming from the engine room when the girls are at work in the laundry.\n\nOn the west side of the building there is a space on which a laundry could be built and attached to the engine room.\n\nThe building required would be of brick like the main building with 3 walls and skylight roof. The size 53x24x10 ft, wall. This building fitted with the old equipment would cost about $6000 but if new revolving driers and mangles\u2014which are badly needed\u2014were installed it would cost about $8000 to $10000.\n\nI may also remark that the present pumping system for the septic tank is not what it should be and if a new pumping arrangements are established, they would take up the space now used by the present laundry and which is the only place for the machinery to be.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 7th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the condition of the present laundry at the St. Albert Indian Residential School.

Race\nIndian Agent\nEdmonton Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 15th, in regard to the $4000.00 grant, suggested by the Deputy Superintendent General, Dr. Scott, as a part payment on the erection of our new laundry, I am enclosing a list of the equipment needed for the said laundry, also prices quoted on by the different firms, together with the cost of the fireproof building. By the total amount $10,025.70, you will plainly see that the $4000.00 would be inadequate in this case.\n\nOn your last visit to the school, when going through the building, you keenly saw the great necessity of a new laundry for the school. Moreover you saw at the same time what expenses we are undergoing in regard to the new sewerage disposal plant we were having built anew compulsory by the Provincial Government, at a cost of $7,000.00. The total cost of the old and new sewerage disposal plants in the last seven years amounted to $14,000.00. Furthermore, we had to have a new installation of batteries which cost us the sum of $2,000.00.\n\nBy the above figures you can plainly see, that we have tried to do our utmost toward the upkeep of the school in every manner.\n\nIf the department could at least furnish $3,000.00 on the erection of the new said laundry, we would be most grateful, as at the present we have all we can do to make both ends meet, in regard to our daily expenses, interests, etc. Asking you kindly to take this matter up with the Deputy Superintendent General, Dr. Scott, hoping he will do his utmost for us, toward the furnishing of the $3,000.00 mentioned above.\n\nAnd oblige\n\nYour humble servant\nSister Proulx, Prin.\n10th April 1928\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to letter No. 110-1-5 of 10th March re allowance for laundry at the St. Albert School, I beg to say that I told the Sisters what the Department were prepared to do and I was told that the former Principal had underestimated the total cost. The enclosed copy of their letter and the cost of building and equipment gives a more correct idea of what the outlay will be. The difference is mostly for the equipment.\n\nIt is not necessary to make any further comment on the enclosed letter except I know all that the Sisters say is quite correct and that the compulsory provision for sewage disposal has put their finances very low.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing copy of a communication from the Sister Superior of the St. Albert Indian Residential School, with reference to the proposed laundry and laundry equipment. I note that the cost will be more than originally estimated and that the Department is requested to provide a grant of $8,000. I regret that the Department will have available for this purpose the sum of $4,000 only, as this is the item that is in our Estimates. The Deputy Superintendent General's arrangement was that if the school management erected a laundry and equipped it, at a cost of $8,000 or more, the Department would make a grant of $4,000. You may inform the Sister Superior that the Department will have this last mentioned amount only available for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

M. Graham, Esq.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request, we are forwarding you the plan of our new laundry together with cost of machinery. As you will notice, a garage is attached to back of laundry. This garage being greatly needed, we thought it would be most convenient to have it built on to the end of laundry, as this was the site most satisfactory, needing only two walls to complete same. Mr. J.R. Desrochers of Edmonton, the man who made out the plan, estimates the garage at about $400.00, that is, all fire-proof. It is not our intention, that the Department shall pay for this garage, although we keep the care solely, for the accommodation of recruiting pupils on the different reserves. However, kind Sir, we shall greatly appreciate anything you can do for us, in regard to the building up of this said laundry and garage; and moreover, rely upon your generosity to do all in your power to have the full amount paid by the Dept. of Indian Affairs. We permit ourselves to speak to you in this manner, as you are about the only one, who knows clearly and exactly how we are standing in regard to our financial affairs.\n\nTrusting you will do your utmost, to grant us this favor as generously as you have granted us, so many numerous others, and hoping to be able to say in future years, that the modern laundry and garage of the St. Albert Boarding School, was built up, equipped and paid for, by the Department of Indian Affairs, through the kindness and generosity of our Indian Commissioner, Mr. W. M. Graham, whose powerful words spoke up for us.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n(Sgd) Sister Proulx, Trin.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nW.

You may inform the Sister Superior that I have decided to increase our grant towards this building to $5,000. If they erect the building at an estimated cost of $6,500; place therein $3,500 worth of machinery and then forward their receipts to the Department, I will see that one-half the cost, up to the amount of our grant, is given to them in reimbursement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Graham, Indian Commissioner, notifying us that you have had the kindness of increasing the grant towards our new laundry and garage to $5000.00. We thank you most sincerely for same.\n\nThe remaining balance, we still find a large amount to pay out, for the simple reason, not having the required amount on hand, we shall be obliged to borrow it, and this borrowing always follows by paying interests of 6% and 7%.\n\nHowever, Kind Sir, we greatly appreciate your kindness and generosity towards us, and still live in hopes that when you shall receive the invoices for the building and machinery, you will again do your utmost, to help us out in some manner for the balance.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSister Proulx, prin.\n\nPer.

In the summer, the Deputy Superintendent General offered to increase our grant to $5,000, provided the school authorities erected a building at an estimated cost of $6,200 and placed therein $3,800 worth of machinery. Funds for the purpose of paying this grant will be available only up to the end of March of this year.

Please advise the Reverend Sister that she should arrange for the equipment without delay, even if it is necessary to borrow the funds. When the total cost is known and the receipts are forwarded to the Department, a grant of one-half the expenditure will be made up to a total of $5,000. The Auditor General's requirements make this necessary. I am returning the voucher you prepared and the receipt of J. P. Desrochers, who erected the building. Please ask this firm to give you a duplicate copy of this receipt and see that the Sisters secure duplicate receipts for the laundry machinery they install.\n\nI have to request that you will have the Sister Superior attend to this matter without delay, so that your voucher in their favour will reach the Department not later than the last week in March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The receipts are now to hand, showing an expenditure of over $10,000. I shall be pleased to have your authority to reimburse the school management to the extent of $5,000.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nST. ALBERT R.C. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe school building is a very fine structure. It is bright, has high ceilings, and is well ventilated. I found it very clean and tidy throughout. It is well equipped with facilities for fighting fire, and there is easy access to the fire escapes.\n\nSince my last visit a laundry has been added to the main building. This is 42'x27' with a 19'6\" ceiling. Access to this is obtained through a porch leading to the main building. This makes it unnecessary for the children to enter the engine room. The building, unequipped, has cost $6,040.00. The estimated cost of machinery and equipment was given to me as $6,000.00, which will bring the total cost to over $12,000.00. This is a very good building. It has a cement floor, and a pedestal 7 ft. high has been provided for a motor so that it will be well out of reach of the children. The Sisters are looking forward with considerable anxiety to having the Department bear a share of the cost of this laundry. They hope that the Department will bear 50% of the expense. I was present when they gave their estimate of cost to Dr. Scott two years ago, and they then stated that they expected the cost would be around $8,000.00. They have exceeded this estimate by a third more. The Sisters stated that they recently had to expend $12,000.00 in installing a septic tank and drainage to comply with the provincial regulations, and they found the additional cost of the laundry a heavy burden on them. They have not had a great deal of assistance at this institution in the past, and it appears to me that they are deserving of some consideration by the Department.\n\nThey have\nThey have, at the present time, a very capable staff. The three Sisters in charge of the classrooms are reported on as being quite capable teachers by the Provincial School Inspector, and the percentage of marks obtained by the pupils on his test appears to be quite satisfactory.\n\nA large farm is operated in connection with this school. The work on the farm is largely done with hired help. They have 144 cattle and were milking 32 cows at the time of my visit. They have an ample supply of milk and butter for their own use. They raise hogs and have a large flock of poultry, so that the stock and poultry provide an important source of food supply. The boys assist in the care of the stock, under supervision, and do the milking. The girls are taught to make butter and bread, and, in fact, they are given a training in general domestic work. They have a large garden, which supplied ample potatoes and vegetables last season for their requirements.\n\nI may say that the clothing for the children is all made at the school by the pupils.\n\nThe foregoing report is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., April 4th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection of the schools in the Edmonton Agency, which was made by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nWith reference to the St. Albert School, everything there was found in good order as usual. You are quite familiar with the promises that were made to the Sisters with regard to the building of the laundry and what proportion of the expense the Department would bear, so it is unnecessary for me to go into this matter. You will be pleased to note, however, that the laundry has been completed and is apparently highly satisfactory.\n\nOn the whole the report on these two schools is quite satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n25th October\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that on the 28th September a fire destroyed the pig pen at the St. Albert School. Not only was the building burned but the gas engine, crusher pump and tank and 500 bushels of barley recently chopped ready for feed and 35 pigs most of which were just ready for sale.\n\nThe building alone was worth about $3000 whilst the machinery, chop and pigs would make up another $2000.\n\nThe Principal is asking if the Department can assist them in replacing the building and machinery.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 31st, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the fire which destroyed the pigpen at the St. Albert Residential School. The Principal's request that the Department assist in replacing the building and machinery has been noted and will receive attention when the Estimates are being prepared for the fiscal year 1930-31.

They milk between 30 and 35 cows regularly throughout the year.\n\nTheir cow barn is old, cramped, and out of date, having been built about 25 years ago. A modern barn with plenty of room and air space as well as good drainage would add greatly to the comfort of the cows as well as promote cleanliness in milking time.\n\nThe same remarks apply to the horse barn which has no drainage and is in a badly shaken condition. It would add to the appearance of this institution if the old outbuildings were torn down and replaced with buildings set farther away from the school in an orderly formation. They are now scattered all over the place and have anything but an attractive look.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ST.

As we have but very few white children in the school owing to the hard times, and quite a number of indian children, and they being the treacherous ones, do you think, Honorable Sir, that the Department could help us out in paying the salary of the night watchman, together with a night watchman's clock; this clock being an absolute necessity, as he would have to punch it each time that he would visit around the different departments and in this manner we would know if he remains on duty or not.\n\nIf all the above items were not an absolute necessity and we really had the means to meet the expense, we would not hesitate to go right ahead and not bother you, but we cannot see our way through as we stand today, and having the above problems weighing us down, makes it very miserable for us.\n\nPegging you, Honorable Sir, to do your utmost to give us a helping hand as you have always done in the past.\n\nI have the honor to be, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nSister M.A. Surprenant, Principal.\nJanuary 13, 1932.\n\nDear Sister Surprenant:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to needs at the St. Albert Indian Residential School.

You should, therefore, notify the Principal of the St. Albert Indian Residential School that the Department will not allow any grant towards the salary of the night watchman after April 30, 1935. Payment of the grant at the same rate as formerly, viz., $40 a month, will be resumed from October 1, 1935, and will be continued until April 30, 1936.\n\nIf the Principal so desires, you may forward a voucher at the end of each month during the period for which this letter authorizes the employment of a night watchman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We respectfully submit these requests to your benevolence hoping that in return the children will show their gratitude by obtaining a higher standing of education, in which you take such a deep interest.\n\nThanking you for your devotedness to the welfare of our Institution, we beg to remain, dear Sir,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSt. Albert Indian Res.

MacKinnon, M. P., requesting that the Department purchase a truck for the use of the school.\n\nIn this connection I would say that this school is a church-owned institution, to which Indian children are admitted. The Department provides a grant for the education and maintenance of 160 children, for which payment is made at the rate of $180 per capita, less 15%.\n\nIt is not the policy of the Department to provide a truck for use at church-owned schools. In any event, there are no funds available to provide the cost of supplying a truck.\n\nAs requested, the letter of the Sister Superior is returned herewith.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that a short time ago I inspected St. Albert School, near Edmonton, and while there the Sister Superior wanted to know if the Department were going to help the school out in any way over and above the grant. What she asked for was some tools, as they have men at the school now who has charge of the boys and is giving them some manual training. She also asked for some paint for interior decorating and a group of 16 basins, 8 on each side, for one of the dormitories. This would cost something like $300.00.\n\nI did not make any promises to the Sister Superior any more than that I would submit the matter to the Department. I shall be glad to be advised of the Department's decision in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 13, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 403-11A. R.C. of the 8th instant, regarding the request of the Sister Superior of the St. Albert Indian Residential School, that paint for interior decorating and a group of 16 basins be supplied, at an approximate cost of $300.\n\nIn reply I have to say that no funds were provided for repairs or equipment at this school in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year. I regret, therefore, we will be unable to supply the school with the equipment asked for by the Sister Superior.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that I have received a request from the Rev.

These desks are size number 5 and number 6, and the price is $5.00 per desk. The principal of the school also requires some larger desks for the larger children. At the end of last term there were 167 children in this school and there will be approximately about the same number this year when the new children are in school.\n\nWill you please advise me if this request can be granted and if so what action will be taken regarding purchasing of desks?\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

C. Laight,  \nIndian Agent,  \nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to the new laws enacted in Alberta regulating the salary of workmen as well as their hours of service, our nightwatchman is entitled to an increase of salary. By these laws he should work only 54 hours a week and be allowed 33 1/3 cents an hour, an arrangement which constitutes 4 1/3 weeks of work a month for a salary of $78.00.\n\nHowever $65.00 a month would satisfy both the requirements of the Provincial law and the demands of the employee, for he takes two meals a day at the school which we deducted from his wages and which meals we are very willing to provide him without any consideration.\n\nHoping that these extra expenses will be taken into consideration by the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSigned Sister V.M.Corriveau\n\nSister V.M.Corriveau, Principal.\nWinterburn, Alta.\nMarch 5th, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nPlease find enclosed copy of a letter which I have received from Reverend Sister V.M.Corriveau, Principal, Youville Indian Residential School. This letter is self explanatory.\n\nWill you please advise me what action if any the Department can take in this matter.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the night watchman at the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nI realize that the Reverend Sisters in charge of this institution will have to comply with the Provincial regulations regarding the wages paid to the night watchman. At the same time I would point out that we have never questioned any of the schools regarding the amount they have been paying the night watchman. We simply allow an amount of $40.00 a month for a certain period each year toward the wages of the night watchman. It has always been understood that if it is not possible to secure a night watchman for the amount we allow that the school authorities are expected to pay the balance. I may also add that the amount allowed the St. Albert School for night watchman's services is the same as that paid to other Residential Schools where night watchmen are necessary. Under the above circumstances the Department is unable to allow any increase in the amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C.

Laight,\nEdmonton Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: Classroom and Lavatory Equipment\n\nTwo of our classrooms are still furnished with the old-fashioned double desks, an equipment which the Public School Inspector, Mr. J.J. LeBlanc, recommends to replace by the modern single desks. Consequently I would be greatly obliged if you would kindly forward to Ottawa our requisition for:\n\n20 single desks No. 2\n20 single desks No. 3\n10 single desks No. 4\n\nLast February, a school furnisher, Mr. Andrew Jackson, 39 Garibaldi Block, Edmonton, has offered to supply the required desks, if the Department choose to give him their order.\n\nI also wish to call your attention to the need of lavatory equipment for two of the boys' wards. The girls are already supplied with porcelain enameled basins, each ward having a set of 16. An equal number is required for each of the boys' wards.\n\nThe knowledge that you have of the Institution and of its needs, leads me to ask you, Mr. Laight, to kindly support our requisition before the Department.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister V.M. Corriveau,\nprincipal.\nSir:\n\nPlease find enclosed copy of letter which I have received from the Reverend Sister V. M. Corriveau, Principal, Youville Indian Residential School, St. Albert. This letter is self explanatory. However, I would recommend that if at all possible that the desks asked for be supplied.\n\nThe lavatory equipment for the two boy's wards are badly needed but these are very expensive and could be laid over for another year.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 11, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Youville Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with this school, the Department found it possible to provide in the current year's appropriation an amount of $800.00 only, for repairs, improvements and new equipment. The cost of the number of desks mentioned in the Sister's letter would greatly exceed this amount.\n\nIn view of present regulations, it is impossible for us to expend a larger amount than that specifically provided for the school. You should, therefore, consult the Sister Superior again and let me have a definite recommendation regarding the manner in which the amount available should be expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\nSir:\n\nAttention Mr R. A. Hoey, please.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. II0-1-5 of the 11th instant in connection with request made by the Principal of the Youville Indian Residential School for school desks, in reply I beg to report that I have again discussed this matter with the Principal, Rev. Sister V.M. Corriveau who advises me that she would ask that the amount of $300.00 this years appropriation be expended in desks.\n\nOn my return from the school I called at Moyer School Supplies Ltd., 10167-104th Street Edmonton and obtained the following prices on single desks delivered F.O.B.

Sister Corriveau and myself.\n\nI am advised by the Mager of Moyer's Ltd., that it will be adviseable to place this order as soon as possible as there is a possibility of prices being advanced at least 8% in the very near future.\n\nRespectfully submitted and awaiting your further instructions.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Garnett, M.E.I.C., professional engineer, (Alberta). His report states that, in his opinion, our \"present method of producing heat and power is extremely inefficient.\" At the time the original equipment was installed, the system adopted was the only solution to the power problem. At the present time, however, due to the construction of an electric power transmission line to our premises, he declares that a very substantial saving can be made by bringing about a change in the electrical and heating systems of the Institution.\n\nThe changeover from Direct Current power obtained from our own plant to Alternating Current as supplied by the Calgary Power Company, requires the installation of motors, switches, wiring, etc. Tenders have been invited for the alterations and additions to the existing water supply and heating system as well as for the electrical work. We realize that it will be impossible to carry over the change with less than $567.00 which is the lowest bid.\n\nAs we know with what interest the Department looks upon the development of its Indian schools, we take the liberty of asking its help to finance this enterprise. Our means being so limited, we would greatly appreciate an endeavour on your part to second our efforts in this undertaking.\n\nTrusting that our demand will receive the kind consideration of your Department, I remain, Sirs,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister V.M. Corriveau,\nSister V.M. Corriveau, principal.\nSir:\n\nPlease find enclosed a letter which I have been asked by the Rev.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour well known benevolence and devoted interest in our Indian Residential Schools must be my apology for asking you a great favor.\n\nOur school built in 1919 is in urgent need of repairs. We are presently renewing the entire roof and this taxes our financial situation to the extreme.\n\nThe interior of the buildings require likewise urgent repairs. Among these, the cement of the basement halls is badly broken and needs to be covered or remade. We therefore, beg respectfully submit our request for help to finance this last undertaking. We would appreciate a heavy marboleum, as this is durable and would prevent the raising of dust and favor cleanliness especially for the playrooms and dining-rooms which are adjacent.\n\nAllow me to state the dimensions of the corridors to be thus covered, as your devotedness to Indian schools cannot permit us to foresee the possibility of a refusal under present conditions\u2014380 ft. x 7 ft.\n\nI feel confident that you will favor our request and accept to present it to the kind consideration of your Department.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Ste Sabine,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting us to supply marboleum for the floors of the halls in the Youville Residential School. The quantity of marboleum which you request amounts to 240 square yards. This article is not only scarce but expensive at the present time and its cost would be much more than we could provide this year. As a matter of fact we have in our appropriation an amount of $250.00 for repairs and improvements at the Youville School and this is the total amount that we can expend. I understand that we could secure Grade AA battleship linoleum at approximately $2.00 a square yard. This would mean that for the amount of funds available we would be able to secure approximately 125 square yards. However, we can only secure battleship linoleum in 6' widths. I should appreciate your advising if the linoleum mentioned would be suitable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister Ste.

I mentioned in my letter of July 5, that we were renewing the roof on all our buildings, and this at a cost of over $1800. Two days after completion, a terrific wind storm tore off one third of the roof of the right wing. This is now under repairs, and will cost over $500.

In the current year's appropriation an amount of $250.00 is provided for repairs and improvements at this school and the Principal has requested that battleship linoleum be bought. The quantity to be secured will, of course, depend on the price and you will note that the total amount available is $250.00.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

McGill\n\nThe Purchasing Agent has submitted to me a requisition for the purchase of battleship linoleum for the R.C. Indian Residential School at St. Albert, Alberta, the cost being $246.44, this being the lowest tender submitted.\n\nIt is noted that on the requisition it is stated that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $250 was provided for repairs and improvements at this school. Is it not the general practice to use this appropriation for repairs to the buildings rather than for buying furniture or other similar articles. The fact that the above sum is allotted to this school does not necessarily mean that it should be spent. If we adopt the policy of purchasing linoleum and carpets, this might be extended to buying other furnishings which should be purchased by the churches rather than by the Department. It would seem desirable that our expenditures should be restricted to repairs which will keep the buildings in good shape.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, August 28, 1943.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

This school is owned and operated by the Grey Nuns for the education of Indian children only.\n\nThe last expenditure made for repairs, improvements or purchase of new equipment for this school was made during the fiscal year 1939-40, at which time we purchased 31 desks at a total cost of $246.25. During the fiscal years 1940-41 and 1941-42 we did not make any expenditures at this school for either repairs, improvements or purchase of new equipment. The only payments made to them were the per capita grant and an allowance for seven months of each year for the night watchman.\n\nIn a letter received from the Principal she stated that the school was built in 1919 and this year required an entire new roof which the school management was supplying from their own funds. She also pointed out that the interior of the building required some repairs and these repairs also were being paid from their own funds. She made the special request, however, that we supply the linoleum, as this would prevent the raising of dust and favour cleanliness.\n\nIn view of the information contained in this memorandum, I trust that you will find it possible to approve the purchase of the linoleum.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 1, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Sister Vincent, the Principal and she said they simply did not have the money to do the work. She also pointed out a lot of partitioning which had been done this summer to make things more comfortable for the children, in that the bigger girls & boys were in some measure separated from the younger ones, which I thought was rather a good idea.\n\nOn looking through the estimates to find if anything had been provided for by way of repairs & maintenance, I found that the building was the property of the church. I noted also that they were only being allowed the same per capita grant as the Edmonton School & in view of this I was wondering if the Department would consider furnishing the material for re-decorating if those in charge of the school would agree to do the work.\n\nI did not take any measurements, as I thought there would not be any object in doing so, until I found out if the Department would consider any such expenditure.\n\nTrusting you may give this favorable consideration.\n\nJ.T.

As you state in your letter, this school is classed as a Church-owned school and consequently we can only expend, for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment, the amount specifically provided in our appropriation for that particular school. In the current year's appropriation we included an amount of $250 for repairs, improvements and new equipment and in July last the Principal requested that we supply battleship linoleum. We purchased 126 square yards of linoleum at that time at a cost of $244.44. Consequently you will note that the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for the Youville School has been practically expended. In view of the information given above, you will realize that it is not possible for us to make any further allowance to this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nJanuary 3, 1945\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nIn Account with Youville Indian Res.

This year, as previous, we shall ask for Linoleum, but instead of the Battledhip, could we have the Marboleum which comes in a lighter color. We are planning to cover the main entrance hall; therefore a brighter shade would more suitable for this part of the house; it will require about 130 sq. yards.\n\nWe have inquired in the City and the Blowey-Henry Ltd. of which Mr. C.V. Cairns is the Agent, and they can procure this kind for us. We understand that it will be more expensive than the other, but we will pay the difference if necessary.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your usual kind cooperation and in thanking you in advance for this favor,\n\nwe remain,\n\nYours very sincerely.\n\nSister Rose Vincent, P.M.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 28, 1946.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, requesting us to purchase Marbolem for the Youville School.\n\nAn amount of $250.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation.

In October we received a voucher from the Indian Agent, requesting us to pay an amount of $250.00 towards the cost of labour required for painting and redecorating. We issued a cheque to your school for that amount and consequently the amount provided in the appropriation for the current fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 1946, has been paid.

What we received in December last was for 1945. Since our fiscal year ends December 31st, we took the liberty of putting in our application in the early part of the year in order to have it before the end.\n\nI did not realise that it was necessary to wait after March 31st since we always wrote in the middle part of February before. However, the application already sent is for the year 1946, and even though it is a very small portion in comparison of what we should have, we would like to have it as soon as possible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 11, 1946.\n\nDear Sister Vincent:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, I note, in your communication of February 21, that you would prefer Marboleum instead of Congoleum.

You should inquire, however, concerning the following items:\n\n(a) 2 filing cabinets,\n\n(b) 2 sewing machines - supplied Oct. 30, 1946,\n\n(c) 50 gallons of white paint, etc., supplied June, 1948.\n\n(Please find attached account covering this paint.)\n\nIt is suggested that these items be shipped to either the Edmonton Residential School or to the Ermineskin Residential School.\nThe school books, pencils, library books, etc., can be shipped to either the Michel or Stony Plain Schools. Some of the desks can also be stored for use in the projected Alexander School.\n\nI would recommend that you have the two teachers of the Michel and Stony Plain Schools visit the Youville School and arrange for them to take over the text books, scribblers, etc., such as they require. Other stocks of text books left over can then be shipped to the Ermineskin school.\n\nWe will expect a report from you in due course concerning this matter.\n\nA letter has been sent to the Reverend Principal advising her of this matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nc/c to Mr. Gooderham.\nOttawa, August 23, 1948\n\nReverend Sister Angelina Letarte,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nReverend and dear Sister:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of August 7th, we have advised Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson to visit you in the near future with regard to the preparation of an inventory of all Departmentally owned furnishings and equipment in your institution.\n\nIt is our intention to use the desks, books and other items in other day and residential schools in your vicinity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard M. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/NGD\ncc H. F. Neary, Esq., Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nAugust 31st, 1946.\n\nE. A. Robertson, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nEdmonton Indian Agency,\nWINTERBURN, Alberta.\n\nRe: Nouville Indian Residential School\nand Alexander's Indian Day School.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education has answered my letter of the 16th, file 110-6-7, copy of which was sent to you. In this he asks that we interview local contracting firms for the submission of contracts on either firm or cost plus 10% basis.\n\nRespecting the Alexander's Day School, a prior letter was received from Mr. Neary to say that the Chief Engineer of our Department had considered the tender of the Alberta Construction Company in the amount of $17,985.00 for the erection of the school was more than he was prepared to recommend since there was only one tender.\n\nThere is a very definite urgency for a school on the Alexander's Reserve, and possibly you can secure more tenders to erect it. Would you please advise if you may expect to get other tenders?\n\nYou might again interview the principals of the Alberta Construction Company and ascertain -\n\n1. If they can quote a lesser amount.\n2. When they would be prepared to commence the work if their company was fortunate enough in getting this job.\n\nYou may possibly find that the Alberta Construction Company tender is the best that can be secured, and though it now appears excessive to the Departmental Engineer, the price may not be at all out of line with existing building costs.\n\nAs you are fully aware of the urgency, I know that you will give this your immediate attention. To avoid any undue delay, send a copy of your reply to the Superintendent of Education. A copy of this letter is being submitted to him.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG:RM\nThe teachers' desks are also in very bad shape. They are very old and delapidated.\n\nYouville school has turned over to us some 18 boxes of books, scribblers and other school material and as soon as this can be checked over and listed a further report will be sent you. They have also turned over to us several cartons of winter clothing which had been made up from surplus army clothing supplied to them.\n\nWe have also taken over all of the school desks and disposition of the serviceable ones will be sent you later.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReference to your letter of Aug. 23rd in regard to departmentally owned equipment at the Youville School.\n\nIn regard to the two filing cabinets, Sister Superior advises that these are old style wooden cabinets, furnished through the War Assets Corporation. They are not of very much value and the convent would like to keep them for their own use, paying for them if necessary.\n\nRegarding the two sewing machines, these will be turned over to the Edmonton Indian Residential School for use at that point.\n\nRegarding the 50 gallons of white paint etc., invoices covering which were attached to your letter, Sister Superior advises me that this paint covers their 1947 paint appropriation and was required for renovating the boys' quarters. She claims the quarters were in very bad shape and that the paint was necessary to bring them up to a standard where they could be used for any other purpose and she feels that they should not be called upon to pay for this paint especially as they have had to repair damaged walls etc., at their own expense and that the buildings should be left in a proper state of repair when vacated by our pupils. Will you please let me know your further instructions regarding this paint.\n\nThe beds and teachers desks are the property of Youville School according to their records. If this is not correct will you please advise further. In this connection I might say that the beds are the small cot beds and I do not know where they could be used, in any case you will remember that similar beds at the Edmonton School have been replaced by double decker beds.\nSeptember 30, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the Youville School.\n\nIt is noted that the books, scribblers, etc., have been turned over to you and that you have taken all the serviceable school desks which were formerly purchased by the Department.\n\nIt is also noted that you have forwarded the two sewing machines to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nWe understand from your letter that the white paint has reached the school and you may, therefore, certify the account which was forwarded to you with Colonel Neary's letter of August 23rd.\n\nIt appears reasonable to allow the Sister Superior to use the paint in the manner mentioned in the fourth paragraph of your letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**FILE NUMBER:** 81562-15-6\n\n**DATE:** June 10th, 1946\n\n**TO:** Martin Banque Paint Co.

Mr. Rummalls, in his letter, refers to a portion of land near St. Albert and is anxious to know if the Government would be prepared to sell this property.\n\nI may state that the St. Albert Indian Residential School and the land surrounding this institution are the property of the church authorities. Apart from the fact that the Department pays a per capita grant to this institution, we have no ownership or control over the property at St. Albert.\n\nIn addition to the property at St. Albert, there is the farm adjoining the school known as the Edmonton Indian Residential School, operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. Inquiries have been made on more than one occasion with respect to the land attached to the Edmonton school and the willingness of the Government to sell a portion of this land. The Edmonton school has an enrolment of 150 pupils. The Department has always been opposed to the sale of any portion of the land known as the Edmonton Indian Residential School farm.\n\nDirector.\n| CHARGED OUT | RETURNED |\n|-------------|----------|\n| TO          | DATE     | BY      | DATE | C.R. | FILED BY |\n| R3          | 27-9-56  | cww     | 27-8-10 |      | cww      |\n\nNOT TO BE REMOVED FROM CENTRAL REGISTRY\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6365)\n\nFile 760-5, part 3\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nSupplies & Accounts. 1947 - 1950\n\nFile 760-9, part 1\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nSchool Land. 1937\n\nFile 760-10, part 1\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges. 1935\n\nFile 760-10, part 2\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nAdmissions & Discharges. 1936 - 1939\n\nFile 760-11, part 1\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nVocational Training. 1936 - 1948\n\nFile 760-14, part 1\nEdmonton Agency - Youville Residential School -\nLivestock. 1944\n\nFile 761-2, part 1\nGrouard Residential School - Quarterly Returns.\n1941 - 1949\nOttawa, January 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, you may inform the Principal of the St. Albert Residential School that the admission of George John is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nAEB/O'M.\nMEMO.\n\nStatement of Joe Adams\n\nI have always considered myself a Protestant and was educated in the Protestant school at Red Deer, Alta. I have always attended the Protestant church & have never attended the Roman Catholic church. I do not remember being baptized in the Catholic Church but I have been told that I was. I am still a Protestant & have not confessed the Catholic faith. I have one boy named John who is attending the Edmonton Residential School at the present time. The reason my boy Daniel went instead to the St. Albert School was that at the time he should have gone to school I was busy buying & selling my grain & I did not have time to take the boy to the school. When the Catholic priest Father Kenison came to meet me he told me that he had spoken to the agent & that I could send my boy to which school I liked, & did not see the Indian agent at the time, but as I was busy & could not go to the school myself & I was afraid that if I did not send the boy I would be sent to gaol, I let Father Kenison take the boy, at the same time I told Father Kenison that I did not want the boy baptized into the Catholic faith, he said alright. I had been instructed by farming Instructor Mr. Kerr to send my boy to\nMEMO.\n\nSchool by a certain date & I had only one more day to get to the school when Father Kinion came for the boy & that was the chief reason why I let him go to the St Albert School. If the government give instructions for my boy Daniel to be transferred from the St Albert school to the Edmonton Residential School I am quite willing to let the boy go to the Protestant School.\n\nThis statement has been given by me with my own free will & I have not been threatened or persuaded in any manner to give such a statement. All questions & answers were interpreted to me by William O'Donnell, Interpreter for the Edmonton Indian Agency in the presence of Mr Kerr, farming Instructor & William Burntich a member of the Pauls Band & I have made this statement without fear or favor.\n\nSigned\n\nJames Kerr\n\nW. O'Donnell\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply beg to report that on Tuesday the 14th of January I was at the Paul's Reserve and interviewed Joe Adams in connection with his boy Daniel going to the St. Albert School, father Henion was not at home when I went to the Reserve therefore he was not present when I interviewed Adams. I took a signed statement from Adams which I am sending to you for your information, from this statement you will observe that Joe Adams has not changed his religion.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Supt. Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJanuary 14th 1936.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nMay I again refer the Department to my letter of November 28th 1935 and your reply of December 5th 1935.\n\nRe-case of Daniel Adams, son of Joe Adams, now in the St. Albert Residential School.\n\nQuite apart from the particular case of this boy, I feel that by allowing this boy to remain at the St. Albert School will establish a most unsatisfactory precedent. As stated in my letter the boy comes from a Protestant home and the parents are still Protestant. This Paul's Band is historically Protestant and quite apart from vacillations one way and another the United Church ministers to the people regularly through a resident Missionary. This is the one Band in the whole of the Edmonton Agency where the United Church pretends to secure recruits for this school. It hardly seems fair that the Roman Catholic Priest should go into one of our homes, and take a child, and be allowed to secure this child just because he brings sufficient pressure of a religious nature upon an ignorant and susceptible Indian parent. I may say that reports from the reserve indicate that this pressure is being used and as in this case right over the head of the Agent, as the child was landed at St Albert, just after the parents had told both the Agent and our Missionary that the boy was coming here.\n\nIt may also be pointed out that the clause in the Indian Act provides that Protestant should go to Protestant schools etc., I take it\nthat such a clause was inserted to overcome the friction which must necessarily result from the well known unstable and fickle nature of the Indian. In other words the Department must make up its mind for the Imix Indian. It would appear that this case very definitely breaks down this idea. The father states that the other children are to come to this school, but one can see that this same battle must be fought over again when the other children come of school age. The same pressure will again be at work, and yet the parents are definitely Protestant.\n\nSome time ago, a child from the Edmonton Agency was brought to this school by its parents, the said parents being anxious to have the child here. After objections the child was sent to the other school, on the basis that all the antecedents of the child were R.C. Again a child was sent from Hobbema by the agent because R.C. parents wished him in this school. I was instructed to return the child to Hobbema. And did so. In trying to carry out the wishes of the Department I have as far as I know not taken a child off any reserve without first securing the consent of the Agent. A few days ago at Hobbema I was advised of a boy (Baptiste) who wished to come to this school. I phoned the Agent, he requested me not to take the child until certain matters were settled. I respected his wishes. I have always done so in the case of Mr. Laight. I do not think it fair that another school officer should go into our homes and thus disregard the instructions of the Department-to our disadvantage. This religious competition disgusts and humiliates me and I hesitate to quarrel over a little Indian lad, but if we are ever to solve this delicate matter there must be some respect for the rights of others. And as stated in the first place I feel that if allowed to pass this case will form an unfortunate precedent. These Wabamun Indians are a very low and ignorant lot, and if allowed to settle matters themselves will be sending part of their family one place and the rest another place. There are a few trouble makers among the Indian people on this\nJoe House is one. He denies it of course, but for some time we have felt it. When I say \"we\" I mean more than our Missionary people. I quite appreciate the fact that the Department has difficulty in determining the rights of the case, and I have been satisfied with most of the decisions of the Department. I also wish to say that the Indian Agent, Mr. Laight, has been fair and impartial, but I frankly think that this case if allowed to pass will bring no end of confusion to the work at Wabamun, and involve future cases.\n\nI have written very frankly, and as I view the case, I may be all wrong, but I do not think this case should be decided at once or without very serious consideration. I am speaking for the school and the church, as well as in the light of previous regulations and instructions of the Department.\n\nAll the above is very respectfully submitted.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 31, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to Daniel Adams who has recently been placed in the St. Albert Residential School.\n\nIt is regretted that you did not strictly comply with the instructions contained in official letter of the 3rd instant, by having Father Kenion with you at the time you interviewed Joe Adams.\n\nHowever, in view of the information that Adams has given you, it is considered that Daniel Adams should not have been placed in the St. Albert Residential School. Please request the Principal to return the boy to his father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, January 31, 1936.\n\nRev.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nRE: Daniel Adams.\n\nI wish to state that in the early part of 1935 I was requested by Joe Adams of Paul's Reserve to make application to have his children educated at St. Albert. Joe stated that his parents were both Catholics and that he believed himself to have been baptized by a priest. I investigated and discovered that he was baptized in the Catholic font when quite young.\n\nIn the autumn of 1935 Joe again approached me with the request that I try to place his son Dan in the convent. I promised to do what I could. The facts about his case were forwarded to the Indian Department. The reply was to the effect that he was permitted to choose in the matter of schools. I told him this and he agreed to send Dan to the convent. His later statement that he forbade me to baptize his boy is absolutely false.\n\nI was under the impression that the boy entered the Catholic school with the approval of the Department and that Joe's decision of October 23, 1935 was supposed to be final. I am rather surprised that the boy has been taken from the Catholic school as I know the policy of the Department is not to grant the varying wishes of the Indians. I am rather amazed to have made a mistake in placing Dan in a Catholic school since this was done with the approval of the proper authorities.\n\nI do not wish to cause unnecessary inconvenience to the Indian Department but simply to state my position and prevent misunderstanding of the case.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\n\nFurther to your letter File No. II6-I-IO of the 31st of January 1936, I beg to report that Daniel Adams has been taken from the St. Albert Residential School and returned to his home on the Paul's Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter I wish to state that I called at Father Keenan's residence at Spruce Grove, Alta., on my way to Paul's reserve on January 14th, but Father Keenan was away from home. However, when I made a visit to the Paul's reserve on February 13th, I called at Father Keenan's residence and took him to the reserve with me, in the presence of Father Keenan, James Kerr, Farming Instructor, and Joe Adams. I read the statement made by Joe Adams on January 14th, nothing was denied by Father Keenan at the time and I was under the impression that the case was settled satisfactory to all concerned. I have since that time received a statement from Father Keenan which he asked me to forward to the Department; please find this statement attached.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C.

Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa, April 7, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, requesting an amount to pay travelling expenses of children going home from the St. Albert Residential School for summer holidays, the Department considers that in the majority of cases the Indians should come for their children and also return them to the school without expense either to the Department or to the school management.\n\nI am writing Mr. Agent Laight and requesting him to assist you in this matter. He is being further informed that if it is necessary to allow travelling expenses he can submit a voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister V. M.

In reply please find attached applications for the admission of Elizear Cardinal and George Arcand for admission into the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to report that Jimmy Arcand the father of George Arcand refuses to sign the application for admission of the child. However, as the child has been in the school for some time I am forwarding the application to the Department.\n\nI regret the delay in sending these applications to the Department; this has been caused owing to the one parent refusing to sign and in the case of Cardinal he has been away from his reserve, in fact he was away when the child was placed in the school.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C.

I beg to report that I have discussed with the Rev. Sister Superior, Principal, of the St. Albert Indian Residential School the matter of transportation of children from this school going home on holidays. I explained to the Sister Superior that it was unnecessary for the Department to pay railway fares for the children going home to the Alexander and Michel reserves that the parents could very well go to the school and get the children. In the case of the children from the Alexis and Paul's reserves the parents would have a round trip of over 100 miles and I informed the Sister Superior that I would recommend to the Department that these children be sent home by train.\n\nTrusting my actions will be approved by the Department.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Supt., of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department approves the arrangements you have made with the Principal of the St. Albert Indian Residential School with regard to paying transportation costs of children going home from that school to the Alexis and Paul's reserves. From information given in official letter of the 7th ultimo this will amount to approximately $56.00.\n\nWhen the children leave, you may submit a voucher, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached proper receipts from the railway company.\n\nI enclose some forms which will enable you to secure the reduced rate for these children. You will note, however, that these forms require the railway fare to be paid in cash. No doubt, the Principal of the school will arrange this. The Department does not desire the usual requisition form to be used when paying transportation costs of pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that I have received two letters from Marlboro, Alta., one from Martin Desjarlais and one from Gaspar Paul, advising me that the three children of Ben Paul (Deceased) are being neglected by their mother and step-father; they inform me that these children are not properly fed and often have to go without food.\n\nThe Department will no doubt recall that the mother married a half-breed after the death of Ben Paul and that she was commuted at $50.00 in October 1935. This would still leave the children in Treaty as members of the Alexis Band.\n\nI would ask for authority to have these three children placed in the St. Albert Indian Residential School, the children's names and ages are as follows:\n\n- William Paul, age 10 years\n- Florence Paul, age 8\n- Adlin Victoria Paul, age 6\n\nIf these children are sent to the school it will be necessary for the R.C.M.P. Police to pick them up and put them on the train for Edmonton where they will be met by myself and taken to the school.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

Reference to above, memo from O.C. Edmonton, S.D., in connection with transfer of the above children to St Albert Indian residential School. I beg to report that I called at the home of Mrs Ben Paul (Mrs Joe Gaucher) at Marlboro, enquired as to when the children would be ready, so that I could take them to Edson and put them on the train for Edmonton.\n\n2. Mrs Ben Paul's attitude is that she will not allow the children to be taken from her; she does not wish them to be put in the Indian Residential School. States that they can be put to school in Marlboro. If the children are taken away, she must accompany them.\n\n3. Owing to the age of the children concerned, I do not consider it advisable to send them on the train alone. I would respectfully request that Mr Laight, Indian Agent be contacted, Mrs Paul's attitude explained, and authority given for her to accompany the children to Edmonton, where her grievances can be heard and adjusted with Mr Laight. It would mean force would have to be used, to take the children from Marlboro without their mother.\n\nPENDING.\n\nR. F. Matheson, Cpl.\nReg #11624, I/c Detachment.\n\nG.

Police to get the three Paul children and send them to Edmonton, I have now received the attached report from the police and would ask for further instructions in connection with these children.\n\nIn my opinion it is not necessary for the mother to accompany the children to Edmonton and if it is not advisable for the children to travel alone I would suggest that the Police bring them as far as Edmonton and I will meet the train and take the children to the school, to place the children in a school at Marlbro is out of the question as there is not an Indian school in that district.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions in the matter.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C.

For your information I beg to state that Fred Callihoo was a Treaty Indian and also his wife. During the regime of Mr. George H. Race as Indian Agent at this Agency Fred Callihoo and his wife left Canada and were in the States for approximately 6 or 7 years. After their return to their reserve they were told by Mr. Race, that owing to their being absent and living in a foreign country for 5 years continuously that under Section 13 of the Indian Act they had ceased to be members of the Band and that they could not again become members of that Band. I am unable to get any information whether or not Mr. Race took this matter up with the Department upon the return of Fred Callihoo and, therefore, to my knowledge they were not members of the Band; during my regime as Agent.\n\nFred Callihoo and his wife are now dead and the children are being taken care of by their uncle Johnny Callihoo.

C.

It is noted that this girl is not amenable to discipline and that it is recommended by the Doctor and yourself that she be placed in the Home of the Good Shepherd, Edmonton, providing arrangements can be made for her admittance to that institution.\n\nThe Department would appreciate, if the authorities of the Home of the Good Shepherd will accept this girl, to have her placed therein. We would be prepared to allow the Home remuneration for her maintenance, clothing and tuition at the rate of $14 per month, payable quarterly, upon receipt of an account, in triplicate, which should be submitted through your office and certified by you.\n\nIt is considered that approximately one year would be a sufficient length of time for this girl to remain in the Home. You should keep in touch with her case, and, about this time next year, you should make a recommendation as to whether she should be kept in an institution or returned to her home on the reserve. In any event, we would not be prepared to continue the grant for her maintenance in the Home for a period later than March 31st, 1938.\n\nYou may take this matter up with the authorities of the Home, and if they will consent to accept her on the above terms, you may arrange to have her placed there. Please advise the Department of the action taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C.

J. Guy, O.M.I., previous to his trip to Ottawa. Among other informations, I asked His Excellency if it was a fact that the Indian Agent is not duty-bound to help in the recruitment of pupils for the Indians Schools. A conversation with Mr. G.C. Laight, Indian Agent for Edmonton Agencies, led me to understand that according to the Indian regulations, this was left to the discretion and management of the principals, although he did help in the past.\n\nI simply inquired about this to Mgr. Guy for my own reference; but not to complain about our Agent. His Excellency advised me to write to you, Sir, in this respect for proper information.\n\nMay I take avail of this opportunity to ask for a copy of the Indian Act, which I presume should be at the disposal of the principals in charge of the Indian Schools.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for your kindness,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours truly devoted,\n\nSister V.M. Corriveau,\nPrincipal\nOttawa, March 19th, 1937.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I feel that, if you have any difficulty in securing the number of pupils required for the St. Albert Indian Residential School, you should bring the matter to the attention of Mr. Agent Laight. He will, no doubt, assist you in securing any additional pupils that you might require to bring the number up to that for which grant is provided.\n\nA copy of the Indian Act is being forwarded under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister V. M. Corriveau,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that Michel Kootenayoo has returned to the St. Albert Indian Residential School; this boy was discharged from the school upon the recommendation of the Doctor after he had been operated upon for mastoid, and was shown as discharged on the quarterly return for December 31st 1936. His discharge was authorized by Departmental letter No. II0-1-10 dated October 28th 1936.\n\nThe boy now appears to be quite well both mentally and physically although he still bears traces of facial paralysis.\n\nWill you please advise me if it will be necessary to have new application for admission signed by the father of this boy, the original application for admission of Michel was signed as at September 1st 1935.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 20, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that Michel Kootenhayoo has returned to the St. Albert Indian Residential School.\n\nAlthough this boy was granted his discharge on account of ill-health, it is now found that, after an operation for mastoid, he is quite well both mentally and physically. The Department will approve of his readmission. He should be given his previous register number, and when the return for the current quarter is being prepared a note should be made opposite his name stating the date he was readmitted. It will not be necessary to forward another application form for this boy.\n\nPlease inform the Principal of the approval granted for his readmission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG.

I would ask for authority to keep this boy in school for one more year; my reason for asking for this authority is that this boy is one of the trachoma cases at the school and Dr. J.J.

If, at the end of that time, it is considered necessary to keep him longer application should be made to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. C.

When application is made for the admission of such cases, full particulars should accompany the application.\n\nForm No. 406.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nAgency: Edmonton Band: Alexis\n\nChild's name: Armand Peter Age: 8 Weight: 58 lbs.\n\nHeight: 5'1\" Is child undernourished? No Has child any defect or deformity of body or limb? No Any defect of vision? No Any defect of hearing? No Any cutaneous disease or eruption? No Any signs of mental deficiency?

No\n\nIf child has any of the above defects, describe them:\n\nPulse rate: 72 Temperature: 98.2 If feverish, from what cause?\n\nHas this child active tuberculosis in your opinion? No\n\nIf so, of what part of the body and in what stage?\n\nTrachoma, or other communicable eye disease? No Syphilis? No\n\nDescribe any other condition in child or parents which would make the child an unsuitable candidate for admission to a residential school, or of which the Principal of the school should have warning:\n\nDate: 3/6/38 Time of day: 12:00 noon\n\nM.D.\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alberta,\nJune 15, 1938.\n\nMr. C.C. Laight,\nIndian Agency,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is Armand Peter's Application for Admission which was forwarded last January to Mr. Jones, Farm Instructor of Alexis Reserve, to have it signed by the boy's father, Baptiste Peter. The form was mislaid and a few weeks ago when I received news about it, I had a second application filled in and a second medical examination report made. Yesterday Mr. Peter came to visit his children and he signed the application which I address to you this morning.\n\nAs this child has not yet been regularly accepted by Ottawa, would not this omission be responsible for the reduction of $53.56 on the grant for the quarter ended March 31?\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister V.M. Corriveau,\nprincipal.\n\nSD\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant you may inform the Principal of the Youville Residential School that the admission of Armand Peter is approved. The Principal refers in her letter to you about a reduction in the amount of the grant which she expected to receive for the March quarter.\n\nIn checking the return it was found that there was a mistake in the addition of page one of the return. The total number of days should have been 13028 instead of 13208. Using the former figure, which was correct, resulted in a smaller amount being paid to the school than the Principal expected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. C.

During the after-noon of 28-2-39 while en route to the home of the above named I met Chief Fred GALANDO and Simon BRELAND, they were then on their way to St Albert with Donald BRELAND age 12.

I continued the patrol to the BRELAND home accompanied by Chief Fred GALANDO and interviewed Mrs. BRELAND.

There appeared to be no reason why Mrs. BRELAND did not want these children to go to school except that she did not want them to leave home.\n\n5.

This report indicates that good work is being done.\n\nI am anxious, however, to know what provision, if any, is being made for vocational training for the boys. Of course I understand that they have the advantage of considerable training on the farm but the Honourable the Minister is extremely interested in having the boys receive other vocational training as well. In replying you should let me have complete information regarding any special training given to the boys.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

They work during the half-day reserved to manual training under the instruction of their supervisor. At present they are doing the woodwork required for the Exhibition. After this training they will attend to the everyday repairs in the School. One boy works half of the day in the bakery and in the shoemaker's shop.\n\nIt is our ambition to see these attempts at vocational training develop and progress gradually for the welfare of our boys.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister V.M.Corriveau,\nSister V.M.Corriveau, principal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to vocational training for the boys at the Youville residential school. It is evident from the contents of your letter that you recognize the importance of vocational training for the boys and I feel certain that you will continue and enlarge this branch of the school work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister V.M. Corriveau,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nINDIANS' ART IS ADMIRE\n\nTourists Gasp at Saddle Trappings, Jackets, Gauntlets\n\nGay knitted gloves and beaded buckskin gauntlets are only part of the contrast between traditional and modern Indian work in the exhibit under the grandstand. The work of the students in the Indian schools is on a par, and the same in subject as that turned in by their white friends, but the showing of handcraft shows that the ancient arts are not being lost.\n\nFrom tourists particularly, the buckskin jackets, gauntlets, saddle trappings with their colorful beadwork, produced drawn gasps of admiration. One individual squaw arranged her beaded earrings on a birch bark frame.\n\nThere are a number of birch bark sewing cases, some of them others with porcupine quill decorations.\n\nThe school work includes bright smocks, knitted and crocheted goods, cross-stick samplers, maps, and art work. All of these are the efforts of students from the Youville school at St. Albert and St. Mary's Roman Catholic school at Cardston.\nCENSUS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES\n\nAs at April 1, 1937\n\nQUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED BY THE DEPARTMENT\n\n| QUESTION | CODING SECTION |\n|----------|----------------|\n| 1.

At that time he outlined the policy of the Branch regarding manual training and endeavoured to explain the matter as fully as possible to your teachers.\n\nDue to present conditions it will not be possible for the Department to allow any large amount in order to encourage the teaching of manual training in your school. However, it is hoped that you will co-operate with us in having this work commence during the academic year 1941-42.\n\nTo assist you in this regard Mr. Doucet is preparing a curriculum covering woodwork especially which it is hoped will be followed at your school during the coming academic term.\n\nAt the time of his visit Mr. Doucet made a careful check on the equipment that you have and has made definite recommendations to me regarding the additional equipment which he considers should be supplied in order to carry out the curriculum that you will receive. The cost of these tools will be borne by the Department and in addition you may expend an amount of $25.00 for necessary material.\n\nRev. Sister Ste. Sabine,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nYou will realize that the Department's wishes in regard to manual training can only be carried out with the co-operation of yourself and I feel certain that you recognize the value of this training and that the school management will provide at their own expense the space required for the classes and arrange to have some member of the staff follow the curriculum that you will receive.\n\nI am informed that there is a small space available and it will be necessary for you to arrange for someone to teach the work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

R. A. Hoey,\nSupt of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nNo doubt you are aware that our school opened only on September 22. You will therefore understand that it is impossible for me to send in the monthly report for the wood-work class.\n\nI shall simply submit to your approval, or rectification, my plan for this work. I have decided to give three lessons of an hour each per week. If this is not satisfactory, I shall ask for longer lesson periods. As this is a four-year course, I think that the pupils of 12-13 years of age should take the course, while those of 14-16 years should be given, for this year, practical work, such as repairing, etc.\n\nWe have been given as shop, a classroom, not presently in use. It is well lighted, 30' by 25', with ample blackboard space for demonstrations. I really believe that good work can be done here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSupervisor.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo and note its contents.\n\nI was aware that the schools would be late in opening, due to the provincial government's action in regard to epidemics. However, as you will note on the reverse of the Monthly Report, I desire a report every month even if instruction has not been given.\n\nI am pleased to note that you will have splendid accommodation for the manual training class. Your plan, however, would not be effective. An hour period for woodwork is practically a loss of time. You will readily understand what I mean. The time that it takes the pupils to get ready and put away their tools leaves very little time for instruction. The minimum required for the course is three hours per week, but these three hours should be consecutive. This amounts to an afternoon a week.\n\nYour impression that this is a four-year course is faulty. It is designed for a three-year course. I have no objection, however, to young boys taking the course if you judge they are able to profit by it.\n\nAs regards the practical work for the boys of 14 to 16, your idea, with restrictions however, would be satisfactory. It is hardly possible to require a boy\n\nMr. Leo Mailloux,\nSupervisor,\nYouville Indian Res. School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nto do repair work if he is not familiar with the common manipulation of tools. The course provides for this kind of work if the boys are found able to do the repair work. This is the reason for the Record Sheet for all jobs done.\n\nWishing you the best of success in this important work for the coming year,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. J.

I would like to hear how this training is progressing at the Youville School.

Kindly excuse the delay.\n\nI am sorry to say, Mr. Doucet, that the boys' supervisor, Mr. Leo Maliloux, claims himself duty-bound to stay with his sick parent.\n\nAs to physical training, Mr. Bird has discontinued giving lessons, so Mr. Alx Rowland who was following this course, to impart it to our boys, feels incapable of giving this training satisfactorily as yet.\n\nI am sure you realize how difficult it is to find competent men for our schools, especially at this time, when so many are called for military service, but rest assured that I do my utmost to find someone to give proper training to the big boys.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSr. Ste Sabine.\n\nSr. Ste Sabine, Principal.\nExtract from Inspector R.J. Scott's report on the Youville Indian Residential School visited in December, 1941.\n\nSome woodwork was started with Grade 4. Unfortunately the instructor had to leave this school after making a good start. The senior girls were doing good work in the sewing room.\nDear Sister Ste. Sabine:\n\nThe Department has recently received Inspector Scott's report regarding his visit to the Youville Residential School in December, 1941. This report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Some woodwork was started with Grade 4. Unfortunately the instructor had to leave this school after making a good start. The senior girls were doing good work in the sewing room.\"\n\nAs you are aware, the Department is very anxious to have vocational work for the boys and we have incurred considerable expense in sending Mr. Doucet to Alberta to outline our programme as well as supplying certain equipment to assist you in this work. I should, therefore, appreciate your advising me immediately what steps are being taken to have the work done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSister Ste. Sabine,\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nYouville Indian Residential School,\nSt. Albert, Alberta,\nMarch 1, 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to yours of February 13, I am pleased to say that we now have an instructor for the boys, who claims that, by giving two and if necessary three lessons of three hours a week, he can yet complete the first year's course in woodworking.\n\nFrom the departure of our first instructor, November 25, to February 1, the boys have done quite an amount of repairs, as the report which will be sent in a few days to Mr Doucet will show.\n\nMay I be allowed here to extend my most sincere thanks to your Department for sending Mr. Doucet to assist and advise on vocational work with our Indian Children. His talks and demonstrations have been an inspiration to us all. I am convinced that the expense thus incurred will be amply repaid by the more efficient work done.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSr. Ste.

Hoey,\nSupt. of welfare & Training,\n\nSir:\n\nI must apologize for delay in answering yours of December 1941, File II.O.I-II., re: wool Carding machine & spinning wheel. I wrote to different firms for names and prices, and I am enclosing illustrations received of machines desired, with prices.\n\nIf your Department could supply us with these, we would be most thankful, as we believe they will be most helpful in teaching our Indian girls to make use of old woolen clothes etc.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSr. Ste. Sabine, Principal\nOttawa,\nApril 17, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to a wool carding machine and a spinning wheel for the Youville Residential School. The Department approves your purchasing 6 hand carders at a price of $1.95 each.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve the purchase of the other equipment at the present time, due to the fact that such equipment will not be available to pupils when they return home and consequently it would not be of much value for them to learn their use.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of April 17th regarding the purchase of hand carders for the Youville Residential School.\n\nWe have several of these wool-carders on hand, but find them unsatisfactory when using old wool. Instead of these we would like to purchase a New Improved Carding Machine priced at $14.95. Several other institutions have been using it with success. This machine is also in use in many homes of Alberta.\n\nYours,\n\nSr. Ste Sabine, supr.\nSr. Ste Sabine,\nPrincipal.\nDear Madam:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 28th ultimo, you may purchase one improved carding machine at a price of $14.95 instead of the wool carders authorized in my letter of the 17th ultimo.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

May we hope that this sum be reimbursed to our school.\n\nPlease find also under cover the woodwork report for May-June.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nSr Ste Sabine, s.g.m.\n\nSister Ste Sabine  \nPrincipal\nYouville Indian Residential School  \nSt. Albert, Alberta  \nJuly 7, 1942\n\nMr. R.

We were asked immediate payment; may we ask for the refund of the sum paid\u2014$14.95.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSister Ste Sabine  \nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 14, 1942.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letters of the 7th instant, with reference to expenditures that you have incurred in connection with manual training.\n\nOfficial letter of August 9, 1941, did not authorize you to purchase additional tools. It only authorized an expenditure for materials. However, the Department is prepared to pay the account of the Ashdown Hardware Company. Before this can be done, it will be necessary for you to certify on the account that the goods have been received. If you have already paid the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, you should attach their receipt to the account.\n\nI note that you have secured a carding machine at a cost of $14.35.

We do not furnish bottle mucilage from our Stationery. I am rather inclined to believe that this is an error and should be wood glue. If that is the case you may include an amount of wood glue sufficient for the necessities of the woodworking class.\n\nWith reference to the thimbles, measuring tape, etc., also included on the requisition, the Department does not furnish these for the schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nYOUVILLE\nIndian Residential School\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nThe following is a list of tools required for the first course in the line of wood work.\n\n1 Wood chisel\nfour different kinds of saws\nFour \" \" Keyhole saws\nAssorted Files\nOne rip saw\nOne cross-cut saw\nOne wood planer\nFour different kinds Hammers\nTwo screw drivers\nTin cutters\nSand paper\nAugers - Brush & blades, big and small\nTwo draw-knives\nOne plier.\n\nCan you fill this requisition as soon as possible, we will appreciate very much.\n\nVery truly yours\n\nSister Rose Vincent, S.G.M.\n\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian School,\nSt-Albert-Alberta.\nYOUVILLE\nIndian Residential School\nSt. Albert, Alberta.\n\nThe following is a list of tools required for the first course in the line of wood work.\n\n1 Wood chisel\nfour different kinds of saws\nFour \" \" Keyhole saws\nAssorted Files\nOne rip saw\nOne cross-cut saw\nOne wood planes\nFour different kinds Hammers\nTwo screw drivers\nTin cutters\nSand paper\nAugers - Brush & blades, big and small\nTwo draw-knives\nOne plier.\n\nCan you fill this requisition as soon as possible, we will appreciate very much.\n\nVery truly yours\n\nSister Rose Vincent, S.J.M.\nPrincipal,\nYouville Indian School,\nSt-Albert-Alberta.\nFor the musical training, we always had three general exercises each week beside other rehearsals for many occasions, but from now on the teachers will give the daily period as before.\n\nIt would be our utmost desire, dear Mr Phelan, to provide the children with all these beneficial trainings, but we lack the necessary financial means to do so. We give them good schooling, we watch over their health by giving them warm clothing and good food, and you know how much these commodities cost at the present time, and this is all we can afford.\n\nYou will understand that our school built in 1919, now needs repairs and alterations and it is urgent that we provide for these, before other extra expenses be encountered. The $250.00 appropriation we received annually from the Dept. is a very small portion of the large amount we had to pay for the last three years for repairs, paintings, etc. Two of the quarterly cheques do not cover the yearly interests, insurances and taxes, so it leaves us only the other half to meet all our other obligations.\n\nMay I add, Mr Phelan, that we would be most thankful to you and to your Department if you could assist us in any way to provide the means to carry on the various trainings as you desire, but without help, I am very sorry, we cannot do better.\n\nHoping these explanations will be satisfactory to you, and believe,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nSister Rose Vincent o.p.m.\n\nPrincipal.\nYouville Indian Res. School,\nSt-Albert-Alberta,\nJanuary, 22nd, 1946.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Chief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nIn reply to your letters dated Dec. 31st and January 7th, permit me to state the reason why certain special trainings have not been undertaken this year. Previously, we have given the boys training in woodwork and we supplied tools and material as best we could. We cannot afford to do so this year as not only new tools and material should be supplied, but we cannot obtain the services of an instructor. An ordinary carpenter cannot be hired for less than one dollar per hour and this beyond our means.\n\nAs to farm work, we have had a great deal of trouble with the big boys in the last two years. They expect to be remunerated for the least work they do and they show such a lack of interest in all their work that the men on the farm feel they are wasting time trying to teach them. It would require a man solely to direct, and that would mean another monthly salary of $100.00.\n\nThe older girls have had their regular daily periods of training in sewing, but as to cooking we have had not enough help to teach them the regular lessons prescribed, although a few in the morning and as many in the afternoon are helping to prepare and cook the daily menus of the household, thus receiving some training. Knowing these conditions, would you kindly tell us how we should make the monthly reports as required in your letter of January 7th.\n\nAs for the Physical Training, we never had a regular instructor for either boys or girls. Mr A. Durocher has volunteered to take the boys sometime before Christmas to add an extra number to the concert given for the parents on Christmas Day. Mr Durocher will not continue giving P.T. unless he is paid to do it. We could now have a lady to give the girls the same training if proper remuneration were available.\nOttawa, January 30th, 1946.\n\nReverend Sister Rose Vincent, Principal, Youville Indian Residential School, St. Albert, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant and I have carefully taken note of its contents.\n\nThe Department realizes the great difficulty that some schools are facing when endeavouring to obtain qualified instructors. We also realize that due to the advanced season very little, if anything could be accomplished this year. We are anxious, however, that immediate steps be taken to improve the condition for next September. On our part, we are prepared to give you a special grant towards material needed in teaching Manual Training, provided a qualified Instructor is secured. We are also willing to help defray the salary expense of such an Instructor. I am enclosing forms which should be completed by an Instructor who might apply for the position. He should have some teaching experience, some training in general shop and be able to take charge of the boys physical training and organized games. The Department will pay half the salary provided the services of the teacher could be secured for $1500.00 a year or less; In other words, if a teacher requests $1500.00 for the academic year, this Department will allow $750.00, the School Management providing the balance of the salary plus room and board. If the salary is less than $1500.00, it is understood we would pay only half the amount. We feel that you will be able to secure the services of a qualified Instructor, as Alberta definitely trains teachers for this kind of work.\n\nI have noticed your tool requisition. I think that it would be better to wait until you have secured an instructor then he can go into the matter of tools more carefully. He should, then, submit a requisition to us and\nwe will endeavour to supply the tools required for this instruction.\n\nAs regards the girls domestic science, that is, cooking, sewing, knitting, etc., we can not imagine any difficulty being encountered. The Basic Operation requirements, copies of which have been sent to your school are the result of every day occupations around the school. It should not, therefore, be difficult to train the girls in these activities.\n\nShould there be anything else that we can do to further encourage the integrated program of studies in your school, please let me know.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting the Youville Indian Residential School\nFor the month of March 1947\n\nROUTINE\n\nAt the time of my visit there were:\n- 146 pupils in the classrooms.\n- Are the classroom registers kept up to date?

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been informed that the Department of Indian Affairs sends, upon request, goats for the Residential School farms, with instructions as to the way of proceeding to spread this beneficial industry among the Indians.\n\nI wrote to our Indian Agent, Mr. G.C. Laight, last week, asking him if he thought it advisable to request a certain number for our farm.\n\nIn answer, he suggested that I write direct to you, Mr. Hoey. This, I confidently do today, as I know you have always shown a keen interest in the welfare of our school, and have always done your utmost to foster its further development. May I hope that you will add to your favors, that of kindly bringing this request before your Department?\n\nAllow me, dear Mr. Hoey, to renew our most sincere thanks for your kind concern in our Institution and its inmates.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Rose Vincent, S.G.M.\nSister R. Vincent,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 5, 1944.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Principal of the Youville Indian Residential School. The subject matter of this communication, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt is my understanding that it is somewhat difficult to secure goats for the time being anywhere in Alberta and only a little less difficult to secure them in the province of British Columbia. If, however, goats are anywhere available at a reasonable price, you are authorized to purchase five female and one male goat for the use of the Youville School. I am not at all sure that this is the best season of the year to make such a purchase. It is just possible that goats for our schools should be purchased early in the spring. I make this suggestion for the simple reason that they require less care during the spring, summer and fall months than they do during the winter. However, this is a matter in respect to which you can exercise your own best judgment. If you are at Edmonton at any time in the immediate future, you might discuss this matter personally with the Principal of the Youville School.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 5, 1944.\n\nMy dear Sister:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of July 31, in which you express a desire to undertake the feeding and care of a number of goats at your school.\n\nI may state that our policy in providing a limited number of goats at residential schools represents an attempt to provide instruction to Indian pupils, particularly the senior boys and girls, in the care and feeding of goats. We have been informed by the best nutritionists in the country that it is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to supply a well balanced diet for Indians, particularly Indian children, in the absence of milk. In view of the fact, therefore, that it is not practicable to keep cows on a number of the smaller reserves, we have deemed it advisable to encourage certain bands of Indians to keep goats.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter addressed by me to Inspector Schmidt. It is altogether likely that the Inspector will take the steps necessary to purchase a few goats for your school, if such goats are available.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for the words of appreciation contained in your communication.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in quarter of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Harvey\n\nDated: March 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: APR 7, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The grant per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at July 1, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | TOTAL NUMBER

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Harvey\n\nDated December 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils enrolled on the Roll, and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of capital grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Harvey\n\nDated: March 31, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ground Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph H. Harris\n\nDated: June 30, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this: ........................................... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 103\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Government Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Harvey\n\nDated: September 30, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Regina, Oct. 10, 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ground Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Habag\n\nDated: March 31st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nP.J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, putting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...Driffield Residential...School for the Quarter ended...June 30,...1944.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Haber\n\nDated: June 30,...1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driffield Alta\n\nthis...3rd July,...1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Grand Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Habay\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: October 10, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ground Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal Joseph H. Harvey\n\nDated December 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Duffield, Ont., this 16th Jan., 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 469\nReq.

Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alberta.\n\nReturned herewith is Duplicate Copy of the September Quarter Return for the Grouard Residential School. You may draw the Principal's attention to the fact that only one copy of the Quarter Return is required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days present of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at July 7th 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 10th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nOct. 17, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total\" for each pupil during quarter.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated April 3rd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPIL | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 283             | Robert B.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, so called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5th 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this JULY 24th 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the

Quarter: $3,900.00\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No 2; and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is inserted by filling the column under the heading \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

She has step-father, a British soldier asked to have her discharged, stating he would later be responsible for her. He discharged her separately. We have not heard from him nor been able to locate him. In consequence of this, we are unable to make any payment on the treaty list, considering the amount paid by her former husband, including such a procedure to be in conformity with your Department.\n\nRev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is calculated by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTERED NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | ATTENDANCE |\n|------------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| D281             | Bennett Gray    | 14  | 1   |      | Whitefish      |                         |            |\n| D285             | Tom Schoenaker  | 14  | 1   |      |                 |                         |            |\n| 295              | Charlie Johnson | 15  | 1   |      | Lawrence        |                         |            |\n| D287             | Raymond Johnson | 14  |     |      | Whitefish      |                         |            |\n| 300              | Francis Johnston| 12  |     |      |                 |                         |            |\n| D205             | J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GROUARD RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended SEPTEMBER 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 15th 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3638\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| 200             | Francis Johnston | 16  | M   | Whitefish      | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 216             | Stephen Labouane | 15  | M   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 239             | Walter Twin      | 16  | M   | Sevrige        | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 240             | Albert Twin      | 16  | M   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 254             | George Chalifoux | 16  | M   | Ground         | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 255             | Raymond Labouane | 15  | M   | Whitefish      | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 257             | Walter Nonovetis | 13  | M   | Sevrige        | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 240             | Russell Grey     | 16  | M   | Whitefish      | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 245             | Raymond Nakagun  | 9   | M   | Lubicon Lk.    | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 246             | Harold Twin      | 11  | M   | Sevrige        | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 251             | Joseph Labouane  | 18  | M   | Lubicon Lk.    | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 252             | Jean Marie       | 16  | F   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 253             | Mr. John         | 10  | M   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 254             | Daniel           | 10  | M   | Whitefish      | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 255             | Henry Paul Talman| 10  | M   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 256             | Joseph Jackson   | 10  | M   | Tsulim Lk.     | 1                 |                        |            |\n| 257             | Isaac Johnston   | 15  | M   |                |                   |                        |            |\n| 258             | Tommy R.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, any payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days the names of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Quarter:** 7448\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during Quarter:** 81/67\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $81.67 x 68.00 = $5,308.55\n\n**Total:** $6,211.00\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GROUARD RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Nov. 11th 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Nov. 15th 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**LESSE SLAVE LAKE Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF the GROUARD RESIDENTIAL School at GHUWARD on LESSE SLAVE LAKE Reserve for Quarter ended Sept.30 1947**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 287             | Raymond Tellman | 16  | 1   |      | Whitefish       | 1             | 1                |                          | Sept.1,37 62               | 0          |\n| 295             | Charlie Twin    | 16  | 1   |      | Sawridge        | 1             | 1                |                          | Aug.27,38 62               | 0          |\n| 300             | Francis Johnston| 13  | 1   |      | Whitefish       | 1             | 1                |                          | Sept.,19,38 92              | 21         |\n| 306             | David Chalifoux  | 15  | 1   |      | Grouard         | 1             | 1                |                          | \" 3,35 62                  | 0          |\n| 316             | Stephen Laboucane| 14  | 1   |      | Whitefish       | 1             | 1                |                          | \" 10,40 92                 | 21         |\n| 328             | Walter Twin     | 15  | 1   |      | Sawridge        | 1             | 1                |                          | Sept.1,41 92               | 20         |\n| 329             | Albert Twin     | 13  | 1   |      | \"               | 1             | 1                |                          | \" \" \" 92                   | 20         |\n| 332             | Lloyd Sinclair   | 14  | 1   |      | Clear Hills     | 1             | 1                |                          | Nov.6,42 92                | 0          |\n| 324             | George Chalifoux | 18  | 1   |      | Grouard         | 1             | 1                |                          | Jan.5,42 92                | 21         |\n| 325             | Raymond Laboucane| 11  | 1   |      | Whitefish       | 1             | 1                |                          | Sept.1,42 92               | 21         |\n| 337             | Walter Menosetis | 12  | 1   |      | Sawridge        | 1             | 1                |                          | \" \" \" 92                   | 21         |\n| 340             | Russel Grey     | 13  | 1   |      | Whitefish       | 1             | 1                |                          | \" \" \" 92                   | 21         |\n| 348             | Raymond Eskagon  | 8   | 1   |      | Lubican Lk      | 1             | 1                |                          | \" 11,44 92                 | 21         |\n| 349             | Edward Twin     | 11  | 1   |      | Sawridge        | 1             | 1                |                          | \" 1,44 92                  | 21         |\n| 351             | Joseph Laboucane | 11  | 1   |      | Lubican Lk      | 1             | 1                |                          | \" 25,45 92                 | 21         |\n| 352             | Jean Marie      | 13  | 1   |      | \"               | 1             | 1                |                          | \" \" \" 92                   | 21         |\n| 353             | Wm.

Laird, agent of Indian Affairs at Brouard, I see that the same difficulty exists at The St. Bernard's Br., at Brouard. So I was told to let you know the desks required to have the school up to date.\n\n8 single desks of 7 to 9\n\n10 \" 12\n16 \" 14.\n\nThanking you, I am your obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmilda Slater\nEdmonton, September 10th\nOttawa, October 5th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, furnishing a list of the desks required for the use of St. Bernard's Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you request that 40 desks of the sizes mentioned in your letter be supplied. I would point out that the Department allows a per capita grant to your school for 30 pupils, and we can supply desks for that number only. Kindly state the condition and kind of desks at present in use in your school, and the number of same that are serviceable. You may forward a requisition for the number - not exceeding 30 - required to replace the desks that are not in good condition, and you should also give the ages of the children for whom the new desks are required. Please also give full shipping directions. As soon as we have this information we will be in a position to decide the number of desks that can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of October 5th, 1923 (file 131-1-5) and I agree that the Department allows only a capital grant to our school for 30 pupils, though there are at present 41 pupils on the roll. It is the reason why I thought the Department could supply just a number of desks.\n\nAll our desks are homemade and the Inspector of School did not find them very serviceable.\n\nHere are the ages of the children:\n\n| Age | Number |\n|-----|--------|\n| 15   | 4      |\n| 14   | 4      |\n| 13   | 5      |\n| 12   | 8      |\n| 11   | 6      |\n| 10   | 3      |\n| 9    | 4      |\n\nThe nearest station for Crowfoot is Balda, where an agent is residing.\n\nWith my respectful thanks, I am your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT\n\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1923.\nReq.

BERNARD RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, April 4, 1925.\n\n---------------------\n\nRECOMMENDED:-\n\n1.- That the number of standard desks be brought up to the quota of children in this school. Some of the desks in use are very obsolete and very unsatisfactory.\n\nL. R. Yule,\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, recommends that the number of standard desks be brought up to the quota of children in this school, as some of the desks in use are very obsolete and very unsatisfactory. In this connection I would point out that desks to accommodate 30 pupils were supplied this school in November, 1923. As the number of grant earning pupils has since been increased to 40, and the last quarterly return shows that there was an enrolment of 50 pupils, it may be necessary to supply a number of extra desks, if the half-day system is not in effect in the classrooms at this school.\n\nIf you consider that it is necessary that further desks be supplied, you should state the size and number of each size required. You should consult the Principal in the matter. Desks are manufactured to meet the requirements of pupils of various ages, as follows:\n\n- No. 6 - Pupils 5 to 7 years.\n- No. 5 - 7 to 9 \"\n- No. 4 - 10 to 15 \"\n- No. 3 - 11 to 14 \"\n- No. 2 - 15 to 18 \"\n\nIt may be that if some front or rear seats were supplied it would save space in the classroom. Care should, however, be taken to give the sizes required. They are manufactured in the same sizes as the desks. Full shipping directions should also be given. The request for these further desks should only be made if you are assured that they are absolutely required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\nINDIAN OFFICE\n\nAt Grouard, Alta.,\n\nJune 3rd 1925\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letters of May 26th, ultimo, Nos. 131-1-5 and 131-4-5,\n\nI beg to state that St. Bruno's Residential School is some distance from Grouard, but I will endeavour to see the Principal before I leave on my Annuity Payment trip, on the 9th, inst.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nSt. Bernard's Mission, Grouard, Alberta July the 18th 1925.\n\nTo Mr. Duncan Scott, Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe know how eager the Department of Indian Affairs is to provide its schools with everything for their proper management and equipment.\n\nProbably the most important question in connection with any establishment is the water supply. In our case this has always been a source of drudgery, inconvenience and great expense, which can be readily understood when one considers that the water has to be hauled up hill from the river at an altitude of 200 feet.\n\nIn our endeavours to better the situation, we have never gone beyond the plans which would be to establish a system whereby water might be pumped from the river; but our means are not adequate to the scheme and we do not foresee the possibility of carrying it out unless help comes from some other quarter.\n\nIt occurred to me that the Department might see here an opportunity for helping a good cause and if it were so inclined what a boon it would mean for the school and how greatly the favour would be appreciated by all concerned.\n\nTrusting that my hopes may be realized regarding this important project,\n\nI remain, Sir, your respectful servant.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Sept. 15, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, with regard to the existing water supply for the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, and in reply I would suggest that you furnish me with a sketch plan of the location of the building, and its distance from the lake. If possible you should indicate also the exact altitude of the basement of the building above the lowest level of the water. The accompanying information blank should be filled in and sent with your sketch plan. When this is received this question will be given further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

In this connection I would refer you to official letter of May 26th, last.\n\nPlease forward your reply at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nAct. Asst.

The water is now pumped into the building from an artesian well and is not serviceable on account of its hardness, and is a source of great expense to the management of the school. The water for the laundry and the cooking is carted from the river a distance of 1500 feet and to an altitude of 150 feet, which means a lot of hardship. The average amount of water required is 1500 gallons.\n\nI have prepared for your information an estimate of the cost of an installation which will provide for sixty persons consisting of a typhoon pressure pump of a capacity of 40 gallons per minute operated by a three H.P. oil engine. This pumping outfit could be installed in a small building erected on top of an intake well close to the shore of the river, a distance of about 1300 feet from the nearest building. The water would be pumped into a tank in one of the buildings, which would provide for a quantity of water sufficient for domestic purposes only. The cost of the machinery would be $550.00. The two inch galvanized iron pipe and fittings for connection to the water tank and the various buildings would cost $500.00. The intake well and the machinery building would cost $500.00, making a total $1,550.00.\n\nIn view of the fact that this school is not the property of the Department I would suggest that the above mentioned equipment be granted by the Department, on condition that the Principal will arrange for all the labour required, such as the excavating work, the laying of pipe and the installation of machinery, etc., which will represent an expenditure of at least $3,000.\n\nAs mentioned in the Principal's letter of July 18th, this institution has no means to pay the cost of such an installation.........\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\ninstallation, and if funds are available I would recommend that the above mentioned request be given favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nJanuary 9, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nSt. Bernard's Indian Residential School, near Grouard, Alta., has urgent need of a proper water supply system. At the present time, all water required for washing and cooking is hauled from a river some 1500 ft. distant.\n\nThe school management and the Church authorities have urged the Department to install a pressure pump and gas engine in a small building above an intake well at the shore and to supply a pipe to the school water tank. The well, building and machinery will cost $1650. I propose to ask the school management to be responsible for the excavation, laying of the pipe, installation of the machinery and all other labour the cost of which is estimated by the Department engineer, who has outlined the proposed scheme, at approximately $3,000. If the school authorities are willing to undertake the work, I consider the Department should allow the $1650 necessary for machinery and materials.

School, Grovedale, Alberta.\n\nI have also sent you under separate cover, Catalogue on the Novo Engine, which will give you complete information in reference to the construction and operation of the Novo Frost Proof & Dust Proof Engine. This engine, which we have quoted you on, will run on either gasoline or kerosene, and is a frost proof outfit, that is, we give perpetual guarantee against any damage from frost, and will replace, free of charge, cylinder that is broken from frost.\n\nWe are also sending catalogue on Blackmer Pumps. We are quoting you on No. 4 Rotary Pump, which has a capacity of 50 gallons per minute and I would like you to read the information in reference to the Blackmer Pumps. This pump will never need any priming, when placed within 15' of the supply. It is the closest trade pump than can be purchased anywhere and owing to the particular construction of it the replacements are very small. It is fitted with tight and loose pulley and can be operated with belt supplied and carries with it a guarantee of satisfaction.\n\nWe have also quoted on the other equipment which you asked for, quoting the net price, f.o.b. London, with Sales Tax added and also the freight to Milda Alberta.\n\nIf we are successful in securing this business we can make immediate shipment on this equipment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPlease see Catalogues\n\nJ.C.

He states that there should have been 70 lengths of 20 ft. to make up the 1400 ft. charged in the account, and it is inferred that he only received 69.

Paget.\n\nWith further reference to our letter of May 13th, your file 131-1-5, we have today received from the mill a copy of their tally sheet and we find that lengths were shipped to Enilda station, Alberta, but that the total amount of feet amounted to 1407'.\n\nWe therefore overshipped 7' as your order specified 1400, and as previously advised we believe that your Superintendent is under the impression that the pipe is shipped in 20 foot lengths exact, whereas mostly every length shipped was over twenty feet by a number of inches.\n\nWe trust our explanation will now clear the matter, and that invoice can be passed for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE CO., LTD.\n\nBY\u2014\n\nCFO/T\n\nMONTREAL, QUEBEC, ST.

Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 30th April last, returning the account of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company Ltd., for material supplied for the St. Bernard's Indian School and pointing out an apparent shortage of pipe, I beg to state that the matter has been taken up with the firm and I am advised that 69 lengths were shipped to Emilda Station, and that the total amount of feet was 1407\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). They therefore over-shipped \\(7\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches over and above the order for 1400 feet. You are evidently under the impression that the pipe was shipped in 20 feet lengths exact, whereas mostly every length shipped was over 20 feet by a number of inches. It is therefore quite evident that there was no shortage, but instead you have a surplus. Kindly re-check the measurements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

You yourself know as also the numerous tourists who have favored us with their visits, that what we call the boys' department is a very old building. It was built with lors thirty-six years ago, very satisfactory at the time, but has now become dangerous and unsanitary for the inmates. It is for this reason that I beg you to kindly use your influence with the department in regard to this request, namely to construct a new building for the boys according to the enclosed plan and estimate. It will be simple, very comfortable, and not too expensive. We will help in the expenditures.\n\nI rely on your devotedness which has always been shown towards the Indians. I am confident that you will assist us to obtain our request, and that next year we will be able to construct a building which will speak in favor of your department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSt. Bernard's Mission,\nGrouard, Alberta,\nNovember 1, 1929.\n\nMr. Harold Laird,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Laird:\n\nReverend Father Floch, principal of the St. Bernard's Residential School has asked me to second the request which he sends you. Your assistance is greatly desired in obtaining for us a grant from the Indian Department to construct a building for the boys. All acknowledge the necessity of this new building, for time has rendered the old one unserviceable. Financial circumstances prevent me from erecting the needed dwelling.\n\nKnowing the interest which you have always taken in the Indians of your agency and the devotedness which you have manifested in their welfare, I firmly believe that you will second the Reverend Father Floch in his enterprise.\n\nYour servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNOV 1 1929\nGrouard, Alta.,\nNovember 1st, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose letters from the Right Reverend Bishop Grouard, and from Reverend Father Flock, Principal of the Indian Residential School, St. Bernard's Mission, requesting financial assistance towards erecting a new building to replace the one now in use.\n\nI beg to state that a new building will add very materially to the comfort of the Indian children, and I endorse their application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T.

I find that the materials cost approximately $5,000. I presume that the church authorities will supply all the labour, and I write now to enquire how much financial assistance from the Department is needed before this improvement can be undertaken.\n\nI may say that on July 16th, at the request of Father Fahler, the Department authorized Father Floch to arrange electric lighting at the St. Bernard's School. It was promised that accounts up to $3,500 would be paid by the Department. I should like to learn if this work has been undertaken this year.

There are no funds for the proposed new boys' wing, but I shall be glad to consider the matter for next year's Estimates.

Four classrooms are provided, and each in charge of a qualified teacher. The Sisters of Providence have charge of the inside work, and it was noted\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Indian Affairs\nST.

I enquired into the question of food supplied to the children, and I am informed that they get all the milk they care to have, and are given wholesome, nourishing food. Their general appearance is healthy and would indicate that they are well cared for.\n\nTwelve cows are kept for milking purposes, and a small home farm is operated in close proximity to the school. They raise hogs and poultry. There were 20 hogs on hand at the time of my visit. The home farm consists of 50 acres for grain, 4 acres for potatoes, and a large garden. They have a large farm about 9 miles away which is operated with hired help, and the young stock is kept there. Only the cows required for milking purposes are kept at the school. They have over 120 cattle altogether.\n\nThe Rev. Father Floch is in charge as Principal. He has two lay brothers and a number of hired help. The Principal appears to be very energetic and interested in the welfare of his school.\nST. BERNARD'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) Cont'd.\n\nnoted that all the members of the staff speak good English.\n\nSeparate buildings are provided for the boys and the girls. The main building is frame, and provides a kitchen, dining rooms, office, infirmary, girls' dormitory, and staff rooms. It is heated with hot air and lighted with electricity. Fire extinguishers are placed at convenient points throughout the building, and there are stairway escapes at each end of the building. The dormitory in this building is large, and it is noted that comfortable beds are provided. Wash basins and individual towels are provided in the dormitory. This building is in good condition.\n\nThe boys' building is very old, being one of the first buildings erected at this Mission. The lumber, for the most part, used in its construction was whip sawed by hand. Stairways are provided at each end of the building as a means of escape in the event of fire. Fire extinguishers are also placed in this building at easily accessible places. This building is not in good condition, has served its purpose, and should be replaced. It is heated with stoves and lighted with electricity.\n\nSeparate outside toilets are provided for the boys and for the girls. I found these in good condition.\n\nThe water supply is pumped from the lake in the summer months, but as they only use a surface pipe, they have to haul their water supply during the winter months.\n\nThe girls, in addition to their classroom work, are given general instruction in housework. They assist with the washing, ironing, baking, sewing, knitting, and fancy work. All the girls' clothing is made in the school. The boys' clothing is purchased, but all the\n\nmending\nOTTAWA, March 21st, 1931.\n\nM. Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nMr. Ferrier\nSt. Bernard's Ind.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier:\n\nWhen in Ottawa lately I discussed with you the feasibility of the construction of a new boys' wing at St Bernard's Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand that $5000.00 will be voted in Parliament for that purpose. When in Ottawa I told you that we would rather wait and ask later for a substantial building for both boys and girls. You quite agreed with me as you could make use of whatever money was not used for the purpose for which it would be voted. We were only to repair the present building and wait a year or two. I regret to say that in spite of my good will it will be impracticable to repair the present boys' wing decently. Mr Hurison who has inspected it in January has probably voiced my sentiment. I presume our agent would agree with me. We therefore take the liberty of proposing to build a frame building 60' x 40' x 10' or 12' just one story to be used only for military purposes, said building to be used later as a gymnasium or auditorium when the other building will be erected. With such a building we could wait a few years and thus accommodate you better. We would keep the present building as a recreation, refectory and even class room(1) building. Of course the present building would have to be repaired. All the floors would have to be renewed and a few minor details looked after. I wish to note also that the roof is leaking. A few rolls of tar paper would do to cover the whole building.\n\nThe new building would be heated by camp stoves or if the Department prefers it by two pipeless furnaces. In the latter case the expense would be a little higher. There would be no toilet as same would be located outside as at present, the children being used to such discomfort.\n\nIt is our belief that we would not spend much more than the amount allotted and we therefore ask the advice and authority of the Department to proceed immediately with the work.\n\nI may add that we are in need of a vegetable cellar at Grouard. If we were installing pipeless furnaces for the above building we would have to dig for installing said furnaces and could profit by this opportunity to make a concrete basement for furnaces and also for vegetables cellar.\n\nI will reach Grouard on the 27th and would welcome an answer at that point at your earliest opportunity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\nJuly 4, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nFive Thousand Dollars is available for the construction of a new boys' wing at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, approximately 35 miles across Lesser Slave Lake from Ground, Alta., in the federal district of Peace River. The church authorities are urging the construction of a temporary frame building of one storey only, to be used for the next few years as a boys' dormitory. Later, when a modern main building has been erected, it is suggested that the proposed frame building be converted into a gymnasium or workshops. This scheme commends itself to me.\n\nThe usual practice in the case of northern schools is to have the church authorities undertake the construction of inexpensive buildings and to present accounts for material and labour up to the amount of the Department's grant. In this manner, considerable saving is nearly always effected. With your concurrence, I shall draft a memorandum to Council, authorizing a grant of $5,000 to the church authorities towards the cost of erecting this building.\n\nDuncan C.

The Oblate Order under whose auspices the school is conducted proposes the construction of a temporary frame building of one storey only, to be used for the next few years as a boys' dormitory. Later, when a modern main building has been erected, it is suggested that the proposed frame building be converted into a gymnasium or workshops.\n\nThe Minister observes that an amount of $5000.00 as a grant by the Department of Indian Affairs toward the cost of erecting this building has been provided by Parliament for the current fiscal year 1931-32.\n\nThe usual practice in the case of northern schools is to have the church authorities undertake the construction of inexpensive buildings and to present accounts for material and labour up to the amount of the department's grant. In this manner, considerable saving is usually effected.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $5000.00 for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nOttawa, August 24, 1931.\n\nRIGHT REV.

F. MacKENZIE.\n\nChg. Dept.\nI. A.\nOttawa, August 24, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to Your Lordship's letter of June 15th, I have to confirm official Day Letter of this date, as follows:\n\n\"Reference Your Lordship's letter June fifteenth, re building to be used as boys' dormitory for time being at St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, authority now received for Five Thousand Dollar grant. This will be paid when Your Lordship forwards usual receipts for materials and time sheets, both in duplicate, showing that at least the amount has been expended for the building.\"\n\nI may say that P.C. 1937, of the 14th instant, authorizes a grant of $5,000. It is understood that the Church authorities will erect a frame building, as specified in Your Lordship's letter; that this building will be used as a boys' dormitory for the time being and that, at a later date, it will be for gymnasium or auditorium or workshop, etc. The Department considers that box stoves would be suitable for heating this building. I cannot concur in the preparation of a root cellar underneath it, as this would make it unsuitable for the purposes to which it is to be put.\n\nYour Lordship will see that receipted accounts for the material and time sheets for the labour - both in duplicate- are forwarded in due course. If these show an expenditure of at least $5,000, grant up to this amount can be allowed. When this work is under way, if Your Lordship would like an advance on the grant, please make application.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa, November 4, 1931.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWith reference to your account dated the 27th March, 1931, for shipment of supplies to the Reverend Sisters in charge of St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, I have to request that you will furnish receipts in support of freight charges for supplies sent to the school which is at Grouard. Kindly refer in this connection to the entry on your account referred to above, namely, Registre J-21, Lot No.2, amount $106.30. Kindly refer also to Registre J-15, Lot No.6, amount $3.98. (The amounts mentioned are charges for freight.)\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nE.J. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nMessrs. A.

Verrill\n\nMy dear Mr. Verrill,\n\nThe Father of St. Bruno's Indian School has just received from a Provincial Police of Montreal a letter from the Dept. of Indian Affairs asking for receipt covering shipment of a range to St. Bernard's School last March. The Reverend Father has referred the matter for explanations. I will be in Ottawa on Feb. 29th next and will call at your office with necessary papers. I may say at this time that the range for St. Bruno's and that for Wabasso came in a carload (No. 47648) leaving Montreal on March 7th. We paid $568.63 for said carload, receipt being made in the name of Joseph Martin & Co., Montreal, who loaded said car and another for three hours. For these charges we have freighting from Canada to St. Bruno's School and paid the latter to St. Bernard's. If desired I can have receipt from payables on $327.63 for two trips. If so desired please wire to me to label school upon receipt of the\nSTE-ANNE DE JOUSSARD\nALBERTA\n\nPlease let me know when I will be there on May 23rd. If you write a little later please address Hamilton.\n\nI hope that I will not be too late for the Estimates in Ottawa on the 24th. I am going there Monday or Tuesday.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPostmaster of Ste-Anne\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| ONLY CASEMENT WINDOWS, 26 x 35   | 8        | 2.35       | 18.80 |\n| 6 BT.                            |          |            |       |\n| ONLY CASEMENT WINDOWS, 17 x 35   | 4        | 1.55       | 6.20  |\n| 3 LT.                            |          |            |       |\n| ONLY COMPLETE WINDOWS, 6 SASH    | 3        | 3.05       | 9.15  |\n| 8 LT.                            |          |            |       |\n|                                  |          |            | 34.15 |\n\n**Total:** 34.15\n\n**Date:** Nov 17, 1931\n| Item Description                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| \"For New Building\"                     |          |            |             |\n| only Misc.

You know how afflicted we have been with fires. Last year we lost the hospital and girls building at Fort Vermilion School and have not been helped to any serious extent by the Department. I have done my best under circumstances to weather the situation, borrowing money to erect a building and spending the greater part of my time, literally begging to pay the interest. I would suggest $10,000 for said buildings.\n\nIn the Estimates you will also find the following:\n\n$6,000 to reimburse us for the construction of an annex to the girls building at St Bernard's Indian Residential School. As in the case of Fort Vermilion I borrowed the money and have been begging to pay the interest. I have all vouchers necessary to prove that the annex has cost at least the above amount;\n\n$5,000 for the same purpose at Fort Vermilion;\n\n$2,000 for absolutely necessary repairs at Sturgeon Lake (Alta) Indian Residential School. The girls building at that point threatens destruction but as we cannot tackle the problem of reconstruction we must do some thing. That school has not received help from the Department in years.\n\n$2,500 for the building of a cow barn at St Bruno's Indian Residential School. We have been asking over and over again for this construction. We have not been heard with the result that scores of our cattle at that point have died of exposure during Winter.\n\n$800 for furniture at Wabasca R.C. Indian Residential School. Same had been asked last year but left over.\n\nI leave the above to your judicious consideration and would ask you to help us in our struggles for the upkeep of our Indian Residential Schools. In the case of St Bernard's School emergency class and laundry equipment I would ask you to wire me instructions here at St Boniface's Hospital Thursday if possible.\n\nWith best regards and wishes, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nHOPITAL ST.BONIFACE\nST.BONIFACE, MAN.\n\nNovember 28th, 1933.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMr Harold W.

No loss of life reported and no damage to the other buildings which are St Bernard's Indian Residential School's Boys building and Girls building. I hope that you have been advised directly. If not please consider the present letter as the official advice.\n\nIn connection with the above fire I wish to ask help from the Department. I am not prepared to speak about the hospital as it belongs to the Sisters who probably will address themselves to you in due course. But I wish to speak about the class equipment and the laundry equipment.\n\nRegarding class room facilities I offer my cathedral church and the vestry and will probably find room in the boys or girls building. We will probably need desks, books and stationery. I will be made certain on Sunday morning when I reach Edmonton unless I am advised by wire before. I would therefore ask you authority to buy most necessary equipment (a few desks, blackboards, etc.). If quantity is required I will wire particulars.\n\nI can accommodate the laundry for a while in a small room at my residence and would ask for three boilers of 50 gallons (or 60) each, washing machines (hand), tubs, baskets, irons, etc. I could buy same in Edmonton and see to their prompt shipment north.\n\nBy the way I may say that some years ago as it can be seen in the Schools Branch Estimates Book, I asked for a new laundry building and equipment. $8,000.00 were mentioned at the time.

I have found it necessary to prove that the annex has cost at least this amount.\n\n$5,000 for the same purpose at Fort Vermilion:\n\n$2,000 for absolutely necessary repairs at Turgeon Lake (Alta) Indian Residential School. The girls building at that point threatens destruction but as we cannot tackle the problem of reconstruction we must do something. That school has not received help from the Department in years.\n\n$2,500 for the building of a cow barn at St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. We have been asking over and over again for this construction. We have not been heard with the result that scores of our cattle at that point have died of exposure during winter.\n$800 for furniture at Wabasea R.C. Indian Residential School. Same had been asked last year but left over.\n\nI leave the above to your judicious consideration and would ask you to help us in our struggles for the upkeep of our Indian Residential Schools. In the case of St. Bernard's School emergency class and laundry equipment I would ask you to wire me instructions here at St. Boniface's Hospital Thursday if possible.\n\nWith best regards and wishes, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

McGill.\nSir,\n\nFurther to my telegram of same date, re St. Bernard Schools and St. Joseph Hospital of Grouard recently destroyed by fire.\n\nOn Sunday the 26th, about at 2 o'clock P.M. during an awful wind and snow storm, the St. Joseph Hospital caught fire and the flames spread so rapidly that the Sister in charge scarcely had time to get out with her patients, but nobody got injured, and in no time the whole town of Grouard was on the scene fighting the flames but the wind was blowing so hard that it was impossible to check the fire for some time. Beside the Hospital, two school houses and another small building were completely destroyed and a couple of desks and a few books are all that what saved from the fire. Since it was impossible to do anything to save the Hospital and the schools all the efforts of the people were directed towards the Fathers' residence and the Convent, and it is useless to say that it was a desperate fight, but they succeeded to check the fire and those buildings were only badly scorched.\n\nI did not hear about this fire until Monday in the afternoon, as the telephone line got damaged during the storm by the falling trees, so on Tuesday morning I went to Grouard to inquire what assistance they needed. The Rev. Father Superior and Sisters looked very despondent and they did not asked for anything beside drugs, as all the ir medical supplies were lost in the fire, but there is no doubt that they will ask for assistance later on. The origin of the fire is not known.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGROUARD, ALTA\n\nDecember 8th, 1933.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nThis present letter is only to acknowledge yours of the 4th inst received this day and to thanks you for having taken up our case with the Superintendent General.\n\nI have been so much taken up since my return and specially today (our mail day) that I am unable to send you particulars by this mail. I will forward same by the next one which is on the 13th, the letter to reach you only on the 13th. What a misery to be so far away!\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nList of articles required\n\n1 churn\n1 butter press\n12 large washing tubs\n6 \" linen baskets\n12 washboards\n12 galvanized pails\n1 copper was boiler\nSoap, Soap flakes, washing soda, blue (to bring over to St Bruno's laundry).\nArticles lost in boys' residence as per list\nbonus to replace lost food stored for Winter.\n\n+ [Signature]\nBishop Grouard\nFIRE EXTINGUISHERS:\n\nFrom the GIRLS' Residence four large fire extinguishers have disappeared after having been used. One is broken and crushed, the others are not to be seen.\n\nIn the BOYS' Residence only 2 large ones and 2 small ones are left. There are three of the small ones that were positively lost in the fire when three of our boys ran in the attic of the hospital from their residence in order to extinguish the fire but seeing themselves surrounded they threw them in the fire and ran to ladder nearby. They nearly lost their life. I think other extinguishers were lost that way by being thrown in the fire through excitement or left aside after having been discharged.\n\nThe Principal has given me a list of refills for our extinguishers as follows:\n\n- A few 7-lbs bottles (special) Sulphuric Acid for use in the big fire Engine machine which has helped us so much in preventing fire from spreading to the adjacent buildings. It was refilled a few times during the fire and with effective results. Those bottles are sold by Robert S. Bickle, WINNIPEG, Man.\n\n- 100 lbs bicarbonate soda\n\n- 6 refills for Pyrene Fire Extinguishers\n\n- 6 \" \" Thermene Stream Antifreeze\n\n(The last two from Pyrene Company, Toronto.)\nMILK HOUSE:\n\n1 churn (12 gallons)\n1 butter press\n200 lbs butter\n200 lbs lard\n100 lbs tea\n150 lbs bacon\n250 lbs meat (pork and beef)\n3 sacks peas\n2 barrels molasses (45 gallons each)\n\nBOYS' RESIDENCE:\n\n12 pillows (burned by sparks)\n50 mattresses were partly burned by sparks passing through the windows or when outside but most have been repaired with the exception of 15\n40 pillow cases (burned or stolen)\n100 cotton sheets burned (completely or with very large holes in them) and a few stolen.\n25 single blankets burned as the sheets and some stolen.

The boys use the girls comforters for the time being.\n45 towels (toilet) burned, torn, spoiled.\n15 suits (blue serge).

If such an arrangement could be arrived at the Department would have probably to pay less than $4,000 a year for a period of years.\n\nI leave the whole matter to your judicious consideration. I know that you are willing to help as you understand our situation. I wish that you demonstrate to the Honourable the Superintendent General the necessity of immediate and effective help.\n\nWith anticipated thanks, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard\na certain quantity. The sisters had very hard work to clean the articles that were outside as most were imbedded in the mud. What a mess! However everyone has carried on bravely and is to be commended.\n\nWe have established class rooms in the boys' large recreation room, in the girls' recreation room and in the girls' dining room. Mr Wilson, the Inspector, must report to the Department and I am positive will congratulate the staff for the rapid and effective work done.\n\nAs to the laundry we have been offered by our neighbor (30 miles) St Bruno School to have our washing done in the newly equipped laundry which the Department has installed. So we will need no equipment for the present with the exception of a few articles which I note on an accompanying list.\n\nI have submitted to you the sum of our losses and I must say with some hope of relief. You know that this is our second fire within 13 months. Happily, in each case, there has been no loss of life. But the loss to us\u2014I mean the material one\u2014is very heavy. In the case of Fort Vermilion we were not helped by the Department for reconstruction. I have borrowed money for which I will pay interest (if I can). Now in the case of Grouard I am asking for help. First, could you not consider a certain amount to cover our present losses as shown on my lists. Then in the Estimates I would ask for an amount enabling us to build a school house with full basement for laundry (and equipment for same) and upper story for older girls (including a sewing room). I believe that such a building would cost at least $15,000.00 (exclusive of laundry equipment) and do therefore ask for this amount to be placed in the Estimates.\n\nBy looking over my last letter you will note the other amounts asked for, viz., $6,000.00 to reimburse us for cost of annex to girls' residence, $5,000.00 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" present construction at Vermilion, $2,500 to the construction of a cow barn at St Bruno, $2,000 for absolutely necessary repairs at St Francis Xavier School, Sturgeon Lake, $800 for furnishing at Wabasca. We must necessarily be helped and I rely upon you to explain the situation to the Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nIf you think that Rev. Fr Plourde's plan for borrowing money would be feasible in our case I would suggest that we borrow $50,000 to cover the above and to build a girls' wing at Sturgeon Lake and finish Fort Vermilion constructions. Of course even with the above amount we will have to spend quite a lot ourselves but I am ready to go and beg for the difference in order to\nMr Harold W. McGill, M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nAt last I am given an opportunity of giving a report on the fire that destroyed a few of our buildings at Grouard, on Nov. 26th, together with a list of our losses.\n\nThe agent must have reported to you as he told me yesterday. Fire broke out in the attic of the hospital through a defective chimney at 2.30 hrs Sunday afternoon, the 26th. Rev. Fr Charest, my secretary, who happened to be in the hospital, (as a patient) rushed upstairs with an extinguisher but was driven back by the smoke that was already spreading over the whole building. The sisters immediately brought out the few patients that were in the hospital and placed them in my residence which is at a fair distance. Some of our boys (Indian boys) tried again to stop the fire by rushing up ladders with extinguishers but to no avail. The building was doomed. Then attention was turned to saving the other buildings. There was a fierce wind blowing and as the ground was simply a mirror on account of rapid freezing after a heavy rain following a fall of snow the sparks and cinders started to travel from building to building but meanwhile the father (the principal), the brothers, the sisters and a few volunteers including our boys started to save the contents of the buildings. From school building No.1 all desks, chairs, and many books were saved. Then from School building No.2, all desks, benches, books, blackboards of the two stories were out in a short time. Part of the articles stored in the attic were saved but quite a quantity was left as can be seen on the accompanying list. I may say that a few desks were broken but I did not mention them on the list.\n\nThe laundry was first to blaze but a few articles were saved together with some clothing, then the milk house were nothing was saved, then the ice house in which there was but a few tools, then the two school buildings. Fire started many times on the boys' residence outside and inside. The sparks were passing through little holes in the windows or through windows. That accounts for the losses in the boys' residence, though farther from the fire than the girls' but the boys' residence was right in the wake of the wind. Our night watchman, Mr St Denis, did wonderful work with our boys and saved the place. Unhappily people who were coming to help us and ... others (specially women) took away quite a number of things as you can see by the annexed list. We have recovered\nDecember 20, 1933.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, reporting on the loss incurred by fire at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School on the 26th ultimo. The loss occasioned is regretted, but I am pleased to learn that, through the strenuous efforts of the staff, there was no loss of life and that the two main buildings and also considerable equipment were saved. I have noted the list which you submit, of the various articles that were destroyed, and that you request the Department to reimburse the school authorities or replace the loss.\n\nI am not definitely aware, from your letter, what new equipment will be required to enable the school to carry on or the approximate cost of same. I may add that the Department could hardly consider reimbursement for a large number of the various articles enumerated in the list which you forwarded. An order has been sent the Government Stationery Office to forward the classroom material considered necessary, and a quantity of fire extinguishers will be ordered and sent the school.\n\nOur Estimates for the coming fiscal year include only the minimum requirements for residential schools, and I regret the impossibility of providing the full requirements, as requested, for the schools\n\n- under your\n\nRight Reverend Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nunder your auspices. If you will forward a list of the more urgent equipment required at the present time and the approximate cost, the most favourable consideration will be given. I should be pleased, also, if you would advise what insurance, if any, is carried by your Order on the buildings at each of the schools.\n\nI note the arrangements that have been made to carry on the work at the St. Bernard's School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 21, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. PARKER,\n\nThe following fire extinguishers and refills are required to replace those lost by fire at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alberta, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase:\n\n6 - 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) gallon Thermene Extinguishers, complete with chemical.\n6 - 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) quart Pyrene Extinguishers, complete with chemical and wall brackets.\n100 lbs.

McGill, M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor McGill:\n\nYour letter of December 20th, 1933, duly received. The rush of Christmas mail has delayed my answer to this day.\n\nI must say that I felt rather sad on perusal of same. I really believed that the Department would do something special in the present instance. I understand that no money was voted in the Estimates for such an emergency case but my past experience in the Department teaches me that emergency cases can be met with. You will realize, Doctor McGill, that two fires in almost rapid succession should obtain consideration from the higher authorities of the Department. I have not the privilege of knowing personally the Honorable the Superintendent General for the very simple reason that I have always dealt satisfactorily with you personally and with other officials of the different branches of the Department, but I believe that if the case was placed before him in its entirety he would favor some means of helping us out in the present trial. Of course I could bring the matter before the Honorable the Prime Minister and you know by experience (for example Rt Rev. Bishop Charlebois' repeated appeals) that we obtain results. But again, I do not think to go to such extremes and just wish to appeal to you again and ask as I did in my preceding letter for a little help.\n\nWith this view I have prepared a complete list of all articles lost in or on account of the fire and enclose same. I would call your attention on the food lost to the extent of $679.15 ($718.50 less four last items, hospital list viz $33.35) plus $181.15 in the milk house (viz butter, lard, tea, bacon, meat, peas, molasses) making a total of $860.30. Could you not place us on the relief list for that amount and allow us either to buy in a store indicated by you or the Honorable the Superintendent General or present bills for articles bought in our regular wholesale stores?\n\nThe clothing as per list on page 3 could be attended to in the same manner as suggested for food. Other items of that kind are found in the Laundry list and school building No 2 (two last items: soap and paper).\nAs already stated in my previous letter we are doing our very best to carry on and in order to answer the request of paragraph 2 of your letter I may say that to carry on the school work we have received classroom material from the Department and wish to thank you for same. A teacher's desk would come handy, also the book cases and blackboard. The Dominion ensign of course we could do without but you know what it means in front of a school building.\n\nRegarding the laundry equipment though the sisters go every other week at St Bruno's School for the regular washing we do a part of the latter here in a room back of the Bishop's Residence's kitchen. I have already bought a few necessary articles as per invoice no. 7174 of J.H. Ashdown Hardware Ltd enclosed. Those articles are for the laundry room (except the churn and butter rocker also absolutely needed for the kitchen). I did not buy the 3 boilers nor any washing machine as yet nor copper wash boiler nor the two heating stoves. I bought rosin and lye as per invoices no. 495 enclosed. We need washing machines with wringers, laundry soap, soap flakes, washing soda, Keen's Blue.\n\nWe have received Pyrene and Thermene extinguishers for which I am pleased to thank you.\n\nReturning to your letter I note that you express the impossibility of providing the full requirements for the schools under my jurisdiction. I feel sorry for such news. In a passing way I wish to point out that in my list of articles lost I did not mention the most important of all; the losses on the buildings themselves. I would estimate same to be about $15,000.00 (with $20,000.00 on hospital, the latter belonging to the sisters' corporation and being insured to the extent of $10,000.00). Note that the articles listed under the heading Hospital belonged to the school and were only stored there through lack of space elsewhere.\n\nRegarding the Insurance we carry or are supposed to carry at Grouard or elsewhere on the buildings of the schools I wish to say that none of our Indian Residential Schools are insured. How could we get the money to pay the premiums when specially in our Northern country said premiums are almost prohibitive. However, I may say that in the case of the boys' building at Grouard which was built two years ago I took an insurance policy of $8,000.00 just for the building in order to protect same during the construction. This policy will elapse on November 13th, 1934. In the present fire though many articles were burned, spoiled or lost I cannot claim anything because the building alone was insured.\n\nI leave the matter to your consideration with the hope that you will see your way clear to help us substantially and thereby alleviate the burden so heavy at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: \"Thompson, Grouard\"]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, January 23rd, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\n- Mr. Sutherland -\n\nIn connection with supplies which are to be purchased by His Lordship Bishop Guy, I may say, that the following firms are on the approved list at Edmonton:-\n\nHudson's Bay Company.\nHotel Equipment and Supply Company.\nDelton Hardware Company\nJ.

It is considered that it would be more satisfactory if you would arrange for the purchase and forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, to a total net exceeding the above amount.\n\nI have examined the list which you enclosed, enumerating the various articles destroyed and the approximate cost. Regarding the articles mentioned as being in school building No. 1, you may arrange for the purchase of a teacher's desk and three bookcases. An order is being placed here to forward the quantity of blackboard, chalk trough and moulding. It will therefore not be necessary for you to purchase this equipment.\n\nThe Department could not pay accounts covering the cost of food supplies to replace those destroyed, as the Auditor would object to an expenditure for this purpose. The only articles which can be authorized on the list which you submitted for the hospital would be the four last items.\n\nWith reference to the supplies that were in the laundry, we could not authorize replacement of the empty gasoline barrels, children's sleighs, Sisters' headgear and costumes and fountain pens. Further, it will not be possible to pay the cost of replacing the food supplies in the milkhouse, such as butter, lard, tea, bacon and meat. I would\n\n- request\n\nRight Rev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nrequest that you obtain prices from the following firms on the approved list in Edmonton and arrange for the purchase of the various articles considered essential from the firm quoting the lowest price:\n\nHudson's Bay Company,\nHotel Equipment and Supply Company,\nDelton Hardware Company,\nJ. H. Ashdown Hardware Company,\nMarshall-Wells, Limited,\nGaults Alberta, Limited,\nNorthern Hardware Company, Limited,\nWestern Hardware Soon.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, from each firm from whom purchase is made, and, when the supplies are delivered at the school, I would request that you certify each copy of the accounts in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when cheques in payment will be issued to the individual firms. I would request, further, that Your Lordship will arrange to complete the purchases, have the accounts received and forwarded to the Department in time to make payment before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, March 31st, next. I am leaving in your hands the purchase of the equipment, to the total amount authorized, as I feel sure Your Lordship will be in a better position to decide the various articles necessary.\n\nI note that it is not the general policy of your Diocese to carry insurance on Indian residential school buildings.\n\nThe accounts which you submitted, in favour of the J. H. Ashdown Hardware, Limited, are returned herewith, as it is necessary that they be in triplicate. If payment of these is made by the Department, they will be included in the amount of the grant mentioned above, which you are authorized to expend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMy Dear Doctor McGill:-\n\nYour kind letter of January 23rd was received here during my absence. I take great pleasure in acknowledging same today and thanking you for the grant which you have found possible to allow in favor of St Bernard Indian Residential School. Please transmit to the Honorable the Superintendent General my appreciation and the expression of my gratitude.\n\nI note the different paragraphs of your valuable communication and will act according to instructions given. For that purpose I will take the trip to Edmonton on the list and buy the different articles shown on lists. I must say however that a few items have been brought to my attention since my letter of January 13th as having been lost in the fire but they do not amount to much. I intend to change some articles as for example the laundry equipment. Instead of 8 washing machines (hand) and wringers I may buy two or three power ones with greater capacity, etc. Then, I note that I cannot procure some of the items from the firms on the approved list, e.g., teacher's desks, bookcases, knitting machine, soap and soap flakes. I would suggest that you allow me to buy the school equipment from Moyer's in Edmonton and give me the name of a wholesale grocer or merchant for soaps. If Snowdon Oil Co is on the list I would buy from same. Regarding mattresses I usually buy from Parkhill Bedding Co who is on the approved list (at least in Winnipeg) and who have a warehouse in Edmonton. They have special prices for Indian Residential Schools. If above suggestions and requests are agreeable I would kindly ask you to write to me upon reception of this present letter (Monday the 19th) at 9916-110th Street, Edmonton, where I will be Wednesday night (the 21st) just for the very purpose of making necessary purchases.\n\nHoping that every thing will be found in order and thanking you again for the practical attention given to my requests, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nFebruary 19, 1934.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I would request that, in addition to the firms mentioned in my communication of the 23rd ultimo, you obtain prices from the following firms:\n\n**SOAP:**\nH.

I regret having spent over the amount allotted. You will judge what is to be done and of course I will abide by your decision. I may say that I had not figured that the Department of Indian Affairs was paying sales tax ($180.00 on $2,000.00) but the different firms have advised me that such was the case and charged accordingly.\n\nAs requested I have asked for tenders and submit same with the following remarks. I asked tenders from Gaults only in the dry goods line as Hudson's Bay Company is not in the wholesale dry goods business. Same remark applies to the tender for soaps which I gave to H.H. Cooper Ltd. I did not buy book cases (2 at $30.50) from Waterman-Waterbury finding price too high.\n\nI wish to again thank you for the help you are giving us in our difficult circumstances and hope that accounts will be found in order and satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nEdmonton\nCanada\nApril 30th, 1934.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nDOMINION GOVERNMENT,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe are in receipt of cheque #59315 paying invoices No. 27174 - $54.94, 485 - $22.34 and 4144 - $501.61.

An item for $10.68 for an Ice Cream Freezer at the bottom of the account would explain the discrepancy between your figure of $294.66 and the account as rendered at $305.34.\n\nHoping that this information will enable you to reconcile these payments.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.H.

I refer in this regard to St. Bernard's. I have expended here the sum of $6,000 in the erection of an annex, built in the year 1932. An account for $889, covering part of this building, has been left in the Schools Branch, in the hope that funds may be available in the near future for its payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard\nOttawa, May 22nd., 1954.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Purchase of Supplies for Residential School, Vote 188, 1933-34\n\nCheque No. 39007 for $1,039.50 was issued on April 23rd last to Caulds Alberta Limited, for clothing and other supplies for the St. Bernard Indian School.\n\nOrder in Council of 22nd October, 1892, which extended the per capita grant system to the schools of the Northwest Territories, provides that the management pay all charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses out of per capita grants. It appears to me that any departure from this provision should be authorized by the Governor in Council.\n\nI shall be glad to have your views on this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 2nd, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Gonthier,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, regarding cheque No. 39807, for $1,038.50, issued in favour of Gaults Limited, for clothing and other supplies for the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe St. Bernard's Indian Residential School is conducted under the auspices of the Bishop of Grouard. A severe loss by fire was suffered at this school in October, 1932. The buildings were partially rebuilt and refitted following the fire. Another fire occurred in November, 1933, and the Bishop found it impossible to provide funds for refitting the building a second time. He appealed to the Department for assistance and, as the St. Bernard's School provides educational facilities for a large group of Indians, the Department considered it advisable to authorize purchase of the materials covered by the account in question. I might point out that a considerable portion of this account covered the cost of sheeting and blankets, which articles the Department has been in the practice of supplying to new residential schools during the past eight or nine years without any exception being taken. The St. Bernard's School can fairly be considered a new school inasmuch as the building had to be rebuilt after the recent fire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeo. Gonthier, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Purchase of Supplies for Residential Schools, Vote 106, 1933-34\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst. regarding the purchase of supplies for the St. Bernard Indian Residential School. As the Order in Council of 23rd October, 1892 explicitly states that the management pay from the per capita grants all expenses for maintenance and expenses, I am of the opinion that no departure therefrom should be made without the consent of the Governor in Council.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1934.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nOn April 23rd, 1934, a payment of $1038.50 was forwarded to you by cheque No. 39807. This payment covered your invoice, March 14/33, No. 1489, $573.13 and invoice, March 19/34, No. 4736, $465.37. This last mentioned invoice contained a charge of $17.25 for freight. Apparently the receipted freight bill was not attached to your account and we require it for our Audit Office. I should be pleased if you would forward it at your earliest convenience.\n\nIn connection with this matter I beg to say that the goods covered by the two above-mentioned invoices were sold to La Corporation Episcopal C.R.

N.C. ALLEN,\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of June 21st we investigated the matter referred to, and, learned that prepaid freight, $17.25, was included in invoices as you state.\n\nIt is not our custom to include freight in invoices in this manner, but in this instance the freight was handled in this way at the request of Bishop Guy. Unfortunately, in some manner, shipment of March 13th was made freight collect, and, we suppose, paid at Emilda, although charged on our invoices. We, therefore, enclose herewith credit note for $9.62 refunding the amount.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will also find prepaid freight bills covering shipment of March 13th, freight bill No. 25615 and April 20th freight bill 42024.\n\nWe regret this mix up and trust that enclosed credit note with freight bills as above will make the necessary adjustment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGAULTS ALBERTA LIMITED.\n\nPer.\n\nJHJ.W.\nENCS.\nDominion Government,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJune 27, 1934.\n\nATTENTION MR.

McGILL:\n\nIs the Department aware of any\n\nproposed new construction, or alterations\n\nto buildings, proposed by Bishop Guy of\n\nGrouard, during the coming year; and\n\ndoes the Department plan to assist in any way?\n\nGeorge Buskard per\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 9, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReplying to your memo of the 7th instant, regarding any new construction or alterations to buildings at the Indian Residential Schools in the diocese of Grouard, I would say His Lordship Bishop Guy has requested that an appropriation be provided to undertake the following work:\n\n1. ST. BRUNO'S - New Barn (approximate cost) - $1,500.\n2. WABASCA - Stable and Barn (approximate cost) - $3,000.\n3. FORT VERMILION - To replace building destroyed by fire, there is required a new girls' residence - approx. cost - $15,000.\n4. ST. BERNARD'S - (a) To replace five buildings destroyed by fire, there is required a building to include 4 classrooms, laundry, dormitory, living quarters and sewing room for older girls - approximate cost - $12,000.\n   (b) Ice house and pantry - $1,500.\n   (c) Cow barn - $2,500.\n5. STURGEON LAKE - (a) New girls' residence - $15,000.\n   (b) Repairs to boys' residence - $5,000.\n\nDuring my visit, last summer, to the St. Bernard's and Sturgeon Lake Residential Schools, consideration was given to the erection of a new building, centrally located, to replace the present old buildings at these two schools. Bishop Guy, I understand, is considering this suggestion. If, and when, a new building is erected, it should provide accommodation for approximately 175 pupils.\n\nThe above requests of His Lordship will receive consideration when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared. However, I am unable to state what amount will be approved for carrying out the work requested by Bishop Guy at any of the above named schools.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 22nd, 1934.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nPlease refer to your telegram to us of September 5th. The Department has been giving serious consideration to your requirements indicated therein, in the preparation of our Estimates for the next fiscal year. I have furnished the Honourable the Superintendent General with a memorandum setting out the details of these requests and those received in connection with your schools at Babineax and Fort Vermilion.\n\nI have lately had an opportunity of discussing this matter at some length with the Honourable the Superintendent General. The Minister does not look with much favour upon the building of new schools at the present time, but is prepared to consider new structures in the way of replacing buildings that have outlived their usefulness. In this connection I placed before the Honourable the Minister the suggestion that I had made to Your Lordship when you were in Ottawa, that is to say the advisability of consolidating your two schools at Grandin and Sturgeon Lake respectively, and building one modern structure to take care of the children not being accommodated in these two schools. The Department would favour a new structure being built at a point more accessible to railway communication, but I should think that the present site of St. Bernard's would not be unacceptable.\n\nYou will note that the total of the various amounts that you have requested comes to something over \u00a350,000.00. My present inclination is to place an amount in the Estimates,\n\nSt. Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grande,\nGrandin, Alberta.\nwhich are now in course of preparation, necessary to build a fire-proof structure to take care of the work now being done at Surgeon Lake and Grindrod. I have reason to believe that the Minister would be willing to favour such an undertaking.\n\nI should be very pleased to have the result of any consideration you may have had time to give to this matter and to receive your conclusions or any further suggestions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy to Assistant General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n\nPB CALGARY, ALTA November 29th, 1934.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the copy of a letter you have written to His Lordship, Bishop Guy of Grouard, in connection with schools in that territory. In my opinion your suggestion is quite feasible; After all Sturgeon Lake is not very far from Grouard and as you are aware, there is a fairly good highway from High Prairie to Sturgeon Lake except in wet weather, so it would be no hardship on the Indians to have their children sent to school at the above mentioned place. Moreover, if a new school were built at Sturgeon Lake it would be costly to have the material hauled in, it being so far from the railroad.\n\nI wish to thank you for sending me a copy of this letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nNovember 30th, 1934.\n\nMr Harold W. McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:-\n\nIn the matter of preparation of the Estimates for the next fiscal year I wish to make an application for the following covering the Residential Schools under my jurisdiction viz St Bernard's at Grouard, St Bruno's at Joussard, St Martin's at Desmarais, Sturgeon Lake at Calais, Fort Vermilion at Fort Vermilion.\n\nST BERNARD: Cf your letter of the 22nd inst. If plan is not proceeded with I would renew my request for $50,000.00 covering work material to be supplied at different points. In Grouard, we need absolutely a school house and accommodation for older girls, a laundry, a ice house. The latter have been destroyed by fire on November 26th, 1933.\n\nST BRUNO...: Cow Barn. Imperative as you have found out personally. Approximate cost: $2,500.00\n\nThe floor and basement must not be lost sight of. If immediate attention is not given I will assume no responsibility in case of accident.\n\nST MARTIN.: Stable and Barn, approximate cost: $3,000.00\n\nSTURGEON LAKE: Cf your letter of the 22nd inst. Otherwise of my own letter of May 9th asking for Girls' residence: $25,000.00\n\nRepairs \" Boys' \" : $ 5,000.00\n\nFORT VERMILION: I would ask for a compensation to replace building destroyed by fire October 8th, 1932, viz, girls' residence. Approximate cost would be at least $15,000.00.\n\nI also ask for increase in pupilage for the following schools:\n\nST BERNARD'S: 75 to 100\nST BRUNO'S: 125 to 130\nST MARTIN'S: 100 to 110\n\nFinally, I wish to ask officially that the 15% cut in grants be removed and therefore grants be restored to their former amounts. The Government incomes are increasing and ours are declining. I hope you will give your effective recommendation to the Superintendent General in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nDecember 13, 1934.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, setting forth the requirements at each of the Indian residential schools in your diocese and requesting that the amounts be included in the Estimates of this Department for the coming fiscal year.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our Estimates are now in course of preparation, and your requests will receive every consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

We are very anxious now to see it installed and to make use of it. This cannot be so long as we have every reason to believe that the repairs of the basement will be continued as soon as the working of ground permits.\n\nWe feel greatly indebted to you, dear Doctor McGill, for all the kindness and consideration received at your hands.\n\nThanking you sincerely for this last favor,\n\nI am,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\n[Signature] Peter of Rome, Superior\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nJuly 26th, 1935.\n\nDear Mr Sutherland:\n\nAs I am starting work at Grouard and have already ordered a carload of cement, one of brick, two of lumber (also one car cement and one of lumber for St Bruno) I would welcome an advance on the $1600.00 voted in our favor for different items.\n\nAnd how about the $10,000.00 grant for Fort Vermilion? Dr McGill intended to have amount sent us immediately after the Session but I understand that he is away. I am sorry I could not meet Mr Phelan. We are certainly handicapped this year on account of high water and other difficulties along the same lines. If he is back please offer him my best regards and the expression of my regret.\n\nI should be in Ottawa during September. Look after yourself and...others but yourself first.\n\nCordially yours,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nOttawa, August 19, 1935.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have delayed replying to your letter of the 26th ultimo, until the Deputy Minister returned, when I could discuss the matter with him.\n\nI assume, from your letter, that you are starting the work of erecting the classroom building, which will include dormitory space, laundry and sewing room, and also the erection of the barn, at the St. Bernard's R. C. Indian Residential School.\n\nWe would be pleased to have particulars regarding the type and size of the buildings. I note that you have already ordered a quantity of building materials and request an advance of the amount provided in our appropriation, viz.: $16,000. I would request that you obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials, and forward them to the Department, when cheque in payment could be sent direct to the firm from whom the materials are obtained. Should you require an advance to pay labour, this could be forwarded. Proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour employed, should be kept.\n\nI am sure that, in the purchase of the\n\nRight Rev. Jos. Guy, O. M. I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nmaterials, you have dealt with firms on the approved list. Might I point out that, before you purchased the building materials and started the work, you should have consulted the Department and obtained the names of the firms from whom to purchase.\n\nA Memorandum to Council has been prepared and is now before the Treasury Board, regarding payment of the $10,000 grant for Fort Vermilion. As soon as the Order in Council is passed, a cheque will be sent you.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 5, 1935.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nRegarding Your Lordship's request, that an advance, to the amount of $2,500, be sent you to pay labour in connection with the work which you are carrying out at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, I have to say that present regulations of the Treasury Board set forth that all advances to pay labour should be sent to the local Indian agents. I would therefore be pleased if you would drop me a line, at your early convenience, and state if it would be satisfactory that the cheque be sent to Mr. Agent L'Heureux, who would have to certify to the paylists in accounting for the advance. If this is not satisfactory, I could, no doubt, arrange to obtain the authority of the Deputy Minister, that the cheque be drawn and sent in your favour. However, it may be satisfactory to you to have the amount sent Agent L'Heureux. As soon as I hear from Your Lordship, a cheque will be sent as you request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D.

SUTHERLAND\n\nMontreal, September 9th, 1935\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th inst in the matter of advances ($2,500.00) for salaries in connection with work now being carried on at St. Bernard's Indian School I wish to say that I have decided to keep on with our usual policy viz., that of borrowing from the Bank the necessary money and present labour returns and other bills when construction is completed. I may however send to your office a few of the major bills for direct payment or reimbursement. Though I have no objection to have the labour accounts paid through the local Indian Agent I find it far more convenient and satisfactory to deal directly with the Department.\n\nWith thanks for the attention given that matter, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nMontreal, Que.,\nAugust 31st, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nATTENTION:- Mr. J. D. Sutherland.\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of recent date, I wish to explain my position in regard to the work being undertaken at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School without previously mentioning the fact to the Department.\n\nI would like you to realize that this year we are flooded and communications by rail and otherwise have been interrupted for a long time. On account of our lack of road facilities, we delayed construction and, when we finally decided, we had to rush the work. I did not think of asking the Department for the patronage list but you know that I am conversant with said list and, consequently, I am buying supplies from authorized dealers.\n\nI hope that the above explanation will be sufficient and that it will excuse what was, seemingly, an oversight on my part.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nOttawa, September 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the enclosed account covering lumber supplied for the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School, I would appreciate if you would forward two more copies of this account. Before payment can be made, the Department requires accounts in triplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nOn the 28th instant, you were forwarded some accounts, one of which covered supplies for the St. Bernard's Residential School and the other, for the St. Bruno's Residential School. It was through oversight these were forwarded to you, as it was intended to send them to the firms concerned.\n\nNo doubt, you have received these accounts, and you should therefore forward them to the firm, with the request that they make out two more copies and forward all three copies direct to the Department. Please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile,\nAlta.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1935.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nHis Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., has presented to the Department for payment the enclosed account in connection with lumber supplied to the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School.\n\nOne of the last items of this account reads:\n\n\"Less freight on 49880 # @ 55\u00a2 - $274.34\"\n\nFor purposes of our auditor, it will be necessary to have some explanation regarding this entry on the account. Please let me have full details in order that we can attach same to the account. As soon as your reply is received, a cheque will be issued.\n\nI enclose a copy of the account for your information. This copy should, of course, be returned when you are replying to this letter.\n\nEncs. 2.\n\nCanadian Western Lumber Company, Limited,\nFraser Mills,\nB.

McGuire,\nDistrict Sales Manager,\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, October 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is considering payment of certain accounts covering the cost of lumber supplied by your firm to the Bishop of Grouard, Grouard, Alta., for use at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School. In reviewing the accounts, it is found that you include a charge for freight, and before repayment of the freight can be made to you, it will be necessary for the Department to receive a receipt from the railway company.

Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMcRea Lumber Company,\nFaust, Alta.\nOttawa, November 6, 1935.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,-\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that building operations enumerated hereunder were carried out during the past summer at each of the St. Bernard's, St. Bruno's, Sturgeon Lake and Wabasca Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta.\n\nAs these schools are in an isolated locality, it has been found that the most economical method of arranging for construction is to place the work in charge of the Oblate Order, under whose auspices they are conducted. All work was approved by the Department and carried out on a day labour basis, under the direct supervision of His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, at a cost of $24,800. The cost of the work at each school, including material and labour, was as follows:-\n\nST. BERNARD'S:\n\nErection of a new building, to provide classrooms, sewing-room, dormitory and laundry - $16,000.\n\nST. BRUNO'S:\n\nRepairing foundation, main building - $3,300.\nErecting kitchen - $1,400.\nErecting barn - $1,500. 6,200.\n\nSTURGEON LAKE:\n\nMiscellaneous repairs, school buildings - $600.\n\nWABASCA:\n\nErecting machine shed and chicken house - $2,100.\n\nFunds to cover the cost of the above mentioned work are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1935-36.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $24,800 in payment of the cost of the above mentioned work.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of November 6th, 1935.\n\nThe St. Bernard's, St. Bruno's, Sturgeon Lake and Wabasca Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta, are owned and conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order. His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, requested that assistance be given by the Department towards the cost of certain repairs and the erection of buildings at the above schools. The Department provided the amount required in the Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1935-36. The work, authorized by the Department, was carried out during the past summer. Owing to the rather isolated location of the schools, it was considered the most economical method was to place the work in charge of the church authorities. Bishop Guy arranged for the purchase of the materials and for the labour and had the work carried out on a day labour basis, under his direct supervision. The total cost was $24,800. A request is now being made to His Excellency in Council for the necessary authority for payment of the cost of the above mentioned work.\nFREIGHT BILL\u2014PREPAID CHARGES\n\nM CRAE LBR CO.\n\nTo the NORTHERN ALBERTA RAILWAYS CO.

Ashdown Hardware Company as it was covering payment of articles allowed by the Department after our fire in Grouard (St Bernard's School). It is therefore in order and may be paid. Thanks.\n\nBishop of Grouard.\n\nCongratulations for acclamation as school trustee.\nOttawa, December 11, 1935.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe enclosed accounts covering lumber supplied for the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School have been forwarded to the Department for payment; and, in view of the manner in which they have been prepared, we are unable to decide whether or not they are correct.\n\nWith reference to your account of August 19th, one item reads: \"2 (4) 1x6 8 #3 Clear Fir Drop Siding 144.\" From this entry, the Department infers that you supplied 4 bundles of Clear Fir Drop Siding and that each bundle contained 9 pieces, the measurements of each piece being 1x6x8. This makes a total of 144 feet, which is apparently correct.\n\nHowever, we infer that the next item means 3 pieces 1x6x10, and you show a total of 60 feet. Apparently this should be 15'. The same applies to the subsequent four items. The total of each of these is apparently four times what it should be.\n\nRegarding your accounts of August 20th and 24th, the first item reads: \"28 (4) 1x6 8 #2B Clear Fir Drop Siding 448,\" which is correct. The Department infers that this means 4 bundles, each containing 28 pieces 1x6x8, or a total of 448 feet, which is correct. However, the subsequent five entries are apparently four times too much in quantity.\n\nSimilar mistakes appear in 16 subsequent entries on the account. You will note that we have marked these \"2 to 17 inclusive\".\n\nI would appreciate your amending the accounts and returning them to the Department as soon as possible for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

If you have the accounts for the freight charges, will you be good enough to certify them in the usual manner and forward for payment. I shall be pleased if you will show definitely on each account the name of the school for which the material was supplied.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D.

We note, also, that you are deducting 2% cash discount, $58.10, which we also have advised him we are unable to allow at this date. We would refer you to our various invoices, wherein our terms are stated, and are now enclosing copy of our letter of September 6th, last, addressed to Bishop Guy in this connection.\n\nWe might respectfully point out that where discount terms are anticipated, it is customary to make a substantial advance payment on account, thus protecting the discount, and in such cases, there is no objection to final payment being delayed for a reasonable time.\n\nWe are now forwarding statement covering the balance due, $2821.61, for your further consideration.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADIAN WESTERN LUMBER COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccounting Department\n\nIHV/D\n\nEnc. 2.\nOttawa, January 24, 1936.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding payment of your account for four cars of lumber and the freight charges on same, shipped last summer to the account of His Lordship Bishop Guy, Grouard, Alberta.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that cheques in payment of the freight and one car of lumber will go forward in the course of the next few days. I would point out that there was delay in receiving your accounts from His Lordship. Under present regulations, it was necessary to deduct the 2% discount allowed on the lumber, and you will have to look to His Lordship for payment of the amount deducted from your accounts for discount. We are informing His Lordship accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nCanadian Western Lumber Company, Ltd.,\nAccounting Department,\nFraser Mills, B. C.\nOttawa, January 24, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland, of this Department, concerning payment of accounts of the Canadian Western Lumber Company, covering the cost of the lumber, including freight charges, supplied on your order for use at the Indian residential schools under your auspices.\n\nCheques in payment for the lumber and freight are being sent to the above company. Under present accounting regulations, it was necessary to deduct the 2% cash discount on the bills covering the cost of the lumber. The company have protested the deduction of the discount, which amounts to approximately $72.56, on the materials supplied. We are unable to pay the company this discount and are informing them that it will be necessary for them to take up the matter with you.\n\nThe accounts which you forwarded, covering the cost of the material and labour, erecting the kitchen at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, and also the accounts for the labour and wages paid in erecting the classrooms, barns, etc., at the St. Bernard's Indian Residential School were received today, and cheques to reimburse you will be forwarded as soon as these accounts can be passed for payment.

The two statements herein contained cover only part of wages and I expect that balance will be forthcoming in a very few weeks. I would appreciate payment of present statements as I had to borrow from the Bank to pay said salaries.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Right Rev. Jos.

C. 3614, of November 22nd, 1935.\n\nBishop Guy was authorized to arrange construction of building and labour.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 505\n\nAgent\nOttawa, February 1, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 10th ultimo, enclosing labour returns for work at St. Bernard's Indian Residential School. The Representative of the Treasury has found it necessary to make the following changes:\n\n1. Paylist of August 10, 1935 - On this paylist is included the name of Alex. Chalifoux, and payment is requested for him for 60 hours at 20\u00a2 an hour = $12.00. He did not sign the paylist and, consequently, this amount cannot be allowed. In order that you may obtain reimbursement for this expenditure, it will be necessary for you to prepare a new paylist, in triplicate, for the week of August 10th. This paylist should include only the name of Alex. Chalifoux and should be receipted by him.\n\n2. Paylist of August 31, 1935 - On this paylist, the name of R. Portlance is shown. Payment is requested for him for 71 hours at 30\u00a2 an hour. The total amount due him would therefore be $21.30. On the paylist which you submitted, you entered $28.40. A deduction of $7.10 has therefore been made.\n\n3. Paylist of September 7, 1935 - This paylist shows that Ben Deschenes worked 65 hours at 30\u00a2 an hour. You requested payment for 66 hours. Consequently, a deduction of 30\u00a2 has been made.\n\n4. Paylist of November 9, 1935 - Myles McDermot is shown to have worked 45 hours at 20\u00a2 an hour. From this entry, it would appear that the sum of $9.00 was due him. You entered only $1.80 on paylist, and, as he has receipted the paylist for this amount, no extra amount is being allowed you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Norman Rogers,\nMinister of Labour,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you be good enough to advise me what wages were paid for labourers and carpenters at Couard, Alta., during the year 1935. I understand that the Roman Catholic Mission at that point completed some buildings, part of which were paid for by the Federal Government. If this information cannot be supplied by your Department, would you be so kind as to forward my letter to the proper Minister.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. A. Pelletier, M.P.,\nPeace River.\nOttawa, March 24, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Pelletier,\n\nI have received your letter of the 17th instant relating to certain building work carried on by the Roman Catholic Mission at Gaudet, Alberta, during the year 1935, and asking to be advised the wages applicable to labourers and carpenters at that point.\n\nIn reply I may state that we have no knowledge in the Department of Labour of the wage rates which are paid to the classifications mentioned in that particular locality. On federal Government building construction work, for which the Department of Labour prepares wage schedules, the minimum rate at the smallest point in the Province of Alberta is 85 cents for labourers and 70 cents for carpenters for a maximum 8-hour day. The work to which you refer, however, was not, insofar as I am aware, a federal Government contract.\n\nIf, as suggested, the federal Government contributed financially to this work it would undoubtedly have been through the Department of Indian Affairs, and I am therefore transmitting a copy of your communication to that Department in order that your enquiry on this point may be answered.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Pelletier, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing copy of a communication received by the Honourable Mr. Rogers, from Mr. R. A.

Please return Bishop Guy's letter.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nApril 2, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have the memorandum of Mr. Jackson, Private Secretary, of the 27th ultimo, with attached letter from His Lordship Bishop Guy, Grande Prairie, Alberta, requesting payment of an account for the supplying of batteries for the lighting system at the Groizard (St. Bernard's) Indian Residential School and also requesting payment of certain other accounts for materials and labour in the erection of new buildings and alterations and repairs.\n\nIn this connection might I say that provision was made in the Appropriation for the fiscal year just closed, to the amount of $24,000, towards the cost of building operations carried out by His Lordship during the past summer at four of the Indian Residential Schools conducted under his auspices, viz.: Groizard (St. Bernard's); Joussard (St. Bruno's); Sturgeon Lake and Wabasca Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta. All work was approved by the Department and carried out on a day labour basis, under the direction of Bishop Guy. The amount available for each school and the work carried out was as follows:\n\nGROIZARD (St. Bernard's)\n\nErection of a new building, to provide classrooms, sewing-room, dormitory and laundry - $16,000.\n\nJOUSSARD (St. Bruno's)\n\nRepairing foundation, main building - 3,300.\nErecting kitchen - 1,400.\nErecting barn - 1,500. - 6,200.\n\nSTURGEON LAKE\n\nMiscellaneous repairs, school buildings - 500.\n\nWABASCA\n\nErecting machine shed and chicken house - 2,100.\n\nExpenditure of the above amounts was approved by P.C. 3614, dated November 28, 1936. Properly certified accounts were supplied by Bishop Guy, for material and labour, and paid.\nand paid, to the amount authorized.\n\nHis Lordship, during a recent visit to the Department, was informed that payment could only be made to the amount authorized by the Council in Council. He, however, now submits further accounts which he asks be paid, to the amount of $8,590.62\u2014which include payment for the batteries and for materials and labour in connection with the above mentioned work.\n\nBefore he undertook the work last summer, he was definitely informed of the amount that would be available. He however, had some work carried out than was first planned. There is no doubt that the entire work was well done\u2014a part of it having been carried out under the supervision of the Supervisor of Construction appointed by the Department. I would point out that Bishop Guy undertook the extra work at his schools and purchased the batteries without reference to the Department.\n\nThere are many instances where the Department has been requested to assume financial responsibility towards the cost of additions, repairs, and maintenance, and for the purchase of equipment and furnishings, at schools which are not government-owned. The policy of the Department in this connection was drawn to the attention of church officials in a memorandum dated April 19, 1934\u2014a copy of which is attached.\n\nThe Appropriation for the fiscal year 1935-36 is practically assigned and no provision has been made in our Estimates for the fiscal year 1936-37 to pay the accounts as submitted by Bishop Guy. It is considered that the Department has dealt generously when it has already paid accounts to the amount of $24,800 for improvements at his schools, which are not government-owned properties. I beg to suggest he be informed there are no funds available to pay the accounts which he now submits.\n\nWith reference to the question raised by Bishop Guy, regarding discrimination as between government-owned schools and schools which are the property of the church authorities, in the matter of payment for repairs, equipment, etc., I would say that this will form the subject of a separate memorandum.\n\nI return Bishop Guy's letter.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Canadian Globe Wood Washer\n\nBelted Motor Driven\n\n36\" and 40\" Diameter Single Geared\n\nSize\n\nThe inner cylinder shall be inches in diameter by inches in length, and shall have doors and partitions, and hinges, latches and hoops.\n\nCylinder\n\nShall have heads and staves of Crown Prime Long Leaf Yellow Pine, with ribs of hard Maple.

LTD.\nMarch 14th, 1936.\n\nBishop Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nBishop's Residence,\nGROUARD, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 9th from Edmonton enclosing your original letter dated February 25th from Ottawa. I was in Edmonton this week and endeavored to get in touch with you but found you had left for Grouard on Monday.\n\nAs per your request I am giving you attached particulars of the machines on which you have requested prices etc. In a number of Indian schools in Western Canada, we have installed what we call the Group Laundry equipment which consists of a washer, extractor and single roll ironer, all in one unit and driven from one large motor mounted at the rear of the washing machine. All the machines can be running at once off this motor or each can be run separately. That is to say the washer can be running by itself with the other two machines closed down or the washer and extractor together or all three at the same time. The unit comes exactly as shown on the attached illustration which we have marked No. 1. This would work out considerably cheaper for you than by having each of these machines with its own individual motor. We are, therefore, giving you a proposition showing this Unit together with the Drytex Tumbler which could be placed anywhere on account of it having its own motor and the two sets of laundry tubs and boiler. Then on another proposal we have outlined the prices of the washers, extractor, ironer and Drytex Tumbler each with their own individual motor equipment attached, and the illustrations with this second proposal will give you full details as to the construction of each machine.\n\nIn connection with the washers, you have asked for an alternative in a metal washer and the only metal washer which we can quote you would be our CHAMPION CASCADE which is constructed of sheet monel metal in the tub and cylinder, and of course\nis a very substantially built piece of equipment. The illustration gives you the specifications of same but the picture shown is of a larger machine than that which we have quoted. The one in our proposal would have only one compartment instead of two as shown in the picture, and the size of it, you will note, is smaller than that mentioned in your letter being a 36\" x 36\" machine, which has a capacity load of 85 lbs. dry weight, but a 36 x 36\" Monel Metal Machine will turn out the work much faster than a machine constructed of wood. Therefore, the 15 lb. less capacity per load than the wood machine would be offset by the shortening of the washing time. The other washer which we have quoted on is the regular CANADIAN GLOBE machine, with which you are familiar, having an inner cylinder of 36 x 54\" and a capacity of 100 lbs. dry weight per load.\n\nWith reference to the Extractor, you will note that we are now making this with the inner basket having its side sheets constructed of Monel Metal, which is a considerable improvement over the old basket construction. We also have a patented Automatic Oiling Device on the extractor which is an exclusive feature on our machine.\n\nIn connection with the #1 HANDY IRONER, we want you particularly to notice that this machine is equipped with an Automatic Safety feed Guard and Pressure Device which is a very important feature. Any movement of the Guard by the person operating the machine, causes the Ironer to stop therefore being a protection against the possibility of getting a finger caught. You will note that this Ironer has quite a large roll when padded, i.e., 13/2\" in diameter, which assures a good ironing surface as the roll operates in a concave chest of proper size.\n\nThe DRYTEX TUMBLER is of very recent design and has been found to be an efficient and up-to-date method of drying the various pieces that come from the Extractor. This machine is made in two types, i.e., with Non-Reversing Cylinder which means that the inner cylinder only turns one way while the machine is running. Then if desired we build this machine with a cylinder which is of the reversing type which means that it turns an equal number of revolutions each way while the machine is running. You will notice that there is $100.00 difference in the price of the two designs.\n\nYou will note we have figured all these prices f.o.b. factory, Toronto, including the Sales Tax, and we have given in each case the weight and approximate freight to Grouard. This is simply for your guidance in arriving at your approximate cost laid down at Grouard, as we presume that you will\nwish to buy the machinery on an F.O.B. factory basis,\nwhich is the usual procedure.\n\nI trust that the information which we are sending you will be all that you desire, and wish to apologize for the delay in sending same forward to you. The writer only got back from Edmonton this morning.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nManager.\n\nWESTERN REPRESENTATIVES OF\nTHE CANADIAN LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO. LTD.\n\nW.G./W.\nEncl.:\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\n\nCluny, Alta., March 24th, 1936\n\nAttention of Mr. Turney Orr\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nPlease find copy of correspondence with the Stanley Brock Co. Manager of Calgary in connection with Laundry Equipment to be installed at Grouard Indian Residential School. An amount of $7,500.00 is provided for in the current Estimates for said Equipment.\n\nYou will note the different proposals. Of course Proposal No.1 is the only one feasible. I note that, including sales tax, said equipment would cost F.O.B. Factory $3,210.00. The freight charges are to be added. For your information I may say that I can secure better rates than those shown in the Manager's letter. Figure on a half rate except on the Steam Boiler and even in that case it is possible I obtain same. That would bring the complete outlay, excluding the installation work at around $8,450.00.\n\nI had written at this time on account of difficulty of transportation after the Winter roads are broken. I would have appreciated shipping of machinery on the present Spring icy roads. Later, we have only the difficulties of three unloadings before reaching destination.\n\nI intend to go to Ottawa by the end of April and will see you again. You will note I am in Cluny where your name has naturally been mentioned more than once for obvious reasons.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. J. Butler Bishop of Grouard.\nWinnipeg, March 25, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nAtt'n Mr. R. Barney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department\n\nOur Calgary Branch have been quoting for some time on Canadian Laundry Machinery Company products for the Indian School at Grouard, Alberta. This letter is to advise you that we have a couple of carloads of laundry machinery moving to Winnipeg in the very near future, and any laundry machinery which is coming into Saskatchewan or Alberta can be enclosed in these cars to Winnipeg, thence L.C.L. to destination. In the case of Grouard, the saving over the special Government prices amounts to $2.05 per 100 lbs., which, we feel, you would be anxious to save.\n\nAs you know, machines which we handle in the West are the products of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Limited, and if at this time you are in the market we will gladly give you revised quotations, showing the savings in freight to any of these Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\nThis letter replaces draft of March 31/36.\n\nMe\n\nOttawa, March 31st, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nAs you can imagine, Mr. Crerar is very busy at the present time and on that account he has asked me to write to you in reference to your letter of the 26th February last, regarding the purchase of certain equipment for use in the classrooms of the new building at Grounds.\n\nThe Department have now informed me that they are communicating with you for the purpose of obtaining a definite list of the sizes and the number of each size of school desks required, when arrangements will be made for the purchase through the Purchasing Branch of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

It will therefore be necessary to state, also, the number and size of each front and rear seat required.\n\nRegarding the bookcase, please state the type required. It is presumed, as there will be certain danger of breakage in transportation, that only a bookcase with wooden panels in doors be supplied.\n\nPlease state, also, the number of visitors' chairs required and if any teacher's desk or chairs are needed.\n\nWhen the Department has full information regarding the above equipment, the order for supplying same will be placed from here.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

His Lordship Bishop Guy arranged for the employment of the labour and the rates paid, this Department providing a grant only towards the cost of the work. I would suggest that your correspondent apply to Bishop Guy for the information he requires regarding wages paid.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nL. P.

If this is so, undoubtedly the Department must know what wages were paid.\n\nI quite realize that it is possible for me to obtain this information from Bishop Guy, but I am interested in dealing directly with your Department and trust that you will see your way clear to supply me with the information requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRene Pelletier\nMember for Peace River.\nApril 23, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Pelletier:\n\nI have delayed replying to your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the wages paid labourers and carpenters on certain building work carried out by the Roman Catholic Mission at Grouard, Alberta, during the year 1935, until I had the opportunity of consulting Right Reverend Jos. Guy, Bishop of Grouard.\n\nI understand, after consulting with the Bishop, he endeavoured to give work to as many men as possible who otherwise might be obliged to be in receipt of relief. The Department appreciated the manner in which His Lordship handled the work and the satisfactory job performed at each school.\n\nThis was not a Federal Government contract. The schools at which the work was carried out are the property of the Roman Catholic Church. His Lordship Bishop Guy was entirely responsible for the employment of the labour and the rates paid.

The pay for carpenters was at $25 an hour and board being altogether too scanty to provide a family of twelve.\n\nI remain truly yours,\nJ. W.

PARKER,\n\nI would request that you obtain prices for the supplying of the following laundry equipment, for use at the Grouard (St. Bernard's) Indian Residential School, f. o. b. Jousset, Alta., government sales tax included:\n\n1 - Canadian Globe washer, with wood outer case, having galvanized iron sliding door and 36 x 54\" inner wood cylinder, capacity 100# dry weight per load, motor driven, 110 volt, direct current.\n\n1 - Canadian Solid Curb Extractor, with 26\" inner basket, having side sheets of monel metal, manually operated brake and plain safety cover. Capacity 80# dry weight per load. Individual motor driven, with regular speed and regular start.\n\n1 - Canadian #1 Handy Ironer, #11115, with 66\" inverted chest, having a delivery speed of 12' per minute. With automatic safety feed guard, pressure device and wood feed box. To be steam heated and driven by its own motor, 110V. D.C.\n\n1 - Canadian Drytex Tumbler, with 36 x 48\" galvanized, woven wire mesh cylinder, capacity 55 lbs. dry weight per load. Silent V. Belt motor drive. With full width gear guards and self aligning ball-bearing cylinder bearings. Cylinder to be of non-reversing type motor driven, 110 volt, direct current, and to be steam heated.\n\n1 - 10 H.P. Vulcan Vertical Boiler, capable of producing a working pressure of 100 lb. steam. Including regular boiler fittings.\n\n2 - Sets of Two - 42 x 24 x 16\" Cement Laundry Tubs with N.P. Fittings.\n\nEquipment to be similar in all respects to that manufactured by Canadian Laundry Machinery Company. Full description and cuts of machinery quoted on should be supplied with quotation.\n\"We have just received a request to quote on laundry machinery for the Indian School at Grouard, Alberta. Copy of the specifications is enclosed.\n\nYou will note that our equipment has been specified, but of course the Government will accept competitive equipment, although I might tell you that it does not have the features which our equipment has, so I presume it boils down to a question of price.\n\nOne thing I thought I might write you about is in connection with the Extractor - the second item. We have some reconditioned Extractors in Winnipeg, which could be individually motor driven, and could possibly save the Department $150.00 to $200.00 on such a machine. I am wondering if it is the Department's policy to consider reconditioned equipment. An Extractor, for instance, is a machine which has a life of 25 to 30 years, as there are not many parts to give any trouble. We sell a good many to commercial laundries and hospitals who do not insist on new machinery. I know that you are trying to save money for the Government and would be obliged if you would advise if the Department would consider a reconditioned Extractor.\n\nWe will be quoting on this equipment in a few days; in fact the quotations close on June 26th, but I have had to write our Calgary Manager for a little more information.\"\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, June 25, 1936\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nI am enclosing herewith an extract from a letter received from Stanley Brock Limited referring to certain laundry machinery that is being purchased for the Indian School at Ground, Alberta. Will you please bring the matter to the attention of your Purchasing Agent.\n\nC.W. Jackson\nPrivate Secretary\n\nEnclosure (1).\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, June 29th, 1936.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nI understand that recently you called for quotations for certain laundry machines for the Indian School at Grouard. The Minister is interested in one of the firms that is quoting prices and would be glad to see the tenders before any definite decision is made in regard to them.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 7, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI wish to refer to my memorandum of April third, last, and memoranda from Mr. Jackson, Private Secretary of the 23rd and 29th ultimo, regarding the quotations for the supplying of laundry machinery for the Grouard (St. Bernard's) Indian Residential School, in the Lesser Slave Lake agency, northern Alberta. Quotations have been received as follows:\n\nStanley Brock, Limited, Winnipeg - $4,134.45\nBeaver Soap & Chemicals, Ltd., Winnipeg - $4,104.00\n\nThese prices are f.o.b. Jeussard, Alberta, the nearest shipping point to the school, and I attach the quotations, as requested.\n\nThe quotation obtained by His Lordship Bishop Guy, from Stanley Brock, Limited, Calgary, Alta., was for the supplying of Group Laundry Equipment, operated in one unit, by one large motor, while the prices from the other two firms are for individual motors for each of the machines. In installing Group Equipment, it would be necessary to have a drive shaft, with pulleys and belting, and it has been found, in schools where this equipment is in use, that there is danger in the persons operating the machine catching their hands or clothing in the belting.\n\nRegarding Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 23rd ultimo, with extract of a letter received from Stanley\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nBrock Limited\nBrock, Limited, dated Winnipeg, June 19th, last, stating that they could supply a re-conditioned extractor, at a saving of $150 to $200 on their quotation, I would say that it would be more satisfactory to supply entirely new equipment to this outlying school. We have had considerable trouble at our schools, in using re-conditioned laundry equipment, and it is often difficult to obtain new parts. In discussing this matter with the Architect of the Department, he stated that little could be gained in supplying re-conditioned equipment, as there is no guarantee as to the length of service and owing to the difficulty in obtaining and replacing parts that might be required from time to time.\n\nI might add that, while only the sum of $8,500 was provided for this purpose, yet, there are other funds available, which were intended for barn and classroom equipment at this school. Classroom equipment has been obtained and there is a saving of $275.00 in the amount for this purpose. The balance required could be taken from the amount provided for barn equipment.\n\nI would recommend that new laundry equipment, as described in the quotations herewith, be supplied, and I submit same for your consideration. I should be pleased to be advised of the name of the firm with whom the order should be placed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nSchools.\nTHE Beaver Utility Tumbler is designed to fill the requirements of small plants and to fit in for departmental work in large plants. As a departmental tumbler this machine saves many steps and delays in sending odds and ends to the tumbler department.\n\nThe machine is very sturdily constructed and ball bearings are used throughout. The case is made of welded steel plates and the cylinder of closely perforated galvanized steel plates. The fan is a special high-speed type with aluminum blades. The heating element is a copper fin coil and the draft control is so arranged that any desired temperature from cold to hot can be obtained by the movement of one lever.\n\nThe tumbler is made in three sizes, 36, 42 and 48 inches long by 36 inches in diameter. At an additional cost it can be fitted with explosion proof motors and fused steam extinguisher valve for dry cleaning.\n\nPrices for belt drive are the same as motor drive.\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Limited\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents: THE BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICALS, LTD., WINNIPEG\nBEAVER STEAM BOARD\n\nTHE Beaver Steam Board is designed to eliminate those objectionable features found in most steam boards.\n\nThe steam chamber and board are of monel metal so that there is no danger of rust when steaming. The sleeve board is also all monel metal.\n\nThe board is equipped with a bronze heating coil to dry out the padding and the sleeve board has a water separator. A steam vacuum exhaust is provided, and both steaming and exhaust are operated by foot pedals.\n\nSize of Board\u201450 x 15 x 10\u00bd.\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Limited\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents: THE BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICALS, LTD., WINNIPEG\nLAUNDRY MACHINERY\n\nSingle Roll Ironer\n\nThe Beaver Single Roll Ironer is a simply designed, sturdy, efficient machine specially suited to produce a high-class finish on table napkins, handkerchiefs, doilies and other small pieces.\n\nIt can be arranged so that the goods can be fed straight through and delivered to the opposite side or so that the goods are returned to the feed side. The return arrangement is usually chosen as this allows the ironer to be operated by one person, if necessary.\n\nThe steam chest is a heavy semisteel casting carefully machined and highly polished and tested to 200 pounds per square inch hydrostatic pressure and 125 pounds per square inch steam pressure. The padded roll is 12 inches in diameter and is supplied fully clothed with 1\u00bc inches of padding.\n\nThe pressure device is a simple hand-operated worm and cam arrangement operated by a hand wheel. This provides a very positive easy means of pressure regulation. The pressure device is so arranged that the roll can be lifted right out of mesh for re-padding. The control is by means of a lever-operated clutch in belt drive machine. With motor drive push button stop and start is provided.\n\nMotor drive ironers have the motor carried on a bracket at the righthand end of the machine and the motor is connected to the drive shaft by silent gearing.\n\nGuards are provided for all gears and an efficient guard (not shown in the illustration) is placed on the roll to protect the operator.\n\nThe Beaver Single Roll Ironer is made in a standard size of 75 inches long, but can be supplied in any length from 64 inches to 120 inches.\n\n75 inch. Floor space 9 ft. x 3 ft. Shipping weight 2,000 lbs.\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICALS LIMITED, WINNIPEG\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor\n\nMOTOR DRIVE\n\nA HEAVY DUTY EXTRACTOR Designed to operate at high speeds, self-balancing, and requiring only a minimum of attention.\n\nThe Curb, Legs and Base are one solid massive casting, weighing almost 300 lbs. more than the ordinary curb. This tends to absorb vibration, allowing the Machine to balance easily, and to pick up speed quickly.\n\nThe Wide Square Base distributes the weight over a large area, and allows this Machine to be operated at higher speeds than is possible with a small or round base.\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Limited\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents; Beaver Soap & Chemicals Ltd., Winnipeg\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor (Continued)\n\nThe Basket is of Perforated Copper, heavily tinned and strongly reinforced by steel bands. The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick adjustment or changing of the rubber springs.\n\nThe Beaver circulating oil system ensures complete lubrication of the main bearing at all times. The oil well is very accessible for inspection of the oil level and refilling. From the oil well the oil is led to a sump in the base of the machine, whence it circulates through the bearing, returning to the sump. Owing to the large capacity of the oil well only occasional attention is required.\n\nThe Beaver Motor Drive Extractor has a high torque vertical motor mounted on a sliding base attached to a heavy base bolted to the curb and legs of the machine. The extractor is driven through a short belt with provision for maintaining belt tension. The motor is controlled by a stop and start push button mounted conveniently on the curb. Motor starter with overload relay is provided. Motors are specially built for the work having a high starting torque to take care of the overload when starting the machine and are of ample size to operate the extractor at its proper high speed.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size | Motor | Load | Speed of Basket | Centrifugal Force Per Pound | Horse Power | Shaving Weight |\n|------|-------|------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| 20 inch | 2 H.P. | 30 lbs. | 1400 R.P.M. | 550 lbs. | 30 x 54 | 1050 lbs. |\n| 26 inch | 3 H.P. | 50 lbs. | 1300 R.P.M. | 610 lbs. | 36 x 48 | 1700 lbs. |\n| 30 inch | 4 H.P. | 65 lbs. | 1200 R.P.M. | 615 lbs. | 40 x 54 | 1950 lbs. |\n| 36 inch | 5 H.P. | 114 lbs. | 1100 R.P.M. | 610 lbs. | 45 x 66 | 2800 lbs. |\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Limited\n\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents: BEAVER SOAP & CHEMICALS LTD, WINNIPEG\nLAUNDRY MACHINERY\n\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\n\nHeader on End\n\nThis is a very strongly constructed washer, built for heavy duty. The material throughout is of the best grade and no pains have been spared to produce a machine that can be relied upon to give many years of satisfactory service.\n\nThe Main Trunion Journals operate in roller bearings. Less power is required to drive the machine and wear is almost entirely eliminated, with the result that all gears are always in correct mesh and alignment. Broken gears, worn trunion journals and bearing replacements are never necessary on this washer. The main bearings are entirely separated from the tub by packed stuffing boxes, which absolutely prevents oil and grease from entering the washer or water from coming out.\n\nThe Reversing Movement is our Beaver Ball Bearing type in which all the thrust of operating the belt shifter slides is taken by hardened steel balls. The movement is designed so as to give a positive even shifting of the belts, irrespective of wear, so that the cylinder runs the same number of\n\nThe Beaver Laundry Machinery Co. Limited\nToronto\n\nWestern Agents; Beaver Soap & Chemicals Ltd., Winnipeg\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\u2014Header on End\n\nrevolutions in either direction. The gears are machine cut from solid blanks and the main gear is thirty inches in diameter. The gear has a split hub to facilitate easy removal. A combined gear lock and hand wheel is provided.\n\nThe Cylinder is of the best grade all heart stock long-leaf yellow pine with hard Maple ribs. The three lifting ribs are extra deep to ensure rapid washing. The trunnions are bolted to heavy brass rings. The hinges are of brass bolted through a brass buttom with an enclosed brass lock.\n\nThe Outer Case is of the finest clear Cypress and is furnished with a brass apron at the door opening. Inspection plates are provided in each end so that trunion bolts may be tightened without removing the upper half of the case.\n\nThe Inlet and Outlet Tees are connected by a 1\u00bd inch pipe into which steam can be injected. When steam is being used to heat the water this construction gives a rapid circulation and absolutely prevents any steam from coming in contact with the wood of the cylinder or case. The water inlet is 2 inches in diameter. The steam inlet is \u00be inch. A 3 inch plug type discharge valve is supplied.\n\nThis Washer can be arranged for motor drive, in which case it is driven from the motor through short belts. The motor is carried on a substantial cast iron base bolted firmly to the frame of the machine.\n\nAt a small additional cost these machines may be equipped with a Beaver 6 inch foot operated discharge valve, Beaver Water Level Indicator, visible anywhere in the wash room, Beaver Soap and Soda filling doors, and Monel Metal Lifting Ribs in the cylinder.\n\n| SIZE   | NUMBER OF DOORS | NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS | PULLEYS | BELTS | SPEED | FLOOR SEAT | WEIGHT |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|-------|-------|------------|--------|\n| 36 x 36| One             | One                 | 16 inch | 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 44 x 72    | 1500 lbs. |\n| 36 x 52| One             | Two                 | 16 inch | 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 44 x 88    | 1650 lbs. |\n| 40 x 40| One             | One                 | 16 inch | 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 48 x 76    | 1600 lbs. |\n| 40 x 52| One             | Two                 | 16 inch | 1\u00bd x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 48 x 88    | 1750 lbs. |\n\nSINGLE GEARED ONLY\n\nThe above are our standard sizes.

Quotations have been received as follows:\n\nStanley Brock, Limited, Winnipeg - $4,184.45\nDenver Soap & Chemicals, Ltd., Winnipeg - 4,104.00\n\nThese prices are f. o. b. Jeussard, Alberta, the nearest shipping point to the school, and I attach the quotations, as requested.\n\nThe quotation obtained by His Lordship Bishop Guy, from Stanley Brock, Limited, Calgary, Alta., was for the supplying of Group Laundry Equipment, operated in one unit, by one large motor, while the prices from the other two firms are for individual motors for each of the machines. In installing Group Equipment, it would be necessary to have a drive shaft, with pulleys and belting, and it has been found, in schools where this equipment is in use, that there is danger in the persons operating the machine catching their hands or clothing in the belting.\n\nRegarding Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 23rd ultimo, with extract of a letter received from Stanley\n\n- Brock Limited\nBrook, Limited, dated Winnipeg, June 18th, last, stating that they could supply a re-conditioned extractor, at a saving of $150 to $200 on their quotation, I would say that it would be more satisfactory to supply entirely new equipment to this outlying school. We have had considerable trouble at our schools in using re-conditioned laundry equipment, and it is often difficult to obtain new parts. In discussing this matter with the Architect of the Department, he stated that little could be gained in supplying re-conditioned equipment, as there is no guarantee as to the length of service and owing to the difficulty in obtaining and replacing parts that might be required from time to time.\n\nI might add that, while only the sum of $3,500 was provided for this purpose, yet, there are other funds available, which were intended for barn and classroom equipment at this school. Classroom equipment has been obtained and there is a saving of $275.00 in the amount for this purpose. The balance required could be taken from the amount provided for barn equipment.\n\nI would recommend that new laundry equipment, as described in the quotations herewith, be supplied, and I submit same for your consideration. I should be pleased to be advised of the name of the firm with whom the order should be placed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, July 11, 1936.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to inform you that your quotation of the 16th ultimo, for the supplying of laundry equipment, is approved.

The Department desires to reimburse Bishop Guy for the amount paid by him for this equipment. Before doing so, however, it will be necessary that the accounts be received in triplicate. I would therefore request that you forward itemized accounts covering your orders Nos. 5834, 5835, 5836, 5837, 9407, and 9408.

If Stanley Brock are the successful bidders you can ship to GROUARD but in order to secure special rate from Toronto (\u00bd rate) please write Mr Ramsay, c/o General Freight Office, C.P.R., Windsor Station, MONTREAL, to ask about procedure to follow. The freight account will have to be sent to me. Do you desire me to go ahead with the Stanley Brock people?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nOttawa, July 14, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letters of the 2nd and 7th instant, enclosing accounts covering the cost of barn equipment supplied for use at the Grouard and Joussard Indian Residential Schools. I am writing the Company to furnish duplicate copies of their accounts, as you forwarded only one copy. Before payment can be made of the accounts, it is necessary, under present regulations, to obtain an Order in Council. I am having this placed before the Minister, but I am not aware how long it will be before it passes Council.\n\nThe above also applies in the case of the account which you forwarded for supplies for installing water pressure tank, plumbing and heating, at the Wabasca School. Might I point out that only the sum of $3,000 is provided for the Wabasca School, not $4,000, as stated in your letter. As soon as the Order in Council is obtained, payment of accounts, up to the amount provided, can be made.\n\nRegarding the laundry equipment, you were written officially yesterday, informing you that the order had been placed with Stanley Brock, Limited, Winnipeg, whose quotation covers the cost of freight charges, f.o.b. Joussard. The Minister decided that, as only the sum of $3,500 is available for laundry equipment, it would not be possible to supply the ironer. I hope, when the other equipment arrives, that it will be satisfactory.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nJuly 14, 1936.\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council,-\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the equipment, repairs and improvements enumerated hereunder have been authorized at each of the Grouard (St. Bernard's); Jossard (St. Bruno's) and Wabasca Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta:\n\n**Grouard (St. Bernard's)**\n\n- Barn equipment - $1,200.\n- Laundry equipment - $3,500.\n- Classroom equipment - $800.\n- General repairs - $500. Total - $6,000.\n\n**Jossard (St. Bruno's)**\n\n- Barn equipment - $1,000.\n\n**Wabasca R.C.**\n\n- Installing water pressure tank, plumbing and heating - $3,000.\n\nTotal - $10,000.\n\nAs these schools are in an isolated locality, it has been found that the most economical method of arranging for the repairs and purchase of equipment would be to place the work in charge of the Oblate Order, under whose auspices these schools are conducted. All work and purchases of equipment were approved by the Department and carried out under the direct supervision of His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, C.M., Bishop of Grouard.\n\nFunds to cover the cost of the above mentioned equipment and work are provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) in payment of the cost of supplying the equipment and in the carrying out of the above mentioned work.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of July 14th, 1936.\n\nThe Grouard (St. Bernard's), the Joussard (St. Bruno's) and the Wabasca R.C. Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Agency, northern Alberta, are owned and conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order. His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, requested that assistance be given by the Department towards the cost of providing certain equipment, repairs and improvements at the above named schools. The Department provided funds, to the amount of $10,000.00, in the Estimates for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nOwing to the rather isolated location of the schools, it was considered the most economical method was to place the work in charge of the church authorities. Bishop Guy arranged for the purchase of the equipment and the carrying out of the improvements.\n\nRequest is now being made to His Excellency in Council for the necessary authority for payment of the costs of the above mentioned work and equipment.\nBGRA, Y. 40 NL.,\n\nVIA EDMONTON, GIROUARD, ALTA JULY 17 18\n\nTHE SECRETARY DEPT., INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nLETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH RE LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT FOR GIROUARD SCHOOL\nRECEIVED STOP PLEASE ADVISE STANLEY BROCK LIMITED TO HOLD SHIPMENT\nUNTIL FURTHER ORDERS AS I WISH TO SUBJECT CHANGES STOP\nLETTER WILL REACH YOU WEDNESDAY TWENTY SECOND CONCERNING THIS MATTER.\n\nBISHOP GUY.\n\n1AM\nOttawa, July 18, 1936.\n\nRight Rev.

The prices from the Winnipeg branch were obtained direct by the Department.\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nJuly 17th, 1936\n\nAttention of Mr Sutherland,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Sutherland:\n\nI beg to acknowledge letter signed by the Secretary in date of the 13th inst re Laundry Equipment for Grouard Residential School. My night letter of today in the matter is now being explained.\n\nI had given quotations from the Calgary Office of the Stanley Brock Limited. I note by your letter that shipment is made through Winnipeg Branch. May I suggest that credit be given to the Calgary Manager?\n\nI note the omission of the Ironer as included in first quotation and also the elimination of the CANADIAN GROUP DRIVE of three machines viz: Washer, Extractor and Ironer, substituting individual motor driving. May I say that individual motor driving brings up the expense for each machine as you can find out in above mentioned quotations from Calgary. The total figures of the said quotations amounted to $3,210.00 plus approximately $458.00 freight making a total of $3,668.00. In a previous letter I told you that I have secured special rates on the Railway and could have said $458.00 cut to $229.00 making a total of $3,439.00 which would be within the $3,500.00 voted. Why not give me the opportunity of profiting by the advantages given me instead of depriving me of same by direct purchase?\n\nYou have given orders for shipment to Joussard. As there is no platform at the Station you will have to ship said Equipment to GROUARD.

We note that in placing the order they omitted to give you an Ironer, although in your enquiry to us you specified one of these machines.\n\nIt has just occurred to the writer that perhaps the reason the Ironer was left off the order was to keep down the investment in this equipment. I am wondering if you could have the Department purchase a reconditioned #1 Handy flatwork Ironer, 66\" wide, similar to the new one we quoted you in our letter of March 14th., our Proposal #2. This would be equipped with its own individual motor to set on the floor beside it. I might tell you that this Ironer has been in a laundry in Winnipeg but has not been operating very long and has just recently been replaced by larger equipment. The machine would be sent to you completely overhauled and in first class running order. As you know there is very little that can ever go wrong with an Ironer because there is no continual strain put on the machine like a Washer or Extractor.\n\nOur Winnipeg House has this Ironer and they tell us that you could purchase it for $500.00 complete with D.C. motor as above mentioned, f.o.b. Winnipeg. If you compare this price with the figure quoted in our Proposal of March 14th., you will find that it is practically half of what a new machine would cost you.\n\nIf you think that this suggestion would be of interest to the Department, and you could have this machine purchased on the above mentioned basis, I am sure you would be perfectly satisfied with the equipment and it would complete your laundry.\n\nWould appreciate hearing from you at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nManager.\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nAugust 27th, 1936\n\nPersonal\n\nMr Harold W. McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI take the liberty of enclosing the letter just received from the Manager of Stanley Brock in Calgary and which is self explanatory.\n\nA sum of $3,500 has been voted for Laundry Equipment at Grouard and $3,096 is applied to new equipment which is expected here any day. A mangle has been omitted though requested because amount would have been exceeded.\n\nIf the Ironer mentioned in Mr Cochrane's letter could be bought by the Department I would pay the difference. However, if you prefer to wait until next year to supply a mangle as a letter form the Department suggests, I could certainly wait as equipment would be of better quality. Regarding balance from $3,096 to $3,500 I can spend as piping and work will be required to install the coming equipment.\n\nI leave the whole matter to your kind appreciation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nOttawa, September 4, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from Stanley Brock, Limited, offering to supply an ironer, complete with motor, which was in operation for a short time in a laundry in Winnipeg, for the sum of $500.00, f. o. b. Winnipeg.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that only the sum of $3,500.00 has been provided for laundry equipment, and, as you were informed, an order has been placed to supply this equipment, to the amount of $3,086.65. This would leave a balance of only $403.35 available to purchase the ironer. I might say, further, that an amount of only $2,200.00 was provided to supply barn equipment for the schools at Grouard and Jossard, while accounts covering the cost of this equipment have been paid to the amount of $2,361.74, or $161.74 in excess of the sum provided. I regret, therefore, that the Department will be unable to supply the used ironer offered by Stanley Brock, Limited, during the current fiscal year.\n\nWhen our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, consideration will be given to placing an item therein to provide for supplying a new ironer, at a cost of approximately $1,050.00.\n\nAny balance on hand from the amount provided for laundry equipment could be utilized, as suggested by you, in paying for the cost of piping and the work of installing the laundry equipment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Details of the expenditure are set forth in the Order in Council. Right Reverend Joe Guy, C.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, arranged for the purchase of the barn equipment for the two first named schools and also for the work at the Wabasca R.C. School. The classroom equipment for Grouard was ordered through the purchasing branch of this Department. Regarding the purchase of the laundry equipment, I would refer you to my memoranda dated April third and July 7th, last. Accounts have been received and paid, covering the cost of the barn, laundry and classroom equipment.\n\nThe general repairs at Grouard and the installing of the water pressure tank, etc., at Wabasca are being carried out in charge of the church authorities, and the accounts covering the cost of this work have not yet been received. As stated in the synopsis of the memorandum to Council of July 14th, last, it was considered the most economical method to have the work done was to place it in charge of the church authorities.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 6, 1936\n\nDr. McGill,\nD.S.G. Indian Affairs\n\nI have your memorandum of the 5th instant, your file 131-1-5, regarding equipment for certain schools in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency.\n\nOur enquiry is from the Forkhill Bedding Limited of Winnipeg, and refers to Tender No. 315, September 15th last, for Indian Schools at Slave Lake, Joussard, Croward and Delmas, Sask., and, from telephone conversation with your Mr. Parker, it is understood that the tender call referred to (No. 315) was for INSTITUTIONAL BEDS AND MATTRESSES. Your memorandum of the 5th would not, therefore, seem to apply.\n\nWill you be good enough to furnish a further memorandum, giving full particulars of the tender call mentioned (No. 315).\n\nW.J.F.

They are in the hands of Mr Sutherland. I understand that an Order-in-Council would be required to have same paid. I respectfully request that said Order-in-Council be made in our favor. I enclose another account for a washing machine bought after our recent fire as an emergency help. I have also labour sheets in Grouard for work done and unpaid. If the latter could be considered when preparing the Order-in-Council I would appreciate a wire at Grouard when I would sent same immediately.\n\nAs usual I express my regret at the fact that if we had in the past spent so much money for our Indian Schools it would be an easier matter for us to have accounts above referred to paid as no Order-in-Council would be required. I again make the Department the offer to buy our schools at a price set by your own Inspector in order that we could be placed on the same footing as other institutions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard\nDear Doctor McGill:-\n\nIn my Memo of yesterday RE Reconstruction of Boys' Residence in Grouard I forgot to mention that in my formal request to the Honorable Minister I had mentioned the probable price (including Laundry Equipment) at $50,000.00 as per first hand approximate figures given by Mr Orr. I may say however that the latter in view of the kind of construction and facilities for us to get sand believes the building can be erected for probably less than $40,000.00 He will be able to give you closer figures in a short time.\n\nIt will be understood naturally that the building will be the property of the Department.\n\nI intend to have Mr Gardner-Smith of Calgary in charge of the work which would be done by local labor at a cheap rate.\n\nIf an amount is placed in Estimates for said work and if in order to let me know about same I would appreciate a telegram not later that April 2nd as I am leaving Grouard on the 3rd to return East.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nEn route, March 15th, 1937\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have seen the Minister in the matter and have hope from him of serious consideration. He has authorized the preparation of plans which will be ready shortly when Mr Orr will be able to give an approximate price for construction. If the Minister finds he is unable for the present year to supply the whole amount I would certainly consider a substantial account and borrow the balance same to be reimbursed by the Department next year.\n\nMay I say that all the schools in my Vicariate have been built at our expense with the exception of Joussand. I therefore consider that after such a trying experience as our last fire I should be substantially helped.\n\nAnd if I am allowed to express all my mind I will say that after the 25 years of service and cooperation with the Department, during which time I have certainly saved money for the Department and given moral help of every kind, I was under the impression that no hesitation would have existed in the matter of giving a hand. I may have been mistaken but I sincerely thought that I deserved special consideration.\n\nThe Minister has told me he would see you and Mr Hoey in the matter. You will understand my position and, am positive, will act accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard\nOttawa, March 22, 1937.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to your account, to the amount of $154.20, covering the cost of beds and mattresses shipped to Reverend C.

All purchases of equipment and the labour in connection with repairs were approved by the Department and carried out under the direct supervision of His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard.\n\nFunds to cover the cost of the above mentioned equipment and labour are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $4,347.37 in payment of the cost of supplying the equipment and in carrying out the labour at the above mentioned schools.\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMarch 22nd, 1937.\n\nSynopsis of Memorandum to Council of\n\nThe Grouard (St. Bernard's), Joussard (St. Bruno's), Sturgeon Lake and Vermilion Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake Indian agency, northern Alberta, are owned and conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order. His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard, has requested that assistance be given by the Department towards the cost of providing certain equipment and labour at the above named schools, to the total amount of $4,347.37. Bishop Guy arranged for the purchase of the equipment and the carrying out of labour in making improvements. The necessary funds are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nA request is now being made to His Excellency in Council for the necessary authority for payment of the costs of the above mentioned equipment and labour, to the amount of $4,347.37.\nMarch 23rd, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nI enclose Memorandum to Council, requesting authority to pay accounts, amounting to $4,347.37, in connection with four of the Indian residential schools in the Diocese of Grouard.\n\nThe amount mentioned above is made up as follows:\n\nGrouard Residential School:\nPurchase of Equipment - $2,283.49\n\nJoussard Residential School:\nLabour - erecting barn - $1,434.97\n\nSturgeon Lake Residential School:\nPurchase of washing machine - $211.27\n\nVermilion Residential School:\nPurchase two furnaces - $417.64\n\nHis Lordship, Rt. Rev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I., has submitted accounts to the Department covering the above and I am satisfied that the articles have been purchased and were required. As these schools are owned by the Diocese of Grouard, it is necessary to obtain an Order-in-Council to authorize payment of the accounts. Funds can be found for the purpose in our Appropriation for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1937, and I recommend that the necessary Order-in-Council be secured.\n\nDirector.\n## CANADA PRODUCTS LIMITED\n\n**LUMBER, MILL WORK AND BUILDERS' SUPPLIES**\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nOctober 1935\n\nSold to La Corporation Episcopale C.

This is due to the fact that, when we paid the account, the time limit for obtaining the discount had elapsed, and, as a result, we had to make payment of the full amount of the account. As funds were not readily available, we were unable to make payment within the allotted time and, as a matter of fact, the money used for the purpose had to be borrowed from the bank, when this was possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Edmund\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\n\nEn route, March 15th, 1887\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nYou will remember that there are a certain number of outstanding accounts calling for reimbursement. They are in the hands of Mr. Sutherland. I understand that an Order-in-Council would be required to have same paid. I respectfully request that said Order-in-Council be made in our favor. I enclose another account for a washing machine bought after our recent fire as an emergency help. I have also labour sheets in Grouard for work done and unpaid. If the latter could be considered when preparing the Order-in-Council I would appreciate a wire at Grouard when I would send same immediately.\n\nAs usual I express my regret at the fact that if we had in the past spent so much money for our Indian Schools it would be an easier matter for us to have accounts above referred to paid as no Order-in-Council would be required. I again make the Department the offer to buy our schools at a price set by your own Inspector in order that we could be placed on the same footing as other institutions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nSome time ago, in the beginning of February, I have asked the Honourable the minister for a grant of $10,000.00 to help towards defraying the cost of building an Indian Day School in GROUARD. The said Day School is already built.\n\nAs there was a vote in last year's Estimates for Indian Day Schools which has not been totally used, I thought that help could be supplied from that source.\n\nAs yet I have received no answer from the Minister's Office or from the Department. Would you suggest me writing again as the end of the Fiscal year is nearing its end. Or do you prefer mentioning the case yourself to the Minister? A line from you in Grouard would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nCanada\n\nEn route, March 15th, 1937\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by The Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General on the 31st March, 1937.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 22nd March, 1937, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, stating that the repairs, equipment and labour enumerated hereunder have been authorized at each of the Grouard (St. Bernard's); Joussard (St. Bruno's); Sturgeon Lake and Vermilion Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake agency, northern Alberta:\n\n| Location          | Amount   |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Grouard (St. Bernard's) | $2,283.49 |\n| Joussard (St. Bruno's)    | 1,434.97 |\n| Sturgeon Lake            | 211.27   |\n| Vermilion                | 417.64   |\n\n$4,347.37\n\nThe Minister further states that as these schools are in an isolated locality, it has been found that the most economical method of arranging for the purchase of equipment and in carrying out repairs is to place the work in charge of the Oblate Order, under whose auspices these schools are conducted;\n\nThat all purchases of equipment and the labour in connection with repairs were approved by the Department and carried out under the direct supervision of His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Gay, O.M.I., Bishop of Grouard; and\n\nThat funds to cover the cost of the above mentioned equipment and labour are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37.\n\nThe Minister recommends that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $4,347.37 in payment of the cost of supplying the equipment and in carrying out the labour at the above mentioned schools.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n(Sgd.) E. J. Lemaire,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nthe Minister of Mines &\nResources.\nMarch 29th, 1937.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI notice by the building reports just issued, that your Department will start work soon on an Indian School at Croward. I presume you will naturally require Desks, Blackboards, and other supplies, and I am taking the liberty of mailing you under separate cover today, a copy of my catalogue. The prices as shown, would be subject to a discount of 10% to your department, with transportation charges paid by me.\n\nI trust I may have the opportunity of filling your kind order for your requirements.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFEO/MR\n\nAlberta's Largest School Supply House\nSEND FOR CATALOGUE\nSUGGESTED CONCRETE SPECIFICATION\n\nFOR\n\nSchool at GROUARD, ALBERTA\n\nMATERIALS\n\nPortland Cement shall conform to the Standard specifications for Portland Cement (No. A5-1927 of the Canadian Engineering Standards Association.\n\nConcrete Aggregates shall be free from alkali, organic material or other deleterious substances and shall not contain soft, friable, thin, flaky, elongated or laminated particles totalling more than 3 per cent or containing shale in excess of 1/4 per cent or silt or crusher dust finer than the No. 100 standard sieve in excess of 2 per cent. These percentages shall be based on the weight of the combined aggregate as used in the concrete. When all three groups of these deleterious materials are present, the combined amounts shall not exceed 5 per cent by weight of the combined aggregate.\n\nFine and coarse aggregate shall be delivered and stored separately.\n\nFine aggregate shall range in size from fine to coarse within the following limits:\n\n| Percent by weight |\n|-------------------|\n| Passing 3/8\" sieve - not less than | 100 |\n| \" #4 sieve - not less than | 90 |\n| \" #60 sieve - not less than | 8 to 30 |\n| Weight removed by decantation - not more than | 3 |\n\nSand when tested in accordance with the Method of Test for Organic Impurities in Sand in Concrete as specified in Appendix \"K\" of the Standards Specification for Concrete and Reinforced Concrete (No. A23-1929) of the Canadian Engineering Standards Association, shall show a colour not darker than the standard colour.\n\nCoarse aggregate shall range in size from fine to coarse within the following limits:\n\n| Percent by weight |\n|-------------------|\n| Passing 3/4\" sieve - Not less than | 95 |\n| \" #4 sieve - Not more than | 10 |\n| \" #8 sieve - Not more than | 5 |\n\nCoarse aggregate shall consist of screened gravel having clean uncoated particles.\n\nWater for concrete shall be clean and free from injurious amounts of oil, acid, alkali, organic matter or other deleterious substances.\n\nReinforcing Steel shall conform to the Standard Specification for Reinforcing Materials for Concrete (No.A9-1923) of the Canadian Engineering Standards Association. The material for main reinforcement shall be either Rail steel or hard grade new Billet steel. Stirrups shall be structural grade billet steel.\n\nStorage of Materials\n\nCement and aggregates shall be stored at the job in a manner to prevent deterioration or the intrusion of foreign matter. Any material which has deteriorated or has been damaged shall be immediately removed from the job.\n\nReinforcing material shall be stored on racks or skids so it is protected from dirt and will maintain its fabricated form.\n\nConcrete Proportions\n\nConcrete for structural members shall be mixed in the proportion of one (1) part of Portland Cement to 5 parts of combined aggregate, and not more than 5 Imperial gallons of water per sack of cement.\n\nThe aggregates shall be measured separately and shall be in the ratio of approximately 4 parts of fine aggregate to approximately 7 parts of coarse aggregate - measured dry.\nThe total amount of water entering the mix shall not exceed the water-cement ratio given and shall include the surface water carried by the aggregate. When not determined accurately by tests, the amount of surface water shall be assumed as follows:\n\n| Imperial Gallons per cubic foot |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Fine aggregate - Damp           | 1/3   |\n| - Moderately wet                | 1/2   |\n| - Wet                           | 3/4   |\n| Course aggregate - Wet          | 1/4   |\n\nThis mixture shall have a strength in compression at the age of 28 days, as determined by cylinder tests, of at least 2000 pounds per square inch.\n\nConcrete for concrete floor finish shall be mixed in the proportion of one (1) part of Portland cement, to one (1) part of fine aggregate to two (2) parts of pea gravel graded between 1/4\" and 3/8\" in size, and not over 4\u00bd Imperial gallons of water per sack of cement. Allowance shall be made for surface water carried by aggregate as previously specified.\n\n**Concrete Mixing**\n\nAll concrete shall be mixed in a batch mixer of an approved type. The mixer shall be equipped with a water storage tank and a water measuring device which can be set so that the same and correct amount of water is supplied to each batch. Water shall not be admitted to the mixer while it is being discharged.\n\nThe mixing of each batch shall continue for not less than one minute after all the materials are in the mixer. The volume of the mixed materials per batch shall not exceed the manufacturer's rated capacity. The mixer during mixing shall revolve at the peripheral speed recommended by the manufacturer.\n\nThe retempering of concrete which has partially hardened, that is, remixing with or without additional cement, aggregate, or water, will not be permitted.\n\n**Placing Concrete**\n\nBefore placing concrete, all equipment for mixing and transporting the concrete shall be cleaned of hardened concrete and foreign materials. All debris and ice shall be removed from the places to be occupied by the concrete. All forms shall be thoroughly soaked with water (except in freezing weather), or oiled.\n\nConcrete shall be handled from the mixer to the place of final deposit as rapidly as possible, by methods which will prevent the separation or loss of the ingredients. Concrete shall be deposited in the forms, as nearly as practicable, in its final position to avoid reshuffling or flowing. Under no circumstances shall concrete that has partially hardened be deposited in the forms.\n\nWhen concreting is once started, it shall be carried on as a continuous operation until the pacing of the section is completed.\n\nConcrete shall be thoroughly compacted by puddling with suitable tools during the operation of placing and shall be thoroughly worked around the reinforcement, embedded fixtures, and into the corners of the forms. Special care shall be taken in compacting the concrete in metal forms so as to eliminate all honey combing in the finished surfaces.\n\n**Construction Joints**\n\nConstruction joints in columns shall be made at the underside of the floor slab.\nConstruction Joints (continued)\n\nConstruction joints in floors shall be located near the centre of spans of slabs, beams, joists and girders, unless a beam intersects a girder at this point, in which case, the joint in the girder shall be offset a distance equal to twice the width of the beam. In this case, adequate provision shall be made for shear by the use of inclined reinforcement.\n\nAt least 2 hours must elapse after depositing concrete in columns or walls before depositing in beams, girders, joists or slabs supported thereon.\n\nThe surface of hardened concrete shall be roughened and thoroughly cleaned of foreign matter and laitance and shall be saturated with water and the form retightened against the face of the hardened concrete before depositing additional concrete. An excess of mortar on hardened surfaces shall be secured by thoroughly rodding the freshly deposited concrete to remove the coarse aggregate from contact with the hardened concrete.\n\nCuring\n\nAfter being placed, all floors shall be covered as soon as possible with a layer, at least one inch thick, of shavings, sawdust or sand, which shall be kept continuously moist for at least 7 days.\n\nWalls and other concrete surfaces shall be kept moist by sprinkling or other methods for at least 4 days.\n\nCold Weather Requirements\n\nWhen depositing concrete at freezing or near-freezing temperatures, the concrete shall have a temperature of between 50 degrees Fahr. and 100 degrees Fahr. It shall be maintained at a temperature of at least 50 degrees Fahr. for not less than 4 days after placing. When the surrounding atmosphere has a temperature lower than 40 degrees Fahr., all aggregates and water shall be preheated and all reinforcement, forms fillers and ground with which the concrete is to come in contact, shall be defrosted.\n\nAll canvas and other protective coverings shall be kept clear of the concrete to permit free circulation of air around all columns and over the tops of all slabs and beams.\n\nSalts, chemicals and other substances shall not be added to the mixture with a view to the prevention of freezing.\n\nManure and other injurious substances shall not be allowed to come in contact with fresh concrete.\n\nReinforcement\n\nMetal reinforcement, before being placed, shall be free from rust, scale or other coatings that will destroy or reduce the bond. Reinforcement shall be formed to the dimensions indicated on the plans. The diameter of bends shall not be less than 8 times the diameter of the bar.\n\nMetal reinforcement shall not be bent or straightened in a manner that will injure the material. Bars, with kinks or bends not shown on the plans, shall not be used. Heating of reinforcement for bending will not be permitted.\n\nMetal reinforcement shall be accurately placed and secured and shall be supported by concrete or metal chairs or spacers, or metal hangers. Brick, wood, gypsum, tile or similar materials shall not be used to support the reinforcement.\nFORMS\n\nForms shall conform to the shape, lines and dimensions of the member called for on the plans. They shall be substantial and sufficiently tight to prevent the leakage of mortar; they shall be properly braced and tied so as to maintain their position and shape. Temporary openings shall be provided where necessary, to facilitate cleaning immediately before depositing concrete. Bolts and rods used for internal ties shall be so arranged that, when the forms are removed, there shall be no metal within one inch of any surface. Wire ties will be permitted on unimportant work; they shall not be used through surfaces where discoloration will be objectionable.\n\nWood Forms for exposed surfaces shall be built of lumber dressed to a uniform width and thickness and free from loose knots and other defects. Joints in forms shall be horizontal or vertical. For unexposed surfaces, plastered surfaces and rough work, undressed lumber may be used. Lumber once used in forms shall have the nails withdrawn and surfaces to be in contact with concrete thoroughly cleaned before being reused.\n\nRemoval of Forms\n\nForms shall not be disturbed until the concrete has hardened adequately, nor shall the permanent shores be removed until the structure has attained its full design strength and all excess construction loads have been removed. Wall and column forms shall be left in place until the concrete has hardened sufficiently to sustain its own weight and construction loads likely to come upon it. Forms other than wall or column forms shall be left in place until the concrete has hardened sufficiently to carry the full load which it must sustain, unless removed in sections and each section immediately reshored.\n\nFloors\n\nAll floors on earth shall be prepared by a thorough compacting of the earth at the level required. Where the excavation has been carried deeper than intended or where pockets of poor soil have been encountered and cleaned out, clean earth, broken brick or stone shall be used for fill and shall be thoroughly tamped so that no later settlement will occur. Unless such extra excavation has been ordered by the architect in writing, there shall be no charge for any fill required.\n\nOn the prepared subgrade shall be placed 4 inches of screened cinders which shall be well tamped and kept moist. Any waterpipes, electric conduits or other metal piping which pass through the cinder fill shall be encased in about 3 inches of concrete so that the cinder fill does not come in contact with the metal.\n\nOn the cinders shall be placed concrete to the thickness shown on the plans, screeded level to receive the finish as specified later.\n\nUpper floors and roof shall be built to the thickness shown on plans and the concrete shall be screeded level to receive the finish as specified later.\n\nWhere floor drains are indicated on the plans, the concrete floor shall be carefully graded to the drains so that there is a true even slope of the amount and in the direction shown on the plans.\n\nFloor Finish\n\nFloors shown on plans as a cement finish shall have the concrete base prepared by being swept, flushed with water and thoroughly scrubbed with stiff brushes. All dirt, mortar and plaster droppings shall be cleaned off the floor. Free water shall be removed but the floors must be kept damp. The floor shall then be painted with a neat cement grout well brushed in. Grouting shall not be done more than 10 minutes before the finish is laid. Any portion grouted longer than this, before the finish is laid, shall be scrubbed off and regouted immediately in advance of the finish course.\nFloor Finish (continued)\n\nThe finish course shall be not less than one (1) inch thick of concrete of the mixture specified for floor finish. It shall be of the driest consistency possible to work with a sawing motion of the straight edge. This consistency may be varied by the addition or deduction of the coarse aggregate but not less than 1\u00bd parts of coarse aggregate shall be used. The addition of fine aggregates or water to give increased workability will not be permitted.\n\nAfter placing the concrete, it shall be screeded to the correct grade and compacted with a wooden float, as soon as possible after screeding. Floating shall not be continued longer than is necessary to bring the minimum amount of mortar to the surface for finishing. After the concrete has set sufficiently, it shall be trowelled to a smooth hard, dense and level surface. If necessary, the surface shall receive a second trowelling. Over-trowelling shall be avoided and no drier shall be used.\n\nFinished concrete surfaces\n\nExposed concrete in walls or ceilings shall be treated as follows; After the forms are removed, cut away all projections and fins and point up all depressions, air holes and other roughnesses with a mortar composed of one part of Portland Cement to two parts of sand, while the concrete is still fresh. Thoroughly wet the surface before pointing. All corners shall be sharp and true. The surface shall then be rubbed with a carborundum brick until the surface has a smooth even texture. No cement or other wash shall be used. (Note: It is not the intention to remove the form marks, but to make them smooth and true).\nTORONTO, Ont., Mar. 25th, 1937.\n\nMr. R.G.

Gibson,\nDirector,\nLands, Parks & Forests Branch.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 9th of July, with reference to the telegram which the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has recently received from Rt. Rev. Joseph Guy, C.M.I., Bishop of Grouard.\n\nThe boys' building at the Grouard Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire last winter. The Department was unable to provide any funds for its re-erection but the Honourable the Minister agreed to allow extra pupilage at this school if His Lordship Bishop Guy arranged for the construction of a new building. Under these circumstances, I believe that it would be in order to allow Bishop Guy to use the buildings about which he has wired.\n\nActing Director.\nSINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY\nINCORPORATED\nCENTRAL AGENCY\n424 PORTAGE AVENUE\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA.\n\nAugust 4, 1937\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe refer you to our letter of June 2\nand your letter of May 5, File 131-1-5, and wish\nto advise that our shop at Grande Prairie has not\nas yet received settlement for the machines sup-\nplied to the Grouard Indian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alberta.\n\nWe will be very pleased if you will\narrange for early settlement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY,\nF.J.

General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill,\n\nI wonder if the other day when applying for beds destined to our new residence for boys at Grouard, I have specified the kind of beds we would like to get. I enclose a catalog sheet showing same. We have a nice building; the furniture should suit with.\n\nYou will hear soon through Mgr Guy about the Laundry Equipment needed at Grouard. He has kindly accented to help me in this matter. The worst will be to pay for. I understand that an appropriation has been made last year for a part at least of that equipment. Could not the Department carry the balance?... The fire of last winter has brought us so heavy expenses that I foresee to be tied up if I have to put a few thousands dollars on that Laundry Equipment. I imagine that it would be a pleasure and a satisfaction for the Department to complete the splendid work done here. I leave the suggestion to your appreciation.\n\nI had hoped to be in a position to send you a photo of the new building. Unfortunately, it has been cloudy since I am back.

In 1935 we purchased mattresses from Simmons Limited and, at that time, they gave the following specifications:- \"Filling to be white layer linter - cotton felt - furnished with stitched rolled edge - diamond tufting, having 17 cotton tufts - 4\u00bd\" bags - weight to be not less than 30 pounds\".\n\nThe sheeting is required both for sheets and pillow cases. We have formerly supplied cotton sheeting for this purpose. The last large supply of this sheeting that we purchased was secured from the Dominion Textile Co. Ltd., Montreal, and was known as their:- \"No. 5/4S 22 cotton sheeting (72\" wide, strong, unbleached - good quality)\". I am not certain how many yards there are in a roll and therefore it might be necessary for you to accept delivery of slightly more than 350 yards. You will note that this sheeting is 72\" wide and the sheets and pillow cases can be made up at the school.\n\nWhen outfitting the Shingwauk Home in 1935, we purchased 160 pillows from Simmons Limited, Montreal. The specifications in connection with these pillows, as quoted by Simmons Limited, were:- \"19\" by 26\", mixed chicken feathers - weight per pair to be not less than six pounds and covered with feather proof art ticking.\"\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Balley\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of December 8, 1937, and my reply of December 13, 1937, in connection with surplus stores at the Savard Park Immigration Hospital, Quebec City.\n\nThe only place where we could at present use any of the stores now available in Quebec City would be at the Grouard Indian Residential School. After extensive enquiries, it was found that an expense of approximately $600.00 would be involved in transporting the goods from Quebec to Grouard. I do not feel that this would be a good investment and therefore we will be unable to use any of the surplus stores mentioned on the list forwarded with your memorandum of December 8th.\n\nDirector.\n| Quantity | Description                                      | Price | Gross Amt. | 2% Goods | Net Goods |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 365      | OR ONE YEAR SUPPLY PAPER DIALS AS PER SAMPLE FOR DAVIS WATCHMAN CLOCK (1) | 3.50  |            |           | 3.50      |\n|          | POSTAGE                                          | 0.08  |            |           | 0.08      |\n|          | TOTAL                                            |       |            |           | 3.58      |\n\nNET 30 DAYS MAIL DEC 30/1937\nMAIL TO REV.

F. S. LaJoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 8, 1936.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMr. Harold D. McGill, M.D.\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nAs you are aware a brand new Laundry Equipment was destroyed on January 13, 1937 in the fire which razed the Boys' Residence at Grouard. Since the Sisters and children wash clothes in small washing machines. I may say that previous to the installation of the above mentioned equipment which was used only twice they had, after the destruction of the former laundry, three years previous, been obliged to travel thirty miles twice a month in every kind of road and specially by boat in order to wash clothes at Joussard School.\n\nIt is impossible to allow such a situation to recur and therefore I have been directed by present Diocese and School authorities to make a formal request for an equipment similar to the previous one. The cost of the latter was $5,100.00 and was perfectly modern and satisfactory in every respect. It consisted of the following Canadian Laundry Machinery Machines (supplied through Stanly Brock of Winnipeg):\n\n1 - 36\" x 54\" Canadian Globe Woodwasher 110 V.D.C. with individual motor.\n\n1 - 26\" Extractor Inner Basket and angle countershaft attached and individual motor.\n\n1 - Canadian Drytex Tumbler with 36\" x 48\" Inner Cylinder\n\n1 - 10 H.P. Vulcan Horizontal Steam boiler and usual fittings.\n\nAjax Cement granitine Laundry Tubs (3 compartments)\n\nA No.1 Canadian Handy Flatwork Ironer 66\" long roll, steam heated had been provided for in the present year Estimates at a cost of $1,050.00.\nMay I suggest that the equipment be installed in the Boys' New Residence? If the Department is unable to supply the sum presently a combination could be made with the above $1050.00 and balance on $3,000.00 voted for Laundry Equipment at Wabaska Indian School. I understand the latter institution will not use total sum. I believe that if the Department could guarantee payment of part of the equipment the Diocese authorities could borrow enough to advance balance until next Estimates are prepared.\n\nWith best personal regards, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBishop of Gravelbourg.\nOttawa, January 29, 1938\n\nMy dear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of January 8th, in which you refer to the reconstruction of the boys' residence at the Grouard Residential School.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I appreciate very fully the prompt action on your part which resulted in the re-opening of the residence on December 1, 1937. It is very gratifying to note, also, that a modern three-storey building of fireproof construction has been erected.\n\nI have given careful consideration to your request for an additional pupilage grant of $500.00, which grant is, in your judgment, necessary to meet the interest and capital instalment payments on the sum of $40,000.00 for a period of twenty years.\n\nMay I refer to my letter to you of April 21, 1937, in which the statement is made \"that an additional sum be included in the Estimates yearly to provide for an increase in the per capita pupilage grant, namely $2,500.00, until such additional payments reimburse you for your capital outlay and interest thereon\". Owing to the increasing costs for relief, hospitalization and other purposes which are making heavy demands upon the funds voted for the Branch, I regret that it will not be possible to increase the amount of the grant now provided for in the Estimates for next year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.A.C.\n\nThe Right Reverend J.

The Prices were f.o.b. Grouard, Alberta, sales tax included.\nMarch 10, 1938.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nThat the Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake, Wabasca Roman Catholic and Vermilion Indian Residential Schools are located in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency in the Province of Alberta;\n\nThat these schools are in an isolated locality and it has been found that the most economical method of arranging for the purchase of several articles of equipment and in carrying out repairs is to place the work in charge of the Oblate Order under whose auspices these schools are conducted;\n\nThat the total expenditure, during the fiscal year 1937-38, for purchasing of equipment and carrying out repairs at the above-mentioned five schools, all of which are Church owned, was $16,765.94;\n\nThat funds to cover the cost of the above-mentioned equipment and labour are available in Vote 169, 1937-38, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $16,765.94 in payment of the cost of supplying equipment and making repairs at the above-mentioned schools.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines & Resources.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI enclose memorandum to Council requesting authority to pay accounts amounting to $16,765.94 in connection with the five Indian Residential Schools in the Diocese of Grouard. The above amount is made up as follows:\n\n1. Labour and repairs and improvements to the buildings and purchase of some equipment $12,181.86\n\nProvision for the above amount was specially included in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38 and following the practice of former years His Lordship Right Reverend Jos. Guy, O.M.I., has submitted accounts to the Department covering the above and I am satisfied that we have received good value for the amount expended. A similar Order-in-Council was passed last year (reference my memorandum of March 23, 1937 and P.C. 685 of March 31, 1937).\n\n2. Purchase of beds, mattresses, pillows, cotton sheeting and blankets for the new addition to the Grouard Indian Residential School $1,484.05\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my memorandum to Mr. Bailey of January 10, 1938. The articles mentioned above were purchased through Mr. Bailey's office and their cost is being included in the Order-in-Council.\n\n3. Laundry equipment for Grouard Indian Residential School $3,100.00\nThis equipment has not yet been purchased but I enclose requisition to the Purchasing Agent. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of July 7, 1936. At that time approval was granted for the same articles as are shown on the purchase requisition. The equipment was received in good order at the school but was destroyed by the fire at the time the portion of the school was burned on January 13, 1937. The laundry machinery previously supplied was purchased on your instruction from Stanley Brock Limited, Winnipeg, and as it was very satisfactory while in use I would recommend that similar equipment be purchased at the present time. I may say that laundry equipment is absolutely necessary at this school.\n\nThe total of the above-mentioned three items is $16,765.94 and this amount has been included in the memorandum to Council.\n\nI would appreciate if the Honourable the Minister would give the necessary instructions to the Purchasing Agent to purchase the laundry equipment.\n\nFunds for the total expenditure mentioned above are available in our appropriation for the fiscal year ending March 31 and in the event of the Honourable the Minister approving the purchase of the laundry machinery the Purchasing Agent should be requested to make immediate purchase.\n\nDirector.\nPARKHILL BEDDING LIMITED\nBetter Bedding and Upholstered Furniture Manufacturers\n\nNotre Dame and Erin Sts.

I am enclosing five certified copies of reception of each item.\n\nThe boys have come to tell me that they had expressed themselves their satisfaction to you and to the Department. These boys will surely remember you, Mr. McGill. After having slept on the floor for nearly a year, they can't believe that they have so good and nice beds. It is understood that I share their pleasure and that I join with them to thank you.\n\nI hear through his Excellency Mgr J.

There is no doubt that it will be very satisfactory for all parties concerned.\n\nOnce more, Dear Mr. McGill, accept my thanks for your kindness and believe me yours very truly,\n\nF. S.
