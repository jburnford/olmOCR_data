T., FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 1884.**\n\n**COMMUNICATIONS.**\n\n**FIRE PROTECTION.**\n\n_To the Editor of The Times._\n\nSir,\u2014I was pleased to read in The Times of the 21st that we were in a fair way to be incorporated. I have no doubt that the first important business that will engage the attention of the council will be that of fire protection. I trust the lease taken by Mr. Smith for the fire hall will not be neglected. Although the fire company were early in attendance with what apparatus they had, and worked hard and efficiently, there was nothing to show by citizens, etc., all they could do was to save the store house. The mill had to go, and I am afraid, also, the lumber yard. If a spark, a clean engine thrown two streams had been on hand, all before the men came, and thus saved the cost of his fine engine. Another matter, gunpowder is kept in large quantities, and if the fire should break out, so kept that it can be easily got at and removed in case of fire, as great loss of life may result in case of fire.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJOHN F.

We have no cause to open our dispute. That the discovery of this fact should have been made just as signs of share, if slow, decayin the older inhabited portions of the North appear to us to be fraught with that reaction in the condition of society caused by the rapidly increasing practical application to the wants of man of old world scientific discoveries, not without a large significance in casting the horoscope of our prosperity in this vast country. What, however, more immediately and intimately concerns us just now is the question as to how we are to secure to ourselves the greatest possible benefits which ought justly to reward our enterprise, our labors and services privations as the pioneers of civilization? The answer to this most vital question seems far to seek. Indicating the depression, necessary consequent upon hopes and schemes allowed to run riot, owing to the fact that the immigration of our kind has been on such a scale that in a short while consumers of produce have already so far outstripped supply beyond the means that an unmitigated surplus is absolutely necessary for our salvation. It seems almost superfluous to add that nothing but the steady demand for timber in the provinces may see a legitimate one to them, but they must distinctly understand that we do not intend to form the subject of our own experiment. The refusal to deem our lives to be worth our own expenditure seems selfish, but we can't help it. The solution of the Hudson Straits question seems to us to mean life or death for the settlers. While quite aware that mere personal denunciation can carry no great weight either way, we must say that a careful examination of the facts so far adduced strongly tends to strengthen our conviction of the practicality of the route, the more so, as we notice that a contrary view is supported by a great extent of men who until recently succeeded in convincing Europe that this country was useless unless for fur trading. That idea is already a tradition, and we believe that the importance of the profits only realized by the Hudson Bay Company will soon be relegated to the same category. Space only permits us to glance at this large question, and as probably all that can so far be said about it is not yet altogether discussed, we pass on with solemn regard to this matter being scrutinized. That their conduct with respect to other matters is subjected to the same feeling they must be aware, and we trust that by refusing to pander to the selfish interests of the opponents of this scheme, they may succeed in creating much existing bitterness. The conduct of the C.P.R. authorities seems to bear out our expectations that so far from opposing the movement, they are doing all in their power to facilitate the prosperity of the Territories as a whole and their own must be mutually involved. We believe that anything they may lose by the emergence of the new line in the eastern portion of their line, where they have to contend with powerful opposition, will before long be more than compensated for by the increased traffic on the new line, which must be of most important link in the communication between the Pacific Ocean and Europe. That must jealously should exist in and around the Hudson Bay Provinces is a fear, is incredible, but we believe the proportion of that antagonism, and the benefits certain to accrue to us from the completion of the railway will be more than the risk. We would humbly advise its opponents to give in gracefully, to resign themselves to the inevitable. They can only hope at most to retard for a time what is a foregone conclusion, and moreover, create much bitterness in those whose prosperity, we might say very existence, depends upon the speedy opening of the route to the West. Meanwhile we earnestly hope that the people of Manitoba and the North West Territories will sink all other differences for the present and to a large extent, in the support of their leaders in carrying through, as compared with which all else sinks into insignificance.\n\nWith regard to Mr. D. Cameron's story as told in his letter, we consider it an imperative public duty to point out the significance of his statement. He has stated that the entry of his land has been productive except from Crown Timber Agent for whom he claims on logs cut under circumstances described in his letter. Putting aside the question of a timber agent's right to enter a settler's land on us under our peculiar circumstances, it is to be tolerated that a proper share of the timber industry is to call us to account. The timber cut several years ago, at a time when there was no timber agent in the District, if even in the Territories? In those days a settler would have just as soon been asked to lend a person's cattle at the rate of a penny. We believe this action to be ultra vires, even had they had the decency to hear Cameron's side of the case. If the matter cannot, unless Cameron can produce a receipt for an unsubstantiated claim of a totally uncertain amount, he may have been jumped and lost the use of ten years' labor and prison. The thin thread is the fact of it all ugly look of tyranny. It would look as if the Timber Agent, ashamed of his actions, had recourse to something not unlike a conspiracy to bulldoze. Perhaps, though, he can explain. We trust he will do so and that people here realize whether their position is to be under police officers, Crown timber or other agents, analogous to that of Russian serfs.\n\nTHE HORSE SHOE STORE\n\nThere is a motto that's plain if you follow\nYou will find in the end it will pay.\nSuccess will come if you make efforts anew,\nA result that answered in event that is gained\nWhen buying your property go where they say.\n\nAt the store they call the \"Horse Shoe.\"\nIt is not only cents but dollars you will save.\nWill leave you a hundred more to the good\nRemember the motto and also the place,\nAnd you'll be glad you've bought there.\n\nWe are determined to sell out at occasional Hard Lines.\nBetter tuck next time.\n\nThe Boom is of\n\nWhat cannot be avoided\nTwice children's weaknesses to lament.\nHow often in affairs of men we do\nFail limitation end in worst failure?\nIf trouble must be made, decide at once,\nAnd with proceeds of the sale buy cheaper.\n\nG.

B. ROUTE AGAIN.\n\nJ. Lemire, of Long Lake, sailed from St. John's in the \"H. B. Co. ship Prince of Wales,\" for York Factory. Had mild weather and a pleasant trip all the way out. Saw the steamer \"Nipigon\" account-\ning Cape Resolution, at the entrance to Hudson's straits, about the last of June. Could not get through the narrows at that time. There was consid-\nerable fog, but the ship did not lie up,\nwas so low in the straits that the boat-\nmen could see over her deck, and the\nweather and navigation good. Only\ndifficulty, the current was strong and not\nproperly known; it had to be kept well astern\nto keep the vessel going. When\nthere was a tide with a copper wave so that it\nwould give the true direction. When\nnear the entrance, there was a sudden\nattention of Equinaxus, but no cause\nfor alarm. After passing through the\nstraits about August 1st, went south-\neastward between Manfield\nisland and the main land. There en-\ncountered fine flow, and smooth water.\nThe turn of the tide released the vessel, and no\nmore ice was seen. The weather was\nunusually calm and fine. No Indians\nwere seen in the straits or bay, and there\nare no violent storms.\n\nLaunched at York Factory on August 15th. About seven miles out\nfrom York, and in low tide the vessels\nhave only room to swing, with bare sand\nbanks on either side.\n\nMr. Lemire remained at York factory\nduring the years '62, '63 and part of '64,\nthe ships being laid up during those\nthree weeks, leaving for England about\nthe middle of September. Ice took\nYork river early last October, '64, and\nkept gradually freezing further down\nthe river until winter. Although open water could not\nbe seen in the head of the river, the snow\nand ice was very heavy. The\nweather was generally dead calm and\nvery cold, the thermometer frequently\nreading below zero, and sometimes six\nfeet deep. All winters similar in char-\nacter. Spring thaw commenced at\nthe latter part of April or first of May.\nYork river opens about May 30th, and\nthe hay clear of snow about June 10th.\nVehicles can travel before York river\nbreaks a passage through the ice to\nthe open water. The fish are white\ngenerally, but are very thick along the shores.\nThe summer season is generally very\nlate. June 1st thermometer regis-\ntered 100\u00b0 in the shade. Turnips and radishes grow well at\nthe fort and potatoes have been tried, but\nonly grown in small quantities. There\nwas frost in June and July.\n\nAfter leaving York Mr. Lemire resided\nin the Rainy Lake district for several\nyears. In 1870, the steamer last, of\n\"H. B.\" took passage in a new vessel called\nthe Prince Rupert. Mr. Lemire, Eng. Saws a\ngreat deal of the country, and has visited\nreaching Manfield island. Passed\nthe island in the night, five days out from\nYork. Saw no ice along the shores or\nin the straits. Had no fog, as there\nare none in the fall. Passed cape Resolu-\ntion north, about July 15th. York. Kept\nnorth about three weeks. York river\ngales across the ocean, and no ice.\nLeft the best India dock, London,\ntwenty-five afters noon.\n\nLeft Stromness again for the North\nWest on June 18th, 1870, in the Prince\nRupert.
