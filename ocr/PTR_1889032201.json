If there was the slightest evidence to show that he is, or ever has, been inimical to our interests, we should understand and sympathize with such persons. But there is no evidence of the sort. The parties who talk in the manner referred to are Grays, and they are simply talking for political effect. They wish to elect someone who will not be afraid to speak his mind. Is there a Reformer in this district who would be as good a representative as our present member? If so, when did he arrive? Two years ago they found it necessary to send to the Atlantic coast for a man more fitted for the district. Why do they do this now? Surely they know full well that they need a member of their own party in the district of sufficient ability or intelligence to send to Ottawa as a representative, and they know well that they are far better off in having him today. The only thing that one who would go and \"speak his mind\" it would be an infinitesimally small task and would be about as much felt and heard as much effect as a fly on the head of an elephant. It is utterly useless to say that our present member cannot obtain immediate railway connection to Prince Albert he should resign, and those who waste breath in such silly twaddle should be silenced at once. Should Mr. Macdonald turn round and oppose the Government it would scare them into giving us a railway? No! the Government are very strong in the House at present and do not require to pay any attention to what is said. We are obliged to let Saskatchewan go, is also a fact that the Eastern Provinces are opposed to the expenditure of money in developing the North West, and as the present, or any other Government, would have to depend on those Provinces for its existence, however, it will be guided by the feelings and wishes of Eastern politicians. The fault does not lie with our members. We have every evidence that a rational being can imagine that he is doing his utmost to secure the best interests of this district. He is, it is said by a local working member, one of the hardest working members at Ottawa. We believe such is the case. Why, then, condemn him? If he is true to his constituents, even if sometimes in his endeavours he could get accomplished desired ends. If the fault lies with the authorities, as we believe it does in this instance, then condemn them, but in the name of common sense, forget the children and children, and let them continue to make themselves ridiculous and a laughing stock to outsiders by suggesting such a cure for existing evils as asking our member to resign.\n\nWe cannot but deplore the action of the Town Council in passing the resolution they did at their last meeting. It was one virtually in favor of secession or separation from the United States. The only excuse for our city fathers is that they are inexperienced and were led astray by individuals who have personal ends to serve. We protest against and repudiate the expression of views and sentiments or feelings of the people of this town. We consider that the Council went entirely out of their sphere in taking upon themselves to pass such a resolution as the one mentioned and hope that the Government will pay attention to it if brought to their notice. Experiences teach.\n\nThe Town Council of last year was certainly deserving of credit for the manner in which they succeeded in spoiling some of our principal thoroughfares and damming up water courses. After their so-called improvements, things are worse than they were before, and the town will moreover be called upon and have to pay several bills for damages as a consequence of the way in which they squandered our money.\n\nThe Neekins Social, held in Grace Hall last Friday evening under the auspices of the Ladies Aid Association, was a great success. The church was crowded at an early hour and refreshments were served during the programme adjournment. After refreshments were served a short address was given by the chairman of the short program, followed by songs, recitations, etc., was rendered. Among the songs sung were \"When the Clouds Roll By,\" a song by Mr. McCallum was well received and Mr. Davis furnished the audience with two selections from Shakespeare. Mr. Betta made a short and humorous speech which was highly appreciated. We believe the social was quite successful financially.\n\nR. C.

He says he has postponed the trip until next spring and will try to arrange a race with North, the Australian champion, by cable.\n\nThe library committee of the House of Commons has recommended that hereafter added and partially worn or books instead of being put up at public sale be given to Regina for distribution among the Mounted Police posts as a library for the men.\n\nThe Government will be glad if they are aware that the first lot of goods from Europe imported into the Territories and that the Inland Revenue Department require local brewers make up four percentum tax on beer. It is the intention of the Government to do away with the imposition.\n\nImportant subjects will receive much attention during the present session of the Imperial Parliament. The cotton cultivation vote of $10,000,000 for the Dominion of Canada was, and will no doubt pass. Many of the Liberal members are objecting to the smallness of the vote.\n\nSome time ago the erection of a brewery plant was made at Medicine Hat and the owner fined $300 for the contravention of the law which prohibits the making of beer except in licensed premises. The owner was allowed to continue making beer in the Territorial. Davis wanted Mr. Costigan and his followers to be sent to prison at least. It is likely the fine will have to be refunded, but this matter the Government will have to decide.\n\nThere is no question of the successful seizure of the French and Russian ships in Southwood in western Ontario. There have been cases and 6 deaths so far. The Lethbridge Star says there have been 25 victims; three deaths occurred in it. The roads leading from Southwood are guarded by armed men to prevent the plague from spreading. This is as it was at first. All public gatherings and private parties are prohibited in the neighborhood.\n\nIn his reports Sir Chas. Tupper, Canadian High Commissioner, says the chief of the native police is now convinced of a high order. A larger number of capitalists and tenant farmers than usual came to Canada last year. He endorses the statement made by Mr. Macdonald agent at Liverpool, who states: \"About 3,000 head of ranch cattle from Alberta were received at this port, and I have heard reports of many more having been landed.\"\n\nThe following is a translation of a note from Canada in published: \"The German frigate Olga has bombarded Ma- tlock camp. The captain of an American steamer says that the camp was not protected, he opened fire on the steamer. A shell burst between decks doing damage to the steamer. The steamer was torpedoed by the American ship, blowing her up with all hands.\" At the State Navy Department, no information has been received concerning the affair. Blowing up of the American war ship Nippon by the German corvette Olga.\n\nA party of soldiers were killed when they were attacked by a band of Indians. They were killed while they were on duty at the pioneer magazine two ships were fired at him and that he fired shots at his assailants. He was wounded in the hand and was removed to the hospital where his finger, which had been struck by a bullet, was amputated. A military in- vestigation was held, but evidence so far taken has convinced the authorities of the truth of the report. The soldiers were killed in regard to the affair are a plot to blow up the magazine with dynamite, which would destroy the town.\n\nThe police force was then away a few days before, and it is now believed this was done to enable the first to reach the magazine and murder the sentinels.\n\nVICTORIA\n\nLivery and Boarding Stables\n\nBetween Johnson's and Campbell's Streets\n\nHaving enlarged our premises to double their original size, we would respectfully call the attention of the travelling public to our stables, situated on the main road and river water almost at the door.\n\nOur well-known fleet of prairie roadsters, and the numerous horses and mules in our stables can be had west of Winnipeg, at reasonable prices.\n\nHorses taken at reasonable prices.\n\nNEILSON & M'BEATH\n\nFOR THE\n\nBest Assorted Stock\n\nOF\n\nCONFECTICNERY\n\nGO TO\n\nH.

Betts, M.A., was formed and held on the table for consideration.\n\nThe council went into committee to consider the question of whether or not it would be thought necessary to send to the Dominion Parliament, urging speedy railway connection with this district. Mr. Betts, accompanied by the following resolutions:\n\nThere is something of a disturbing dissatisfaction becoming prevalent throughout the entire country.\n\nThere is reason to believe that this council deems it the imperative duty of this body to take action in regard to this matter.\n\nIt is our belief that this council desires to express its appreciation of the impartial report by Sir Percy to the Commons.\n\nIt is our belief that this council desires to express its satisfaction with the state of the district owing to the want of rail way communication, and that this council considers itself bound to urge this through the clerk, Carleton.\n\nThe council then adjourned to meet again on Monday evening, April 1st.\n\nTHE FINLAYSONS.\n\nTo the Editor of the Times,\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Since my letter of this date, I have received further particulars regarding the fate of the unfortunate brothers Finlayson, which I have sent to Mr. Chief Factor Clarke, together with all books, papers and letters pertaining to them. Parties interested will find the information I possess, or am likely to obtain, by applying to our Prime Albert, etc., etc.\n\nH. BELONGER, C.F.\n\nThe following extracts refer to the fate of the Finlayson brothers, taken from letters dated the 25th of January and the 2nd of February 1889, written by Mr. Gibbon, who was employed at Hudson's Bay Company's post at south end of the same lake, to H. Belanger, Esq., Chief Factor, Prince Albert, Hudson's Bay Company, Cumberland House.\n\n\"I wrote you on 13th December last that the Finlayson brothers had left their place on the 14th of November. They were supposed by Lieut. Hobart. I receive very much very late, you may see that the Finlayson brothers' dogs were found on the 21st day about 8 miles from their shanty, they having perished from hunger. It appears from the numerous letters, newspapers, letters, pockets\u2014which with other papers and account books I know forward\u2014that death took place at the same time.\n\nIt would appear the men had gone ashore, on an island, about ten to boil their kettle, but the weather being so bad, there was no doubt had had too to do, but everything had been put back on the sled, except an axe which was sticking to the snow. The men had a blanket and a can with salt, which one of them was still holding. From the position in which the dogs were found, it appeared the tea and salt was going to put them on the sled, but no doubt being without them, he fell to work on the fire, and was unable to reach the axe. In his brother's position, evidently went to his assistance, when he fell on his brother's feet, where they lay, being little or no fire, they continued on the snow; the shoe of one was a little singed and the other's face a little blackened by smoke.\n\nThey started with two dogs and sled and when found one of the dogs was alive and the other dead. The sled was found on the sled except two axes, three traps, one kettle, one frying pan, a rifle, shotgun, their clothing, and a quantity of fish.\n\nIt was too far to remove the bodies to the fort in the condition in which they were found, and there was no possibility of having them thawed and straightened and as the fatal spot was so rocky as to prevent the possibility of removing them, the bodies remained on the spot for 40 or 45 miles from the fort, here their charity is about 30 miles from this post.\"\n\nThis is spring, sweet, balmy spring\u2014\nSome stock that T.O. bought last fall\nHe says it really is no use,\nThis winter stock must go,\nSo let us sell it all at once\nAnd give the folks a show.\n\nRemember, the chance of one winter stock must be sold out to make room,\nAny other winter stock known than it is better to sell at cost and have the new replaced by spring, we say, spring.\n\nYou get goods at deal cost.\nWe get the sale of the money.\n\nThis is business, not hunting.\nGive me a call and convince yourself that we advertise facts.\n\nOur price may sell you goods at cost, but we can sell you goods cheaper, because we buy for cash in the cost and buy in larger quantities, consequently sell cheaper.\n\nTHOS.
