Besides, wherein lies the difference between the declarations on the part of the News, since party government is the order of the day, and the motto of the true party man is \"with the party, by the party, for the party?\" Sure, by God, if awarded, justified in seeking the comments we do insist upon, in the first declaration\u2014if there was a seasonable pause to the correctness of our interpretation of its meaning, in real instance\u2014there can be no mistake now, since it places the Northwest before parties, which means political parties, and of course with the News as nothing but the Dominion Government, no matter how able, no matter whether Reformors or Conservative, Free Traders or Protectionists, no matter what our opinions may be regarding the Dominion, we should be sure to think it would be not only so but also of some honour and dignity, but so earnest, as to think seriously of sending to Ottawa our most representative men who, while thus, according to its own views, would doubtless destroy some \"old\" political party or one of either of the great political parties, to swallow their prejudices, make political sentiments of themselves, and then proclaim their advantages to be given to the Northwest, for in our opinion, it is no such things as advantage Northwest before centre parties, but as having to prove, just as having to prove, that the Northwest is something more than merely a political movement. If it were not so, more might be said.\n\nWe believe that in the North-West, for in our opinion, it is no such thing as advantage Northwest before centre parties, but as having to prove, just as having to prove, that the Northwest is something more than merely a political movement. It is a question of national pride, and it is necessary that the Northwest be made to feel that it is an important part of Canada.

The examination was strictly taken advantage of by the trustees and residents to organize a picnic for the termination of the school year. Mr. Andrew Spence, chairman of the school trustees, presided with much tact and enthusiasm over the proceedings.\n\nThe examination was held in the school house which, though of no mean dimensions, was wholly inadequate to accommodate the large number of pupils who assembled to do honor to the occasion. Under some little disadvantage from overcrowding, Mr. Spence put the different classes through their oral exercises in excellent style. It is not our intention to longevity but rather to mark the varied and individual industry and individual prominence amongst the pupils. Suffice it to say all the visitors present were convinced of the high degree of efficiency of the school and its work. In all the classes even a casual observer could see the most complete evidence of the thoroughness of the teacher's plan and of thoroughness in his system, while the pupils and their teachers are equally marked by the absence of nervousness, bright and intelligent alive to their work. The reading was characterized by careful attention to the rules of capitalization, while the custom of allowing the pupils to examine each other on the exercises of the day was an excellent method of interest and aid and is a valuable educational factor in the school. The senior classes showed very fair progress in composition and recitation and evinced a considerable knowledge of the elements of grammar, which was all the more commendable when we consider the pupils when we consider the instruction in this branch has hitherto been given nearly entirely, so far as we know, in the home. Writing was judged by a committee of experts chosen from among the visitors. All the work was pronounced very good and the committee's recommendations would have done honor to any school. A special feature in the day's proceedings was the singing by the pupils in all the classes took part. The pieces selected were in good taste and were very effective in indicating the interest taken by Mr. Craig in every department of his work, who may be justly proud of mentioning that a little piece of music had been spoken by two young ladies who had never been within ten thousand miles of the old country, yet sang with such grace and so very correctly that we, as lovers of the grand old Doric of the northern tongues, could hardly believe that they carried away from that bold encampment overlooking the South Saskatchewan to be the only young ladies \"banks and brass\" of our own country.\n\nWe do not know whether at the end of the proceedings the chairman observed as he has done on former occasions, enough at this very point he called us from labor to refreshment? An excellent lunch was provided in a large booth or other form of shelter, and after a short dining-room. Lunch having been eaten ample time was given for the examining pupils to take the large number assembled in the school room where the pupils under the leadership of the Rev. R. N. Smith, the minister of St. Andrew's entertained the audience with a specimen of their singing powers which was greatly appreciated.\n\nThe chairman then, in bringing the examination to a close, addressed a few interesting and appropriate words to the pupils and their parents, and after warmly thanking the guests and visitors for their presence and countenance, he called upon Capt. Craig, the chairman, who, speaking on behalf of the guests, expressed the great pleasure they all had in being present, and proceeded shortly to review the day's events in full referring in terms of commendation to the results in the examination in all the departments. He had but to refer to Mr. Gerrard's many qualifications for the duties of his important office, but took this opportunity to express the extent to which he had been able to impart his ample store of knowledge to his pupils, and to assure them that he gratulated the trustees, the parents, and the pupils alike on possessing such a teacher as himself. He then reviewed the oversight of another class of bright and apt scholars. The proceedings of the day had been thoroughly interesting and especially generous, and the names of the guests he asked the trustees and the committee to accept their cordial thanks in the pleasant entertain-\n\nBLACKSMITHING\n\nFOR GENTLEMEN'S FURNISHINGS!\n\nIN ALL BRANCHES\n\nFOR\n\nWhite Cotton,\n\nFactory Cotton,\n\nFlannels,\n\nSheetings,\n\nTowelings,\n\nDress Goods,\n\nSilks,\n\nLinen, etc.\n\nGO TO\n\nJ.
