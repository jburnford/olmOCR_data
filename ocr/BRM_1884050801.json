It appears to the writer that there has been common sense, to say nothing of convenience and advantages, to recommend it. The distance between those points, on the present inexhausted road, is 25 miles, and the bringing of the two places 8 miles nearer together would give great facility to many communities of this country, lowering travel costs, and increasing the value of goods brought to market.\n\nA good deal of our population resides five or more leagues south, proportion, diagonally, affecting, in about twenty sections, and such a longer run means much increase in the value of land throughout which it might pass; we feel confident the advance rate should be got by the Brites (for whose lack out into the old highway ought to be made the sacrifice.) An old writer says\u2014\n\n\"There can be no question whatever in the improvement of roads and bridges increases the profits of commerce, and benefits the whole country.\"\n\nIt is an improvement on our unsown and lengthy highways, given value to agricultural products, and adds to the public wealth, the enormous increase of property along highway, must display its prosperity, and moreover especially such a highroad as the one proposed. For every petticoat worn it not only becomes taxable at\u8327 but so as well as those living at intermediate points have been claimed for a road already, and an absence of transportation this would be free. In more desirable, it is becoming clear that good short highways should be built without delay.\n\nTHE PORTAGE GRIT PRIZE.\n\nThis opportunity, allowing the Municipality through Mr. Watson and Mr. Rodgers and Messrs. Whittaker and others to enjoy the benefit of obtaining a valuable gift, is more than he cared, nor he should not, therefore, be hamprest. That it was not equal to the claim of the district is shown in no manner, and if the ballot is held, that Mr. Watson has done the county by the day of his election crafty work with the electors. With the right of the voters \"to feed and drink\" their representations, we assure Mr. Watson that liberty to do as they please in this election.\n\nMr. Watson, at the banquet, is reported to have said, \"He could not help enjoying the festivities and tender proffs of hon. Edward Blake. To accomplish anything in the House of Commons must succeed some way or other or the people will say his opinion, were he not dishonest, for Mr. Watson to carry on election on the no-man's cry, on the ground he was too Populist (for every county) and allied to one party no more than the other?\" Give us a fair answer, Grit prize.\n\nWas it dishonest for Mr. Watson to oppose the loan to the C.F.R. when the object had been to see that end accomplished as quickly as possible through connection, and place them in a position to give cheap wheat where we asked for very things the Farmers' Union are crying for? If not then it is dishonest, for the Farmers' Union to ask the C.F.R. to save the farmers' lives from railway they have to control over which in it Grift prize.\n\nIt is a rare privilege having for the C.F.R. a certain branch lines before the main line \"to keep money circulating in the country,\" is it not dishonorable to try and go around to revocate the return of the tariff to enable Manitobans to send their money out or to invest for American trade? What do you think of the idea, Grit prize?\n\nMr. Watson denied having signed Mr. McLennagan's petition for recommendation in paper, to aid him in manufacture at the Portage, so he believed the duties were high enough, if this be true why was he not willing to take the Provincial third print to demand the Government, for not granting the decrease, when it was rumored Mr. Watson felt himself the affront. So is the scope of the affair that dist. grid print would make plain answers to these queries; they would taste better than that \"original prime\" to \"Rob Watson.\"\n\nWONT BE COMFORTED.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun is one of those prints that will not be comforted where they met the portage weekly paper, no matter how pointed it may be. In recent issue the Mark stated or implied that Manitoba cannot afford to expend a reduction of the tariff and an increase of the subsidy at the same time, and \"our compensation\" was vindicated.\n\nIf the tariffs were abolished, how could that effect the revenue if, a laudable note, when the consumer does not pay the duty? But, waited for the hint, for Mr. Watson will that a reduction in the rate will dispel, for he will, in addition, even it included the abolition of the taxes on coal, wheat and flour, would produce an enormous yearly surplus. The very reason why the present Finance Minister exceeds the limit of fair taxation, and the Maxims of taxes, our internal shocks are none the less keen when the settler needs to be supplied to that he is not ready to bear, and consequently whenever extra acres somewhere are thrown into the game by Ontario and the North-Western States, and because it is upon the early dates as are now, as is the material and political prosperity of Manitoba, is almost altogether a new internal industry by a tariff that is jeopardizing the proper development of a resource. That is the question.\n\nIt does not require a decision of parliament to understand that most assuredly whether it is the exporter or the consumer that pays the duties, if the tariffs were abolished the world's consumption would be enabled to carry the goods at reduced rates, and if this effect as afflicting this country might be reduced so also would our per capita contribution to the Imperial Exchequer be diminished, whereas the Province is expecting an increased subsidy, almost dismissed, and our grounds for complaints removed.\n\nThe entire revenue of Manitoba, arising from lumber, agriculture, implements, and the mining and general operation on which the Grit press must hourly complain, after deducting the payments made by the federal government, and the amounts due by federal patentees is calculated to yield but six cents of benefit of the people of this country, and to carry out the terms of Confederation, enteried into by Manitoba, to secure a public debt that would be able to sustain her over the morrow, and to enable to establish Eastern Canadian community and commerce in the country to keep their industries in operation. As Manitobans has next to keeping up existing wages, which finds its justification in our local Canada derives ten dollars worth of deficit from the railways in this country for every dollar derived by Manitoba over the contract. It is a fact that, as the Telegram says, that from a revenue producing point of view, the current income of today, if none of its sons has gone to the far west, but we are aware opinion is divided as to what the future holds for us, and whether or not the sagacity of the race will ever bestow the bounty of Canada. Our Winnipeg friend, I can assure, that we do promote this end by fatal tax upon it, as of course the Canada enjoys the benefits of this province, he who fails to resist the tax will receive a local complaint, but an added boon to the eastern reaches that might be deemed of great value. For every man and woman who resides here for seven years, he, who fails, to resist the tax, may be heard to say, that it will ever be a most inconsiderate step to refuse its services to the crown. Unless more than seven years, he will state that his services are demanded for immediately useful purposes. Every honest homesteader must be prepared to offer any sacrifice required, not however exceptional, some may be asked but it will be to the best interest of this district, as thus when presented with the privilege of purchasing land, and the owner being throttle put in the bag, the owner being throttle put in the bag. Thus all other claims were permissible land offered by both parties, the liberty or by whipping as the public whipping post.\n\nProvinces have kept the promises of the last election to this country, by thus spending thousands in bringing new settlers to it for the rest of the world; that the Dominion had spent millions in building a railway to bring the north west, that Ontario and the other Provinces would be better off tomorrow, if they had spent none of their last election lands for the construction thereof, Manitoba has no ground for demand or better terms from the Dominion Government.\n\nTen million pounds a sate paid to investigate the claims of the Hudson's Bay Company, for that of Manitobas alone, yet that of the North-West territory that Manitobas received certainly not exceeding fifteen part. Perhaps, then, the Provincial cost Canada $100,000 millions for the above purpose, but the funds have not been taken out of the treasury, but added to the national debt, upon which Manitoba now pays a large share of the same, and the result of that transaction is considerably diminished. True it is also that Ontarions contributions in new provincial legislation may have been the most part paid to Ontario again, or, in other words, by Ontarians specifications being transcendent, Manitoba being obliged partly generous from it which received more tribute than benefited, the Legislative\u2014shall\u2014in the parlance\u2014have been called \"overpaid\" for the additional tax, while for another generation, there further, with worthy of a considerable expenditure.\n\nIt is equally true that many people come from Ontario\u2014other provinces to the country to improve themselves and settle out on their own lot and set the lot of the country, and the money that is saved in immigrating, of which Manitoba will be glad to contribute to help settling this country, who will bring lands from the Dominion Government.\n\nMr. Watson's recent return of a great amount of machinery, purchased from this Manitoba, purchased, that would be the most beneficial in the settlement of the Dominion.\n\nAnother the highest pressing has been on\u8f93\u51fa\u7aef\u53e3san blocks has been out lately the sale of Manitoba, made and sold entirely on behalf of the people of this country, and to carry out the terms of Confederation, enteried into by Manitoba, to secure a public debt that would be able to sustain her over the morrow, and to enable the establishment of Eastern Canadian family and commercial, a possibility of profiting at a later date, when the eastern reaches will be demanded of the crown. Unless more than seven years, he will state that services are demanded for immediately useful purposes. Every honest homesteader must be prepared to offer any sacrifice required, not however exceptional, some may be asked but it will be to the best interest of this district, as thus when presented with the privilege of purchasing land, and the owner being throttle put in the bag, the owner being throttle put in the bag. Thus all other claims were permissible land offered by both parties, the liberty or by whipping as the public whipping post.\n\nHOMESTEADING ACROSS THE LINE.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Watson on public address has appealed to that repudiate the presumptions of law and timber cutters, and array and start the timber men to undertake the venture under provisions. Every homestead applicant would be compelled to give one century prospective rent from anishes in stock, one acre set to lie in the timber land, and the cost to be the same as that of the occupation premises, whereas, two years after the presentation of such proof accepted by the administration, and substantiated by affidavit to submit among other authorities to administer the oath, charging and suggesting fraud, either in the origin, or in subsequent, the honesty of the transactions, the public authorities will find the manner in which the services, were so distributed or otherwise, that the evidence would have been acquired by the care, those sworn testimony would be sufficient, sufficient, and by thus proceeding, the honourable Mr. Watson does well in rousing the anxiety of the citizens, and will be approved by every honest citizen.\nTHE BRANDON WEEKLY MAIL.\n\nMAIL\nBook and Job\nPRINTING\nDepartment\n\nNEW GOODS for the LADIES\nJUST ARRIVED AT\nT.
