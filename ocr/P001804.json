The weather was most phenomenal for the time of year, warm, genial and balmy; the day was more like one in the early spring rather than in the dreary fall. The fine weather and the unusual character of the ceremony\u2014happily one almost unknown to Canadian history\u2014attracted thousands of spectators to the spot, who watched with much interest the pro-\nceedings, which went off with the utmost eclat.\n\nThe monument stands just inside the Park gates on a commanding site, looking towards Rideau street. It is typical of a Guardsman, in an attitude of mournful repose, standing with hands clasped upon the butt of his rifle. On a prominent bronze plate on the front face of the pedestal of the statue is displayed the following inscription:\n\nERECTED BY THE CITIZENS OF OTTAWA TO\n\nTHE MEMORY OF\n\nPRIVATE JOHN ROGERS AND WILLIAM B. OSGOOD,\n\nWHO FELL IN ACTION AT\n\nCUT KNIFE HILL, ON MAY 2ND, 1885;\n\nand on either side of the pedestal are bronze medallions purporting to be portraits of the fallen heroes.\n\nThe scene as the time for unveiling the statue drew near was a remarkable one. Spectators were massed in front, in rear, all around, and they\ngathered on every coign of vantage, not excepting Parliament Hill, from which an excellent view could be obtained, and which was enshrouded in foliage of many a varied tint, presenting a pleasing contrast to the eye. The gay uniforms and glittering bayonets of the military lent animation to the scene, and overhead additional splendour was given by the clear blue appearance of the sky, which was scarce flecked by a single cloud.\n\nThe colours of the Guards in memory of the occasion were encircled by memorial wreaths.\n\nThe military who materially assisted in keeping back the crowd of spectators were drawn up about the statue in the form of a square, the strength of the corps being: Governor-General's Foot Guards, 150 non-commissioned officers and men under Major, now Col. Tilton; the 43rd Battalion, 100 non-commissioned officers and men under Capt. Sherwood; Dragoon Guards, 35 officers and men under Capt. Gourdeau; Ottawa\nField Battery, 80 non-commissioned officers and men under Major Stewart. Lieut.-Col. Macpherson was in command of the whole brigade, Capt. Bliss acting as brigade major.\n\nMuch valuable service was rendered by a detachment of the Dominion police force, under Inspector O'Leary, and also of the City police in charge of Chief McVeity, in maintaining order amongst the large crowd of spectators.\n\nAccommodation was provided for ticket holders who were seated inside an enclosure, roped off for purpose, fronting the statue, amongst whom were noticed the following: Sir Adolphe, Lady, and Miss Caron, Hon. Mackenzie Bowell, Hon. John Carling, Hon. Edgar and Mrs. Dewdney, Hon. C. H. and Mrs. Tupper, Hon. John Haggart, Chief Justice Sir William and Lady Ritchie, Hon. Mr. Justice and Mrs. Gwynne, Hon.

Waldo, and Dr. Wicksteed.\n\nThe Governor General arrived punctually at 2.30, the appointed hour for unveiling the monument, accompanied by his suite, and was received with a general salute by the brigade. The spectators greeted him cordially. He was escorted to the platform by Col. Powell, Chairman, and members of the Monument Committee. His Lordship Bishop Lewis of Ontario, the Revs. J. Bogert and H. Pollard were present in full canonicals. The Mayor, Sir Adolphe Caron, Minister of Militia, General Sir\nFred. Middleton, Mr. Percy Wood, the sculptor, and Mr. Frank Newby, joint secretary, were present on the platform.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop then said prayers as follows:\n\n\"Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with Thy most gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help, that in all our works begun, continued and ended in Thee, we may glorify Thy holy name and finally by Thy mercy obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.\n\n\"O Almighty God, Father of lights from whom alone cometh every perfect gift unto the children of men, we thy servants here gathered together to perpetuate the memory of two of Thy servants, departed this life in Thy faith and fear, now beseech Thee with Thy favor to look down upon this memorial, which we in Thy name have raised in loving and lasting memory of Thy servants, John Rogers and William Osgood.\"\n\"Grant, O Lord, that we and all those who in days to come may behold this memorial, may be strengthened to follow their example in showing forth loyal attachment to our Queen and country; even unto death, so that no secret conspiracy nor open violence may disquiet this Dominion, but that peace and happiness, truth and justice, may be established amongst us throughout all generations. Bless, O Lord, this our city. Give grace to all that bear rule therein. Knit together all hearts in love to Thee and in godly union and concord with one another. Grant to us all that we may faithfully serve Thee in this life, and this life ended, that we with all those who have served Thee here on earth may be partakers of Thy heavenly kingdom. All this we ask in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with Thee, O Father, and Thee, O Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.\"\n\nThe Lord's Prayer and the Benediction then followed; after which the Guards' Band added to the\nimpressiveness of the occasion by playing a verse of the hymn commencing, \"All people that on earth do dwell.\"\n\nColonel Walker Powell, Adjutant General of Militia, then advanced and spoke as follows:\n\nThe monument is erected to those who went to the North-West in 1885. It will be within your recollection that in March of that year, troops were called for from all over Canada by the Dominion Government, and that one company of these troops was allocated to Ottawa. We could only have one company, because every other corps in the country wanted to be represented. The company of Sharpshooters was called out on the 30th March, at the most inclement season of the year, and the men were ready to leave on the 31st. They did leave amidst the good wishes of the inhabitants of the city, and commenced their arduous and very serious journey of 2,200 miles when there was snow on the ground and in some places slush. For about 500\nmiles there was no railway communication for them. They had to go around the north shore of Lake Superior. Need I tell you that all these men behaved as soldiers and that there was no word of complaint from any quarter. They arrived safely at Winnipeg on the 7th, and when the difficulties of that journey are considered it must be generally admitted that it was a most extraordinary one for any man to make. It could only be accomplished by men inspired by the utmost enthusiasm. That portion of the journey that gave them the most serious inconvenience was where it was difficult to convey troops because of the long distances and where they had to be transported upon flat railway cars used in the work of railroad construction. As adjutant-general of the Dominion I never had any complaint from any of these men, and the number of cases of sickness, or of incapacity of any description, occasioned by that journey has been almost nothing. I think it is a marvel. The com-\npany remained away for four months. During the period of its absence, and while stationed at Battleford, Lieut. Gray and 21 men of the Sharpshooters took part in the engagement at Cut Knife Hill. They showed their bravery and determination by going in the face of great difficulties to that engagement. I am sorry to say that during the engagement two of the men were wounded and two were killed. The company returned after completing the labors on which it went, and the city gave the men a public reception and a banquet, and when the dead Sharpshooters were brought back gave them a public funeral and procured a site in the cemetery near this place. I need not tell you that after the public funeral had been given to these men, and when all the circumstances were brought under consideration\u2014how they had experienced great inconvenience to themselves and encountered great dangers\u2014the citizens of Ottawa determined that they would not only decorate the\ngrave, but that they would erect a monument in the City of Ottawa in honor of the dead, and to hold out to the living assurances that the sympathy of the citizens was with those who endangered their lives in the public service. A meeting was called, a committee was organized, subscriptions were raised\u2014private subscriptions\u2014and it was considered that in any monument to be erected\u2014all the difficulties of the situation having been quieted\u2014it was desirable not to show the existence of any boasting, any vain glory, but that upon this monument should be erected a statue of a soldier in repose, expressing sorrow for what had passed, and the best hopes for the future. The committee placed itself in communication with correspondents all over the country, and they found it would be better to erect a monument partly of bronze and partly of granite. They then corresponded, amongst others, with Percy Wood, Esquire, of London, who on many occasions had made monuments which reflected great credit on\nhimself. The committee thought that if they could put the commission for this statue into his hands, it would indeed be in good hands. Well, Mr. Wood agreed not only to furnish the statue but he gave us working plans and models of the pedestal, and when these latter were sent out to Ottawa, Messrs. Mills & Sons undertook the contract to provide the granite pedestal according to the specifications of Mr. Wood. Therefore, Mr. Wood should have a large amount of credit for this monument that has been erected, and as many of us have not had the pleasure yet of seeing it, you yourselves will have to judge of its great qualities, and whether it meets with the expectations of the public. When the committee undertook to erect this monument a smaller sum of money was subscribed for the purpose of enclosing the ground at the cemetery, and they have placed a small tablet over the heads of the two deceased Sharpshooters, who now lie buried in the cemetery. I may say perhaps that the com-\nmittee\u2014and I speak after consultation with the whole of them\u2014feel themselves under a great obligation to the government in giving us this beautiful site for the monument. The Minister of Public Works not only aided and assisted us in getting the ground, but his men have taken great trouble to do everything we wanted\u2014while the monument was being erected. I am sure the committee and all the subscribers to the monument fund feel themselves under a great obligation to the Minister of Public Works.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor-General, Lord Stanley of Preston, then formally unveiled the monument, after which a delay of some minutes in proceeding with the programme occurred, whilst the scene was being photographed.\n\nHis Excellency then spoke to the following effect:\n\nI now have to perform the formal duty of unveiling this statue\u2014I do not know that any com-\nI have now to perform the formal duty of unveiling this statue. I do not know that any comments of mine are necessary. It is there for itself, and long may it remain amongst you as a monument to those who fell in the performance of public duty. It is not for me to speak of the events which took place in 1885. I was not myself a witness of them; I was not even in this country; and even if it were not so, these are subjects which are perhaps more fitly left to the historian of future times than to those who are more closely connected with the subject of history. You have had already explained to you by Col. Powell the circumstances which led to the erection of this statue, and I am glad to think that the Minister of Militia, Sir Adolphe Caron, and Sir Frederick Middleton, my old and esteemed friend, who was in charge of the forces at the time of which we speak, are here to speak, and will speak of the character of the expedition. It is only for me\ntherefore to touch in general terms on the circumstances under which we are met. In the Spring of 1885, as you have already been told, when it became clear that it would be necessary that troops should move to the North-West, a call was made for the requisite forces, and one is happy to be able to say that not one but every portion of the Dominion nobly responded to the call, and that in the troops which were under the command of my friend near me, were men representative of every province in the Dominion. Toronto and your own city were rivalled in honourable emulation by Quebec and Montreal, and if double the number of men had been wanted, they no doubt would have been cheerfully given without a murmur at the sacrifice (cheers). Indeed, though I must travel over ground which has already been spoken of short reference to dates and circumstances will show this. It was only on the 20th March, if I am rightly informed, that Captain now\nMajor Todd, obtained leave to form a company of Sharpshooters. It was not possible to take from this city all who would have gladly volunteered, but I am informed that when volunteers were called for, at least double the number who were required came forward\u2014and came forward willingly. And not alone from the Guards, but also from the 43rd; volunteers were forthcoming in plenty, and the result was that a force, officially designated as the Guards' Sharpshooters, but in reality composed of men of both battalions\u2014the majority being from the Guards\u2014proceeded to the front at the call of duty and at very short notice. Within three days after they were asked to volunteer they marched to the scene of operations in the field. It is not necessary for me to trace the progress of the campaign or to trace the course of the Sharpshooters between the commencement of the campaign and the date we are assembled here to commemorate. Suffice it to say, that after hardships of no com-\nmon order, they found themselves forming portions of a force in face of the enemy, and they came into action\u2014either late on the 1st May, or early on the 2nd. It was at Cutknife Hill that these two men fell, whose memory you are called on to-day to commemorate. They were both men who had something to give up by going to the campaign. They had both before them in their separate ways, in all probability, a life of utility to themselves and to the city; but when they considered that their duty stood in front of them, the same feeling which unites all classes in the Dominion, whether it be the love of adventure of the Anglo-Saxon, or the chivalry of the French constituents, led them at once to volunteer for service in the field.\n\nI believe that Rogers\u2014one of those who is commemorated, was in the civil service, and cheerfully surrendered all the comforts of home and an assured existence to undertake the duties of a campaign, and with his comrade, Osgood of the 43rd,\nlikewise in a good position in trade, and who equally surrendered all his future to take part in the risks of actual war. Well, although I am sure that there are many others who would as willingly undergo the same perils, let us think something of those who in the fulfilment of their duty have risked hardships which are happily not the lot of all, and dangers which I trust few here may meet with, and who did this cheerfully and ungrudgingly, and in that true spirit of soldiers which no doubt would be found amongst many, if not all in your ranks. Now, to show that this was not a common expedition, let us refer to the fact that it was thought by the military authorities, who were persons competent to judge, that it was well to grant the honourable distinction of a medal for what took place in the campaign. That is not done for ordinary expeditions, and it shows well the estimation which was felt of the difficulties with which my gallant friend had to contend, and which\nhe had so successfully surmounted, and of the hardships which were undergone by the troops under his command. In all times and in all places, it has been felt becoming on the part of citizens to place amongst them some permanent commemoration of those who have well done their duty, be it civil or military (cheers), and though I hope that the occasions may not frequently be of a similar character, it is not too much to look forward to the future\u2014it may be distant, but not the less sure\u2014when in this great city, her thoroughfares and her public places are ornamented by statues the commemorating for ever those who, whether in a military or civil capacity, have done their duty amongst you. (Cheers). The memorial of these men will stand up here to public view, long to be gazed upon I hope, with feelings of respect. It represents those who cheerfully came forward in the service of their country, who were loyal to their Queen, true to their colours, and \"faithful even unto death.\" (Loud cheers.)\nSir Adolphe Caron, Minister of Militia, next addressed the assemblage as follows:\n\nYour Excellency, ladies and gentlemen\u2014On my return from Sherbrooke I was somewhat shocked to find on reading the papers that I was expected to deliver a speech on the present occasion. I felt that it would be sufficient for we Canadians, and for we citizens of Ottawa, to have here present His Excellency to give to this great demonstration all the brilliancy that we could expect from it, and I fancy that in expressing as I feel it, the thanks of every citizen of Canada to His Excellency for having performed the duty which he has today, that it would be sufficient for me, and that I might be allowed to take my seat. But your Excellency, and ladies and gentlemen, on an occasion like the present I feel that possibly I would be wanting in my duty if I were not to express in a few words the deep feelings which have been brought out in the breast of\nevery Canadian today by the demonstration we are witnessing (applause). Sir, this valuable, this beautiful work of art which can only add again to the reputation, if possible of the distinguished sculptor who fashioned it, is in commemoration by the citizens of Canada, I say\u2014because in every province and every district, Canadians, speaking as I do the French language, united together as one people under one flag, have all contributed their share to the building up of this monument\u2014of the patriotic devotion of two of Canada's sons, of Osgoode and of Rogers, who, at a moment's notice, unprepared, at the call of duty, at about the most inclement season of the year in this Canada of ours, where seasons are so severe, saying farewell to their families, putting aside their business relations, their business connections, which might be the turning point in their future lives, at the call of duty travelled over 2,200 and some odd miles of territory to vindicate the law, to affirm the\nprinciples that the authority of government must be obeyed (applause), and not alone that, but to affirm that in Canada, a growing and young country as we are, that we are strong enough to have the arm of law protected, and that we are powerful enough, within our own selves, to maintain peace and order, and to have the laws of the country respected. (Applause.) Sir, I remember well, and it recalls to my memory scenes which I shall never forget, as Minister of Militia I was called upon by some of the relations of those who shouldered their muskets, without any reference to those ties, those family ties, which a man who has once got can never forget, leaving aside everything\u2014I remember the day when the mother of one of the young men, not those who are gone, but of their comrades, came to me. She said: \"He is my only son, and I ask you as Minister of Militia to prevent him from forsaking me, from going out and exposing himself to the dangers he\nmust encounter.\" I felt that that appeal, which was made to me as Minister of Militia, placed me in the affecting position of having to tell her, although I felt how acute it must have been to her, I could not interfere: that he was under the orders of his commanding officer. And when she said farewell to me she said that she would only ask me one favour, and that favour was to let her know whether at any time her son was wounded. I had the pleasure eventually to be able to communicate to her that, although he had shown the same patriotic devotion that those two men to whom you have erected this monument, she was more fortunate than either the mother of Osgoode or of Rogers; and her son came back to her having fulfilled his duty, like every member of the militia force of Canada did, to the credit of the force and the honour of the Dominion. Your Excellency, and ladies and gentlemen, I feel that to-day it is incumbent upon me to tell you that as\nMinister of Militia, with the advice of the officers of the staff under my orders, it was possible at that period of time for Canada to send out a force which has been complimented, not only among the citizens of Canada, but which has been commented upon in flattering terms by the press of foreign countries. Our friends who lie to the south of us spoke of what Canadians had done at that particular season of the year in terms which showed that our friends were ready to recognize what the Canadian soldiers had achieved in that campaign; and in England, again, it was not only commented upon by the press, but men who had known Canada, men like Lord Wolseley, who had been here and who knew the country, spoke of what the Canadian soldiers had done in such terms that we can feel proud of the military force of Canada. (Cheers.) Now, sir, to-day we see that Canada, following the example of other nations, feels that when her sons fulfill their duty,\nas Rogers and Osgoode have done, she can show gratitude and admiration for their deeds by building up in the most prominent places, in the public squares, where the public can read history from the names that we build up, monuments as an example, as a recognition of the memory of the departed, but more especially as a lesson and an example to those who are called upon to follow and to accomplish in the same way and under similar circumstances deeds which can be as useful to their country and as honourable to themselves as those which have been accomplished by those two men. Sir, Canada is a young country, but she has a history. I believe I can say today that this is the twelfth monument Canada can boast of. In the old historical city of Champlain, where Your Excellency has been residing some time, we can boast of the monument erected to the memory of Wolfe and Montcalm, and if I may be permitted on this occasion to express an\nopinion, it has struck me more than once that the population of that period, in building up a monument to the leaders of the two contending parties, were placing on record a prophecy that the two nations would become united as one people under the old banner of Great Britain; that they would work together as a united people developing the great resources of this half of the American continent, working out the destiny which Providence must have had in view for Canada. It seems to me, as I said, a prophecy, when in the light of subsequent events we see these two people, no longer fighting against each other, working together under the Union Jack in unanimity, vieing with each other in efforts to make this a happy, contented, rich and prosperous country. Sir, we have besides in Quebec a monument to the brave of 1776. At Chambly we have built up the name of De Salaberry. Montreal boasts of a monument to the memory of Nelson, whose glory and whose\nname is known all over the world. At Queenstown Heights we have a monument erected to Brock, and at Halifax we have a monument to commemorate Welsford and Parker. At Winnipeg, meeting as we do here today, but without the advantage of the presence of His Excellency, the representative of the Queen, they unveiled the Union Jack to commemorate all their Volunteers, all those Canadian soldiers who did their duty as the men whose memory we commemorate today. And, sir, we have here in Ottawa, in the capital of the Dominion, monuments not only commemorating military achievements, but also a monument to my illustrious predecessor in the Department of Militia, Sir George Cartier. (Applause.) In Toronto we have got a monument also, erected to the memory of Mr. George Brown, who, like these two men, fell a victim to violence, under different circumstances, if you will, but equally proving that, whether in civil life or in more extended ques-\ntions, the appeal to the tribunal, to the respectfully constituted authority, is a rule which must prevail amongst civilized and educated people; and when violence comes in it is unfortunately, and invariably, I say, the result of passions which are awakened, like in the present instance, by wicked and designing men, who, taking advantage of a simple-minded people, exercised their influence to get up disturbances and to bring trouble to the homes of loyal subjects. Therefore it is, I say, that if it had not been for men like those whose memory we commemorate, Canada would have been a victim, in more than one instance at least, to the rebellious attempts made by men to baffle the constitution and to prevent the laws of the country from having their regular course. In Three Rivers, also, we have a monument to Laviolette, and in Brantford to Brant. Finally there is this monument, by which we want to commemorate the patriotic devotion of two\nsons of Canada who went forth to fight her battles. Sir, let me apologize, and to you, ladies and gentlemen, for having detained you longer than I should have done. Let me express a hope, and in expressing that hope I believe I echo the sentiments of Canadians from one end of the country to the other, that their example will be followed by every Canadian. Let every Canadian remember that when her sons do their duty Canada will place them in the list of heroes who have won a right to monuments, and whose memory deserves to be gratefully cherished by those who sincerely love their country. Sir, let me hope that whenever Canada, unfortunately, has to call upon her military force to defend her flag, that the example set by the Sharpshooters who fell in the North-West will be followed. In expressing that hope let me say that I find in reading the history of Canada that one of its most glorious pages is the military record of her citizen\nsoldiers. I find that whenever called upon to do their duty they have come forward without any hesitation whatever. My only desire, which is shared by every other citizen of Canada, is that we shall not have any opportunity; whether in our midst or outside our frontier, of showing what the Canadian soldier can do. Again apologizing, Your Excellency, and ladies and gentlemen, for having spoken much longer than I had intended, I will merely add that I would not have presumed to address you had I not felt called upon as Minister of Militia to say a few words upon this occasion.\n\nLt.-General Sir Fred. Middleton, Commanding the Militia, then spoke as follows:\n\nYour Excellency, and ladies and gentlemen,\u2014After the very eloquent addresses that we have just listened to I think there is very little left for me to say, and the little I have to say I am afraid must be a repetition. The magnificent monument\nwe are here to honor and which Lord Stanley has so kindly unveiled for us will remain as a standing proof that the citizens of Ottawa know how to recognize the patriotism and the not unexpected courage of those fellow citizens from among them, who, at the call of their country did not hesitate to quit their families and all they loved best to undertake the hardships and perils of a campaign. I say that Ottawa shows by this monument that she recognizes and appreciates that devotion, inasmuch as she has erected it to the memory of two of those citizens who were unfortunately killed in action while gallantly doing the duty they had undertaken. It was of course not from Ottawa alone, as the Minister of Militia pointed out, that assistance came, as volunteers were forthcoming from all parts of the country; and I think few people in this country are able to form a better opinion than myself who commanded them, of the admirable, prompt and loyal\nmanner in which they all carried out their arduous duties amid the severe trials of that unexpected campaign. I am perfectly certain that the men of Canada will not want any other incentive to fight for their country, and that the women of Canada will not want any other incentive to send forth their husbands, brothers, and sons than love for their country. Occurrences like the present, which are taking place or have taken place in other cities are certainly not likely to weaken the inducement to Canadians to carry out their duty, when they see, that those who strove their best to do their duty to their Queen and country are not forgotten or unhonoured by their fellow citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, I would wish to congratulate my friend, Mr. Percy Wood, on the beautiful and artistic piece of workmanship he has turned out; not forgetting that our thanks are also due to the committee for their able management of the difficult business entrusted to them. (Cheers.)\nMr. Rowley proposed and Mr. Magee seconded a vote of thanks to His Excellency for unveiling the monument. The resolution was carried with acclamation, and in reply His Excellency said:\n\nThe vote of thanks you have been good enough to offer me is, I am afraid, very little deserved. I am very happy to do all that I can, and finding myself amongst you, first of all as the representative of the Sovereign in the capital of the Dominion, in the next place as your near neighbour, and as I hope before long your fellow townsman, in all these capacities anything I could do would, I assure you, be a labour of love. But there is one person who I think has been omitted, not from the minds of men, but from the ceremonial list. All the ceremony and military display could have been dispensed with, although I am glad it has not; the attendance of those upon the platform could also have been dispensed with\nthough upon that I do not invite an opinion; the presence of even the ladies and gentlemen might have been dispensed with, though we might have broken our hearts had it been so; but there is one person who could not have been omitted in connection with this, and that is the talented and able gentleman whose hand is due this entire monument, the unveiling of which we are met together to celebrate. I do not think we ought, if I may assume authority not delegated to me, to depart without expressing in some form or another our sense of the work of the sculptor, Mr. Percy Wood, who, I verily believe, has undertaken this more as a labour of heart and of love than of one of mere sordid considerations. As a sculptor he has executed the largest work in bronze on this continent, namely the Brant memorial. He is besides now engaged on a group representing Her Majesty and the Prince Consort which is to be placed, in memory of her jubilee\nin a prominent station in my native county in, the Mother Country; and \"Dignis parentis fillias dignis,\" he is, I need not remind you, the son of Mr. Marshall Wood, whose statue of Her Majesty graces the National Library of Parliament. In all capacities, and more especially as regards the work of to-day, he has earned a claim to your gratitude, and although I must leave to other hands the fittest mode of evincing it, I hope we shall not separate without in some way showing our appreciation of the work of the sculptor.\n\nCol. Powell called for cheers for the sculptor, Mr. Percy Wood, which were given in a most hearty manner.
