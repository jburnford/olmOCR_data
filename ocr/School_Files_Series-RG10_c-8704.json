I wish to add that Father Latour states that the parents of these children applied in person to him to have their children admitted in the Blue Quill School, and that it was on the occasion of their visit to the above school that they expressed their dissatisfaction of the kind of training their children were receiving at the present time.\n\nIf you approve the above application, will you be good enough to write to Father Latour to that effect.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 15, 1943.\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1943.\n\nMr. D.H.

In this connection I would appreciate it if you would have these children returned to their parents with as little delay as possible.\n\nWith regard to Ella John, I am making further enquiries in this case and will advise you later. Her sister Therese, now sick in Bonnyville Hospital, is enrolled in St. Anthony's School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. L.C. Latour C.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School.\nST. PAUL, Alberta.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your 119-1-10 of the 17th., instant, with reference to the applications for admission of four children from Kesheewin Reserve to Blue Quills Residential School and to submit herewith( in addition to a copy of my reply to the Rev. Principal, Blue Quills School ) the following reasons for withholding my recommendation.\n\nWhen I visited the Long Lake Indian Day School on September 27th., (Vide my report on this School forwarded through Mr Christianson's Office, at his request on Octr 5th,) I found only nine children on the roll and six present. The teacher intimated that an injunction was already on the reserve to have the school closed but I could obtain nothing definite on this point. However, I have since been informed reliably that the resident priest had told the farm instructor and the Indians many times that the school would be closed this fall, and I am also informed that unusual pressure was used to get the Indians to send their children to Blue Quills, with the result that only about seven were attending the Day School in October. I am of the opinion that to admit the children referred to would definitely ruin the Day School and their admission should not be contemplated as long as the Day School is in operation.\n\nI visited the Long Lake School on November 23rd., and found that the children in question had been returned to the reserve from Blue Quills School and there were 14 on the roll and 10 in attendance on the morning I was there. I might add that Father Routhier, Provincial Father of Alberta, called on me on November 10th., when I explained the whole matter to him I believe, to his satisfaction.\n\nDonald H. Cameron,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1943.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th ultimo, regarding certain children from the Keehsewin Reserve who desire to be admitted to the Blue Quills Residential School, I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from Indian Agent Cameron.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Also pupil No. 374 was in residence only seventy-two days. In these three cases the date the pupils returned to school is required.\n\nPupils Nos. 379, 0307 and 0346 were only in residence part of the Quarter. Please advise of the disposition of these three children and the dates of their absence.\n\nThe usual application forms and certificates of health are required for all new pupils shown on Form No. 411 with the exception of No. 0405 whose application has been received and approved.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the following pupils:\n\nNo. 0248 No. 0327 No. 0349.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nKB/HM.\nAttention: Mr Philip Phelan;\n\nI think, dear Sir, this will pretty well cover all the questions asked in your letter.\n\nI notice your letter was addressed to Rev.L.C.Latour. May I bring to your kind attention the fact that Rev.L.C.Latour left the Blue Quills School on January 24, 1947. I am taking his place for the time being.\n\nIt would be very highly appreciated if the checks from now on would be made payable to me, instead of to him.

Both pupils were ordered to the hospital by the local doctor, Dr Decosse, for special treatment.\n\nPupils No 0307 and 0346 have both been ordered after X-Ray examination, to the Charles Camell's Hospital, Edmonton for T.B. treatment, and they are still there to-day.\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of your letter, I know that application forms and certificates of health are required for all new pupils. I fully intended to have them forwarded long before this. But our winter has been so severe, with roads impassable during February, March and April, that the Doctor has not been able to come to the School to make the regular examination of the pupils. I saw him to-day and he told me that he would be there soon then the applications will be forwarded to the Agent and the Department.\n\nI wish to bring your kind attention to pupil 388. This child has been examined by the Doctor, and the application would have been forwarded long ago, had it not been for the obstination of the father in refusing to sign the application. He has been approached several times, both by the Agent and myself, and his answer is always the same: \"I will not sign, until I am sure that the child likes it.\"\n\nCorrection shown on return and extra gram out.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nFebruary 21, 1947\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Blue Quills Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Adelaide Moswa\nEnglish name: Adelaide Moswa\nAge: thirteen (19 May 1933)\nName of Band: Saddle Lake\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: $1\nFather's full name and No.: Jean Baptiste Moswa No. $1 Blue Quill's\nMother's full name and No.: Christine Horsethief No. $1 do do\nParents living or dead: living\nState of child's health: good\nReligion: Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English? a little\nPreviously attended: no school for years\n\n(Signature of father) (Signature of mother)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nV.

The application was refused by your agent, Mr. D. H.

I, therefore, hope that you will be able to settle this contentious case to the satisfaction of the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O.

One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\nJanuary 29, 1948.\n\nDear Father Holland:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the December quarter return for the Blue Quills Residential School in order that you can supply us with additional information.\n\nMay I point out at the outset of this letter that these returns are very carefully checked not only by our own branch, but subsequently by the Auditor General and if the instructions contained on the outside of the return are not carried out and if the principal does not prepare the return in accordance with the instructions contained on the back of the return and in circular letter of December 29, 1944, a copy of which is enclosed, the additional information has to be received.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30th, 1947 grant for 92 days was requested for pupils numbered as follows:\n\n281, 295, 306, 313; 324, 325, 326, 327, 339, 363, 371, 375, 379, 0249, 0325, 0345, 0367, 0391,\n\nIn view of the fact that grant was requested for 92 days, the Department presumed that the children had been in residence at least during the month of September, 1947. In the case of all pupils allowed home on holidays at the end of June the school is entitled to grant in the September quarter for the 62 days holiday leave plus the number of days the pupil is actually in residence during the September quarter.\nOn checking the December quarter return we find that all the pupils shown above are stated to be at home. Are we to infer that these children did not return after the summer holidays or were they all allowed home on September 30th? If the latter is the explanation, please let me know why you found it necessary to allow so many of them to go home.\n\nIf the explanation is that they did not return to the school on the expiration of their summer holidays, grants should only have been requested during the September quarter for 62 days for each of them.\n\nIn the case of pupils numbered as follows: 384, 2077, 0279, 0298, 0328, 0329, 0331, 0332, 0337, 0340, 0341, 0342, 0343, 0347, 0348, 0350, 0351, 0352, 0353, 0354, 0357, the September quarter return requested grant for them for the full quarter and presumably they were in residence during that quarter. However, in none of these cases are you asking grant for the full December quarter and it is, therefore, presumed that the children have been allowed home in which case you should state the exact date on which they left the school.\n\nIn the case of pupil 386, you ask 85 days grant and you place under the remarks column, the following - \"At Camsell Hospital Dec. 27\". Does this mean that the boy was placed in the hospital on that date? If he was in the school from October 1st and was placed in the hospital on December 27th, you are entitled to ask grant for the full December quarter. What has been said regarding this boy applies also to pupil 401.\n\nIn the case of pupil 0364, you request grant for 29 days and state \"In hospital from October 13 to November 27\". This is a period of 45 days.\nand as we allow thirty days hospital leave, grant should have been requested for this girl for seventy seven days.\n\nI wish you would review the return in view of the information given in this letter and make any amendments you consider necessary and send back the return as soon as possible. In the meantime, to assist in your financing we have made a part payment of $4,000.00 on your December quarter grant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E.

When we were ready to go and get the Saddle Lake's children, we were told by Mr. K.W. Taylor, Indian agent that due to an epidemic of measles, we would have the children only at a later date; at first it was on Sept. 15th, but at last with the complete approval of Dr. Stone, Regional Superintendent Health, Cassell's Hospital, the date was set at October the 15th.\n\nWhen we prepared the quarterly Return, ending Sept. 30th, we considered September as continuation of the holidays for the Saddle Lake's children and gave them the number of days in residence accordingly, and under the item Attendance in class-room, we gave only the number of days to those then present.\n\nFor the December Return, after we had all the children, we realized that the children of \"your first list\" would not very likely return to school; we did not give\nthem any day in residence and we notified them as being at home, meaning that they were not officially discharged, and not in school.\n\nThe children mentioned in the second list are all from Saddle Lake, and the same reasons apply to their case. We considered they were in prolonged holidays in the September Return, and in the December Return, we began to count their residential days on October 16th, without asking the grant for the first 18 days of October. Although considering those eighteen days as extended holidays we should have asked the grant for the period.\n\nThe boy No. 386 came to School on the 24th of October, five days after the others, and if we consider the holidays ending on October 16th, he would be entitled to the grant for nearly all the Quarter.\n\nPupil 0564 re-entered School on October 13th, in the morning, and we had her ready to go to the Hospital in the evening. In the event of the school officially re-opening on October 16th, she would be entitled to the seventy-seven days you mentioned in your letter.\n\nIf that extension of the holidays period had been clearly stated, we would have avoided the major part of our difficulties.\n\nBy the way, it is the same reason that applies in answer to the question why the children of our school did not go home for their Christmas holidays. It was thought the School term had been quite short, and besides, sickness had not abated on the Reserve, at Christmas time.\nMr W R Taylor, agent, was on a regular visit here today and I brought the matter with him. He is of the same opinion that the late official entrance of the Saddle Lake's children does not seem to have been reported to the Department.\n\nI would like to know at the earliest your decision on this matter and I would be ready to make accordingly a new return for December.\n\nIn closing I ask to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nATTENTION, Mr Philip Phelan, Chief, Training Div.\n\nThis will advise that I have very recently been contacted by the Rev. Father Rollande of Blue Quills Indian Residential School, with regards to Quarterly returns from his School. There appears to be somewhat of a misunderstanding, and Father Rollande advised me that he was not too familiar with the proceedings, as took place at this Agency during the September and December Quarters for 1947.\n\nI will endeavour to outline the cause of trouble, and without a doubt the cause of errors for the two quarterly returns mentioned above.\n\nDue to a serious epidemic of Measles in this Agency the Blue Quills Residential School was not opened officially, as the majority of the families were under Quarantine. This also effected the opening of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The epidemic was handled under the supervision of Dr. Decosse, and his findings were reported to Dr. E. L. Stone, Regional Superintendent, Indian Health Services, Edmonton. As a result of the Quarantine the Blue Quills School did not open officially until October 15th, 1947.\n\nAs the Rev. Father Rollande was not acquainted with the proceedings he made his September returns out in such a way that the month of September, in the same quarterly returns, would be classed as extended leave. This was also substantiated by the fact that all preparations, including staff, were prepared for official opening on September 1st, 1947. Despite the fact the school could not be opened, some pupils were brought in to the School for the September Quarter from Beaver Lake end\n(Lake and) Whitefish Lake Reserves in this Agency, and some pupils from the Reserves in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nThe remaining pupils did not return until October 18th, 1947. When the December returns were made out, pupils that did not return and were attending School for the 2nd and 3rd Quarters, were shown as being at home. I regret that proceedings of this nature were new and strange to me, or same would have been checked before going this far, causing inconveniences in all sections.\n\nMay I please be advised what procedure should be taken. It would appear that the 3rd Quarterly returns would have to be re-submitted in order to rectify the December Quarterly returns. Every endeavour possible will be made to correct this matter at the earliest possible date.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nFebruary 14, 1948.\n\nDear Father Rolland:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the September and December quarter returns of the Blue Quills Residential School. We have decided not to review the September return and consequently no further action need be taken regarding it.\n\nIn connection with the December return, you should place opposite the names of those comprising the first list in my letter of January 29th the word \"absent\". Do not state \"At home\". This entry should be made in the column headed \"Remarks\".\n\nWith reference to the second list, you should ask grant for them from October 18th to December 31st inclusive and in the column headed \"Remarks\" you should place opposite the names the statement \"Absent from school between October 1st and October 17th\".\n\nFor pupil No. 386 grant should be requested from October 24th to the end of December. For pupil No. 0364 you should request grant for 77 days.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Bernet-Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res.

By error, we did not include the name of Peter COLLINS No 306, though he was mentioned for discharge on our Return for December. Presuming that his discharge would be granted we include his name on the here attached Form No. I.A.411., with the hope this will not cause any inconvenience.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to thank you for all you do in favor of our children, and specially for the financial increase of the per capita grant that will enable us to face the high cost of living and to start working on the improvements suggested by Miss McCready.\n\nIn closing I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. E. Bernet-Rolland C.M.I.  \nPrincipal.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Blue Quills Residential SCHOOL DURING January - March QUARTER, 1948\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | No. of Years under Child's Present Control | Band |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|------|\n|     |               |                   |                  |                                          |      |\n\n| NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L for living, D for dead after name) |\n|---------------------------------|\n| Father                          |\n| Mother                          |\n| Religion of Parents             |\n| State of Education upon entering the School |\n| Place and period of Previous Education |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME            | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 0249| Lydia Large     | Feb.23-48 15      | 11 6             | Nil                   | Grade VIII         | Manual Training, Good.

Jean has never attended school to date.\n\n2. Before any action is taken by Rev. Father Rollande, O.M.I., Principal of Blue Quills Indian School, to have these children enrolled in his school, he would like a ruling on this particular case. That is, a protestant child enrolling in a Catholic School.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if we could have your ruling on this case so that the parties concerned may be informed.\n\nW. K.

Residential Schools.\n\nAs we infer from the contents of your letter of November 6th that these children are not receiving any education now, we would appreciate it if you would instruct Superintendent Robertson to arrange for the admission of the children to the two schools mentioned.\n\nIf at any time in the future a day school is established on the reserve, we can then consider whether the children should be allowed to remain at home to attend the day school.\n\nBernard Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: School Children - Wabunum Reserve.\n\nI have just returned from the north to find your letter of November 25th, in which you instruct that the 13 R.C. children at Wabunum be admitted to the Blue Quills and Onion Lake R.C. residential schools.\n\nOn my trip I found both the Blue Quills and Ermineskin schools filled to capacity with a waiting list of children eligible to attend.\n\nIt may be that the Onion Lake school could accommodate these children but after discussing the matter with Superintendent Robertson, I am convinced that the parents would not agree to send their children such a great distance. Mr. Robertson mentioned this in his letter of November 19th, file 110-6-3 addressed to you.\n\nAs I mentioned in my letter of November 8th, Mr. Staley, principal of the Edmonton residential school, stated that he would be glad to take these children into residence if there was no objection. Frankly I can think of no other solution to this problem except the provision of temporary day school facilities presently under consideration. Unfortunately there are no buildings near enough to the centre of the population to be used for a temporary school.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSchool Children - Wahamum Reserve\n\nIt would seem, in view of the regulations of the present Indian Act, that the only way to provide school facilities for the children on the Wahamum Reserve, will be by the establishment of a small day school. It is unfortunate that no temporary accommodation exists and that the Department of National Defence will not release the buildings previously requested.\n\nWe are having our architects design a low cost one room school without a basement and which will be heated only by stoves. It is felt that such a building would provide adequate accommodation on a reserve in which we are uncertain as to the outcome of the operation of a day school.\n\nWe will have an opportunity of discussing this matter when you visit the Department in January.\n\nBernard F.

Principal has requested the re-admission of;\n\n0358 - Joyce CARDINAL\n0393 - Yvonne JOHN\n\nWith regards to the two re-admissions, I would recommend same for the following reasons. Joyce CARDINAL has been attending a School (Day) in Edmonton, and her mother is working as a Nurses Aide in the General Hospital. Mrs. Cardinal is now working nights, and unable to take care of her daughter. A request was made to have this girl placed in a Convent, but it was recommended that she complete her eighth Grade first. The parents of Yvonne John are of a roving nature, and have not given their daughter a fair chance. I feel she will do well if admitted to the Blue Quills School.\n\nW. K.

Consequently, we cannot make an exception in the case of the two Collins girls, and they should be discharged in the immediate future.\n\nAs a matter of fact, they should never have been admitted to the Blue Quills Residential School which is a government-owned building, and as intimated above, is intended to be used for the education of recognized Indian children only.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nPP/ST\n\ncc Superintendent W.K.

Residential School to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nFrankly, it is not clear to this office the reason for this transfer. Our records indicate that both of the schools are over the authorized pupilage.\n\nYou indicate that these children have been in the Onion Lake School from two to nine years. As the Course of Study for Saskatchewan is somewhat different from that of Alberta, we are of the opinion that children who have been at the Onion Lake School for seven to nine years should complete their education there. The others may be transferred provided one or both of the schools are prepared to absorb the transportation costs for these children.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Blue Quills Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Adelaide Janvier\nEnglish name:\nAge: 7 (26/10/44)\nName of Band: LeGoff\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 172\nFather's full name and No.: Maurice Janvier\nMother's full name and No.: Eva\nParents living or dead: both living\nState of child's health: good\nReligion: R.C.\nDoes applicant speak English?

Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nThis refers to your letter of September 29th regarding admissions to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department approves the admission of all pupils listed in your letter except the four Cardinal children whose names are Victoria, Lena, Gene Francis and Emily as these pupils are Protestants and according to our records Victoria and Lena have attended the Edmonton school. The application shows that Gene Francis also attended the Edmonton school but we are unable to verify this from the Edmonton return. Would you advise the enrolment number of this pupil when attending the Edmonton school.\n\nThe Principal, Father Rollande should not have admitted the Cardinal children to the Blue Quills school until their admission was approved.\n\nAs the admission of the Cardinal children to the Blue Quills school is not approved, grant for them for the September Quarter is not allowed. You may advise the Principal to this effect.\n\nThe discharge of pupils numbered 392, 0329 and 0379 is also approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 18, 1951.\n\nRev. Bernet-Hollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nDear Father Rollande:\n\nThis refers to the September Quarterly return for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nOn Form I.A. 411 enclosed with this Return you indicated that three pupils have been discharged during this quarter and that no admissions have been made.\n\nOn checking the Return, it is noted that in the margin you have shown that seventeen pupils are being discharged and forty-one pupils were either admitted for the first time or re-admitted after being absent for some time.\n\nYou are advised that you must show on Form I.A. 411 all pupils you propose to discharge and those you admitted during the quarter, whether the admissions and discharges have been approved or not.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant under file 751-10-(F6) in regard to transfer of Indian pupils from Onion Lake Residential School to Blue Quills Indian Residential School we wish to advise that Ellyse and Lawrence Martial were admitted to the Onion Lake Indian Residential School at the ages of five and three respectively and that they have attained the grades of four and one respectively. The parents of these children strongly insist that these pupils be taught this year at Blue Quills School because they believe these children will advance more quickly here and that it will be much easier for the parents to visit them and also that the children would be able to return home during the holidays included in the school year. We also wish to advise that the same circumstances exist with regard to Nora Desjarlais.\n\nIn the case of Wilhelmina Ennow it appears that this girl, who is not sixteen years of age, was becoming very difficult to handle and the parents believe they could be in closer contact with her should she be allowed to attend Blue Quills School.\n\nThis matter has been fully discussed with Father Hollande and he informed us that he is quite ready to accept these pupils should the Department give their approval. Transportation cost in this regard will be paid by the parents concerned.\n\nWe would strongly recommend transfer of the above mentioned children, if at all possible.\n\nW. K. Taylor, Superintendent.\nOctober 22, 1951\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nYour file 118/25-2-751\nof October 15th\n\nThe Department approves the transfer of the following children from the Onion Lake to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School:\n\nElyse Martial\nLawrence Martial\nWhilemina Ennow\n\nIt is noted that Father Rollande is prepared to accept these children and that the parents will pay the transportation expenses.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRev. Father Rollands, principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, has contacted this office requesting the discharge of the following pupils:\n\nMoses Makokis\nDonald Whiskeyjack\nLeonard James\nCharlie Smallface\nSt. Mary Whiskeyjack\nJoseph Makokis\nWillie Makokis\nJoe. Robert John\nEdward Watermaker\nSamuel Louis Cardinal\nEva Jane Makokis\nEliza John\nMary Rose John\nVictoria Dumont\nEmily Doghead\nIrane Gladu\nMartha Gladu\nMartha McIlvory\nMary Margaret John\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nOctober 27, 1951.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nYour file 119/25-2-751\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 22nd, the Department approves the discharge of pupils listed provided you are satisfied that the discharges are justified.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would ask the Principal, Father Rollande to show his future discharges on Form I.A. 411 which should be enclosed with the Quarterly Return. It is much easier to check the records when discharges are listed on this form rather than on a letter.\n\nIf any discharges require more explanation, a letter can be forwarded with Form I.A. 411.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy which you may forward to the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Blue Quills Indian & Res.

Indian Education.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 18th., under file 751-10(Eb), in regard to the four Cardinal children from this Agency who are, at present, in the Blue Quill Residential School, we wish to advise that the parents and children in this family are now following the Catholic faith. The younger children in this family have already been baptised and the older children and parents are receiving instruction in the R.C. faith. Since this family undertook the instruction under the R.C. faith before these children were enrolled in school we respectfully request that these admissions be approved as submitted and the grant for the September be allowed.\n\nThree of the above children were previously enrolled in the Edmonton Residential School and their numbers were as follows: Victoria - 0301, Lena - 0302, Emily - 0307 and there is no record of Gene Francis having attended this school.\n\nFather E.B. Rollande has been advised to show the above children on his quarterly return temporarily pending a further decision in this matter. Your further advice would be greatly appreciated in this matter.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nJanuary 9, 1952.\n\nMr. W.K.

If the Return is on its way to Ottawa by the time you receive this letter these children's names will be deleted from the Return and no grant will be allowed. Should a decision reached by the Department favour placing these children in the Blue Quills school the Returns will be amended in the future.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Blue Quills Res.\n\n**School During October-November-December Quarter, 1951**\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band | Name of Parents and Living or Dead | Father | Mother | Religion | State of Education upon entering the School | Place & period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|------|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 377 | Francis Varvin | Oct.29            | 10               | 46   | Heart Lake                        | Philip Francis-D. | Alice Francis-D. | R.C. | Nil |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name             | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| 372 | Charland Noel    | Dec. 31-14        | 5                 | 5 9 29                | Grade IV           | Did not return since Sept.

Foster\nJanuary 23, 1952.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nFurther to our letters of October 18th and January 15th regarding the admission of the Cardinal children to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, it is noted from our files that three of the children were in the Edmonton Indian Residential school; two for four years and one for one year. It appears that these pupils were later discharged from the Edmonton school and all were placed in the Saddle Lake Day School.\n\nIt is noted from the application forms that both parents are living. Would you advise the necessity for institutional care for these children. It is noted that the children are already at the Blue Quills school, however, their admission to this school has not been approved and no grant can be allowed until the matter is cleared up.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Supt. Indian Education.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, under file 751-10(E6), in regard to the necessity of institutional care for the Cardinal children, this will advise that this is a large family which has 7 children living and three that died since 1949. The mother in this family is in very poor health and is constantly in the hospital. We consider that institutional care for these children would ease that burden on these parents to a great extent.\n\nWhile these children were in the Saddle Lake Day School, this family needed the constant help of their neighbors to manage all their children.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\nFebruary 12, 1952\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nYour file 118/25-2-751\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 5th regarding the Cardinal children, would you kindly advise whether these children are now at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is very doubtful that we will be able to secure approval for the admission of these children to the Blue Quills school. It would be appreciated if you would advise whether it would be possible to have these children placed in the Edmonton school where three of them were prior to attending the Saddle Lake Day School. Also advise under what circumstances these three children were taken out of the Edmonton school and placed in the Saddle Lake school bearing in mind the contents of your letter of February 5th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Superintendent of Education.\n\nReference your letter of even file dated the 12th ultimo regarding the admission of the Cardinal children to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nOn reviewing our files it is noted that the first correspondence in regard to this case was submitted September 8, 1948, under file 118/6-1 and a reply was received from your office under file 118-1-10 (E1) on September 16, 1948.\n\nThe father of this family, Matthew Cardinal, treaty No. 228 Saddle Lake Band, was born and raised as a member of the United Church. Shortly after he was married he was baptised and became a member of the Roman Catholic Church. There are eight children and all were baptised in the Roman Catholic Church with the exception of Victoria and Lena, who were baptised in the United Church. Victoria and Lena attended the Edmonton Indian Residential School for approximately three years and everything went well until it was time for Jean, the third daughter, to start school. It was then the parents requested a change and thus our letter of September 8th, 1948, to the Department for a ruling. The reason given by the parents for not wishing to have their children attend the Edmonton Indian Residential School was the fact that they, the parents, were now members of the Roman Catholic faith. Acting on your ruling of September 16, 1948, file number quoted above, the three girls were sent to the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThe following year when a new day school continued..............\nwas opened at Saddle Lake the parents of this family lived within a distance of one mile from the school and thus their children attended the Saddle Lake Day School.\n\nDuring the spring of 1950 the parents moved to a new location approximately five miles from the Saddle Lake Day School and again requested that their children be admitted to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. Since the beginning of the school term 1951, four children of this family have been attending the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. At the present time there is not sufficient room in the Edmonton Indian Residential School for the four girls and in view of the circumstances I would recommend that they be admitted to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills School informed me that, should these children be allowed to attend this school, the two oldest girls will be baptised under Roman Catholic faith.\n\nW.

School\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nAttached find Application for Admission Ralph Frederick Callihoo, age 12 years, TN 122 Michel Band.\n\nThis boy, along with his brother, was admitted to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School in September, 1952. He, along with his brother, repeatedly ran away and the Principal, Rev. Father Latour, discharged both boys. Rev. Father Rollande at Blue Quill's Indian Residential School, St. Paul, Alberta, took this boy in, after it was decided to split the boys and send one to Blue Quill's and one to Sturgeon Lake. The children have no mother and the father is unable to look after them. Both boys of Archie Callihoo have had little or no education and are a constant problem to the Michel Band community and to other communities in which they periodically reside. No one seems to be willing to foster them.\n\nAction was taken, in view of this boy's lack of a home, to send him to Blue Quill's before submission of this application, which was January 29/53. It is hoped this action will meet with your approval.\n\nMedical Examination has already been completed. See Application to Ermineskin Indian Residential School, in September 1952.\n\nH.M.

If you sign the attached application for admission forms, we will try and get your boys into the Blue Quill's Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. I am sure there they will be well cared for and receive good education and proper care which, because of your large family, you cannot give.\n\nIf you agree, return the signed forms to this office.\n\nH.M.W./p\nenclosure\ncc to Director, Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nH.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nAugust 5, 1953.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\n403 P.O. Bldg.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letters of July 29 and 30th, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School:\n\nAlice Kootenayhoo\nMargaret Paul\nEdward Arcand\nLena Agnes Kootenhayoo\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that arrangements have been made with the Indian Health Services to conduct a physical examination of Indian children entering a residential school; consequently it is no longer necessary to complete the physical examination portion on the application for admission form.\n\nFor your information new application forms are available. A quantity of these forms have been sent to Regional Supervisor Gooderham and it is presumed that some of these have already reached your office; however, additional quantities are available by requisitioning in the usual manner. The new application forms do not require physical examination.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCharles Camseil Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nJuly 29th 1953.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n620 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham,\n\nAttached is a letter written by Mr. Dew, for your information, which explains itself.\n\nWe would appreciate anything you can do to further action these two patients.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.L. Falconer M.D.\nMedical Superintendent.\n\nc.c. Dr. P.E. Moore.\nCharles Camsell Indian Hospital,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nJuly 25, 1953.\n\nMr. Gooderham,\nRegional Superintendent of Indian Agencies,\n620 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nATTENTION: Mr. Waller\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham,\n\nWe have two patients in the hospital who are giving us some concern at the present time. These patients are ready for discharge but will require a year's convalescence, preferably under a more restricted routine than they would experience in their own homes. The medical staff would like to hold them in hospital and over-treat them, but as they have a long list of active tuberculosis cases waiting to be admitted they have no choice but to prepare them for discharge.\n\nThese patients have no homes of their own to which they may return, but will have to live with friends or relatives if discharged home. Both of these patients are anxious to receive more education so that eventually they may receive training that would enable them to become gainfully employed.\n\nBoth patients are Indians, one 19 years of age and the other is 20 years of age. Both are Roman Catholics. I have canvassed all the private schools in Edmonton, with the hope that one or more of them would be prepared to accept at least one of these patients. However, the lowest grades taught in these schools is nine and ten. This is no help to us. As far as I can ascertain, there are no other institutions in Alberta where they can receive rest and training at the same time.\n\nTherefore, can you help us? If there is room I would suggest that these two boys should attend Blue Quills Residential School. One of these patients, John Fournier, is unusually talented in art and it has been recommended that he eventually receive training in commercial art. I recall that when I visited Blue Quills School, that I was introduced to a very capable art teacher who would be able to give John much assistance.\n\n2...\nAs I mentioned earlier, the need for beds is urgent and until some arrangement can be made for these boys, they must continue to occupy beds that are required by other patients. Could you therefore give me an answer as soon as possible, as to what assistance you can offer.\n\nI realize that Residential Schools are for children, but as nothing is available for these adults following discharge, it would seem that the residential school provides the only solution to our problem until such time as the departments concerned with the native peoples set up such a training institution.\n\nI am enclosing a summary of these patients for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) FRED N.

Ovarian Substance Tablets list at $3.30 per 100 tablets, the quantity of 500 appears to us rather unusual.\n\nAlso note we are quoting on Essence of Peppermint 10% strength. This commodity is particularly high at present and possibly the 3% extract would be satisfactory which would cost $4.50 instead of $9.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRJH/KHC.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPLEASE ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE COMPANY NOT TO INDIVIDUALS\n**REQUISITION FOR DRUGS FOR USE OF INDIANS OF SADDLE LAKE BAND**\n\nAugust 26th, 1925\n\n| No.   | Item                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------|-----------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| No. 1 | 3 gallon Castor Oil         |          | 3.35       | 10.05       |\n| No. 2 | 1 gallon Lactated Pepsin (Elixir) 40 gr. |    | 3.80       | 3.80        |\n| No. 3 | 3 gallon Ferrogen           |          | 7.80       | 23.40       |\n| No. 4 | 1 gallon Elivir Terpin Dionin |      | 12.50      | 12.50       |\n| No. 5 | 3 gallon Camphorated Oil    |          | 7.10       | 21.30       |\n| No. 6 | 5 gallon Cough Mixture      |          | 3.75       | 18.75       |\n| No. 7 | 1 gallon Witch Hazel        |          | 3.75       | 3.75        |\n| No. 8 | 1 gallon Turpentine         |          | 2.25       | 2.25        |\n| No. 9 | 1 gallon Lysol              |          | 3.50       | 3.50        |\n| No.10 | 1 gallon Glycerine           |          | 4.00       | 4.00        |\n| No.11 | 3 gallon Cod Liver Oil Emulsion |      | 2.70       | 8.10        |\n| No.12 | 3 gallon White Liniment     |          | 3.45       | 10.35       |\n| No.13 | 32 oz.

Clayton\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing list of narcotic drugs required for certain orders placed with your firm. As requested, I am forwarding herewith prescriptions signed by one of our medical officers, covering these drugs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRevillon Wholesale Ltd.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nEnclos.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to report that Dr. Desosse has informed me that on his last visit at the Blue Quill's Residential School, he examined several pupils and found that they had enlarged tonsils. He recommends that these be removed and suggests that in the event of permission being granted the best method of dealing with these cases would be to have them taken to hospital at St. Paul where he could perform the necessary operations and keep the patients under observation for a few hours or possibly overnight.\n\nThe doctor considers that there would be about twelve cases requiring attention. I should be glad to have your authority in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. E. Gullion\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.\nIndian Commissioner\nRegina Sask.\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. W. B. Gullion, Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, with reference to the desirability of operating on twelve pupils at the Blue Quill's Residential School who have enlarged tonsils. I shall be glad if the Department will advise me what action it is desired should be taken. If the Doctor's recommendation is carried out, the cost will probably be $300.00 or more.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 29, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 407-11B of the 22nd instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Gullion, Saddle Lake, relative to the recommendation of Dr. Decosse that a number of the pupils at the Blue Quills Residential School, who have enlarged tonsils, be operated on. In this connection I beg to say that you may arrange to have the operations carried out in the cases absolutely necessary to the health of the pupils.

I will see that, after the re-opening of the school, and after vaccine have been received, those pupils be inoculated.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos.

The letter is self-explanatory.\n\nI have also been reminded that any new pupils who may have entered school during the past year should be vaccinated before the end of the school term. The school year closes June 30th and in the event that I should overlook mentioning the matter, I should be glad if you would call at the Blue Quill's school on your next visit to this reserve and attend to any cases which have not been previously vaccinated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ. P. Decosse Esq., M.D.\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA\n\nJune 3rd, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 93-1 of the 27th ultimo in regard to a report received from Rev'd J. Angin that twenty pupils of the Blue Quill's Residential school had not yet been vaccinated although a list of pupils was supplied last autumn and in reply; I might state that I asked the school for a list of the pupils and received a list containing 65 names, (31 girls and 32 boys) all of whom had been vaccinated as stated in my report of the 23rd August, 1930. Previous to this, I had taken up the matter of vaccination of pupils with Dr. Decosse and he advised me that so far as he was aware, he had vaccinated all of the children in the school and that Sister Breake had a record of this and could furnish the list.\n\nQuite a number of new pupils were taken in during the past year and I am enclosing herewith, copy of letter sent to Dr. J.P. Decosse on the 19th ultimo, requesting him to call at the Blue Quill's school on his next visit to the Saddle Lake reserve, in order to attend to any children who have not been previously vaccinated. Had the Reverend Father Angin mentioned the matter during one of my visits to the school, I could have advised him that it was being kept in mind and that it would be attended to in due course. The Doctor was advised as to regulations in Circular No. 93-1B and I have endeavored to carry out the instructions contained therein. Arrangements have been made to vaccinate all pupils who have not already been attended to and I shall submit a report on this as soon as possible after the end of the school term.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

It is, however, a matter for notice that so many pupils of this school should have been unvaccinated. Instructions have been in force for several years, and the new school has been in operation for sufficient time to enable them to be fully put into effect. If smallpox had appeared in this school this number of pupils would have been material for an epidemic.\n\nThe instructions place the responsibility for vaccination on the officer in charge of the agency and not on the doctor. Kindly give this matter your attention at the opening of school for the fall term, and see for yourself that all new pupils are vaccinated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. E.

Moyer's Health and School Scale No. 325, shown in Moyer's 1932-1933 catalogue would be suitable for this purpose and this is the scale that they had in mind. I believe that in addition to weighing, this has an attachment for measuring height.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.F.

This type of scale is seldom if ever supplied to a Residential School owing to the cost, but the Department is willing to expend approximately $15.00 in the purchase of a bathroom scale of the Health-o-meter pattern. It will, therefore, be in order for you to arrange purchase from approved source locally and have the scale sent to the Principal of the school. Kindly quote the date and file number of this letter when submitting an account for payment. A copy of this letter is being sent to Indian Agent Gullion for his information.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM.

School,\nSaint-Paul, Alta.\n\nAugust 24th 1936\n\nTo the Honourable Harold W. Mac Gill,\nMinister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI herewith inform you that Blue Quills School did not re-open on August 13th through the bad will of Mr. Indian Agent Gullion. This Agent forbade the parents to bring back their children to school on account of whooping cough. In fact, there were some cases of whooping cough on the Saddle-Lake reserve, but only 6 or 7 pupils were sick out of 80; it seems to be ridiculous to maintain home the other 75 pupils. Mr. Gullion told me on August 13th that Dr. Decosse had asked him to run in some of the pupils for 3 weeks, it was false, Mr. Gullion told a lie. Dr. Decosse did not say anything of that; he gave to Gullion a letter dated Aug. 11th or 12th, stating that only the pupils of 5 families should not go to school for a while till they recover. This letter has been read by Mr. Pitre, teacher at Blue Quill School; Mr. Decosse did not hinder the pupils to come back to school; on the contrary, when told by Rev. Father Michel, Missionary at Saddle Lake, that he had visited the school, he was surprised denied it and said that, in his letter to Gullion, nothing of this could be read, and no mistake possible; he was surprised even that the pupils did not come back to school.\n\nIf you ask for this letter to Gullion, you will be surprised, Honourable Sir, to see as Gullion is a hypocrite.\n\nWhen I knew these facts, I had let Pitre phone to Gullion asking him to bring back to school the 75 pupils who were free from disease. Gullion replied he would see again Dr. Decosse, and in fact this latter went through the reserve of Saddle-Lake last Thursday Aug. 20th, but I do not know yet the result of this visit.\n\nI find strange that, where there is some matter relative to the pupils, I am not admitted to discuss this matter with Dr. Decosse and Gullion; they take decision alone. I am rather notify of their decision, an order constituted by the Department cannot harm them, the pupils; this means, I fancy, that I should be admitted into any discussion concerning the pupils. I remember another fact that happened 2 years ago; a girl, Gertrude Cardinal, was sent from school to hospital for eye-disease; she was discharged from hospital and from school both by Dr. Decosse and Gullion, she was home since one week, and I was not notified even of her discharge. This is surprising. I should add, addition to this, any matter concerning the pupils, because I am their guardian, and I do not accept that Dr. Decosse and Gullion can discharge any pupil without my consent, as well as they can not maintain home pupils without my consent. Am I right or wrong?\n\nNow I do not know when the pupils will come back to school; this whooping cough is on the reserve since last fall 1935, and no steps have been taken to stop it. This year, when there is a new break up, I shall have to go to Gullion again before to stop it or to disinfect the barracks of garmattherefore, the disease can spread over and stay for 2 or 3 years.\n\nI cannot understand the conduct of Gullion; for me he is just good for nothing, he does not care about anything, he leaves the Indians quiet, whilst they do not bother himbut as a hypocrite, he can tell lies as many as words.\n\nBut this is a big damage made to the school, and I do not know how I can finance the school if the Department cut the grant.\n3 weeks or more on account of the absence of the pupils. And,\nask you, Honourable Sir, that the grant be given to Blue Hill\nSchool, as if the children had been present since August 13th.\nI say again that the fault is only upon Gullion who should have\nobeyed the instructions of Dr. Decosse.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.H.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 1, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to certain pupils of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School not returning upon the expiry of their leave owing to an outbreak of whooping cough.\n\nMr. Agent Gullion is being requested to report in connection with this matter. I may say that, if pupils with whooping cough were admitted to a residential school, you would probably have considerable trouble with them all winter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSaint Paul, Alta.\nOttawa, September 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in which he states that Dr. Decosse directed that certain Indian children belonging to five families on the Saddle Lake Reserve be not returned upon the expiry of their leave owing to whooping cough. He further states that, in spite of these directions of the doctor, you have issued instructions for about eighty (80) children of the Saddle Lake Reserve not to return on the date of the opening of the school after the holidays.\n\nPlease let the Department have a full report, at once, regarding your action in this matter. If Dr. Decosse gave the instructions mentioned by the Reverend Principal, the Department cannot understand why you kept all the children home.\n\nWhen replying to this letter, you should forward to the Department the letter which you received from Dr. Decosse regarding whooping cough on the Saddle Lake Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nAugust 21, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that owing to an epidemic of whooping cough on the Whitefish Lake reserve, I found it necessary, on the advice of Dr. Eadie of Vilna, to keep the pupils of the Edmonton Residential school and also the Blue Quill's Residential school, at home.\n\nAs there was some whooping cough on the Saddle Lake reserve also, I had Dr. Decosse of St. Paul check up the homes on this reserve and he has now also recommended keeping the pupils at home for a time. The principals of both schools were advised accordingly. I might state that the doctors advised holding the children for at least three weeks when another check up would be made as to their fitness to attend school. I might also mention that the Principals of both schools have mentioned the matter of the grant during this period, and asked if this would be paid in a case of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Gullion\n(Signed)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJ. P. Beronse,\nPhysician and Surgeon\n\nSt. Paul, Alberta, Aug. 20th. 1936.\n\nThe Agent,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our conversation of August the 9th, when I informed you I had found many children of school age who were suffering from pertussis, and also advised that they should not be sent to school for three or four weeks and further, that all other suspicious cases who were brought to your attention should be investigated before the opening of school and that if too many were reported it would be advisable to keep all the children home until such a time as we were satisfied they were all cured, please note that I have found so many cases since that I am convinced the above action was amply justified.\n\nNo doubt many more cases will be reported in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. P. Beronse\nSeptember 18th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 118-1-13 of the 1st instant in regard to a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school in which he evidently endeavoured to make it appear that I had acted contrary to the advice given by Dr. Decosse. As the whooping cough situation was such that I was of the opinion that should the children be sent back to school, serious developments might result, and as this was brought to Father Angin's attention, I am rather surprised at his attitude in the matter. I discussed fully with Dr. Decosse and also with Dr. Fadie, the advisability of keeping the pupils at home for a time and both of the Doctors advised keeping the children home for at least three weeks, this depending on the situation at the end of that period.\n\nThe Reverend Principal was advised of this but he evidently considered that he was better informed in the matter than the Doctors who were in attendance as he almost immediately started to urge the Indians to take their children back to school. This, despite the fact that he had been advised as to what was being done and the reason for keeping the pupils out of school for a time. By insisting whenever the Indians called at the school, the Reverend Principal persuaded some of them to take their children to school before they had been passed as fit by the Medical Officers, twenty-three being returned to school in this manner. In doing this, it would appear that Father Angin acted in direct contravention of the health regulations issued by the Department and should his action result in a further outbreak of whooping cough or other serious consequences follow in the case of the children taken into school, he should be prepared to accept full responsibility in the matter.\n\nThe situation on the reserves is now improved and the children, after being checked, will be going back to school. As requested, I am enclosing herewith, Dr. Decosse's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.F. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRef. 118-1-15\nOrder #31-1-T\n\nOFFICE OF\nTHE PURCHASING AGENT\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 2nd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor immediate delivery\n\nKindly order from P.

Eadie, Vilna, Alta.\n\nOctober 15th, 1936\n\nCopy to Mr. Gullion, Indian Agent\n\nDear Doctors Decosse and Eadie:\n\nI have been asked to intervene in the matter of the children from Saddle Lake who are out of Blue Quills and Edmonton Residential Schools on account of whooping cough. The Principals are put out. Perhaps many of them have gone back now, and we have not heard of it.\n\nAs for children who have whooping cough, and whom you do not think fit to travel, your judgment must be final. As for the rest, it occurs to me at this distance that they might be better off in the schools than at home. Of course, the Principals will have to consider whether this may involve the spread of the disease to many pupils from other areas, and, if you allow children with whooping cough, or exposed to it, to go back you would be entitled to express your view as to their responsibility. I know also that you and Mr. Gullion have the parents to deal with.\n\nMy suggestion is that you and Mr. Gullion should get together, with the Principals of the Schools, if possible, and come to some agreement, or at least compromise.\n\nYours very truly\n\nE. L. Stone, M. B.\nDirector of Medical Services\nMemorandum:\n\nIn writing the Principals you may think it wise to point out that in the last resort, Provincial law and regulations are the final authority in matters of contagious disease, and that the Indian Agent is bound to observe them under the advice of the Doctor.\n\nIt may become a matter for compromise between the strict law and the best interest of all concerned, and we have suggested that the Principals, Doctors and Indian Agent try to work out a satisfactory solution together.\n\nE. L. Stone, M. B.\nDirector of Medical Services\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt Paul, Alberta.\n\nOctober 19th, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Requisition\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nOn our last requisition of June 19th, 1936, we are short of Gauze. We asked for 2000 yds., we only received 150 yds. Owing to the great amount of dressings being done to those children, we are getting short already. Should we have to get it here it would cost a lot more. Hoping shipment will be made at once.\n\nWe have not yet received the Cod Liver Oil. It is time the children should start and take it, as there are quite a number who have been sick and need a tonic. Could you also send some of the Extract of Malt and Cod liver Oil, some of the girls do not digest the pure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Angin, Principal\nOttawa, October 28th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential School has written the Department asking to be supplied with 2000 yards of gauze. He claims he asked for this amount in his last requisition. Actually 1000 yards were requested but it was reduced in this office to 150 yards as that is the average quantity usually supplied to Residential Schools. It is also claimed that there is a great amount of dressings being done to the children. It will be appreciated if you will investigate and, if satisfied that the quantity asked for is required, submit a proper requisition approved by the medical attendant.\n\nThe Principal should be informed that the cod liver oil substitute known as \"Thallatel\" was ordered from Vancouver on October 1st, and must be on its way if he has not already received it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\n\nPJB\nJ. P. Decorse,\nPhysician and Surgeon\n\nSt. Paul, Alberta, Nov. 4th, 1936.\n\nRX'D.\n\nThe Director of Medical Services,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter file No. 118-1-13 and must say that I am surprised to hear that the children had not all returned to school by Oct. 15th.\n\nI completed an inspection of all the children actually on the reserve on Sept. 15th, and advised Mr. Cullion two days afterwards that all the children with a few exceptions could return to school. The latter were cases who had not had pertussis and were coughing at the time, and the parents were advised to keep them home for a week or more and that if the cough ceased, they were to be sent to school, if not, they were to be sent to the Agent who was to advise me as to whether they could be re-examined. As none of these cases reported I assumed that they only had a cold of the ordinary variety and that all had returned to school before Oct. 1st.\n\nThe only explanation I can give for this failure on the part of the parents to return the children is that an epidemic of lobar pneumonia existed at that time at the Blue Bull School among the children of other reserves and also among those of Saddle Lake who were admitted before the inspection, and no doubt the parents elected to keep them home until this abated.\n\nTen Cases of pneumonia, four of which were double, were admitted to the St. Paul Hospital between Sept. 15th and October 14th, with no mortality, fortunately, and in view of this situation, it may have been a wise thing for the parents to do.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. P. Decorse\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.D.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following in connection with the pupils of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school. As mentioned in my letter of the 18th September last, it was necessary, owing to whooping cough on the Saddle Lake and Whitefish Lake reserves, to keep the children home. This action was taken after the situation had been fully discussed with the Medical Officer. As the situation was clearing up toward the end of the month, arrangements were made to have all of the children who were fit, return to the schools on the 1st October. A few were kept at home at that time and the last group, ten in number, were sent back to the Edmonton Residential school on the 27th.\n\nIn the meantime however, there appeared to be an epidemic of pneumonia at the Blue Quill's Residential school as there were ten cases of pneumonia taken to the hospital from the school between the 15th September and the 14th October four of these cases being double pneumonia. As those of the children kept home after the 1st October became fit and parents directed to take their children to school, they hesitated in some cases owing to fear that their children might contract pneumonia. In some cases their children were just recovering from whooping cough. Fortunately, so far, there have been no deaths there from this disease.\n\nI might say that none of the parents refused definitely to take their children back to school when directed that they should do so. They stated in most cases that owing to hearing of so many pneumonia cases at the school, they did not wish to take the risk of losing their children and that they would rather keep them for a short time or until such time as the pneumonia situation cleared up to some extent. Compulsion might have been resorted to, to have the children taken in immediately after they were considered fit. On the other hand, if this action had been taken and pneumonia had caused the death of a pupil after being taken in, a very disagreeable situation would have been created.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWhen I was at Whitefish Lake reserve on the 20th October, I advised the Indians there that any pupils of the schools, Edmonton Residential and Blue Quill's, who were still out, should be returned to the schools to which they belonged. There did not seem to be any objection to this. However, upon making enquiries lately, I was informed that they had expected that the motor truck from the school would be sent up for the few children there. I shall make enquiries and if this was not done, some arrangement will be made to have any absentee brought in. The truck could have been sent up from the Blue Quill's school for the children at Whitefish Lake, and this would no doubt have speeded up the return of some of the children as some of the Indians do not own horses.\n\nChecking up at Beaver Lake reserve on the 6th October, I found that some of the children there had whooping cough. This had just started and the parents were advised that the children would be required at the Blue Quill's school in about three or four weeks time. There are seven pupils there. These will now be brought in if fit.\n\nThe situation in connection with the schools this year was unavoidable and although the schools may have lost a little in the way of grants, the matter throughout has been dealt with in a manner considered in the best interests of everybody concerned.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that a more reasonable attitude by the Principal in unavoidable issues and the co-operation of the schools in recruiting and getting children back to school, would be very much appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nSaddle Lake, Alta., Nov. 10, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report for the month of October 1936.\n\nHEALTH\n\nThe general health of the Indians has been fair. There were a number of cases of pneumonia amongst the school children at Blue Quill's residential school. Whooping Couch cases were all better and the remaining school children were returned to school. Nurse Fisk has been on the Whitefish and Saddle Lake reserves during the month and reports no sickness of a serious nature.\n\nW. E.

As to milking cows, I have applied for 10; the 10 cows here at the present are also getting old and soon will have to be slaughtered for beef.\n\nYou will notice that there is also a list for the shop, mostly of tools required for repairs to house or of farm equipment; and this will prove a great economy to the institution as our engineer can thereby attend to any urgent and necessary repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

On April 10th, last, you gave me a memorandum concerning sources of supply for live stock and implements. If there are any others that you wish to have quoted, please let me know.\n\nConcerning the painting of the floors at the new school, I may say it is not the intention to proceed with this work this year.\n\nA.

S. G. I. A.\nAugust 31, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nPursuant to telephone conversation this afternoon, I have to inform you that horses, cattle and agricultural machinery will be purchased for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in the electoral district of Athabasca, from time to time, during the next few months, as required. The original requisition from the Reverend Principal indicated that six horses, ten cows and the following agricultural machinery would be required:\n\n- Breaking plough,\n- Mower,\n- Gang plough,\n- Rake,\n- Disc,\n- Wagon,\n- Harrow,\n- Bob sleigh,\n- Drill.\n\nI may say it is not the intention to purchase any of this equipment until the Reverend Principal writes that particular stock or machinery is then required. The current prices for the locality of St. Paul, Alberta, will be paid when purchase is made. It is possible that a team or two of horses, the ten cows, a harrow, wagon and bob sleigh will be required during the next few months and that the rest of the equipment and stock will be needed in the spring.\n\nA.

Jos. Anglin,\nPrincipal.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference with your letter No 118-1-14, of Feb. 4th, relative to the machines to be supplied to the Blue Quills School, I may say that, according to your letter, I have asked, 5 weeks ago, for the prices of these, to Mr Charles Gauvreau of St-Paul, but have not got any reply. It is possible that Mr Gauvreau have written to the Department directly.\n\nConsidering however that the spring is coming soon and that the agricultural implements will be needed within one month, I have taken the liberty to ask for prices to the principal firms of machinery in St-Paul that have always repairs in hand in stock and I submit below their prices for your information:\n\n| Massey-Harris | Mc Cormick-Deering |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| 16\" Breaking plow | $92.00 | $93.00 |\n| 16\" Disc | $92.00 | $88.75 |\n| Spring tooth harrow | $90.00 | $90.25 |\n| 20 ft Drill | $299.00 | $299.00 |\n| Bob-sleigh with double-box | $113.50 | $108.00 |\n\nFor freight from Edmonton to St-Paul $27.44\n\nThe Massey-Harris firm gives a 7% discount on Machinery, and 5% on sleigh, so that the amount totals to $575.65\n\nThe Mc Cormick-Deering firm gives a 10% discount on all, so that the amount totals to $566.99.\n\nI know that Mr Gauvreau has yet some machines from Lacrosse Flow works, of Racine, Wisc. I would be very obliged to the Department not to furnish these same machines to the school, as it takes 3 weeks before getting repairs from Racine, Wisc.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Ancin,\nPrincipal.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No 118-1-14, of Feb. 4th, concerning the livestock to be supplied to the Blue Quills School, I must say that Mr. Charles Gauvreau of St-Paul, has submitted no price till now.\n\nThen I can state for your information that the farmers here around the school could supply 10 good cows, fresh, young, healthy for the price of $50.00 per head, and below. Those cows are not Shorthorn, but Ayrshires mixed up with pure Shorthorn.\n\nAs to one bull, I have no reference to submit now.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Aurin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your letters of March 23rd, last, requesting the Department to supply milk cows and agricultural implements.

You may ascertain what arrangements could be made with Charles Gauvreau, of St. Paul, for supplying the cows and farm implements and the cost. Please state, also, whether you could arrange for the purchase of any equipment authorized, including the milch cows and bull, or whether you would recommend that this be placed in the hands of Mr. Agent Gullion.\n\nThe Department is anxious to have this information at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

The playgrounds should be fenced the soonest possible, chiefly when it is time yet to make fence; pretty soon, it will be too cold to have the playgrounds fenced.\n\nThe pump is working very badly and I fear it breaks sometime. Mr. Indian Agent Gullion has been advised two months ago and I asked at this time that the pump be taken off and fixed again. Would it be possible that the man who has settled down this pump come again to see about it?\n\nOur wheat is already cut and pretty soon it will be the turn of the oats to be cut, and after wards the threshing will take place. I get you remember that we have no granary and no other place to put our crop. Therefore a granary should be built very soon. I hope you will take steps in this connection.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School St. Paul, Alta., has requested that the following agricultural implements, fencing and cattle be supplied:\n\nAgricultural Implements:\n- 1 - 16\" Breaking Plough\n- 1 - 16\" Disc\n- 1 - Spring tooth harrow\n- 1 - 20 R Drill\n- 1 - Bob sleigh with double box\n\nFencing:\n- 340 - Cedar fence posts, 7 ft. high\n- 190 - Rods woven fencing, 48 in. high\n- 50 - lbs.

With regard to the cows, the principal states that they have 7 cows at the school at present. Would it be necessary to supply 10 more at this time?\n\nI am uncertain what arrangements could be made with Charles Gauvreau, of St. Paul, for supplying the cows and farm implements and the cost. Please state, also, whether you could arrange for the purchase of any equipment authorized, including the milch cows and bull, or whether you would recommend that this be placed in the hands of Mr. Agent Guillion. I should be pleased if you would give an approximate estimate of the cost of supplying the equipment, live stock, etc., which you recommend at the present time.\n\nThe Principal is anxious to obtain the fencing material as early as possible and, in order to prevent delay, you may arrange for the purchase from indicated sources of supply of the quantity of fencing material, as mentioned above. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost and attach same to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your recommendation regarding the agricultural implements and milch cows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in connection with the agricultural implements, fencing, and cattle asked for by the Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul. You have my report on this school dated the 24th ultimo, and you will note that I have stated that the following agricultural implements will be required:\n\n- 1 - 16\" Breaking Plow\n- 1 - 16\" Disk\n- 1 - 20-run Drill\n- 1 - set spring toothed Harrows\n- 1 - Bob sleight with box - Required this fall.\n\nThe fencing is for the playgrounds, and when I was there the Principal estimated the cost at $250. These grounds should, of course, be fenced, but there is no reason why this cannot be held over until spring, if necessary. In any event, I am not very much in favour of fencing playgrounds with woven wire as it soon gets out of shape from the boys standing on it, &c. I think plain wire with a rail on top of the fence would be more suitable.\n\nWith reference to the milch cows and bull: No doubt this school requires additional cows as they only have seven at the present time, but if say five additional cows were supplied this fall, I think that would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the school at least until spring. The bull of course is not required until spring, and can be purchased at the Edmonton bull sale which is held about the 1st of April. The approximate cost of good milch cows would be between $50 and $60.\n\nTherefore,......\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTherefore, all that would be absolutely necessary to supply at the present time would be the Bob-sleigh and box at a cost of about $90 and five cows at an approximate cost of $300. I note that the Department state arrangements could be made with Chas. Gauvreau for supplying cows and farm implements, and they desire to know the cost of same: I am of the opinion that this man is not a dealer in any of the lines mentioned. The Bob-sleigh and box could be bought in the usual manner and delivered through an implement dealer at St. Paul, and Mr. Gullion, the Agent, is quite capable of purchasing the cows, from the farmers in that district. Of course if the Department wish to place the purchasing of these implements, &c., in the hands of Mr. Gauvreau, I will see that this is done.\n\nI might also refer to the granary which was mentioned in my recent report on this school: This is something that is required by the school this fall, if there is any means whatever of financing it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christiansen,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nSeptember 17, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nIt is necessary at the present time to purchase five cows and one set of bob sleighs, with box, for the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta. In April, 1931, you directed that, when cattle and farm machinery were being supplied, the purchase be made from Charles Gauvreau, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson, Calgary, Alta., states he is of opinion that this man is not a dealer in any of the lines mentioned. He recommends that Mr. Gullion, the local Agent, arrange for the purchase of the cows from farmers in that district and that the bob sleighs and box be bought in the usual manner and delivered through an implement dealer in St. Paul. I should be pleased to have your directions regarding the purchase of the above.\n\nIt will also be necessary next Spring to purchase a breaking plow, disc, drill and set of spring tooth harrows, also a bull and five cows. I shall be pleased to have your instructions regarding the above purchases.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 17, 1932.\n\nMR.

I shall be pleased to have your instructions regarding the above purchases.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, September 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, in connection with the agricultural implements, fencing and cattle for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta. It is noted that the only farm equipment required at the present time is one bob sleigh, with box, and I would request that you arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the list handling these supplies, and have same delivered at the school when considered timely. Please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the fencing of the playgrounds, as our funds this year are limited, this work can be held over until next Spring. This matter may be brought to the attention of the Department at that time and full details should be given regarding materials and cost.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of milch cows, I have to say that the Department is prepared at the present time to supply the school with five grade milch cows. It is considered that a good type of grade cows would be satisfactory. They should be young and giving milk, or to freshen early in the new year.\n\nYou may arrange with Mr. Agent Gullion, if you are assured he is a good judge of cattle, to make the purchase. He should give Mr. Charles Gauvreau, St. Paul, an opportunity to supply the cows, but if Mr. Gauvreau is unable to do so, the Agent may make the purchase locally. It would be advisable that he secure the aid of a Government Livestock Man, if one is in the district, in selecting the cows. All cows should be free from tuberculosis and should be of good milking strain. It is noted you are of opinion that the cost of good milch cows would be between $50 and $60 each. It is hoped that they can be obtained at a price not exceeding this figure.

MCGILL\n\nWith reference to memorandum (Mr. Williams') of September 17, 1932, re the purchase of five cows for the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta.\n\nThe Minister's instructions in this connection were - in part - \"Mr. Guayrath to be given an opportunity to supply cattle requirements.\" It is understood, however, that the purchase was made from Mr. A.S. Spence, of St. Paul.\n\nWill you please furnish the Minister with a report in this matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJanuary 10th, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI have to refer to your memorandum of the 9th January regarding the purchase of five cows for the Blue Quills Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. In our memorandum of September 17th referred to by you, direction was requested regarding the purchase of the cows by Mr. Gullion, the Indian agent, from farmers in the district, as Inspector Christianson had stated that Mr. Gauvreau was not a dealer in any of the lines mentioned. This action was approved by the Minister provided Mr. Gullion was considered to be a good judge of cattle and the suggestion was made that he secure the aid of a Government line stockman if one were in the district. It was further stated that Mr. Gauvreau should be given an opportunity to supply the cattle required.\n\nOn this ruling, Inspector Christianson was informed that if he considered agent Gullion a good judge of cattle, the agent might be authorized to make the purchase. He was to be instructed that Mr. Gauvreau should be given an opportunity to supply the cows but if he was unable to do so the agent might make the purchase locally. He was to be further instructed in regard to securing the services of a Government stockman in selecting the cows.\n\nAlthough no further correspondence took place, it is assumed that the agent acted on these instructions and being unable to secure the cattle from Mr. Gauvreau he made purchase from A. S. Pence. The voucher submitted for payment in this connection bears the following words: \"Authority: Inspector Christianson's letters No. 407-11A of Sept. 26th and Nov. 23rd, 1932.\"\n\nI trust this explanation is satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n**LOCAL PURCHASE\u2014ABSTRACT OF TENDERS**\n\n| ARTICLES          | FIRMS ASKED TO QUOTE | REMARKS |\n|-------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| John New Plan Co. |                      |         |\n| 2\" Bat.

It then developed that what the Principal wanted was a Grain Tank and not a Wagon Box. He also wanted a set of trees and yoke. Trees and yoke are not a part of a bob-sleigh, but rather than have a lot of fuss over nothing I had the wagon box changed for the Grain Tank, and the trees and yoke furnished.\n\nThe extra cost in this connection, over and above the Wagon Box is $30.95. Therefore a voucher is herewith attached for $70.35 and abstract for tenders is also attached for same, and another voucher attached for the extra $30.95.\n\nI hope this meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

In reply, I wish to submit the following report:\n\nIn Mr. Inspector Christianson's letter No. 407-11A of the 26th September, 1932, I received instructions in part as follows: \"As to the purchase of additional milk cows, you are hereby authorized to purchase five grade milk cows for the school of a good milk type. You should see the Principal and ascertain from him what would be the most suitable time for the cows to freshen. When the Department wrote to me in this connection I advised them that the cows could be purchased at a price of from $50. to $60. and this amount should not be exceeded. I think we should get exceptionally good cows for even $50. You are aware of the market price at the present time, and I would consider that real good cows can be bought for this amount. In making the purchase you are to give Mr. O'Meara an opportunity to supply the five cows that are required, but if he is unable to do so, you may purchase them locally wherever you can find suitable ones.\n\nThe cows were also to be T.B. tested. On the 13th October, I interviewed Mr. O'Meara in regard to supplying the five cows required. I advised him as to the kind and type of cows required and also informed him that he should endeavor to see the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's school before getting any cows. In my report for the month of October, I mentioned that the cows had not yet been delivered. By letter dated November 23rd, 1932,\n\nHarold W. McGill Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Inspector Christianson advised me that the matter had already been too long delayed and instructed me to get in touch with the Principal immediately and buy five cows that were suitable to him. I received Mr. Christianson's letter on the 29th November and on the following day, I called at the school and the cows was one of the subjects discussed with Rev. Father Anzin. He informed me that he wished to have at least two cows fresh, the others to freshen before Spring. I was in St. Paul but did not see Mr. Guivray on that date. I however met Mr. Walter Allen from North of St. Paul and he mentioned that Mr. Guivray had told him that a number of cows were needed for the school. I advised Mr. Allen that I would look over his cattle as soon as possible. The day following, December 1st, I drove out to Mr. Allen's and looked over his herd. While some of his cattle were fairly smooth, they were not of the larger type and with the exception of one very poor heifer, none of the cows that I looked over had freshened. He had three heifers, I believe raising three years, that I considered the most promising. His cows, I understand, were not freshening until Spring. I advised Mr. Allen that five cows were required for the school and that I wished to get cows that Mr. Guivray suitable to the Principal. I also told Mr. Allen that I could advise the Principal in regard to his (Mr. Allen's) cattle and that if the Principal considered that they might be suitable, he might drive over and look at them. The Principal, however, did not want any untried milk cows or any that were not going to freshen during the Winter.\n\nAs Mr. Guivray was apparently making no further efforts to secure the cows, I did not again approach him in connection with the matter and proceeded to carry out Mr. Christianson's instructions. On making enquiries in St. Paul, I was advised by Mr. H.A. Welsh and others to get in touch with Mr. A.S. Spence, whom it was considered was the most familiar with the stock in the district. On the 3rd December, I got in touch with Mr. Spence and advised him of the kind and type of cows required. The cows were accordingly delivered at the school on the 16th December. I called at the school with Mr. Spence on Saturday the 17th and checked up on the animals with him. The cows supplied were large and of a very good type. One cow had just freshened, one was to freshen at once and another one within ten days, the other two being due to come in a little later. The Reverend Principal informed me that he was very well satisfied with the cows. The cows were purchased with the understanding that they would pass the T.B. test and Mr. Spence is having them tested. Taking the time...\ntime spent in looking for suitable cows, trucking, etc., into consideration, I was of the opinion that for the type supplied, the cows were reasonably priced.\n\nIt was represented to the Department that the cows were purchased at an amount which was $75.00 more than the price quoted by Mr. Allen. The cows furnished were of course worth the difference or I should not have made the purchase. There were cattle in the district that could have been bought at prices even lower than Mr. Allen's but there is the difference between suitable and unsuitable animals to be taken into consideration.\n\nI fail to see any reason why Mr. Gauvreau should feel aggrieved as he was given an opportunity and I think plenty of time, to procure the cows. In this connection, I might mention that when in St. Paul on the 26th January last, Mr. A.J. Lebel asked me to call at his office. I did so and he then brought up the matter of the cows stating that Mr. Gauvreau had requested him to write Ottawa and ask for an investigation in the matter of the purchase. Mr. Lebel thought that it might be advisable to see Mr. Gauvreau and Mr. Allen regarding this but after considering the matter, I came to the conclusion that it would be very poor policy to go about explaining my action in a matter in which I considered I was right and in accordance with instructions from my superior officer. In discussing this with Mr. Lebel, I explained the situation and he was apparently satisfied. There was absolutely nothing for which I considered I should place myself on the defensive and I felt that I had no occasion to adopt that attitude.\n\nI have gone into this at some length in an endeavor to make the situation clear and in conclusion, would say that I regret very much any annoyance the purchase of the cows may have caused.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nW.E. Sullivan\nIndian Agent.\nApril 20, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buckard,\n\nI wish to refer to your memorandum of the 14th ultimo, regarding the purchase of five cows by Mr. E. Gullion, Indian Agent, Redville Lake, Alberta. From Mr. A. S. Spence, for the Blue Quill Indian Residential School, without the application of the T.B. test to the animals and at $75 over the quotation of Mr. Walter Allen of St. Paul. A report regarding the purchase has been received from Mr. Gullion, from which I quote as follows:\n\n\"I received instructions from Mr. Inspector Christianson to arrange for the purchase of five grade milk cows of a good milk type and to give Mr. Gouvreau an opportunity to supply the cows but that, if he was unable to do so, to purchase them locally wherever suitable ones could be obtained - the cows to be T.B. tested. On October 13th I interviewed Mr. Gouvreau, advising him of the type of cows required. On the 25th of November, Mr. Gouvreau was apparently making no effort to secure the cows. I did not again approach him in connection with the matter. I met Mr. Walter Allen and inspected his herd. While some of his cattle were fairly smooth, they were not of the larger type and, with the exception of one very poor cow, none of the cows had freshened. He had three heifers rising three years, which I considered the most promising. I advised him then that five cows were required for the school that would prove suitable to the Principal. The Principal did not want any untried milk cows or any that were not going to freshen during the winter. On making enquiries, I was advised to get in touch with Mr. A. S. Spence, who, it was considered, was most familiar with the stock in the district. I got in touch with Mr. Spence, advising him of the kind and type required and the cows were delivered at the school on the 16th of December. I called at the school and checked up the animals with him. The cows supplied were large and of a very good type. One cow had just freshened and one was to freshen at once and another within 10 days, the other two within a few weeks in a little later. The Principal informed me he was well satisfied.

There were cattle in the district that could have been bought at prices even lower than Mr. Allen's, but there is the difference between suitable and unsuitable animals to be taken into consideration.\"\n\nIn concluding his letter, Mr. Gullion states:\n\n\"I fail to see any reason why Mr. Gauvreau should feel aggrieved as he was given an opportunity and I think, plenty of time, to procure the cows. In this connection, I might mention that when in St. Paul on the 26th January, last, Mr. J. U. Lebel asked me to call at his office. I did so and he then brought up the matter of the cows, stating that Mr. Gauvreau had refused like to write others and ask for an investigation in the matter of the purchase. Mr. Lebel thought that it might be advisable to see Mr. Gauvreau and Mr. Allen regarding this, but, after considering the matter, I came to the conclusion that it would be very poor policy to go about explaining my action in a matter in which I considered I was right and in accordance with instructions. After considerable discussion and discussing this with Mr. Lebel, I explained the situation and he was apparently satisfied. There was absolutely nothing for which I considered I should place myself on the defensive and I felt that I had no occasion to adopt that attitude.\"\n\nI may add that Mr. Spence, from whom the cattle were purchased, has been paid at the rate of $60 each for two cows and $55 each for three cows - a total of $255.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\nCALGARY, ALTA., April 29th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that last year the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School in the Saddle Lake Agency was asking for certain equipment in the way of machinery, horses, &c.\n\nI have had a letter from him recently stating that he is urgently in need of the equipment for spring work.

Will you please advise me whether the Minister wishes the purchases to be made directly from this office, or whether they should be made through the Inspectors or the Indian Agents themselves. The practice has been to instruct the Inspectors to do the purchasing, and continuance of this method would be the quicker. I shall be glad if you will let me know as soon as possible.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, May 13th., 1933.\nCOPY\n\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nMarch 5th, 1934.\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nIn my estimate to the Department last year I asked for 6 work horses and 2 double harnesses that we may prepare our land for the seeding. These horses and harnesses will be absolutely needed soon next spring, and I would be satisfied if you could ask the Department that horses and harnesses be supplied to the school during April.\n\nWe have 130 acres to seed this year, but out of these 130 acres 100 have to be ploughed very carefully, as it will be the first ploughing since the land was broken. Just now I have only 6 horses for this work and it is completely insufficient. I hope that you will obtain from the Department horses and harnesses. I suppose that now you enjoy a very good health.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"JOS. ANGIN O. M. I.\"\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., March 12th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to herewith forward copy of a letter which I have just received from the Rev. Father Angin, Principal of Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. You will note that the Reverend Father is asking the Department to take immediate action to purchase the six work horses and two sets of harness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 407-11A of the 12th instant, enclosing letter from the Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in which he requests the Department to purchase six work horses and two sets of harness.\n\nPlease let me have a definite recommendation with regard to the necessity of supplying the horses and harness requested by the Principal.\n\nIn the event of your recommending the purchase, please give an estimate of the cost of the horses and state where they can be secured. On receipt of this information, the Department will be in a position to decide if funds can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department's letter No. 115-1-14 of the 18th instant in connection with the 6 horses and 2 sets of harness asked for by the Principal of Blue Quills Indian Residential School in the Saddle Lake Agency. In reply would state that to carry out the programme of the school re farming operations, the Principal actually requires the six horses and two sets of harness. I find that horses up in that country are worth about $90.00 each. They can be purchased from farmers in the vicinity as no doubt most good farmers would be glad to sell a team of horses as cash is very scarce around St. Paul at the present time. I think it would be safe, if the horses were authorized, to let Mr. Gullion buy them, as I noticed the last time I was around with him that he was a fairly good judge of live stock. I would not have the time to go up there just now. The roads are impassible and I am very busy.\n\nThe harness could be purchased from the Great West Saddlery Company here and shipped from their Edmonton branch. Good harness can be bought for about $35.00 per set.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

It is noted, from your letter, that the horses can be secured at a cost not exceeding $80 each.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of two sets of harness from the Great West Saddlery Company, at a cost of $85.00 a set.\n\nEnclosed is E. R. No. 2017 as your authority for the purchase of the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that a voucher is going forward today for the 6 horses purchased for Blue Quills school, also for the harness. The Principal advised me that he has received the horses and harness and wishes me to extend his thanks to the Department for furnishing him with this outfit. The horses are very fit being all young horses weighing from 1400 to 1500 pounds and before taking them over, I advised the Agent to be sure that the Principal was satisfied with the purchase, which he did. You will note that a saving of $15.00 has been made on the six horses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The only policy which would be open to you is the supervised herd plan and, if you desire to take advantage of this plan, it will be necessary for you to have the party responsible for the herd fill in and sign the enclosed agreement forms and return one of them to this office. The duplicate copy should be retained by the party signing the agreement.\n\nI would point out that no compensation is paid for any cattle which react to a test conducted under the supervised herd plan, but the Institution will receive whatever proceeds there may be from any carcasses which are passed as fit for human consumption. No charge is made for the services of our inspectors, but everything possible is done to eradicate tuberculosis from the herd and to maintain it free from this disease.\nR. A.

I am also pleased to report that the management of the school agreed to have their School herd of milk cows T.B. Tested.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\n\n2nd June 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris, (Wherever you may be)\n\nHave been thinking about you all week the weather if anything here has been worse than last week, so we had some luck with the weather anyhow.\n\nI quote from my monthly report as follows:\n\n\"A very enjoyable and instructive visit was received from Mr. J.E. Morris from May 15th to May 26th, having an official visit to the Agency, and go over the ground with you is like a refresher course, while we had bad weather which threw some of plans out of gear, I think Mr. Morris saw a very good cross section of the Agency. I thoroughly enjoyed his visit and help and information I received from him, and I can also say this for the rest of the staff. I only hope he may be able to visit this Agency again, and that other officials may also come. I hope I have success with some of his projects he is anxious to start and I think I see some action in the making already.\"\n\nAnd I do mean just that Mr. Morris.\n\nI visited the Blue Quill's School last Wednesday night and Father Letour is ready to go on some goats. Please advise me how to procure same and thru what channels. His brother from Duck Lake was there and he is having good luck with goats so Father Principal at Blue Quill's would like to get started and I think it is an ideal place to start. I regret I did not ask you for instructions how to procure goats when you visited here. Not only goats I have thoughts of endless questions I could have discussed with you that I passed up.\n\nTrust the weather is better with you and that your trip is going O.K. Best of Luck.\n\nWith kindest regards from Mrs. Pugh & self.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Hoey it is considered that this may be an opportunity to get goats started in the Saddle Lake Agency. If a male goat is being sent to Father Forcade from Spanish another one could be shipped to the Blue Quill's school at the same time.\n\nLeask, Sask. June 15th.\n\nDear Mr Pugh,\n\nRe.-Goats for Blue Quill's School\n\nYour very welcome letter of June 2nd. finally caught up to me. I discussed the purchase of goats with Indian Agent Ostrander of Battleford and he is going to obtain six or seven female grade goats in that district. In fact while I was there we bought two milking mannies. He feels certain that others can be secured. You are requested to communicate with him and give him shipping instructions. Mr Ostrander suggested that the goats be delivered to a railway point immediately south of your location and have the school truck pick them up rather than send them all the way to Edmonton and then back out to St Paul. Note the shortest and quickest route should be arranged as the mannies are milking.\n\nPlease discuss with Father Letour the purchase and care of these goats and advise him that the Department is supplying them on the understanding that the senior girls and boys will be given instructions on their care. It should also be understood that an equal number of females will be given to some responsible Indians as the herd increases.\n\nRegarding a male goat for this herd I am suggesting that a Pure Breed Saanen be sent from the Spanish Herd. It is thought this could be arranged as we are shipping one from this herd to Father Forcade at Grouard, Sask. If it impossible to ship a male from Ontario you will be advised by Ottawa.\n\nJ. E.

MORRIS'S REPORT ON THE DUCK LAKE AGENCY -\n\nBEARDY'S RESERVE\n\nThe goats at this school are doing very nicely. They are milked regularly and the milk is used in the school. The Sister in charge of the dairy has successfully made butter from the milk and a sample and instructions are being sent to Ottawa for inspection. Father Latour has distributed ten (10) young female goats to Indians on the Beardy's Reserve. He visits this Reserve regularly and will give the goats constant supervision.\n\nNote: Father Latour requested that, if possible, a pure bred Saanen male be sent to him from Spanish. Mr. Roberts - kindly endeavour to obtain one for the Duck Lake School. Note: The understanding with Father Primeau is that all male goats of the Saanen herd at Spanish will be made available for our service at a cost of $80.00 each, crated f.o.b. Spanish. I have already asked that a Saanen male be sent to the Grouard and Blue Quills Schools. When these shipments are being made another one could be included for Duck Lake.\n\nJ. E. Morris,\nWelfare Division\nOttawa, July 8th, 1944.\n\nG. P. Schmidt, Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, ALTA.\n\nRequests have recently been received for Pure Breed Male Guanaco Goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills Schools, and I would appreciate hearing from you regarding the possibility of obtaining two suitable animals somewhere in B.C.\n\nR. A. Ross,\nSupt. Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1944.\n\nH. F. Ruddy, Esq., Indian Agent, Golden Lake, Ontario.\n\nRequests have been received from a few of the Agencies in Saskatchewan and Alberta for Male Shaver Goats, and I would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you will have any animals this year which would be suitable for shipment.\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSys. Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nThe remarks in your Duck Lake report regarding sale goats for the Duck Lake and Blue Quills schools have been noted, but we are advised there are no sale goats available at Spanish this year; in fact, it appears the goats there were not bred this year due to Brother Crab being short of help and unable to devote sufficient time to the goats. However, we have written Mr. Ruddy at Golden Lake, requesting that none of the male goats there be castrated until it is known definitely whether or not some of these may be required for the above schools or any other locations in the West. Would you drop me a line regarding your views as to whether or not the Golden Lake goats would be satisfactory.\n\nI have also written Inspector Schmidt asking him to make enquiries in British Columbia with a view to obtaining pure breed males for Duck Lake and Blue Quills. I might also state that Mr. Schmidt was instructed some time ago to purchase a sale Sennan in British Columbia for Grouard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSup't of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. E. Morris,\nc/o C. H. Simpson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBALGARIE,\nSaskatchewan.\nThe Pas, June 27th.\n\nDear Mr. Rose:\n\nRegarding the sending of male goats to the Grouard, Blue Quill and Duck Lake schools as recommended in my reports I wish to make it clear that I never intended that young goats be sent. I do feel that good animals six months old could be sent without any difficulty. These three schools are very interested in the raising of goats to be distributed to needy T.B. Indians and we will have to encourage the project by helping to obtain breeding stock.\n\nI investigated the possibility of obtaining Sasman male goats at Edmonton, Calgary and at any other place where I thought goats could be obtained. This question was very thoroughly discussed with Inspector Schmidt and all the agents I have visited today and in every case they state that there are no good breeding goats to be had. Mr. Schmidt stated regarding the purchase of goats in British Columbia that there are only a limited number available at a very high price and that in his opinion there has been a great deal of inbreeding already. He was of the opinion that if goats are to make a success of in the Agencies in the West good breeding stock will have to come from Ontario.\n\nI would therefore suggest that Father Prinsen be asked to hold a number of good male goats until I return to Ottawa. I will provide him with shipping instructions so that the animals can be shipped, stopping over at certain points where the Farm Instructors can feed water and exercise them, so that they will reach their destination without hardship.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgt) J. E. Morris.\nBattleford, Sask.,\nJuly 17th, 1944.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRecently I transferred one milch goat from the Red Pheasant Indian Day School to the Blue Quill Indian Residential School, Saddle Lake Agency, as on account of the teacher leaving we had no responsible party to take charge of goat. At a later date it may be advisable to purchase a goat for Red Pheasant School.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n528 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJuly 20th, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe: 109-1-14 - Purchase of Goats for Duck Lake and Blue Quills Schools.\n\nAcknowledging your letter of July 10th, I would recommend that young male goats be retained at Golden Lake for delivery to the above-mentioned schools some time this fall.\n\nIt is regretted that the pure bred herd at Spanish was not bred last year. If Brother Grubb is unable to devote sufficient time to look after this herd of goats it might be well to consider moving them to some other place. I might inform you that many of the Agents are very interested in the securing of goats to supply milk to Indians, and as there are very few pure bred herds in the West it will most likely be necessary to obtain goats in Ontario. It is therefore important that the herd at Spanish be bred this year and goats available for delivery next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.E. Morris.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nREPORT ON SADDLE LAKE INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1944.\n\nBlue Quill's School;\nVisited on June 10th. During the month Father LeTour received six goats, to be used in connection with schoolwork.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. P. G. Lasenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, MANITOBA.\n\nRE: GOATS.\n\nYou are authorized to buy sixteen female goats at fourteen dollars each ($14.00) and six male goats at ten dollars ($10.00) each from the Rev. Mr. Jones; payment to be made out of the Welfare Vote. You are also authorized to purchase two female goats and one male goat from Father Rivard at twenty-five dollars for the three animals.\n\nThis herd is to be established at Norway House; the milk to be used for tubercular patients and the children of families who are unable to provide milk.\n\nThere has been considerable inbreeding in this herd; therefore, you are requested to separate the males at the earliest possible date. Probably you can arrange to pasture them on another island until they are distributed. The male goat purchased from Father Rivard should be used with this herd.\n\nOne male goat has already been sent to Island Lake. The others should be disposed of as follows:\n\nOne to Father Trudell to establish a herd at Cross Lake.\n\nOne to Indian Agent Lovell at The Pas.\n\n(Note: It is suggested that this goat be sent there by aeroplane when Dr. Rule next visits Norway House.)\n\nTwo good billies should be selected -\n\nOne to be sent to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nOne to the Blue Quill School in Alberta.\n\nIt is suggested that you write to Father Georges Letour, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, and Father L.C. Letour, St. Paul, Alberta, asking them to provide you with the proper shipping instructions.\n\n- Over -\nNOTE: I understand they will not bring goats out on the \"Keansors\" until after the tourist season is over; therefore these two goats most likely will be shipped the later part of September or the first of October. In my opinion, it might be wise to send these goats via Prince Albert; the one for Duck Lake could be transported from there by truck, the one for the Blue Quill School could be placed off at a station on the main line to Edmonton. If this is done the goats will be delivered in the shortest possible time.\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris.\nWelfare and Training Division.\nOttawa, August 23, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nFurther to my letter of July 10th, regarding the shortage of male goats at Spanish, a letter has now been received from Father Prinsen in which he states they expect to have more kids than was originally anticipated.\n\nI quote hereunder from Father Prinsen's letter:\n\n\"Following up your letter of March 30th (File 54-15) in reply to my letter of the 8th to Mr. Morris, I am pleased to say that we expect to have more kids than we thought there would be at that time. There are already five that have arrived, four billies and one nanny. There will be a good number of others I hope, as some of the nannies were bred than Brother Crab had thought. I shall let you know later this month as to the number of kids we expect to be able to provide this season.\"\n\nIn passing this information on as it has just occurred to me you may wish to alter the instructions you recently gave to Mr. Lesschey regarding the shipping of billies to Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

The Father's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"I beg to advise you that the animal shipped by you arrived in St. Paul, by train, on Friday evening, July 26th and was taken to the school immediately. To my surprise, I found that it was a female goat instead of a male goat. Would you kindly let me know about the mistake.\"\n\nThe Goat that arrived here was a Nanny and was kept at the school for nearly a week. There could be no mistake made here as there are no other goats at the Portage School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nDear Father Oliver,\n\nHaving reference to the goat which was recently shipped from the Spanish River Indian Residential School to the Blue Quills School in Alberta, we have been advised as follows:\n\n\"I beg to advise you that the animal shipped by you arrived in St. Paul, by train, on Friday evening, July 26th and was taken to the school immediately.

Consequently, we would request that you ascertain definitely that the animal shipped is a male.\n\nBernard F.

This was indeed unfortunate. However, arrangements are being made for the shipment of another animal from our Golden Lake herd, in Ontario, and Mr. Indian Agent Ruddy, at Golden Lake, has been instructed to advise Father Huston well in advance of shipment in order that someone may be on hand to take delivery of the goat upon its arrival.\n\nAfter the goat has had an adequate rest period please request Father Huston to have it reshipped to:\n\nRev.

Morris, Welfare Division, has been referred to me for a reply. The Branch is very sorry that a female goat was shipped to you instead of a male goat. Arrangements have now been made with the Indian Agent at Golden Lake, Ontario, to ship you a male Saanen goat and he should arrive in due course.\n\nIt will be in order to incorporate the female goat received into your herd, if you can use her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\nAugust 12, 1946.\n\nMr. J.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received from Portage la Prairie, on July 26th, the animal that had been shipped to the School, but to my surprise, I found that it was a female goat instead of a male goat. I immediately wrote to Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, on the next day, advising him about the mistake, but I have received no answer yet.\n\nAs I would need a male goat for this fall, I am writing to you in order that you may be able to secure me one before it is too late.\n\nI am also awaiting instructions concerning the female goat now at school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. L.C. Latour, C.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 9th current and regret that such a notable mistake was made by the young brother having charge of the goats. To assure you that the same mistake would be avoided by more personal supervision of the matter next time would be superfluous since the goat problem for us no longer, happily, exists.\n\nMay I have directions as to how we proceed in the matter of collecting for the goats which were sent by us to Golden Lake? Should we require a receipt from Indian agent Ruddy as to the number of goats received from us and then work on the price offered by the Department?\n\nIf it is not too late may we offer you all good wishes of success in this work, and invite you to visit us whenever the occasion may offer?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.)

Neary has been referred to me for reply.\n\nIt will be in order to forward us an account covering reimbursement for twenty-five goats shipped to Mr. H. P. Ruddy, Indian Agent at Golden Lake. It is noted that this flock was made up of thirteen nannies, four one-year-old billies, and eight four-months' old billies. The latter were later castrated and will be issued as 'goat meat' to the Indians during the coming winter. This information is passed on to you because we feel that we should not be called upon to pay full price for a four-months' old buck which is going to be turned into ration meat.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

I presume this is the way to do it, since I did not see how we could bill the Welfare Department directly.\n\nSince the young billies are destined for ration meat and since as you say the full price should not naturally be charged, what do you say to one quarter the price of the ordinary goats? If this is not suitable then the bill may be changed and suit your requirements. I presume that since the mistake was made regarding the goat for Blue Quills we have not the right to charge for it and will not put it on the bill. Hoping that all this is satisfactory,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev) J.R.Oliver, S.J.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. G. Armstrong\nWelfare Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alberta,\nJune 27, 1950.\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nThis will advise that I have been approached with a request for assistance towards an improvement of a dairy herd at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. The dairy herd at this school is not an asset in this line as they are more of a beef variety. The Reverend Principal is prepared to sell the milking class in this herd with a view of obtaining ten or twelve head of good milk stock. The proceeds for the sale of this stock will by no means cover the cost of the good milk strain required and the request was therefore being made to assist in covering the balance required.\n\nIt is felt that approximately $3000.00 will be required to make the total purchase. Of this, $1,000.00 will be covered from the sale of the present stock and the Reverend Principal is prepared to put up $1,000.00, which leaves a balance of $1,000.00. I advised Father Hollande, principal of the school, that I was not aware of this information but felt if any assistance was granted that it would have to be covered in estimates.\n\nMay I please be advised what action should be taken in this regards. It is my opinion that a better class of dairy cattle would be obtained with the least possible delay and any information or assistance will be greatly appreciated. There is a dairy breeders meeting being held in St. Paul on July 15, 1950 and an answer to this letter by that time would give us fact on which to make further inquiries.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\n\nWKT/pdh\nJune 30th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nRe: Blue Quills Residential School\nYour File 118-6-7\n\nWe have your letter of the 27th instant with reference to the request received from the Principal of the above school for an amount of $1,000.00 to assist him in buying cattle.\n\nIt is not the general policy of the Department to provide cattle at a residential school except when the school is first opened. When the Blue Quills Residential School was opened in 1932, a number of milking cows were purchased by the Department.\n\nIn view of our present policy, I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to the Principal's request.\n\nBernard F.
