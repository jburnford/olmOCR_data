General\nof Indian Affairs.\nPrince Rupert B.C.\nMar 1, 1910.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter No. 343016, dated Feb 8th, in which you say that the Department will be glad to hear from me in regard to several matters relating to Indian Schools.\n\nWill you allow me to say first of all that the Government's long delay in giving a decided answer to the Indians in regard to the land question is having a most disastrous effect upon our educational and religious work among the Indians. Our Church of England missionaries in this Diocese of Caledonia (Northern B.C.) have steadily counselled the Indians to be law abiding. In consequence of this the Indians say that we are servants of the Government trying to get their land from them. Our Indians have been stirred up by agitators. They have been asked to raise a large sum of money to carry their case to the Privy Council. Money is being freely given for this purpose. Our Missionaries held aloof from this telling the Indians that if they will only wait patiently the Dominion Government will see that they are treated fairly. Not very long ago Indian delegates from all parts assembled at Vancouver to arrange to carry their claims to England. I think the Department should inquire who presided at this meeting. I am informed that it was an official of the Indian Department. Since then the attitude of our Indians towards our missionaries is more marked. Our missionaries are loyal to those in authority while at the same time telling the Indians what will be best for them in the end.\n\nTo give a specific example of what I mean:\n\nOur Nassett Indians were not in the least agitated about the land question, they were quite contented in mind until they received a letter from Rev. Mr. Tait a Methodist missionary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nmissionary more than 500 miles away. He and the Rev. A. E. Green seem to be the chief movers in this matter. Rev. A. E. O'Meara, Church of England, does not belong to this diocese, and has no authority from me. No doubt some of our missionaries think that the question of the Indian Title should be authoritatively settled but as a body we hold that the Indians being wards of the Dominion Government, this Government should have the question settled without this most unwise stirring up of the Indian mind. This is by way of introduction to what I have to report.\n\n1. With great difficulty and at much expense I secured a male teacher for Gitladamiks, the uppermost Indian village on the Nass river. Mr. R. J. George, has an expert knowledge of gardening and farming & has an earnest desire to show the Indians of this village how to cultivate their rich lands. Accompanied by Archdeacon Collison, who knows the language so well, I took him up the river last summer and introduced him assuring the people that he was not after their land, but only wished to teach them and do them good. They received him most kindly until the delegate from this land conference returned returned from Vancouver. Now Mr. George writes me as follows-\n\n\"At a Council meeting at Gitladamiks to consider the matter of setting apart a piece of land for the Mission house they were so undecided that they came to no decision. I enquired the cause and was told that they considered me the thin edge of the wedge. The summed up the situation thus. The Bishop the Archdeacon, Mr. McCullagh and myself are the servants of the Government and are seeking to deprive them of their land. Seeing that I am regarded as a traitor by them I have concluded after prayerful consideration that the only thing for me to do is to leave the river\".\n\nMr. A. F. Seath, our school teacher at Lakkalzap on the same river, writes by the same mail in much the same strain. I shall endeavour to persuade these men to hold on, but you will see how this land agitation is upsetting all our work. The feeling up the Skeena has been intense but is a little\nnew. Our Missionaries urged the Indians to wait patiently till the Commissioner came from Ottawa. He came but only to repeat the same message which had so often been given before.\n\n\"I will report to Ottawa all you have to say.\" The Indians have great respect for authority. All that is needed is a decided answer.\n\n2. In regard to Nassett a new industry has developed at North Island, a Fishing Company is erecting a station there with a steamer carrying fish to Prince Rupert. In consequence of this large numbers of the Nassett people have gone from the village. What Rev. Mr. Hogan recommends is that Miss Benshaw should continue teaching the little ones at Nassett and that Mr. Sherwood should follow the bigger children to North Island and teach school there.\n\nIf the Department will make a grant of rough lumber 3,000 ft at $17.50 per thousand with shingles &c the natives will put a building up 30 x 20 with a \"lean to\" at back for teacher to live in.\n\nI wrote about this to the Indians Agent, Queen Charlotte Islands, but as Mr. Perry was leaving about that time the letter may be waiting for the new agent, whoever he may be, to arrive. I hope the department will make this small grant. It will be seen from this that owing to this new move on the part of so many of the people the question of tents must be deferred for another year. This will show the Department what we have to contend with in trying to carry out any plan.\n\n3. I asked Mr. Fuller the carpenter to whom I referred in my previous letter if he would undertake the work of teaching the Indian young men & older boys carpentry but he sees too good an opportunity for work in Prince Rupert to accept such a position. I think that this is a matter that the Indian Agent should take in hand.\n\nLet me say in closing that I fully appreciate the difficulty in connection with the Indian Title and the dispute between the two Governments but there is no denying the fact\nthat our whole Indian work is suffering because of the lack of a decisive answer from those who represent \"The King\"\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) F. H. Du Vernet\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nSir:-\n\nReferring to my letter of the 1st ultimo, No533 Q5, on the subject of the appointment of a teacher for the Lachkalsap Indian School and the erection of a suitable building, etc., I have the honour to forward herewith for the further information of the Department a letter dated 1st instant from Mr School Inspector Green on the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. Vowell.\n\nSupt.of Indian Affairs. B.C.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nB.C. Inspectorate\n1076 Fender Street Vancouver, B.C.\nOct. 1st, 1909.\n\nSir:-\n\n(Lach-kalsap, Naas River.)\n\nI saw Mr Albert Smeath (a single man forty six years of age), who was alone in the Village, awaiting the return of the Indians. He had been sent by his Lordship Bishop DuVernet, as missionary and teacher to the Indians. He has never taught school before. In reference to the request of the Bishop for a grant of $500.00 per annum for Mr Smeath, at the present time I am not in a position to recommend such a grant, as he had not yet opened the school, and is without experience. After he has been in the work some time, it will be seen whether he is qualified or not.\n\nThis school can only be kept open for six months of the year as the Indians move to Fishery Bay early in March to fish the oolichans, returning in May for three weeks or so to make gardens and in June go to the salmon canneries till the end of September.\n\nI would recommend that the grant be at the rate of $400.00 per annum for balance of year ending March 31st 1910, and if Mr Smeath proves to be a successful teacher, the grant be $500.00 per annum, commencing April 1st 1910.\n\nA. E. Green,\nInspector.\nOttawa, September 30, 1869.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst., inclosing a communication from Mr. Agent Lorenz, covering one from His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia, in which he advises that officer that he has secured the services of Mr. Albert Edward Smeath, formerly of the Church of England Industrial Mission, as teacher of the Lacalasp Indian day school and asks that a salary of $500.00 per annum be paid him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not at present prepared to make a grant of $500.00 for the teacher's salary at this point. It has, however, as you are aware increased the salaries of a number of the day schools in British Columbia to $400.00 per annum, and it will be prepared to pay at this rate for Lacalasp.\n\nThe question of providing a new school building cannot be dealt with at present, but the Department trusts that next year's appropriation will enable it erect a suitable school-house. In the meantime the Department\n\nA. W. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B.C.\nwould be pleased to receive from the Agent and His Lordship Bishop Du Vernet suggestions as to the style of building best adapted to the locality, as well as the probable cost of material and labour.\n\nIn future the Department would be glad if you would when forwarding similar applications give full information on these points and deal with only one school in each letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nIndian Office, Victoria, B.C.\n\nSeptember 1st., 1909.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th inst., regarding the urgent need that exists for the erection of a new Indian Day-school building at Lak-kalsap, Nass River, North West Coast Agency, B.C., I have the honor to enclose herewith for the information of the Department a further letter on the subject, of the 26th inst., yesterday received from Mr. Agent Lorenz with a communication of the 17th inst., addressed to him by the Rev. F.H. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, stating that he has secured the services of Mr. Albert Edward Sneath, formerly of the Church of England Industrial Mission, as teacher for Lak-kalsap School, and asking the Department for a grant in the sum of $500 per annum as salary for this teacher, and adding that the Church of England is making up the balance of the teacher's salary. From what his Lordship states, as well as the remark made by the Indian Agent and the School Inspector, it is evident that the building is in a dilapidated condition generally, and should be replaced for health and safety's sake, as well as for the convenience of the pupils and teacher as soon as the Department has funds for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose you herewith a copy, in duplicate, of a letter dated Prince Rupert the 17th instant from the Rt.Rev.M. Du Vernet, Bishop of Caledonia, addressed to me, in which he asks the Department definitely for the sum of $500 a year as salary for the teacher at Lachkalsap, the said letter also deals regarding the condition of the Lachkalsap school building.\n\nConcerning the Lachkalsap day school building I beg to refer you to my letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting on the dilapidated condition of the building, and that I will ascertain, after the Indians return from the salmon fishing, whether they will do the work if the Department furnishes the material for a new school building.\n\nI beg to request you to forward the Bishop's application to the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.W.

Lorenz, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have secured Mr. Albert Edward Smeath, formerly of the Church of England Industrial Mission, as teacher for Lakkalzap. He left here on the \"Amur\" this evening for the Naas.\n\nI wish to point out that I have secured a male teacher as it would be impossible for a white woman to live alone at Lakkalzap and I ask the Department definitely for the sum of $500. a year as salary for this teacher, the Church having to make up the balance, as no man would go there for only $500. The Church has already had to pay him $75. towards travelling expenses. After the assurance from Ottawa quoted in my last letter to you I am justified in expecting the Department to further my efforts to improve the Day Schools.\n\nSomething must be done quickly about the school building at Lakkalzap. It was definitely promised two or three years ago, it is scarcely fit to use in its present condition. The roof leaks. There are openings in the walls. There are no proper desks. It is a disgrace to the Department. I inspected it last June and reported to you soon after. Please see if something cannot be done. The Church has helped in securing a new Sawmill for the village bearing more than half the cost. We are looking forward to seeing many new buildings, sidewalks etc. in the village and the school-house should certainly not be forgotten.\n\nMay I ask you to forward this application to Ottawa.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Signed) F.H. du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia.\nBritish Columbia\n\nIndian Office\nVictoria Aug. 14th 1897\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith the reports of the Sek Holap Indian day school for the quarters ending Dec. 31st 1896, March 31st 1897 and June 30th 1897, together with statements in duplicate for teacher's salary amounting to $225.00 for the terms mentioned.\n\nThe address to which the cheque in payment is to be sent is given on the requisition.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Superintendent\n\nThe Deputy Sect.

Timothy Derrick is from England, Anna the wife, Peter Cogdon, William Fox, John, etc., are from Lake Kelso and Minden. These men are very civil and polite whenever I appear on the scene, but from time to time very discouraging and bad reports are received at this office, and I am led personally over anxious to take these people into account, certain information of a serious nature is held before me.\n\nYou will learn from the personal of the letter that the School at Lake Kelso was closed during the last quarter because the missionary...\nfollowed him persistently without any obstruction from him, when he intended to take up teaching, but was prevented from doing so by the opposition of a few agitators who influenced the people against him.\n\nThe Indian land title question appears to be impossible for the attitude. It will be a good thing to have that important issue decided once and for all.\n\nOnly a fortnight since the time when both the Indians and the settlers thought \"the Swan River flows down, but up\" and had the Queen been intimidated, the situation would have been worse. As it happened, however, these people were familiar with the character of the Indians and laughed it off.\n\nI think that, in many cases, the Indians try to bluff while others do not know them, but these particular Indians have a bad reputation.\n\nI would recommend that Dr. Stone receive some compensation for his efforts at least to maintain a school, even though the school...\nwas not actually done.\n\nI have personally cautioned the offender in this case.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nAlexandria, June 15th, 1911\n\nDear Mr. Perry,\n\nThe Bishop has written me that you think of appointing me a J.P. for Lake Macdonald, and while I do not consider the honor in a general way (as I was a J.P. in Saskatchewan and found that having to give judicial decisions rather than my practice as a physician) still, here in this position amongst these Indians I think it would be a decided advantage and serve to protect me against the plottings of their agitators. The only thing I should suggest is, that I be appointed for the province generally, so that I am empowered to deal with such cases wherever I may be stationed.\n\nEverything has gone along more peacefully since I have been here, until Timothy Derrick appeared on the scene a few days ago. Then the first thing was, he called at this house and informed me that I would have to move as he had promised it to Andrew Mercer last year. I told him to mind his own business, Mr. Lord had told me to take this house and there I intended to stay. The next thing is, I met him while working last evening and he said \"What about that fine that was put on me at Fishery Bay?\" I told him if he would misbehave himself and break the law by creating disturbances in churches, he must...\nLake, etc., consequences. Then he became abusive and said neither Mr. Perry or I, or many of the rest of us were any good to the Indians, and that he had told you at Fishery Bay that you need not come up to Aigainish to see the Indians there, unless you had good news from the Government to bring them about their land. And as for me I wouldn't be allowed to stay here this summer, even if his people came here, etc., etc.\n\nI could think as far as you were concerned, I knew you were most kindly disposed to all Indians who behaved themselves, and he had better not commence stirring up more trouble, or perhaps he wouldn't get off with only a fine next time. He however I found, went away immediately and told a whole lot of lies about the Fishery Bay Church trouble, to some of the white men working in the Cannery there. And they like many of that class of men who are not too well disposed towards the Church themselves, told him that no one had any right to fine him for such a thing whatever, etc., etc.\n\nAnd so such rascally agitators as the Moses B. McKay, Peter Calder, WM McNeil and a few others of these agitators go on all the time, stirring up the rest and causing bitter feeling against all in authority, who otherwise would be as quiet...\nas sheep mention them.\n\nThere is only one way to remove this continual ill-feeling towards those who are doing their best for their welfare. And that is, to arrest Timothy Derrick and these other trouble-makers, and give them a good term of imprisonment at hard labor at Prince Rupert, or Banff, etc., altogether. And for the good of others as much as myself, I would (if it could be done without running me into extra expense which I can ill-afford) be prepared to appear in Court any time within the Six Months limit; and give evidence as to how these men conspired to keep me and my small nephew for two weeks without the necessaries of life imprisoned at Finlay Bay, by intimidating the others. And many other instances of their lawless dispositions.\n\nThen perhaps their constant ascertainment of those in charge of them by their malicious lying etc., would end, and conditions improve all round. I have no School Report to send in this quarter (not as you know, because there was no place to have really held school in) but because of the malicious influence of Moses McRey principally in that case, and by these other men, what ought I to do under the circumstances?.\n\nThe behaviour of this man Derrick...\nThere now places me again in a very awkward position if he succeeds in stirring up trouble here. As while Mr. Lord personally is friendly enough towards me. They need the Indian women for work in their business, if not the men! And if Derrick causes some trouble through me, it places me in a delicate position with them. Still I trust this amiable intentions will be punctuated. And believe me dear sir.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSylvester. More M.D.\n\nI have thought twice thinking this appointment over, that might help to keep this chief, making provostly of Timothy Derrick in check here. I find it too, very difficult to learn of any case of destitution needing help, or these officers counsel and immediate all of them from accepting anything whatever from the government. And yet little Timothy Derrick had the assurance to say, \"Mr. Perry gives nothing to the poor Indians,\" I said, \"Why I announced in church, that if there were any poor to let me know, as Mr. Perry wished to help them?\" But it's any lie will make more to make trouble.\nOttawa, April 6, 191.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot provide a servant for Dr. Bone at Tahalapam.\n\nThe conditions at Romaico are altogether different. I would point out that a boarding school is conducted there and the staff is engaged to take care of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nOttawa, August 3, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. Hone, teacher at Lakalsap.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the trouble which has arisen between Mr. Hone and certain of the Indians is a matter in which the Department is not prepared to interfere.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nApril 12th 1912\n\nTo Ven: Archdeacon Collison,\nKincolith, Nass River, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Perry,\n\nThe enclosed are my returns for the quarter. I beg to say that I shall not be again able to continue School this summer. There are certain points relative to these returns that need explaining.\n\n(1.) Conduct & Class Standing: It is quite impossible to remark on a large percentage of the children because I so seldom saw them that only their names are familiar to me.\n\n(2.) The same applies to remarks on progress etc.\n\n(3.) You will notice I have stated the school was open 65 days but that 12 holidays occurred. These were due (1) 1 day to the school store and chimney being in such a condition that the whole school was smoked out, and I had to close for repairs. (2) 1 day because of the funeral of a chief and the impossibility of opening the school without violating public feeling.\n\n(3.) The next two half days. (A) Because of a general move to Kincolith of half the people, and though I rang for school, no one came. (B) One afternoon all the children kept away after recess time.\n\n(4.) The other days were due to the departure to Fisher Bay.\n\nHere I had no school, no materials, nothing. I want to use an old\nhouse, but it ought for the second time I lighted the stove, and\nit was not until the second week that I could make it habitable\nand safe and get the children together.\nI could, even then, do nothing but oral work, without slates, or\nbooks. However I managed to teach English, scripture and mental\nArithmetic and spelling, (by means of a piece of charcoal on a white\nboard.) But this so limited the possibilities of work that I had to\nconfine myself to half a day every day. Apart, excepting on the\nfirst two days, not a single Lakhkalsap child came to school. I have\nvery good reason to think that the parents deliberately withheld\nthe little ones, not busy fishing more to their harm than mine\u2014\nBut my duty, as a good Englishman, was to keep that\nschool open if I could. School requisites or no school\nrequisites; and I invited every Kincolith, Dance and Lindertes\nparent at Fishery Bay, at their request, to send their little\nones, and had a good average, considering the season, till term\nending; and am of opinion that these outside children, by their\nregularity, learnt more in two weeks than the average Lakhkalsap\nchild had learnt of the English language in two months. Thus, I\nkept school open, called the roll, rang the bell and taught every\nmorning, and every Lakhkalsap child had an opportunity of schooling\nthroughout that time; and I conscientiously entered them \"absent,\" as\non any other day of the term.\nI feel it my duty to report an incident and consequences relative to the school, to you -\n\nMr Moses Mackay presumed to interfere with my authority under protest of yours. (1) He told me that you had appointed him \"overseer\" i.e. to see after the school and teacher.\n\nI may say boldly that I discredited his authority, although keeping my own council; and ignored the claims entirely.\n\n(2.) He, by his own inference, sent a spy to perform his assumed office: (The spy being the present Chief Constable of the village.)\n\nThis gentleman came in and talked to the girls, raised a disturbance, reproved me publicly for standing (a pretty child - Flora Mackay - in the corner, (as a result of his intrusion on the peace) and after insulting me in English, gave the children advice in Nisshaga; and having \"sufficiently performed his duty,\" retired to report accordingly.\n\nMay I recommend for the benefit of future teachers that Mr Moses Mackay be removed from his - I believe self-constituted office - and given clearly to understand that he must not interfere with school affairs?\n\nI much regret the late attendance of the children: But more, the\nThese, I think, were due to an admixture of indifference to the welfare of the children and foolish misrepresentations circulated among the parents.\n\nI.E. That the teacher was instructing the children in bad phrases in English; that he was beating them on the backs with a stick; that he had twisted a boy's neck; was favouring and punishing unequally, etc. A series of foolish incriminations which I fear proved far more harmful to the educational opportunities of the children than to the instigators of the folly.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nWith sincerest Goodwill to you,\n\nYours,\nRobert Bruce Bonsfield.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that in company with Mr. Indian Agent Perry, I visited Lekalas (Greenville) on April 20th. The school was closed, the teacher, Mr. Mansfield, having left. He took charge of the school about New Years, and gave it up on the 6th of March. The Indians did not know what he had done with the key of the school house, so we could not get in, and I did not see the register.\n\nThe man, just out from England, was well educated, but a most helpless creature; he did not know how to light a fire, did not change or wash his clothes while he was there, they say. The Indian parents asked the Night Watchman and Chief Counsellor to go the school and ask why he did not clean himself. He replied that it was too cold to do so, and although the Indians offered to wash his clothes without pay, he refused. At the close of a service in the church an Indian told him the people would like him to clean up to come to church, but he said he had forgotten to do so.\n\nAfter seeing the Mission House in which he had lived and just as he had left it, Mr. Perry and I had no reason to disbelieve the Indian's story. And later, on mentioning the matter to the venerable Archdeacon Collison at Kinolith, he said he knew and deplored the fact, and that the man should never have gone there.\n\nWe met the Indians in meeting and for over two hours listened to their statements. They claim the Church does not give them proper teachers, and is not caring for them.\n\nThe school house is well built, and in good shape, but through the window we could see school material lying around in an untidy manner. Some of the books in the teacher's house were lying in\nThere is a double closet at the back of the school building poorly built, and one wooden button fastens both doors. This is not proper or decent, as you cannot open one without opening and seeing into the other.\n\nI think it is best not to open this school until September, and then a qualified teacher should be in charge. There are a large number of children in this village and the parents most anxious for them to be taught. They need a teacher with some common sense who will be an example to them.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 21, 1922.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in reference to the Lakalsap School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this is apparently the first intimation the Department has had that Mr. Boucefield was in charge of this school. I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether you were aware of the appointment and whether it was made by the Bishop and also what salary, if any, was agreed upon. In the meantime Mr. Boucefield is only being paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum and a cheque for his earnings for the time the school was open is being sent to you.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the appointment of a teacher are noted, but it is not considered advisable to take action at the present time owing to the unsettled condition of affairs at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo. S.L.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a school report received from the late teacher of the Lak-kalzap Indian Day school, Nass river, for the March quarter, 1912. With it I beg also to enclose a report of my recent inspection of the school, during which visit I was in company with Inspector A.E. Green.\n\nWe were informed that Mr. Boucefield left Lak-kalzap on the second week in March. I received a letter from Mr. Boucefield dated the 12th April, in which Mr. Boucefield tendered his resignation. The letter was received on May 1st, and was sent from Kincolith. I enclose the same herewith for your perusal.\n\nAs regards this school it would seem that the time has come when a Government teacher should be stationed at this village. It is evident that the Bishop of the Diocese is not able to secure competent teachers for this school. Another important point is, that the Indians of Lak-kalzap have been for some time trying to get the Methodist Church to take over the supervision of Lak-kalzap; and a Church of England teacher will not satisfy them, be he never so good. In this present instance, however, I think the Indians are justified in their dissatisfaction with Mr. Boucefield.

Moreover, I was not aware that Mr. Boucefield was to teach the school, but understood that he was to act as a catechist for the church.\n\nI may further state that the only intimation I received regarding the appointment was a verbal statement on meeting the Bishop on the street to the effect that Mr. Boucefield \"may be going to Lak-kalzap\", but of this the Bishop himself was not certain, saying that he had sent him to Archdeacon Collison, at Kincolith, in order that, should the Archdeacon deem advisable, Mr. Boucefield might be sent to take charge at Lak-kalzap.\n\nI would request that the Department kindly communicate with the Bishop of Caledonia, at Prince Rupert, requiring that information in respect to appointments of catechists to act as teachers be communicated to the Indian Agents having the supervision of Indian villages in his Diocese.\n\nIt would also seem to be advantageous to have all salary cheques pass through the Indian office, so as to keep account locally of the dates upon which such teachers are put in charge, and when they abandon their respective schools.\n\nThe new regulation, however, which makes it incumbent upon such teachers to give one month's notice of their intention to quit the school is a step in the right direction.

His present whereabouts are not known to the Rev. Treasurer of the Diocese. The reverend gentleman, however, suggests that the cheque be reissued in his favor, or the Bishop of Caledonia's, so that it may be placed to the credit of the Diocesan account, from which Mr. Boucefield received a salary at the rate of $ per month during his incumbency at Lak-kalzap.

Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWill you please convey to the Indian Department at Ottawa my decision after conference with our Indian Committee (every member being present) to relinquish the privilege hitherto so kindly accorded me of nominating the Indian Day School Teacher at Lakkalsap on the Naas River.\n\nOwing to the present unrest among the Naas Indians it is not expedient for the Government to pay part and the Church part of the Indian School teacher's salary. This mixing up of the two prevents the missionary teaching from exerting a spiritual influence over the Indians. They refuse to look upon a teacher receiving a grant from the Government as a missionary.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nF. H. [Name]\nBishop of Caledonia\nIndians of this village are most insistent upon having a Methodist missionary to take charge of their mission and school, and the Methodist authorities have expressed their willingness to supply the mission with an ordained clergyman, but have also expressed, most emphatically, an indisposition to interfere with the existing arrangements, unless an arrangement can be made likely to meet with the approval of the Department, the Anglican authorities and the general public. Petitions have been made by the Indians to the Chairman of the Simpson District of the Methodist Church of Canada, of recent date, but the attitude of the Churchmen has been of a nature most fair to the Church of England.\n\nI am of opinion that the time has arrived when negotiation having in view the transfer of this mission from the Church of England to the Methodist Church would be most effectual. Last year, a new building was erected by the Department for day school purposes. The building is now closed. Teachers Messrs Smeath, Bone and Housefield, have been badly treated by the Indians, although in the latter case the fault was partly with the teacher. The Indians are dissatisfied with the Church of England; and the latter is evidently not desirous of continuing an interest in the nomination of teachers; the Church buildings are in a dilapidated condition, and the Indians have expressed a desire to have them removed.\n\nIn view of the fact that considerable unrest is known to exist on the Nass river in consequence of the Indians' claim to the lands, it may be that such unsettled conditions are partly responsible for the attitude of the Indians; and, whilst desirous to place all the facts before the Department, I do not feel that I am able to advise the Department as to the action it would be best to take. It will be known to the Department that the Churches are all zealous to maintain their possession of any stations which they may hold, especially if there is a danger of another Church getting possession of them.\n\nIf the Methodist Church were allowed to take charge of this\nthis mission, it may be the church would be able to provide a suitable teacher as well as an ordained clergyman. In view of all circumstances it would seem preferable, in an isolated settlement like Lak-kalzap, to see an ordained clergyman and teacher settled there with their families than a teacher appointee of the Government, who would not likely stay there over a month or so.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 327-1, part 1)\nOctober 4th, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Caledonia, in which His Lordship states that he desires to relinquish the privilege of nominating the Indian Day school teacher at Lak-kal-zap school on the Naas River. In this connection, I beg to inform you that it has for some time been the wish of the Lak-kalzap people to have the Methodist Church authorities to take charge of this mission.\n\nThere has been a lot of trouble at this place. The people have boycotted the missionary teachers who have been sent by the Church of England authorities ever since I have known them.\n\nThe reason for this appears to be that many years ago, when the Methodist Church of Canada had the oversight of the village, there was a lapse of several months during which the Methodist authorities were not able to find a suitable person to take charge of the mission, which had been held for several years by the Methodists. The Church of England clergyman, Rev. Mr. Mc Cullagh, happening along at the time when the Indians were most in need of a missionary, promised to make his headquarters at Lak-kal-zap. An arrangement was at that time entered into by which the Methodists sold their buildings to the Church of England; and the Indians expected that the Rev. Mr. Mc Cullagh would fulfil his promise to remain with them. Instead of that, Mr. Mc Cullagh went to Aiyansh, an Indian village about thirty miles above Lak-kalzap, and has ever since, through the Bishop of the Diocese, had the Lak-kalzap Mission supplied with a lay agent of the Church. The Indians, all this time, have required an ordained clergyman able to conduct marriages, baptisms etc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nOttawa, October 23, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Perry has forwarded to the Department Your Lordship's communication of the 25th ultimo relinquishing the privilege of nominating the teacher at the Lakalup school on the Nass River.\n\nFor Your Lordship's information I beg to quote in part from Mr. Perry's letter as follows:\n\n\"The Indians of this village are most insistent upon having a Methodist missionary to take charge of their mission and school, and the Methodist authorities have expressed their willingness to supply the mission with an ordained clergyman, but have also expressed, most emphatically, an indisposition to interfere with the existing arrangements, unless an arrangement can be made likely to meet with the approval of the Department, the Anglican authorities and the general public. Petitions have been made by the Indians to the Chairman of the Simpson District of the Methodist Church of Canada, of recent date, but the attitude of the Churchmen has been of a nature most fair to the Church of England.\n\n\"I am of opinion that the time has arrived when negotiations having in view the transfer of this mission from the Church of England to the Methodist Church would be most effectual. Last year a new building was erected\n\nRight Rev. F. N. MacVean,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nby the Department for day school purposes, the building is now closed. Teachers Messrs. Smith, Hone and Bousfield have been badly treated by the Indians, although in the latter case the fault was partly with the teacher. The Indians are dissatisfied with the church of England; and the latter is evidently not desirous of continuing an interest in the nomination of teachers; the church buildings are in a dilapidated condition, and the Indians have expressed a desire to have them removed.\n\nThe Department would be pleased to have Your Lordship's opinion on Mr. Perry's suggestion to transfer the mission from the church of England to the Methodist Church. It is Mr. Perry's opinion that should such a transfer be made the Methodist Church would be pleased to provide a suitable teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nG. Perry Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Naas Agency, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th Inst. addressed to me as the Head of the Anglican Church in Northern British Columbia. In this letter you say in justification of your interfering in strictly Church matters in our Anglican Mission of Lakkalzap: \"The position which I take in the matter, and as long as I am an official of the Indian Department having the interests of the Indians at heart, is that the matter of Indian missions is as much my concern as it is yours. If your Church is not able to supply that village with an ordained clergyman, I deem it my business to see that the Indians' requirements are met; and this with a view to improving the present apparently disastrous conditions on the Naas River with which your Church does not appear to have been in a position to cope.\"\n\nAs Head of the Anglican Church in Northern British Columbia I wish to take the strongest possible exception to two points enunciated here by you.\n\n(1) In the first place your assumption of authority over purely Church matters cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. Whether the Anglican Church deems it best to have an ordained missionary or an unordained missionary to impart religious instruction in an Indian Mission belonging to this Church is a matter entirely outside your province as an official of the State, for the simple reason that the State does not undertake to impart religious instruction to the Indians, nor to provide in any way for such religious teaching.\n\nOur Indian Committee has gone fully into the question of what is the best way to minister to the religious needs of the Indians on the Naas River, numbering all told not more than about seven hundred and distributed among five or six small villages. We decided some time ago that it would be an unjustified expenditure of men and money to attempt to have an ordained white missionary in every small village. The Venerable Archdeacon Collison has been about thirty years on the Lower Naas, and the Rev. J.B. Cullagh about the same length, on the Upper Naas. With two such experienced missionaries as these, both talking the language and understanding the native character supervising, and certain lay missionaries, and native catechists assisting, we decided as a Church that the religious needs of the seven hundred Nishgas on the Naas would be amply met.\n\nIn the case of Lakkalzap, as the village is deserted in the summer time all the Indians being at the canneries at the mouth of the river where Archdeacon Collison and a paid native catechist ministers to them, when the lay worker resigned in the spring, we did not deem it necessary to put into operation our present satisfactory plan until the autumn.\n\nIt is not the business of the Indian Agent to interfere in purely Church matters we felt under no obligation to inform you of our plans. As you have not set foot in Lakkalzap since last May, over six months, and I have just returned from there I am in a position to emphatically\ndenied statements you very recently forwarded to the Department to the following effect, quoting your own words, \"The Indians are most insistent upon having a Methodist missionary to take charge of their mission and school\" and \"The Indians are dissatisfied with the Church of England\".\n\nThere is one disgruntled Indian, Charlie Russ, the only avowed Methodist Indian on the Naas River, but he does not live at Lakkalazap but in a house by himself six miles down the river. Ever since we took the Mission over\u2014eight years ago\u2014paying the Methodist Church for their buildings and good will and receiving a solemn pledge that they would not attempt to enter the field again, this disgruntled Indian has been a mischief maker consistently sending reports to the Methodists at Fort Simpson that the Lakkalazap people were dissatisfied with the Church of England. It is to be regretted that when you and the Rev. A.E. Green visited Lakkalazap last May you took for your guide and counsellor this same Charlie Russ. I was informed when at Lakkalazap that it was Mr. Green who told some of the Indians there that the Methodist Church was willing to send them an ordained missionary, taking advantage of the temporary vacancy in our Mission.\n\nIn the occasion of this visit, in the absence of our missionary and without any permission or authority you and Mr. Green, Indian School Inspector, forced your way into our Mission House which does not stand on the Indian Reserve, and reported adversely, the Department having no jurisdiction whatsoever over Church property.\n\nThe point upon which I am asking, through our Member of Parliament, for a ruling from the Minister of the Interior is this\u2014Has an Indian Agent authority to hold this threat over the head of a Bishop of the Church of England regarding the ordination of a missionary in regard to such a strictly Church matter as to whether there shall be an ordained or an unordained missionary to impart religious teaching in an Anglican Mission? If your Church is not able to supply that village with an ordained clergyman I deem it MY BUSINESS to see that the Indians' requirements are met\".\n\n(2) In the second place on behalf of the Anglican Church I resent most warmly the implication contained in your words\u2014\"The present apparently disastrous conditions on the Naas River with which your Church does not appear to have been in a position to cope\".\n\nAfter consultation with our veteran missionaries on the Naas I have come to the conclusion that by \"Disastrous conditions\" you must refer to the manufacture manufacture of intoxicating drink by some of the Indians on the Upper Naas and the consequent amount of drinking.\n\nThe enforcing of Law and Order is not the function of the Church but of the State. It is not the duty of an ordained missionary to act as either a magistrate or constable. Any attempt to do so must lessen his influence over the Indians in religious matters.\n\nOn Indian Reserves it is the duty of the Indian Agent and Dominion Constable to see that Law and Order are maintained, and that the manufacture and distribution of intoxicating liquor is stopped.\n\nAs the Upper Naas is a difficult region to reach it has been the lack of proper supervision on the part of the Indian Agent of the Naas Agency and the lack of proper enforcement of the law by the State that has led...\nto what you are pleased to term \"the disastrous conditions on the Naas River\". This is a matter with which only the strong arm of the Law can \"cope\". Knowing the noble work that the Rev. J. B. McCullagh has done on the Upper Naas, and the most trying and dangerous position he has filled for many years I most warmly resent your charge that the Anglican Church has not been able to \"cope\" with certain conditions requiring the enforcement of Law and Order and therefore you have given the Department of Indian Affairs your \"opinion\" that the time has arrived to \"transfer this Mission from the Church of England to the Methodist Church\", also informing the Department that \"The Methodist authorities have expressed their willingness to supply the mission with an ordained clergyman\". To your threat that if my Church does not supply an ordained missionary in place of an unordained missionary you add these words:\u2014 \"I deem it my business to see that the Indians' requirements are met; AND THIS WITH A VIEW TO IMPROVING the present apparently disastrous conditions on the Naas.\"\n\nHaving just returned from inspecting our Anglican Missions at the Naas of Lakkalap on the Naas River I am very much pleased with the condition of Church matters there. Large and enthusiastic congregations assembled on Sunday, and the best of feeling was displayed both to our supervising ordained missionary and also to our native catechist.\n\nWe are quite willing to have the Department take full control of the Indian Day Schools so that both the Indian School Inspector and the Indian Agent can do all the criticising and fault-finding they like but when it comes to religious teaching and purely Church matters for which the Department of Indian Affairs contributes nothing we must insist upon a policy of NON-INTERFERENCE by the STATE.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Caledonia\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 12th and 16th ultimo in further reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Lekalasap School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on November 21st the Department wrote to His Lordship Bishop DuVernet advising him that it was prepared to pay a more liberal salary, provided His Lordship would be able to nominate a competent person to take charge of this school. For this reason it is not considered advisable to place Alfred McKay, who you state has no special qualifications, in charge.\n\nWith regard to your letter of the 16th ultimo, the Department considers that it gave His Lordship Bishop DuVernet a fair resume of your communication of October 4th and upon receipt of His Lordship's reply informed him that it had no doubt that it was with the object of securing a permanent teacher that your letter was written.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNO. E.66.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nNovember 18th, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Lord Bishop of Caledonia has written to me a letter by which I judge that he is incensed through the receipt of a letter from the Department regarding the transfer of the Lak-kalzap Indian mission to the Methodist Church. The Department's letter to him is quoted in full.\n\nHad I not been given assurance by some of the Bishop's clergy who know the conditions at Lak-kalzap well, that His Lordship would likely be favourably disposed to this transfer if properly approached thereon, I might have allowed a strong reluctance in the matter of negotiating this proposal to have dominated my position.\n\nI must call attention to the fact that I did not inform the Department that the Methodist authorities would be \"pleased\" to send a teacher to Lak-kalzap, as mentioned in the Department's letter to the Bishop. What I did say was that the Methodist Church had expressed willingness to provide an ordained clergyman, and that if a transfer of the Mission were made, the Church may be able to provide a teacher also; and this subject to a satisfactory arrangement being made having the approval of all parties.\n\nI regret that the Department, when writing to the Bishop did not make clear my position as set forth in my letter of October 4th last. In that letter I stated that, whilst desirous to draw the Department's attention to all the facts concerning Lak-kalzap, I did not feel in a position to advise the Department what step it was best to take in the matter, but that I was of opinion that negotiations having in view the transfer of the mission to the Methodist Church would be most effectual. I took particular care\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nmake clear my position, lest the English Church authorities should be led to imagine that I, having some years ago had charge of the Methodist Boys' Home at Fort Simpson as Vice-Principal, was showing partiality and favor towards the Methodist Church as against the English Church, a thing which I have always been against.\n\nThe Department will know that, from time to time, I have reported unfavourable conditions in matters appertaining to the Methodists' schools and institutions, when I have conscientiously felt it to be my duty to the Government.\n\nI understand that His Lordship Bishop Du Vernet has notified the Department that he has stationed an ordained clergyman at Lak-kalzap. I may add to this that the clergyman referred to is Rev. J.B. Mc Cullagh, who recently left Aiyansh, where he has been stationed for the past twenty years, on account of the pregnancy of his wife requiring that Mrs. Mc Cullagh be near to a doctor (Dr. MacDonald, of Kincolith) and because the Indians at Aiyansh have been drinking badly and he was afraid to winter at that place. Mr. Mc Cullagh has informed me that he intends only to winter at Lak-kalzap. In the meantime Aiyansh will be without a missionary.\n\nIf His Lordship is able to give the assurance that a missionary (ordained) will be permanently supplied at Lak-kalzap, it may be the best policy for the Department to pay a teacher a reasonable salary and allow matters to remain as they are, provided the Indians are satisfied with such an arrangement. All I desire as Indian Agent is to see the village supplied with a missionary and teacher. Should His Lordship be unable to furnish these, it seems reasonable to put no obstacle in the way of another Church undertaking the work in order to avert the disastrous consequences of a lapse on the part of the Indians into a condition of heathenism and lawlessness, such as is seen on the upper river.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nIt will be known to you that His Lordship Bishop Du Vernet recently wrote, officially declining to further nominate the Indian Day school teacher at Lak-kalzap, Nass River. I beg to inform you that I received a personal note from Rev. J.B. McCullagh, who will probably remain at that village during the approaching winter, in which it was suggested that Alfred Mc Kay, an Indian of the village, be allowed to take charge of the school during the winter.\n\nIn view of the fact that Mr. McCullagh is serving the Church under the Bishop, and as Alfred Mc Kay, being an Indian having no special qualifications for the post, I did not think it wise to put the Indian in charge as salaried teacher without first bringing the matter to the notice of the Department. Notwithstanding, if the Department is of the opinion that to have an Indian in charge of the school is better than allowing the school to remain closed, I shall be pleased to place Alfred Mc Kay in charge upon your instructions to do so.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 21, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 7th instant in reference to the suggested transfer of the mission at Lakalap from the Church of England to the Methodist Church.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is most anxious to see that a suitable teacher is placed in charge of the school at this point and is prepared to pay a properly qualified teacher a more liberal salary than has been heretofore generally allowed and it is hoped that Your Lordship will be able to nominate a competent person at an early date. The Department has no doubt that it was with the object of eventually securing a permanent teacher that Mr. Perry's letter of October 4th last, was written and the Department fails to see that he was actuated by any ulterior motive.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F.H.

It is Mr. Perry's opinion that should such a transfer be made the Methodist Church would be pleased to provide a suitable teacher.\"\n\nI wish to enter a most emphatic protest against the way the Rev. A.E. Green, Methodist minister and Indian School Inspector, has again and again, especially on the Naas River used his position as a Government officer to further the interests of the Methodist Church against those of the Church of England. Mr. G.G. Perry, who was a probationary Methodist minister before his appointment as Indian Agent, has up to now endeavoured to be impartial, but in this case he has most certainly overstepped the mark in suggesting the transfer of a Church of England Mission to the Methodist Church. We have an ordained clergyman at Lakkalsap and I shall take vigorous steps if there is any interference with our Mission there on the part of any Government official.\n\nThe Church of England was first by many years on the Naas River and founded a Mission at the mouth of the river and a Mission at the head of navigation on the upper river, 65 miles up. These Missions are Kincolith and Rev. J.B. McCullagh has been 30 years on the Upper Naas and Archdeacon...\"\nCollins over 30 years at Kincolith, succeeding another Church of England Missionary who was there some years before.\n\nThe Methodists founded a Mission at Lakkalsap 25 miles up from Kincolith as Rev. A.M. Green was the founder; the village is sometimes called \"Greenville\". More than half the native Christians at Lakkalsap were baptized in the Church of England having either come up from Kincolith or down from our Upper Mission. The Methodist Church had great difficulty with this Mission. There were thirteen different missionaries in about the same number of years. Natives disciplined by our Church went off to the Methodist Church and vice versa. For three years there was no missionary there, and the Indians asked to be taken over by our Church. After long negotiations with Dr. Whittington, the Superintendent of Methodist Missions, we paid $1,500 for the old rotten buildings, and the good will of the Methodist Church, Dr. Whittington giving his pledge that the Methodist Church would not attempt to re-enter the field. Rev. A.M. Green never approved of this transfer. One can understand his feeling and I have tried to make allowances, but every time he has visited the Naas river at Kincolith, Lakkalsap, Gwinoha, Aiyanash, and Gittadamiks he has worked against the Church of England. Our missionaries have traced back dissatisfaction to him again and again, and I am determined to put a stop to this.\n\nProbably because of the many changes Lakkalsap is the most difficult Mission we have to deal with. The natives make the life of a missionary there intolerable. They are the most insolent Indians I have ever met. They tell me they won't have this man, or that man. When our missionary was teacher and catechist combined, they threw it in my face that he was not a missionary because he was paid by Government. In vain I pointed out that only part of\nhis salary came from the Government. It is firmly fixed in their mind that\nthe school teacher is paid by the Government. This is one of the reasons\nwhy our Mission Board decided that it was best for the Government to\nappoint the teacher. We never expected that the Indian Agent would suggest\nto the Department that our Mission be handed over to the Methodist Church\nand further volunteer the information, which is manifestly outside his\nofficial duty as an agent of the Government, that the Methodist Church\nwould supply a teacher.\n\nRev.

Du Tertre\nBishop of Caledonia\nThe Schools Branch,\n\nThe fact that the Church of England bought out the Methodist Church some time ago at that place on the condition that the Methodist Church would not continue there, would, I take it, preclude such action as outlined by Agent Perry. I am inclined to think the Bishop is right in his contention that the Church side of the work is not a matter of the Agent's concern.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, December 11, 1912\n\nMr. Fedley,\n\nThere has been a good deal of correspondence between Agent Perry, Inspector Green, the Bishop of Caledonia and the Department with regard to the Lakalsap Indian School, which has culminated in the receipt of a letter from Bishop DuVernet forwarding a copy of a latter addressed by him to Mr. Agent Perry in reply to his assertion that he has the right to interfere in purely church matters. The Bishop has asked to have a ruling from the Minister of the Interior as to Mr. Perry's assertion that \"The position which I take in the matter, and as long as I am an official of the Indian Department having the interests of the Indians at heart, is that the matter of Indian Missions is as much my concern as it is yours. If your church is not able to supply that village with an ordained clergyman, I deem it my business to see that the Indians' requirements are met; and this with a view to improving the present apparently disastrous conditions on the Naas River with which your Church does...\"\n\"does not appear to have been in a position to cope.\"\n\nThe whole trouble seems to have arisen through Mr. Perry's anxiety to proselytize the Indians, who are Anglicans. Mr. Perry, it is stated by the Bishop, was a probationary Methodist minister before his appointment as Indian Agent and the Bishop naturally takes umbrage at his interference as a Government official in Church matters.\n\nThe Church of England has been in the mission field on the Naas River for the past thirty years and the correspondence shows that, while they have not resident Missionaries on all the reserves, the Indians are not neglected, as there are two regularly ordained clergymen, Archdeacon Collison and Rev. Mr. McCullagh, who are thoroughly conversant with the Indian language and character residing there and they administer to these Indians regularly. Where clergymen are not available catechists are conducting religious services. Bishop DuVernet states that, while quite willing to have the Department take full control of the day schools, so that both the Inspector and Agent can do all the criticising and fault-finding they like, when it comes to religious teaching, for which the Indian De-\npartment contributes nothing, he must insist upon a policy of non-interference by the State.\n\nIt is for the Department to say whether Mr. Perry was justified in taking the stand he did.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 4, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd of November, last, forwarding a copy of a communication addressed by Your Lordship to Mr. Agent Perry in reply to his assertion that he has the right to interfere in purely church matters where the Indians under his charge are concerned.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that Your Lordship is right in your contention that the church side of the work is not a matter of the Agent's concern and Mr. Perry will be so informed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

William Creery, of the Church of England has been appointed as Missionary in charge at the Indian village of Lak-kalzap, on the Nass River. His Lordship Bishop Du Verret has informed me that the Mission Board which recently sat at Prince Rupert during the Synod suggested that \"possibly he (Mr. Creery) might be willing to teach the school\" if the Department wished this and was willing to allow $75.00 a month for the two quarters ending December and March. As the village is deserted the rest of the year except for a few weeks just before the summer fishing it is useless to keep either a missionary there or a teacher.\n\nThe Bishop states that Mr. Creery is a college graduate. In view of the temper of the Indians on the Nass river, and in view of the fact that it has seemed advisable to keep Church and State quite separate, the Bishop has said that if the Department of Mr. Creery opening the school it will have to be announced to the Indians that this arrangement is only until the Department is able to send in a teacher, under which understanding the Bishop thinks the Indians would allow Mr. Creery to teach. In view of recent correspondence, I shall be glad to have the Department's views of this subject.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cairns,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 18,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Lakalsap Indian Day School for the month of October, 1914.\n\nSchool was closed on date of visit. I was accompanied by Mr. Inspector Tyson.\n\nThe matter of a school teacher was dealt with in a public meeting with the Indians held the same day.\n\nAt first it was thought by the Inspector and myself that Mr. Alfred McKay, a native teacher who had conducted school at this place under the Church, might take temporary charge of the school until a regular teacher be appointed by the Department. The people of Lakalsap however, did not wish McKay to conduct school. The Inspector knew of a Mr. Conroy, who taught school at Massett for a time, and who, he thought might be willing to teach at Lakalsap if the Department approved. He promised to take the matter up. Later we discussed the matter with Mr. Cairns, the new school inspector, who knew of two ladies who he thought might do well at Lakalsap in capacities as school teacher and field matron respectively. He thought that good work might result if these ladies were appointed at say $50.00 a month each. Whilst I was not enthusiastic over this proposal, I agreed that such an arrangement might be tried as an experiment. The two inspectors agreed to deal further with the matter. The Lakalsap people had ideas leaning towards the establishment of a boarding school on the Nass River somewhere, to be used by the children of the Nass River.\n\n(Sgd.) Charles Clifton Perry\nAgent\nOttawa, December 30, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to that portion of your report for the month of October, last, in which you refer to the appointment of a teacher for the Lakalsap Indian Day School I beg to say that before the receipt of this report the Department had engaged the services of Miss Pepper and Miss Sturges to take charge of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn further reference to official letter of December 30, 1914, I beg to say that Miss Sturges has been appointed as teacher at Lakalsap at $75.00 per month and Miss Capper as field matron at $50.00 per month. These appointments date from December 11, 1914.\n\nYou will be good enough to purchase the necessary fuel and other requisites in order that they may carry on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakahtla,\nB. C.\nI beg to report that Miss Capper, Field Matron at Lek-kalzep and Nans Hartour, has asked to be allowed a vacation for the whole month of September. She gives as her reason that a short time ago she hurt one of her arms whilst cutting wood at Fishery Bay.\n\nMiss Sturges, the Indian Day School Teacher, informs me that she is anxious about Miss Capper's arm, and that the latter wishes to consult a \"good\" doctor.\n\nI do not know why Miss Capper has not mentioned Dr. McDonald, who lives close to Nans Harbour, where Miss Capper is at present working. I have however, subject to the Department's approval, given Miss Capper permission to leave for the time stated.\n\nI may say, incidentally, that I have asked Miss Capper to get Dr. McDonald's opinion as to her arm.\n\nI shall be glad to know if any standing arrangement exists concerning the vacation allowed Field Matrons.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI beg to inform you that Miss Silvia Sturges, Indian Day School Teacher at Lak-kalzep, Nass River, who by special arrangement has been conducting a summer school at Nass Harbour during the fishing season and has taught for six months straight, has now asked to be permitted to take the month of September for a vacation. I have written to Miss Sturges, stating that, subject to the Department's approval, she may take the vacation desired.\n\nThe school at Nass Harbour, which has been successfully conducted, will be closed at the end of August until the next fishing season. Miss Sturges will open school at Lak-kalzep on the 1st October next. In the interval, most of the Indians will be at their private camps preparing fish for their winter food.\n\nI have asked Miss Sturges to send in a report to date prior to her departure on vacation.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 1, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, stating that you have allowed Miss Copper, Field Matron at Lakalsap a vacation for the month of September, and in reply I beg to say that your action is approved.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, stating that you have permitted Miss Silvia Sturges, teacher at Lakalsap, a vacation for the month of September, and in reply I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Tyson, with Royal Commission on Indian Affairs, October 19, 1915. Original File 47021-61.\n\nLAKALSAP (GREENVILLE) (CHURCH OF ENGLAND)\n\nVisited October 6th. Since my last visit Miss Sturgiss has been appointed as teacher and is doing excellent work. The building is a good one and being kept in first class condition. The attendance has been well up to the mark and the children making satisfactory progress. The Chief Councillor and Council expressed their appreciation of the good work done here by Miss Sturgiss.\n\nSgd. A. M. Tyson,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the returns of the Isk-kalzep Indian day school, Nase River, for the month of October, and those of Aiyansh for the months of November and December. Miss Sturgee, the teacher, it will be remembered was transferred from Isk-kalzep to Aiyansh.\n\nI would inform you that Miss Sturgee has written letters which seem to indicate that she is annoyed because the Department has not paid her salary for the months of August and September last. I mentioned this when telegraphing you for the teacher's pay to the end of January. The Department will be aware that it was decided to pay a full year's salary instead of for ten teaching months to the Nase teachers.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 5, 1918.\n\nS.

As owing to the agreement made her salary is to be paid for a full year instead of for 10 teaching months. From the quarterly forwarded by you it is shown that Miss Sturges has only taught a period of 30 days since July last, namely, 15 days at Lakalsap during the month of October and 15 days after her transfer to Aiyansh during November and December.\n\nIt is recognized that Miss Sturges was put to considerable inconvenience on her way to Aiyansh and by the floods at that place after her arrival. It is hoped, however, that she and the matron are both comfortably settled and that the school will be kept open regularly each\n\nChas. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert\nB. C.\nteaching day until the next summer holidays.\n\nThe Department has been under a large expense in connection with this school and it is hoped that in view of the salary which Miss Sturgos receives that she will devote her full energies and time to the work at this place. You should inform her of the Department's expectations in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nTo the Council of Lake-galzyop\n\nWe have been obliged to put before you the difficulties we have had to manage this winter. We were getting along nicely with the help of Miss Thompson as teacher and Miss Copper as field matron in our district when all at once Mr. Long with drew them from us and sent them up to Ojibwe leaving us without any teacher or other help. Consequently our schools have been closed all the winter. Mr. Long promised to send us a teacher to take their place but he has not done so and we have been greatly disappointed. We therefore beg to appeal to you in our difficulty and beg that you will advise the Indian Agent to take steps to fulfill his promise to us and we will much value your assistance.\n\nWe remain dear Sir yours\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nU. Nelson\n\nCommittee for Lake-galzyop\nOttawa, March 18, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Indian day school at Lekalsap.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Perry and Mr. Inspector Cairns have been endeavouring to secure the services of a teacher and field matron for the village of Lekalsap. The agent will again be requested to endeavour to secure a suitable teacher and matron for your school and it is hoped that he will be successful in his efforts and that before long this school will be reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nF. A. Nelson,\nCouncillor,\nLekalsap,\nNass River,\nB. C.\nOttawa, March 18, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from A. Nelson, Councillor of the Lakotaap Band, on the Nana River, who requests that the services of a teacher and matron be secured for this place. He states that the Indians have been greatly disappointed that the school has been closed all winter.\n\nIn a report made by you in January last, you stated that Mr. Inspector Cairns would assist you in securing a teacher and matron for this point.\n\nThe Department would like to be informed as to whether you have yet secured any applications for the position, or if not, what steps you are taking to obtain a teacher and a matron.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nC.

The Department is disposed to approve of their application when received, but their duties would not commence until the Indians return in September. The Department would be prepared to allow Mr. Gray a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum as teacher and Mrs. Gray at the rate of $300.00 per annum as field matron.\n\nConsidering the expense the Department is being put to in connection with the carrying on of this school, it is thought that the Indians should provide a board walk from the village to the teacher's residence and you will be good enough to inform them accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 11563 dated March 26th, relative to the complaint of the Cree River Indians at Lake-Beauvais that their school has been closed during the past winter. In reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Inspector Gaiman, His Lordship Bishop in Vermont and I have been endeavoring to secure the services of a teacher and teacher, but have found great difficulty as there is a dearth of suitable teachers and persons competent to undertake this work in an isolated village like Lake-Beauvais.\n\nTwo applications have been made for the position of teacher, but from Indians who could not be sent alone to this point. It is most desirable that two Indians be sent together, or a married couple.\n\nI have today discussed with His Lordship Bishop in Vermont an application received lately from Mr. and Mrs. Grey, and we have agreed that, seeing the winter is past and the Indians are gathering to their fishing camps, it will not be well to send officers to this point earlier than September next. It is customary for the Lake-Beauvais teacher and field master to accompany the Indians at this time of year to their respective fishing stations at Fishery Bay, and later to go with the Indians to Lake Beauvais to conduct a summer school. But it is too late now to arrange for the school's fishing station school, the run of salmon being now on. I have further\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI am writing to inform you that we have arranged to have the Algonquin teacher and matron go to Lake Harbour for the summer school. These officers are familiar with conditions there, having looked after this school for the past three seasons. A stranger would not do so well.\n\nCommencing with the month of May, the village of Lake Harbour is to alike with mosquitoes that even the Indians have to abandon the village completely until the end of September. It would be folly and a needless expense to have a matron and teacher go to this village under such conditions. They would not stay there more than a day.\n\nIf an appointment is made now, six months will have to elapse with no work for the teacher and matron. I do not feel that the Department should, particularly at this time, be called upon to pay six months' salaries for nothing.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop La Vernet has agreed with me that it will be well to accept the application of Mr. and Mrs. Gray when made officially to the Department. I haven't yet received the application. Bishop La Vernet has written to Mr. Gray suggesting that he remain in his present position until the fall. In the meantime the Department will be asked to sanction the applications if submitted.\n\nSo far as the Indians at Lake Harbour are concerned,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nLak-kalzap are concerned, I would point out that they have been unwilling to construct a plank walk from the village to the home of the officers. I asked the Department to do this but it was thought that the Indians should lay down a plank walk. The path between the house and the village is through a bog, and it has been with great difficulty and inconvenience that the officers have been obliged to use this, the only walk to the village. I asked the Indians, seeing they have a sawmill at that point, to have a walk made, but they have not done so, and I understand they will not do so.\n\nI think the Department should insist on the Indians making the walk before appointing another teacher. The Indians think the Department should build a house in the midst of their own houses. The present residence is just on the village boundary and on property belonging to the Church of England - their own church.\n\nAs soon as the applications of Mr. Gray and his wife are received I will immediately forward them to the Department.\n\nIn conclusion I would point out that it is exceedingly difficult to get people to go to these lonely and isolated settlements. Consequently there has been delay in sending officers to Lak-kalzap.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Walter A. Gray, B.A., who is recommended by Bishop DuVernet.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the wish expressed by the Grays to go to Kitkatla, the Department will accept their services on the same terms as were paid the Olivers, viz.\u2014$900.00 per annum for Mr. Gray and $35.00 a month for six months for Mrs. Gray. Kindly advise the Department as to whether Mr. and Mrs. Gray accept this offer or not.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough also to inform Mr. Agent Perry of their acceptance of this offer, as it had been decided to place the Grays in charge at Lakalsap, and, if they go to Kitkatla, Miss Sturges and Miss Gapper, who are at present at Aiyansh, will be transferred to Lakalsap.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, June 20, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 12th of April, last, in which you were informed that the Department would accept the services of Mr. and Mrs. Gray as teacher and field matron for the Lakalsap Indian School after the return of the Indians to the reserve in September, next, I beg to say that since then the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, who were teacher and matron respectively at Kitkatla, has been received, and Mr. Agent Fougner now recommends that the Rev. Walter A. Gray and his wife should be sent there to succeed Mr. and Mrs. Oliver. It is presumed that this is the Mr. Gray referred to in your letter of the 26th of March, last, and who was recommended by Bishop DuVernet for the Lakalsap School.\n\nAs it is not the wish of the Department to dispense with the services of Miss Sturges and Miss Capper, who hold the positions of teacher and field matron at Aiyanash, where there is at present no building available for school purposes, owing to the owner having decided to remove it, the Department agrees with you that it would be well to transfer them to Lakalsap, where there will be vacancies if the Grays are sent to Kitkatla, and Mr. Agent Fougner is being informed that the Grays may be placed in charge at Kitkatla, where they are anxious to go. He is being requested to advise you of their acceptance of these positions, at the same rate of salary as was paid the Olivers.\n\nC. O. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nAs soon as you receive word from Mr. Fouger that the Grays have accepted this offer you can notify Miss Sturges and Miss Capper of their transfer to Lakalsap.

Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.118532/I dated the 26th June instant, relative to the appointment of Mr. and Mrs Gray to the school and matroncy at Kitkahtla. In reply I would inform you that I have kept the matter somewhat in abeyance purposely because it was made known to me that Mr. and Mrs Gray had applied for the Kitkahtla School, and there was a remote possibility of the work at Aiyash being continued if the Indians were able to give assurance that they would be willing to have their children attend school by walking from Gitlakdsmik to Aiyash during the winter months in which case a school building would be assured, Chief Derrick now being willing to allow us the use of his house as hitherto provided the Department would pay rental as up to the present. The Indians at Aiyash have not yet settled the point as to whether they can guarantee an attendance as required. As soon as I hear definitely from the Indians I shall be in a better position to arrange for the winter's work at Lak-kalzep.\n\nIn case the work is carried on at Aiyash (and it is most desirable that the work be continued there) I have an application for the Lak-kalzep position. Mr. and Mrs Matthews, formerly of Hartley Bay, have applied and their application is supported by Mr. Inspector Cairns.

He expected to be in Prince Rupert on June 12th and would call on me. The date of his letter was May 31st.\n\nI have not heard from either Mr. Bougner or Mr. Gray since, and Mr. Gray did not call on June 12th.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns (Schools) called at the office recently and gave me to understand that the Grays were going to Kitkahtla.\n\nAs to the vacancy at Lek-kalzep, you have already authorized the transfer of the Misses Capper and Sturges to Lek-kalzep in the event of my not being able to secure suitable premises for school at Citlaskdawe.

These ladies have done faithful work on the Nass River during the last five years, both at Aiyansh and Lakgalzap and I regret very much that they have found it necessary to leave. Great credit is due to them for staying the time they have, as Lakgalzap Indians are not always an easy people to get on with. I think in future it would be advisable to secure the services of a man and his wife to carry on the work of school Teacher and Matron at Lakgalzap. With this in view, I have communicated with Mr. P.H. Gentleman of the Blackfoot Reserve who is I believe, desirous of coming to the coast to take up school work.

Gentleman as teacher of Lakalsap Day School. Letter following.\n\nJ. D. McLean.\nOttawa, May 14, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you state that Miss Capper, field matron, and Miss Sturges, teacher, at Lakalsap, have communicated to you their intention of leaving at the end of next September and that you have communicated with Mr. P. H. Gentleman with a view to having him take charge of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm the following night telegram sent you today.\u2014 \"In reference to your letter of twenty-eighth ultimo Department would not approve appointment of P. H. Gentleman as teacher of Lakalsap Day School. Letter following\".\n\nMr. Gentleman has taught in two of the Department's schools and in neither place have his services proved satisfactory.\n\nYou will be good enough to confer with Mr. Inspector Cairns and with the church authorities in regard to securing successors to Miss Capper and Miss Sturges. Any recommendations made by the above should be submitted for the Department's consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq., Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 14th of May, #18532-1, informing me that the Department could not approve of the appointment of Mr. F.H. Gentleman to the position of Teacher of the Indian Day School at Lakgalzap.\n\nMr. Gentleman's name was first recommended to me by Bishop DuVernet; however, if Mr. Gentleman has failed to give satisfaction in other schools of the Department, it would hardly be wise to place him in charge of the Lakgalzap Indian School. I have already communicated with Mr. Gentleman to this effect.\n\nAs suggested by the Department in a former letter, I have again taken the matter up with Bishop DuVernet with a view of securing a suitable person to take the place of Miss Sturges. Mr. Inspector Cairns is also being written to with the same view. I am hoping to get if possible, a married couple, who could take up the work of Teacher and Field Matron. Lakgalzap is a particularly difficult place to fill owing to its isolation and other disadvantages. By appointing a practical man and his wife, they would be more or less independent of the Indians especially of Lakgalzap. I hope shortly to be in a position to submit to the Department, somebody suitable, for approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the appointments now vacant at Lakgalzap, I have the honour to submit the names of Mr. W.J. Kent and his wife for the positions vacated by Miss Sturges and Miss Capper.\n\nMr. Kent's name was recommended to me by the Bishop of Caledonia as a suitable person for the position of school teacher whilst his wife might possibly assume the duties of field matron. Although Mr. Kent does not hold a teachers diploma, he has had considerable experience in school work generally.\n\nI have examined his testimonials which are satisfactory.\n\nIf he is accepted by the Department, Mr. Kent requests that transportation expenses for himself and wife and effects be paid from Athabasca to point of destination. This would probably amount to about $100.00, without counting freight charges on their belongings.\n\nOwing to the increasing difficulty of getting workers for out-of-the-way places like Lakgalzap, I trust the Department may give Mr. Kent's request favourable consideration. I would suggest that the Department might pay the travelling expenses of Mr. Kent and his wife on condition that they stay for at least 2 years.\n\nAs I believe Mr. Kent's name has already been submitted to the Department by Mr. Perry in connection with a vacancy at Kitkathla, I would state that Mr. Perry and I have talked the matter over, and he is quite agreeable that Mr. Kent should go to Lakgalzap, should he be accepted by the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 327-1, part 1)\nThe explanation is, that unknown to either Mr. Perry or myself, Bishop DuVernet by mistake gave the name of the same party to both of us, hence we have both submitted the same name. However, as I have already stated the matter has been adjusted between Mr. Perry and myself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP. S.\n\nI should be glad to know what salaries the Department would be prepared to pay where the duties of School Teacher and Field Matron are undertaken by a man and his wife, as would be the case with Mr. Kent, whose wife would probably take the work of Field matron at Lakgalzap.\nExtract from Agent's report for the month of August on the Nass River Agency. Dated September 15, 1920.\n\nOwing to the absence of the Indian children at the canneries, that day schools are still closed. I have not yet succeeded in finding anyone to fill the vacancies at Lakelsep caused by the resignations of Miss Sturges, school teacher and Miss Capper, field matron. At present I am corresponding with Mr. J. W. Kent, of Athabasca, who has had considerable experience in teaching, and I am hoping he may be agreeable to taking up the work at Lakelsep. It seems increasingly difficult to find people who are willing to reside in isolated villages during the winter months, and I feel it is only by cooperation with the church authorities in the appointment of those who are really interested in the welfare of the Indians and are willing to put up with the many inconveniences and sometimes hardships of such isolated places for the sake of the work, that the problem of obtaining permanent workers can be solved.\n\nW. L. Collison,\nIndian Agent,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nOttawa, September 9, 1920.\n\nW. E.

J. Kent and his wife for the positions of teacher and matron respectively at the Lakalasap Indian Bay School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you state that Mr. Agent Perry and the Bishop of Caledonia are agreeable to their appointment, the Department will approve of the same. Mr. Kent will be allowed a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum and his wife, if she accepts the position of matron, will be allowed $500.00 per annum. They will also each be entitled to the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period which it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nI may say that Mr. Agent Perry was informed that the Department would approve of the appointment of the Kents to act as teacher and matron respectively at the Kitkatla Indian Bay School, which school was to be open for a period of only five or six months in each year. As the Lakalasap School will be in operation during the whole of the school year, a lesser salary is being allowed than was offered at Kitkatla, in view of the fact that the last named school was to be only in operation five or six months, while the school at Lakalasap will be in operation the full teaching year.\n\nThe Department cannot undertake to pay any part of the transportation expenses of Mr. and Mrs. Kent, but will be prepared, as if they accept the positions, to grant an advance for this purpose of $100.00 on their salaries, which will be deducted in quarterly instalments.\n\nYou should inform the Department as soon as possible whether they accept the positions and, if so, the date on which they will commence duties. If, Mrs. Kent accepts the position as matron instructions regarding her duties will be sent her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit for the Department's approval, the application of Miss Alice E. Hannam for the position of school teacher for the Lakgalzap Indian Day school. Miss Hannam holds a temporary certificate for B.C. and her application has been recommended by Mr. Gairns, Inspector of Indian Schools and also by the Rev. G. H. Raley, Principal of the Coqualeetza Institute who has given her an excellent testimonial.\n\nI would recommend Miss Hannam's appointment at the usual salary of $900.00 per annum and bonus as allowed to teachers of Indian schools, also fuel and light. As there is no teacher's residence at Lakgalzap, Miss Hannam will have to pay $5.00 per month out of her salary as rent for the use of the mission house. Arrangements to this end have been made with Archbishop Du Vernet who has informed me the mission house will be available until such time as a missionary is sent to take charge of Lakgalzap. Owing to the isolation of this village during the winter months, I almost hesitated to accept Miss Hannam's application as I believed the isolation would prove most trying as there are no other white people in the vicinity. However as Miss Hannam is to be accompanied by her niece (15 years) she will not be entirely by herself.\nOwing to heavy travelling expenses for herself and her niece from Vancouver to Lakgalzap Miss Hannam has requested an advance of $100.00 on her salary. If this is agreeable to the Department I would recommend that this be done as I know Miss Hannam will have extra expenses to meet before reaching Lakgalzap.\n\nThe Department is aware of the difficulty I have had to secure a suitable teacher for this village owing to its isolation during the winter months and the many inconveniences which have to be put up with. The Indians are anxious that another winter should not pass without a teacher in charge of the school. I should, therefore, be glad to receive the Department's sanction that the appointment be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 8, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report on the Nass River Agency for the month of January, last, regarding the salary allowed for a teacher and matron at Lakalsap, I beg to say that, as you were informed, the combined salary and bonus allowed for these two services is at the rate of $1500.00 per annum.\n\nWith reference to the bonus, there is a possibility that this will be discontinued, but the Department has no information as to the action that may be taken by Parliament at the present session regarding the matter.\n\nThe sum of $900.00 is all that can be provided for the salary of a teacher, as this is the highest amount allowed to teachers of Indian day schools in British Columbia. Under the classification matrons are allowed a minimum salary of $450.00 and it would be possible to allow this amount in the case where the wife of the teacher acts as field matron. This will make a combined salary of $1350.00 for the two services and, should the bonus be continued during the next fiscal year, that would also be allowed. The Department is aware of the difficulty of obtaining a teacher and matron for an isolated place like Lakalsap, but would like you to continue your efforts to obtain a teacher and matron at the above salary, with the promise that, should the bonus be continued, they will also receive the amount provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from report of Agent W. E. Collison\non the Nass River Indian Agency for the month of January,\n1921. Report dated February 14th, 1921. Original on 75-161A.\n\nThe Lekgalsap School, I regret to say is still without a teacher notwithstanding the efforts which are being made to secure the services of a suitable person to take up the work. I have been in correspondence with Mr. Matthews and his wife with a view of their taking up the work of teacher and matron at Lekgalsap; but they have been obliged to give up the idea owing to the inadequacy of the salary offered. These people were recommended by Mr. Inspector Cairns, and I believe they would have been just the persons for the vacant positions. The salaries offered in the case of a man and his wife taking up the duties of school teacher and field matron respectively are, $500.00 per annum and $300.00 per annum with bonus of $150.00 each per annum. The former school teacher and field matron at Lekgalsap, Miss Burgess and Miss Copper, received $900.00 each per annum with bonus and also free light and fuel. If the same service and efficiency are to be expected from a man and wife undertaking the duties of school teacher and matron, I am of the opinion that the wife, as field matron should receive a higher remuneration than $300.00 per annum. The combined salary at present offered in the case of man and wife amounts to $850.00 per annum including the bonus. There is the possibility of the bonus being discontinued, in which event the salary would be only $850.00 per annum.\n\nIf I may be permitted to do so, I would suggest to the Department that in the case of man and wife taking up the work of school teacher and field matron respectively, the wife giving satisfactory service as matron, that the salary be fixed at $1500.00 per annum.\n\nLekgalsap is a difficult place to fill, owing to the complete isolation during the winter months and the many disadvantages connected with the work.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1290.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant informing the Department that Mr. W. J. Kent is unable to accept the position as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is hoped that yourself, acting in conjunction with the church authorities, will be able to obtain the services of a suitable teacher and matron to fill the vacancies at Lakalsap in time for them to take up their duties before the river closes up. If necessary to advertise for a teacher, it would be well for you to first consult the church authorities in the matter, in order that they will be satisfied with the applicants secured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter #11832/1 of the 8th of September also your telegram regarding the appointment of Mr. W.J. Kent to the charge of the Lakgalzap Indian Day school. I regret now to have to inform you that since receiving your letter Mr. Kent has written to say he is unable to accept the position owing to sickness in his family. I regret this very much as the time is short and the river may close by the end of November or before.\n\nMr. Kent was a nominee of Archbishop DuVernet who offered to defray all Mr. Kent's travelling expenses if he could be secured for Lakgalzap. I am making every effort to secure another teacher and took the matter up with Mr. Inspector Cairns when he was in Prince Rupert last week; but he informed me school teachers were hard to get and had no one in view for the place.\n\nI have again written to Bishop DuVernet in the hope that he may have some other person he could recommend. Failing this I shall ask the permission of the Department to advertise for a teacher and station to fill the vacancies at Lakgalzap. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find suitable workers for out of the way places like Lakgalzap; but I hope it will be possible to get someone before the winter season sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 29th, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant relative to arrangements under which Miss Alice E. Hannam is to take charge of the Indian School at La Loche Village, I beg to say that the Department would be glad to have her accept office in the capacity of Field Matron. If she takes up this work, it will mean that she will attend, when not occupied with her school duties, to the Indians during illness, and that she will also give, when occasions arise, necessary instructions to the Indian women in household arts.\n\nKindly ascertain, and inform the Department, whether Miss Hannam is willing to have her duties enlarged along the lines indicated, and you should learn also as to whether she is capable of dispensing drugs, as it will be necessary for her to have some knowledge of simple medicines if she is to accept as Field Matron and Dispenser. If Miss\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nHannah can take up the duties mentioned, the Department will consider augmenting her salary to a reasonable extent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nSir,\n\nI am glad to be able to inform the Department that Miss Alice E. Hannam of Vancouver, B.C., has agreed to accept the position of school teacher at the village of Lakgalzap. This appointment will I hope, be made possible when the sanction of the Department is received. In connection with this appointment I would suggest that if Miss Hannam is prepared to devote part of her time to the duties of Field Matron and the dispensing of simple drugs for the Indians of Lakgalzap that her salary be supplemented by not more than $20.00 per month. By such an arrangement, the need of a regular field matron at full salary as in the past would not be necessary, at least, for the coming winter.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, August 8th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo submitting for approval the application of Miss Alice E. Hannam for the position as teacher of the Lekalasap Indian Day School who has been recommended by Inspector Cairns and the Principal of Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Hannam, and will allow her a salary of $900 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year. You may inform her of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties at this school as soon as possible.\n\nA cheque for $100.00, being an advance on her salary, is being enclosed herewith, towards the expenses of her transportation. This amount will be deducted from the first quarter's salary paid her.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state if Miss Hannam accepts, and, if so, the date on which she leaves to take up her duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOctober 12th, 1921\n\nRe school teacher, Lakgalzap. Letter #118532-1\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that Miss Alice E. Hannam was engaged to take charge of the Lakgalzap Indian Day school on the 1st of September. She left Vancouver on the 19th and assumed active duties at Lakgalzap on the 24th of the month. I would recommend her salary to commence from September 1st.\n\nWith regard to Field Matroncy duties, I took this matter up with Miss Hannam during my recent visit to Lakgalzap and was informed that she would be willing to devote some of her time to the work when not engaged in school duties.\n\nAlthough Miss Hannam's knowledge of medicine is rather limited, she will be able to dispense the simpler drugs and give instruction to the Indians in nursing the sick and in many other ways be of service to the Indian women and children.\n\nA supply of simple medicines has been sent to Lakgalzap for use during the winter.\n\nI have informed Miss Hannam of the Department's intention of augmenting her salary on account of her extra duties as Field Matron and should be glad to be advised of the Department's decision as to the amount she is to receive.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 1st, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in which you request the Department to pay the travelling expenses of Miss Hannum, teacher of the Lakalulzap Indian Day School, and also to make an allowance of light and fuel for her.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that you may submit a certified account, in duplicate, for $26.50, which amount you state will cover her travelling expenses from Vancouver to the school.\n\nYou may also supply her with whatever amount of coal oil and fuel she requires. A certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform the Department that Miss Alice E. Hannam has written to me accepting the position of teacher of the Lakgalzap Indian Day school and that she is leaving Vancouver sometime in September \u2014 date not settled owing to uncertainty of steamer sailings \u2014 to take up her work.\n\nIn the Department's letter (II8532-I., Aug/8/21.) approving the appointment, no mention is made of light and fuel which has in the past been allowed to teachers of the Lakgalzap Day school. As the cost of living at Lakgalzap is considerably higher than at other places I would recommend an allowance of light and fuel to Miss Hannam and should be glad to receive authority to purchase these commodities.\n\nAs Miss Hannam is bringing her niece with her to keep her company during the winter months, her travelling expenses will be a heavy item. The single fare from Vancouver to Mill Bay cannery on the Nass river amounts to the sum of $28.50 which I think might be paid by the Department owing to the difficulties of obtaining teachers for Lakgalzap. Miss Hannam informed me that Mr. Cairns had given her to understand that this was usually done in cases where teachers had to go any distance and I trust the same privilege may be extended to Miss Hannam.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of official cheque #1091, dated Aug/8/21, being salary advance to Miss Alice E. Hannam, teacher, Lakgulzap Indian Day school, for travelling expenses from Vancouver to Nass River.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith, report received from Miss Hannam, Field Matron at Greenville, for the month of March.\n\nIt will be noticed from Miss Hannam's report that she would welcome a change from Greenville. This matter was referred to in previous correspondence and I shall be glad if it is given consideration by the Department.\n\nMiss Hannam is the only white person at Greenville. The isolation, especially during the winter months when the village is cut off entirely from communication with the outside, is most trying.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that single lady teachers should not be sent to these isolated Indian villages, and if an easier place can be found for Miss Hannam and a transfer made, I would recommend for Greenville, the appointment of a married couple to carry on the school and matroncy work at a salary equal to the joint salary now received by Miss Hannam for her services as teacher and field matron.\n\nThe matter was discussed with Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, during his last visit to Prince Rupert, and he agrees with me that a change is desirable.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\nField Matron's Report\nFor the Month of March, 1924.\n\nGreenville, B.C.\n\nThere has been very little sickness this month. Everybody has left Greenville for the Fishing Season, and I shall be glad to get off the Reserve for a short time. Greenville is utterly deserted, and it is too hard on the nerves to stay in that solitude. True the Indians come back and forth for medicines, but I think it will do them good to find they cannot get them for a short time, as probably they will appreciate them all the more when they can get them. And most of them take a supply to Fishery Bay.\n\nA. E. Hannam,\nField Matron.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter (No. 118532-1) of the 21st ult. I beg to state that Miss A.E. Hannan has again resumed her duties as teacher of the Laklazap Indian Day School.\n\nThis school opened on September 16th, with total attendance of twenty one pupils on the roll.\n\nAs your letter was addressed to Kincolith I regret the enforced delay in replying.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

C.\nOTTAWA, May 1st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your Daily Journal for the month of March, last, regarding the accommodation for the teacher at Fishery Bay, I beg to say that it will not be possible to authorize the erection of a small two-roomed cottage as recommended by you, as we have no funds provided in the estimates for the current year for this purpose. It has been found necessary to curtail all expenditures to the lowest possible point.\n\nYou may draw this matter to the attention of the Department at a later date and if funds can be spared, we will then be in a position to favourably consider your request.\n\nIt is hoped that Miss Hannan will be able to get along with the accommodation at present available. It is noted that she was transferred to Fishery Bay where she will teach the school, look after the sick and perform field matron duties as long as the Indians remain at that camp.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nNass River Indian Agency,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nApril 18th, 1922.\n\n566356\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith copy of my Daily Journal for the month of March.\n\nMiss Hannum, school teacher of the Lekalzap Indian Day School has taken up temporary residence at Fishery Bay where she will teach school as long as the Indians remain at this camp. As Field Matron, Miss Hannum will also be able to look after the sick at the Fishery Bay camp. As there is no suitable house at this place to accommodate the teacher during the two months the Indians remain at the camp, I would recommend, as I have done before, the erection of a small two roomed cottage for the convenience of the teacher and field matron. At present the only available shelter is a small tumbled down shack which is no longer fit for human habitation and I have almost hesitated to ask the school teacher to occupy the place. A small house could be erected next year for about $250.00.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 26, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant and previous correspondence, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to augment the salary allowance made Miss Alice E. Hannam in the capacity of school teacher by a payment of $20.00 a month additional, upon the understanding that in return for the said payment she will perform the duties of Field Matron on behalf of the pupils of the Lakgalzap Indian School and also for the Indians in general at Lakgalzap and in the vicinity thereof.\n\nThe discharge of Field Matron duties will call for dispensing medicines when the same are required and also for attendance and care in cases of illness. Miss Hannam should instruct the older women and girls in household arts and do what she can to improve living conditions in the Indian homes. She should make report with respect to her Field Matron work at the close of each month and her reports should be forwarded to your office in order that you may transmit them in due course to the Department.\n\nYou should make requisition by voucher monthly for payment of Miss Hannam's salary in the capacity of Field Matron and Dispenser of Drugs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing Miss A. E. Hannam's report for the month of March, last, covering her duties as field matron at Lekalzep (Greenville). It is noted that there was little sickness during the month, and that the Indians have left Greenville for the fish hatoneries.\n\nRegarding the request made by Miss Hannam for a transfer to some other school, I would point out that it might be difficult to appoint her to another school where she would be required to perform field matron's duties as well as those of teacher. She is now in receipt of salary at the rate of $50 per annum for each month teaching, together with bonus at the rate of $100, and $20 per month for her services as field matron, a total of $150. Besides a residence is provided. You should take up with Mr. Inspector Cairns the matter of vacancies for a teacher and matron for the next school year. The Department would have no objection to transferring Miss Hannam provided the same can be satisfactorily arranged. While it might be possible to transfer her to carry on duties as teacher, her services as field matron might not be required, and in that case she would have to be transferred at a decreased salary. If, after consulting Mr. Cairns, Miss Hannam's transfer can be arranged so that an additional teacher can secure the services of a married man to take charge of the classroom and his wife to conduct field matron's duties, their combined salaries not to exceed that now paid Miss Hannam, the Department will approve of the above arrangement being carried out.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear after you have taken up the matter with Mr. Inspector Cairns as to what arrangements you are able to make regarding the transfer of Miss Hannam and the securing of a married teacher to succeed her at Lekalzep.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I shall be pleased if you will furnish a report regarding this request, also give full information as to where this school will be conducted and whether you would recommend that the request made be complied with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. L. Douglas,\nGreenville, Nass River,\nB.C.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, reporting on the request of L. Douglas, of Greenville, Naas River, relative to engaging the services of Mr. R. S. Woods to teach night classes of the young men of the village.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after fully considering this request, it has been decided that approval cannot be granted for the carrying on of a night school. It is very doubtful if any real success would attend the conducting of a night school for the young men of the village. I shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Douglas accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nNov. 27th 1924\n\nSir,\n\nYour File 168-35-1\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd October enclosing copy of a communication from L. Douglas, of Greenville, Nass River, relative to engaging the services of Mr. R.S. Woods to teach a night class in the village. In reply I beg to say that this matter was taken up with me by the Indians during a recent visit to Greenville in September.\n\nOwing to circumstances, I declined to give my consent at the time, but not wishing to be thought arbitrary in the matter I suggested that they refer it to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nIn August last year, Woods got into trouble at Kincolith, by supplying liquor to an Indian named Hubert Haldane. Haldane was found drowned shortly afterwards, and it is supposed that in a state of intoxication following the drinking bout he accidentally fell overboard from his boat which was moored to the Kincolith Wharf.\n\nSerious trouble followed as Haldane's relations demanded blood money from Woods. Woods was tried and fined $300.00, or in default of payment, to be imprisoned for six months. In addition, he was ordered to leave Kincolith reserve.\n\nWoods is a half breed, whose mother, also a breed, belongs to the Kincolith band, but at present is living with a half breed named Billy Madden, who spends most of his time at Ketchikan, Alaska.\nWoods is an intelligent fellow, having received a fair education. He has visited Ottawa on one or two occasions in the capacity of interpreter for Indian land delegations from the Nass River.\n\nPersonally, I have nothing against Woods whom I have known for many years, and do not wish to keep in remembrance an unfortunate mix-up which I know he has often regretted. Any action taken has been in his own interests, and he has frequently been told that he is far better away from an Indian Reserve.\n\nHe is a returned soldier, having served overseas, and is married to a white woman whom he met in England.\n\nWhilst I do not altogether place much confidence in the idea of a night class as being the primary reason, I believe the Indians really want him because he has always taken a leading part in village games and entertainments.\n\nAt the present time, Woods is holding a good position as freight checker in the C.N.R., freight shed in Prince Rupert, receiving a fairly good salary, and I hardly think he would be ready to give this up for anything so uncertain as that offered by the Indians of Greenville without any satisfactory guarantee that they can pay for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGreenville Mass River B.C.\n\nFeb. 26th 1925.\n\nMr. Danan C Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nShawmut.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe the Greenville people,\nbeg to ask you to make an arrangement with Mrs. Richard Woods,\nwho is now residing in Prince Rupert, B.C., under which Mr. Woods\nwill undertake the teaching of children Day School; she is\nalso a Nurse she will be able to distribute Medicines to us,\nwe beg to ask that your Department approve of the desired\narrangement.\n\nWe are Very truly Yours,\n\nMatthew Laskins Mark\nSamuel McKay\nC.

He is very much mixed up with the land agitation and is in close touch with Mr. A.F.O'Meara. I need add nothing further beyond stating that even if the position were vacant I would not for a moment recommend him.\n\nMrs. Woods is a white woman and as far as I am aware is not a qualified nurse, but I think served as a V.A.D. during the war. As mentioned in my previous letter, Woods was ordered to remove from the Kincolith reserve for reasons already stated. He has, however, visited his relations at Kincolith, a matter which have purposely overlooked, as I do not wish to add fuel to the fire in the present state of unrest among the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the petition of the Indians of Greenville, Nass River, requesting the appointment of R. S. Woods and his wife to take charge as teacher and field matron, respectively, at the Lakalsap Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that after considering your report regarding the qualifications and character of this man, the Department is not prepared to consider his appointment even in the event of a vacancy occurring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, April 16th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the petition signed by yourself and a number of the Greenville people requesting that Mr. and Mrs. Richard Woolis be engaged to undertake the teaching and field matron's duties at Greenville, Naus River, I now beg to inform you that after full enquiry into your request the Department is not prepared to make any change at the present time in the teaching arrangements at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Matthew Lask, and others,\nGreenville, Naus River,\nB.C.\nContinuing the trip to Greenville, I visited Miss Hanuma, the sole occupant of the village, and inspected the school building. Owing to the absence of the children at Fishery Bay, the school has to be closed during the whole of April.\n\nThe situation as far as Miss Hanuma is concerned is a very trying one. During the months of March and April, when the people are all away at Fishery Bay, she is frequently the sole occupant of the village; whilst during the long winter months when the river is closed she is the only white person there. I have previously recommended a change of teachers for this place as I consider a married man better suited for such an isolated position, and would recommend that this change be made before another winter.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your monthly report on the Skeena River Agency dated the 4th instant, relative to your visit to Greenville (Lakalzap) and the situation at that point insofar as the school is concerned, I beg to refer you to official letter dated May 26th, 1924, this file No., regarding the obtaining of a married man to take charge of the classroom and his wife to conduct field matron's duties.\n\nWe are aware of the difficulty of obtaining a suitable married teacher for this school. However, it may be that you can nominate the services of a married man and his wife. You might consult Mr. Inspector Cairns regarding the matter. The question of salary could be determined after the Department is fully advised as to the qualifications of the applicants for the position. If satisfactory arrangements can be made to obtain a married couple, it might be possible to arrange for the transfer of Miss Hannam to some other school in your Agency where living conditions would be more suitable for her. I shall be pleased if you will give the question of this change in teachers for the Greenville (Lakalzap) school your attention, and inform the Department as to what you are able to do in carrying out the above suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. L. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from June quarter return of the Lakalsap Indian Day School.\n\nThe school was open during the Oolichan season but no one here to attend, the Indians were all away at Fishery Bay. (May 10/23)\n\nBy permission of the Indian Agent the school closed June 12th as they were all leaving for the canneries.\n\nMiss A. E. Hannum,\nTeacher.\n\nSch open 30 days in June 98/25\nEXTRACT FROM AGENT'S REPORT ON THE LAKALSAP SCHOOL FOR THE MONTHS OF MAY AND JUNE, 1925.\n\nAs will be seen from the quarterly report, school was closed for the greater part of May and June, partly on account of the movements of the parents of the children to and from the village.\n\nConditions are not entirely satisfactory as I find a lack of interest in the school work by the Indians.\n\nMiss Hannum's position is a trying one owing to the isolation she has to put up with and the fact that she is the only white person residing in the village. I believe a change would be in the interest of all concerned.\n\nW. E. Collison, Agt.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the quarterly return of the Lakalsap (Greenville) Indian Day School and your report for the months of May and June last, it appears that this school is closed during the greater part of May and June in each year, owing to the fact that the Indians remove from the village during that period, being away at the fisheries.\n\nIt is considered that, as the Indians are away during the two above mentioned months and do not return until late in September, it would be advisable in future to have the school conducted from September 15th to May 15th in each year, a period of 8 months. We have been paying the teacher salary in full for the 10 teaching months when practically only eight months' service is performed. This is, of course, not the fault of the teacher, but entirely owing to the fact that the Indians are away from the village. I shall be pleased to have your opinion as to whether you would concur in the above suggestion. We are aware of the difficulty in obtaining the services of a teacher for this isolated point, and it may be that it would not be possible to obtain the services of a teacher for 8 months only in each year. In our letter of the 17th ultimo, you were requested to obtain the services of a married teacher for this school, and if such is secured it might be necessary to retain his services for the full year. Our suggestion that the school be kept open only eight months is in order to keep the cost of conducting this school as low as possible. However, we will await your views in the matter and also what arrangements you have been able to make to obtain a suitable married teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nExtract from report of Agent Collison\non the Lakaleap Day School dated Jan.26, 1926.\n\nMiss Hannam has been experiencing a little difficulty with regard to discipline in the school which seems to be a little more than she can manage. A change has been recommended, and I hope arrangements to this end may be possible at the end of the summer term.\n\nThe school was visited by Constable Newnham on Dec.8th.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report dated the 26th ultimo on the Lakalsap Indian Day School, relative to the difficulty Miss Hannam, the teacher, is experiencing in enforcing discipline, I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation that arrangements be made at the end of the present school year for a change in teacher at this school.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to our letter of July 8th, last, in which you were requested to endeavour to obtain the services of a married teacher. We are aware of the difficulty in obtaining the services of a teacher for this isolated point. You should keep the matter in mind and endeavour, before the school reopens after the summer holidays, next, to nominate the services of a married man having the necessary qualifications. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements you can for a change in teacher for the next school year. The name, qualifications and experience of the person nominated by you should be forwarded for the information and approval of the Department.\n\nIf you consider that Miss Hannam's services have been satisfactory, it might be possible to arrange to have her transferred to some other school where conditions are not so difficult as she has found them to be at Lakalsap.\n\nPlease advise the Department later as to what arrangements you have been able to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nKincolith, Mass River, Feb. 2, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith my Monthly Report for January 1926.\n\nOwing to having received a letter from the Greenville Village Council requesting me to attend a meeting at Greenville which had been called by Miss A. M. Hannam, day school teacher, on Monday 4th January, and also received a letter from the lady herself asking me to go up there as soon as possible, I left for Greenville on Sunday, 3rd January.\n\nThe meeting was held as arranged and was attended by a full muster of the council, also by Sam McKay who had claimed that he had been appointed \"school trustee\" by the Indian Agent. Miss Hannam's complaint was that she had been publicly insulted by the Indians at a Christmas gathering and that she had been annoyed by Sam McKay attending the school during school hours and interfering with her teaching. Through Johnson Ross, interpreter, I was told that the Indians had not meant to insult her and were sorry if Miss Hannam had taken it that way. Miss Hannam accepted the explanation and there was thus no need for me to take any further action in this connection. I then told the council that Sam McKay had no authority to interfere with the school and that no trustee was appointed. This led to a general discussion of school matters which I said came under the jurisdiction of the Inspector of Indian schools and could not be dealt with by me. This appointment of a \"school trustee\" which according to the Indian interpretation really means \"school helper\" appears to have been provided for under a village by-law introduced about ten years or more ago and as can be readily understood, could be a source of considerable annoyance to a trained white lady teacher. Miss Hannam appears to have had a lot to put up with and was undoubtedly suffering with nervous strain. I smoothed matters out with the council before I left and was asked to send for the school inspector.\n\nS. G. Newnham,\nDominion Constable.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Feb. 15, 1926\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to Mr. Hearnham's report of his visit to Greenville, you will remember that I have for some time advised a change for Miss Hannan on account of health, and I have now informed her that I am trying to arrange a change of schools for her, at any rate she cannot return to Greenville after the summer term. Mr. Cairns has not visited the upper Nass for some time and therefore, is not conversant with the situation.\n\nW. L. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Report of Indian Agent Collison\non the Lakalsap Indian Day School - dated May 16th, 1926.\n\nThis school was opened for three days only -\nApril 28th, 29th and 30th. During the rest of the\nmonth, the Indians were all away at Fishery Bay for\nthe oolichan fishing. The pupils being away from\nschool so much during the school year makes the work\nof the teacher most discouraging.\n\nMiss Hannam leaves at the end of the present\nterm.\nOttawa, June 5th, 1926.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your report on the Lakalsap Indian Day School dated the 18th ultimo, informing the department that the school was open for three days only during the month of April and that Miss A. K. Hammon, the teacher, intends to leave at the end of the present term, I beg to refer you to our letter of February 11th, last, in which you were requested to endeavour to obtain the services of a married teacher for the next school year.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to nominate the services of a teacher having the necessary qualifications in due time to take up duties on or about September 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, July 8th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the June quarter return of the Lakalsap Indian Day School and it is noted that the school was open for 27 days only during the June quarter. From the information supplied on the return, it appears that this was due to no fault of the teacher and it has, therefore, been decided to allow her the full quarter's salary.\n\nI find in reviewing the returns for several years, that the Indians leave the reserve early in June and it would, therefore, appear that there is no necessity for endeavouring to keep the school open after June 1st.\n\nIn view of the above it is considered that when you are securing a teacher for the school, as authorized by official letter of June 5th, it should be understood that the period of engagement is from September 1st to June 1st, or a nine month school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I beg to state that as the Department is already aware, it is most difficult to obtain suitable teachers for these isolated and expensive places, and if salaries are curtailed on account of a shorter school term as suggested, it would be still more difficult to get a good teacher, as it is almost impossible for anyone to live on the salary already allowed owing to the expensive journeys and the cost of living at these places.\n\nI am already in communication with a man for the Greenville school at the same salary as Miss Hannam received, viz: $1050.00 per annum, and as he seems capable of rendering first aid and dispensing simple remedies I would recommend that if his papers and references prove satisfactory that he receive $20.00 per month for this extra service as he could not qualify as a Field Matron. As soon as I hear from him I shall write further regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC JJ.\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report of the 16th ultimo on your Agency for the months of August and September, last, it is noted that you have obtained the services of a teacher, Mr. Frederick Job, for the Likulap (Greenville) Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection with the appointment of Mr. Job, I shall be pleased if you will furnish full information regarding his qualifications and experience, and the salary which you informed him would be paid. Please also state the date on which Mr. Job took up duties.\n\nIt is presumed that Mr. Frank Anfield, whom you nominated for the position as teacher of this school in your telegram dated the 7th of August, last, did not accept.\n\nYour early reply giving the information asked for regarding the appointment of Mr. Job is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Inspector Cairns who was acquainted with conditions on the Nass River fully concurs with me in this regard and intimated that he would write to the Department.\n\nAt the last moment Mr. Anfield, who was previously nominated for this school failed me, having accepted a better position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWEC, JJ.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department of the qualifications possessed by Frederick Job, who was appointed by you as teacher of the Lakalsap (Greenville) Indian Day School, and also stating the rate of salary he is to receive.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Job, with salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month.\n\nIn view of the extra travelling and other expenses which Mr. Job has had to incur in reaching the school, the Department will allow payment of salary at the above rate from October 1st, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The classes were well attended and very much appreciated.\n\nIn view of the fact that this work was not compulsory, and that Mr. Job also attended to the medical needs such as dispensing medicines etc., for the village, I would recommend that he receive extra remuneration at \u00a325.00 per month.\n\nThe previous teacher, Miss Hannam, who acted as field matron, received \u00a320.00 per month for the dispensing alone. I am hoping that Mr. Job will be able to keep on the work for another year as his services are much appreciated in the village as well as school work and I think any extra remuneration which could be given would be an encouragement to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nWBC, JJ.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a report showing the work being conducted by Mr. Frederick Job in the teaching of night classes for the young men of the village at Lakalasp (Greenville) during the months of January and February, last, and requesting that he be remunerated for this service.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department prefers that any remuneration for this service be in the way of an increase in the regular salary of Mr. Job. At the present time he is in receipt of salary at the rate of $105 per teaching month. In view of the services he performs in holding night classes at this school, the Department will increase his salary to $110 per teaching month from the 1st of January, last. This increase in salary is on the understanding that he will continue to conduct these night classes during the period there is a fair average attendance of the young men. This is the full amount we are prepared to allow for the services which he performs at this point. The Department will be pleased to approve of his continuing in the work as teacher at this school for the next school year. We note that you report his services to be satisfactory. Please inform him of the increase in salary allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform the Department of the resignation of Mr. F. Job as teacher of the Greenville Indian Day School to take effect at the end of the present month.\n\nHis resignation is regretted, particularly as he was a very capable teacher and well liked by the Indians. He could not stand the isolation and although he would have liked to remain another winter his health would not permit it.\n\nI am enclosing an application received from Mrs. Isabel Moore, with copies of Inspectors' reports. I would suggest that Mrs. Moore be appointed as field matron as her husband has knowledge of First Aid and could render her assistance in this line.\n\nIn view of the extra service which will be of great benefit to the Indians, especially during the winter months when Greenville is cut off from outside medical aid, I would recommend a salary of $1270.00 with the usual allowance of fuel and light as was paid to Miss Hannam, a previous teacher. It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain teachers for these isolated places, and I believe the salary suggested would be a fair recompense for the position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Job, Greenville, and also understanding that there would be a vacancy for a teacher at the Greenville Indian Day School, I beg to tender my application for the position.\n\nI am a married woman, my husband is a returned soldier who can only do very light work. I am thirty-seven years of age, am strong and healthy.\n\nMy husband has a knowledge of first Aid and has had a large amount of experience in hospital work that might prove useful in the dispensing duties that Mr. Job mentioned.\n\nI am a fully qualified and experienced teacher, with 20 years experience with all grades and all ages. I had fifteen years experience in the Old Country and eight in B.C.\n\nI hold a 2nd class B.C. Teacher's certificate, valid for life.\n\nI have been principal of Crawford Bay School Port Crawford, Kootenay Lake for the past 4 years, but intend to tender my resignation at the close of the present term. During that period I have passed all my Entrance pupils every year and this is a school of ten grades, so, as you will understand, that single-handedly it has been heavy work.\n\nI enclose copies of Inspectors' reports (1919 to 1927) and testimonials from Trustees and shall be pleased to forward any further information that may be required.\n\nShould my application be successful I can assure you that I will do my utmost to give satisfaction in every way.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of a favorable reply,\n\nI am,\n\nyours faithfully\n\n\"Isobel Moore\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

In this connection I have to say that Mrs. Moore is being forwarded a cheque for three months' salary, also a cheque for one month's salary for her late husband.\n\nRelative to the obtaining of a suitable teacher for this school, I would refer you to official letter of the 13th ultimo, in which you were informed that it is not intended to continue the position of assistant teacher if it is possible to dispense with such services, and that it will, therefore, only be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to carry on the classroom work.

He is a married man and his qualifications are satisfactory. His name was forwarded to me by the Provincial Department of Education at Victoria, B.C.\n\nMr. Henry taught in Japan for some years and has good references. I would suggest that he be paid a salary of $1,000.00 per annum for the ten teaching months, and that his wife receive a salary of $25.00 per month as field matron and dispenser. The village is cut off from outside communication during the winter and it is important that someone be appointed to dispense ordinary drugs to the Indians.\n\nThe department is already aware of the difficulty of obtaining a teacher for this school owing to its isolated position, and the privations which a teacher has to put up with. It is impossible to appoint a young unmarried woman teacher as there are no other white people in the village.\n\nOwing to the short time before school opens I have engaged Mr. Henry's services subject to the Department's approval and should appreciate an early reply by wire confirming the appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The subscription is \u00a53.50 per year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHarold E. Palmer\n\nHSP:YM\nObservations on Education\n\nIt must be understood throughout the whole of following remarks, opinions and suggestions, that they apply only to my own personal experience of the work of education here among the Indians of the Reserve near on the line, in the most isolated part of the province; because I have had no reference book, and have no knowledge whatever of the practices and characteristics of any other schools of the Indians here or anywhere else, and therefore cannot say what may be best for others than that the general education should be conducted by the best teachers who can be obtained, and that the children should be taught in such a manner as will make them useful members of society.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nReturning to the language question. Any intelligent person\u2014no who read this or who wrote it\u2014must admit that if we attended a lecture on hygiene delivered in this distance we should know no more of the subject than if we had closed our eyes; this explains the qualifications in my answer to the query \"Is instruction purely religious or hygienic, or directed?\" of the next morning.\n\nThe point of the paramount importance of English to the native children having been pressed home with sufficient emphasis, I think I ought, as an experienced language teacher, to make some suggestions as to improvements in materials and methods. In a school like this the first center is the most important of all books, the first step toward the acquisition of new words and ideas from the point of view of future usefulness; no body of knowledge would be complete, no education, and nothing that is built upon acquirements would be valuable without a knowledge of the English language.\nI have by no means exhausted the ramifications of my subject. I should like to touch on my objections to the \"Inclusive Method\" of journalism used here, on \"Busy Work,\" or Planning the Indians by sending pupils' work (which is really not done by pupils) to the Prince Rupert or other exhibitions and winning prizes, on the necessity of a change in the Indian attitude to the school; that it should be considered something more than a place dry and warm on chill wet days; a glance at the register of the pupils of today, and to the end of June to call from a pool in a water closet, a really cold wet day, and compare a full house, boys, ready to be used for sale, while outside cold winds whistle through the windows, as to the change demanded.\n\nI should like to say something on the relation of the amount of time in the composition of his lot with that of his environment, realizing much of the world's teaching is done in the same way as the savage does his work, and it is no better teaching. Grades at times, there? Yes, grades, first, fifth, and sixth\u2014there is no such thing as a grade that is not a grade, just where we are going, how far we have come, what we have accomplished, and what we have yet to accomplish. The first part of the year is the hardest, the second part of the year is easier, but the third part of the year is the hardest of all. It has been a most interesting experience here, and this thought apparently, although it seems to be a genuine acquisition of impressions gathered first-hand.\n\nMalcolm Henry\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that Mr. Henry's name was forwarded to you by the Provincial Department of Education, Victoria, and it may be that they can assist in obtaining the services of a teacher at this time. Please forward, for the approval of the Department, the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you for this school.

He is now absolutely physically fit.\n\nI am 46 years and have 1st class diplomas in cookery, laundry, and housewifery and certificates in first aid, nursing and infant care and health from London County Council under which authority I was teaching for twelve years. During the war I was doing first aid for the Red Cross as V.A.D., and then I became matron for two years at the Ordination Test School, Knutsford, Cheshire, and in 1922 went out as matron of the Thomas Hanbury School for Boys, Shanghai, China, where I was responsible for the health and feeding of 50 boys. I then transferred to the Girls School where I was on the teaching staff for 5-1/2 years.\n\nI left last year to join my husband who then had completed a three-year course at the Anglican Theol College, Vancouver. The Bishop of Columbia knows us both personally, and Mr. Macintosh, 18th Avenue, Grey, Vancouver also would give us a personal reference. I have copies of my own testimonials I could send if necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) J.M.

Whilst Mrs. Weaver does not possess a Canadian teaching certificate, she has taught some years in the Old Country and possesses other useful qualifications. Her husband would undertake the medical work in the village such as first-aid and dispensing of simple drugs for the sick.\n\nAs previously pointed out, owing to conditions at Greenville and the fact that this place is entirely isolated during the winter months, it is not advisable to appoint a single woman teacher. Out of several applicants personally interviewed by Mr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, and myself, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver seemed best suited for the positions. I would therefore recommend their appointment at the following salaries:\n\nMrs. Weaver, school teacher, at $900.00 per annum for ten teaching months,\n\nMr. Weaver, $30.00 per month as first-aid man and dispenser.\n\nWhilst a British Columbia certificated teacher would have been preferred, Mrs. Weaver appears to be a capable woman and I am sure will give every satisfaction in her work.\n\nOn account of the short time before school commences, I would be glad to receive confirmation of Mr. and Mrs. Weaver's appointment by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.E.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Mar. 7, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith my daily journal and expense account for the month of February.\n\nGreenville\n\nAs far as schools on the Nass River are concerned, matters at Greenville have not been running very smoothly this winter.\n\nWhilst Miss Pennington has excellent qualifications, her methods do not seem to appeal to the Indians who have asked for the appointment of a male teacher. They have been informed that this matter cannot be dealt with until a later date.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nAgent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nInspector Barry's report, regarding his visit to the Greenville (Lakalsap) Indian Day School, has just reached the Department. He states that the teacher, Miss Margaret Pennington and also Miss G. Parker intended to give up their duties on June 30th, last.\n\nPlease advise the Department at once if you have received the resignation of Miss Pennington and Miss Parker, in order that the necessary steps may be taken to obtain their successors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB.C.\nGreenville, Via Mill Bay,\nNass River, B.C.,\nJune 1, 1934.\n\nRev. W.E. Collison,\nIndian agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Collison:\n\nOn account of the attitude of the Indians here, we do not think it advisable to return to Greenville next year. We therefore wish to tender the Department our resignation as teacher and nurse respectively at this place, to take effect at the end of the present school year.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy to us during our stay,\n\nWe are, Yours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher Greenville Indian Day School,\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you of the resignations of the Misses Pennington and Parker, school teacher and dispenser at Greenville Indian village, Nass River, which took effect at the end of the term, June 30th.\n\nIt will be necessary to appoint a new teacher and dispenser before September next, and I shall be glad to receive the usual authority to fill the vacancies as soon as possible.\n\nBoth ladies were well qualified and did their best to make a success of the work, conditions however, made things difficult for them, and I would strongly recommend the appointment of a married couple\u2014one as teacher and one as dispenser. As I have before pointed out, a man is needed to handle the people at this place\u2014both parents and children.\n\nI would recommend that the same salary be paid, viz:\u2014$900.00 for the teacher, and $300.00 for the dispenser with free light and fuel.\n\nThe teacher's residence which has had nothing done to it for some years, needs some inside renovation, and I would recommend that a sum of $50.00 be expended for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 16, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Department has received the resignation of Miss M. Pennington and Miss C. Parker, teacher and assistant teacher, respectively, at the Lakalsap Indian Day School, (Greenville Reserve, Electoral District of Skeena). Lakalsap is an isolated school, situated 18 miles from Mill Bay, in the Nass River district. To replace the above, it will be necessary to secure two persons - one to act as teacher, the salary being $900 a year, and the other to act as assistant. The latter also dispenses the medicines and gives attention to health matters on the reserve. The salary provided is $300 a year.\n\nThe Indian Agent strongly recommends the appointment of a man and his wife - the former to act as teacher and the latter as assistant. The teacher should hold at least a second class certificate and both officers should be Protestant.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSt Mary's Church\nElgin Road\nOak Bay, B.C.\n\nJuly 18th 1934\n\nMr. John Hayhurst is a member of St. Mary's Congregation and I have every reason to believe that he is a person of really good character.\n\nI feel sure that he would always put his best into his work, and try to give entire satisfaction.\n\n(Canon) Arthur E. de Lunnis\nRector of St. Mary's\nOak Bay, B.C.\nAugust 20, 1894.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\n\nI be, to refer you to my memorandum of the 16th ultimo, with reference to securing teachers for the Lakalap Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is today in receipt of a telegram from the Indian Agent, urging an immediate appointment, as this school is situated in an isolated place and in order that it may be re-opened on September 4th, it is necessary to appoint the teachers at the earliest possible date.\n\nI.R. Agent Collison and School Inspector Herr recommend the appointment of Mrs. John C. Hayhurst as teacher and her husband, I.R. John Hayhurst, as assistant teacher. Mrs. Hayhurst holds a B.C. first class certificate and has had previous experience in teaching. Mr. Hayhurst is stated to be fully qualified to assist his wife at this school.

Many of the people were still absent from the village, and the attendance had been small.\n\nSchool is well carried on by Mrs. N. Hayhurst who is a very competent teacher, and is well liked by the people.\n\nW. H. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of January.\n\nAll the day schools in the agency were open during the month, and satisfactory reports received from the teachers. Notice of the resignation to take place at the end of June was received from Mr. & Mrs. Hayhurst, teachers of the Greenville Indian Day School.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nVia Air Mail\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn continuation of my 15/1/1103 of August 25th paragraph four, and with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Lakalsap Indian Day School (Greenville) in the Skeena River Agency, I may say that Inspector Barry obtained the name of one candidate from the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nThis lady is Mrs K.M. Bridge, fifty years of age, an Anglican, and the wife of Captain Bridge. Her address is R.F.D., Ladysmith, B.C.\n\nCaptain Bridge received a gun shot wound overseas in the War of 1914-18. He is in consequence 50% deaf and for this reason in receipt of a small pension of some $35.00 per month. Captain Bridge operates a small bulb farm, but his total income is quite insufficient to support the family, and it is for this reason that Mrs Bridge must go back to teaching.\n\nMrs Bridge was when Captain Barry knew her a Mrs Ballou. She has one son now some seventeen years of age and not very strong or equal to hard work. This boy is Harold Ballou and while recovering his health after an operation could no doubt assist his mother should she be appointed to the Lakalsap School. Harold would not be able to help in the schoolroom but could give his mother some assistance around the house.\n\nMrs Bridge was trained at the Victoria Normal School and holds a B.C. Second Class Certificate. Her experience in the Provincial schools of B.C. extends to some eight years, and she had some two years work in Alberta Provincial schools. Her work in Provincial schools is reported as good. Mrs Bridge was given all necessary instructions by Captain Barry when he interviewed her at Nanaimo last week, and she is therefore in a position to proceed to Greenville as soon as I hear from the Department that her appointment is approved, for Bishop Mix has left the nomination in my hands.\n\nCaptain Bridge hopes to be re-employed with the Canadian military forces in the present war; but if not accepted may go to Greenville to live with his wife.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend the employment of Mrs K.M. Bridge as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School at a salary of $30.00 per teaching month. The question of the employment of Captain Bridge in the position formerly held by Mr. John Hayhurst at Greenville might well be left for future consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hayhurst, teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School, had been transferred to the position of teacher of the Kitwanga School, No. 824, effective from September 1, 1939.\n\nMrs. Hayhurst and Mr. Hayhurst have been paid their salaries at Lakalsap until June 30, and no further payments should be made to Mr. Hayhurst, as he will not be employed at Kitwanga.\n\nTo succeed Mrs. Hayhurst at Lakalsap, the Department has approved the appointment of Mrs. K. M. Bridge, at a salary of $900.00 a year. I am not yet certain the exact date on which Mrs. Bridge will begin duties, but will advise you as soon as this information is received.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment. Staff questionnaire will be forwarded to you later.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 17, the resignation of Mrs. Katherine Bridge as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School is accepted.\n\nI am also in receipt of your letters of June 17 and July 5, with regard to the Anglican Indian Day Schools. It is noted that you recommend that the Lakalsap School be operated during the academic year 1940-41 for a period of 8 months, namely, from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941. This period is approved, and you should so advise the Anglican Church authorities when you are requesting them to nominate a teacher to be in charge of the school. Please let me know when you have definite information regarding the name and qualifications of the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa,\nAugust 1, 1940.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated July 25 from Rt. Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, in which he writes as follows regarding the Lakalsap School:\n\n\"There has been some criticism of Mrs. Bridge at Lakalsap. She at first resigned but later withdrew this. In view of the great scarcity of teachers and of the very fair work she has done, I would suggest that she be left at Lakalsap. She engages to get some female companionship for the coming year.\"\n\nIn connection with the above I would refer you to my letter of the 17th ultimo in which we accepted the resignation of Mrs. Bridge. From the information contained in your letter of June 17 it appears that Mrs. Bridge was not successful as a teacher and consequently her re-appointment does not seem advisable.\n\nBishop Rix states that there is a dearth of teachers and possibly for this reason he is again recommending Mrs. Bridge.\n\nNo reply will be sent to the Bishop until we hear further from you and I should appreciate an early answer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following are some of the changes in the teaching staff of the Indian Schools and certain cases about which there has been some discussion.\n\nI strongly recommend the following:\n\n1. Mr. Norman Green moved from Kitwancool to Kincolith. This was in accord with the wishes of Mr. Green and the Kincolith people. He is one of our most successful teachers.\n\n2. Mr. B. O. Dixon a recent successful teacher at the Indian Residential School at Elkhorn. He has had splendid experience and is highly recommended. I am convinced that he is the most outstanding man offering. He is suggested to take Mr. Green's place at Kitwancool. We are most fortunate if we are able to get Mr. Dixon.\n\n3. There has been some criticism of Mrs. Bridges at Lakalzap. She at first resigned but later withdrew this. In view of the great scarcity of teachers and of the very fair work she has done, I would suggest that she be left at Lakalzap. She engages to get some female companionship for the coming year.\n\n4. I believe the Inspector urges that two teachers be provided for Aiyansh or as it is sometimes called, Gitlakdamics. There are certainly two teachers needed here. The number of pupils warrants it and there is a house provided for one. Where such an extra teacher can be found I do not know. This year neither the Indian Agent or myself have had any applications from teachers. In case an extra teacher can be found and the Department consents to an appointment at Aiyansh, then my suggestion is that a qualified teacher be sent there as senior teacher and the present teacher, Mr. Kinley, be retained as junior. If a senior teacher is not sent, and I doubt if one can be found, then my suggestion is that Mr. Kinley be again left in charge. He at least\ndoes fair work as a teacher and has many other qualities of a most valuable nature.\n\nAll the other teachers with whom I have to deal remain as last year. Mrs. Smiley, of Massett, at first resigned, but has withdrawn her resignation and is ready to stay at Massett.\n\nConsidering the great dearth of teachers, I think it fortunate if you can secure the services of the above.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

This school will only be open for an eight-month term during the coming academic year; namely, from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment and a new staff questionnaire will not be necessary as Miss Arrowsmith was in charge of the Kingcome Inlet Indian Day School until June 30 last.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th ultimo regarding appointment of a teacher at Lakalsap Indian Day School, I would advise that my letter of June 29th enclosing report of Mr. Inspector Barry of June 21st, recommended that Miss Arrowsmith, formerly at Kingscome Inlet Day School, be considered as successor to Mrs. Bridge at Lakalsap.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to your letter of July 22nd regarding Miss Arrowsmith's resignation from Kingscome Inlet Day School in which it was noted that she had closed the school ten days ahead of time without authorization from the Indian Agent or this Department. Miss Arrowsmith has just called at Mr. Inspector Barry's office, explaining that as the Kingscome Village was entirely deserted by the Indian Residents there was no point in continuing an empty school and that she was unable to contact Mr. Indian Agent Todd within a period of two weeks owing to infrequent mail service. She has explained the situation in a quarterly report.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor P.M.

O. Dixon at Kitamaat has already been approved, and Indian Commissioner MacKay has been so advised.\n\nMrs. Bridge wrote the Department recently and stated that owing to the condition of her health she would be unable to continue teaching during the coming academic year. I am today in receipt of a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay, recommending the appointment of Miss Appoosmith as teacher of the Lekalap School. She was formerly in charge of the Kingcome Inlet School. Her appointment is being approved.\n\nWith reference to the Gitladaanix Bay School, a communication has been received from Indian Commissioner MacKay, recommending the transfer of Mrs. Smiley from the Massett School to the Gitladaanix School. As it is presumed this transfer met with your approval, the appointment of Mrs. Smiley has been approved. In view of the decrease in our appropriation, it was only found possible to appoint one teacher at the Gitladaanix School for the coming academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

Rev. Bishop Rix that Mr. Hayhurst be appointed teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the Bishop's suggestion but you should inform him that the Department cannot see its way clear to approve Mr. Hayhurst's appointment as teacher at any Indian day school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter received from the Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, dated August 30th last, in which he suggests that Mr. Hayhurst, husband of our teacher at the Kitwanga Indian Day School, be given a temporary appointment as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nIt will be remembered that Mrs. Hayhurst was formerly teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School, and that Mr. Hayhurst, who looked after health matters in the Village, was paid a small salary as assistant teacher.\n\nSome years ago, the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix arranged for the transfer of Mr. & Mrs. Hayhurst from the Lakalsap School to the Kitwanga Indian Day School, Babine Agency, without consulting this office, and it was subsequently decided by the Department that salary would not be allowed to Mr. Hayhurst whilst at Kitwanga, the appointment of Mrs. Hayhurst as teacher being, however, approved.\n\nThe Department was originally requested to approve the appointment of Mrs. Hayhurst, a married woman, as teacher at the Lakalsap Indian Day School on the grounds that her husband, through disability, was unable to earn a living for his wife and child.\n\nBishop Rix now suggests that Mr. Hayhurst would prove a satisfactory teacher in an Indian Day School though he holds no academically professional qualifications for such a position.\n\nIt would appear to me highly doubtful that the Department would be justified in placing Mr. Hayhurst in charge of any Indian Day School owing to his lack of qualifications, quite apart from the fact that his appointment at the Lakalsap Indian Day School would involve leaving Mrs. Hayhurst and her child at\nKitwanga without the protection of her husband.\n\nThe matter has been discussed with Inspector Barry who finds himself unable to recommend the appointment of Mr. John Hayhurst as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School. I am, however, forwarding Bishop Rix's letter of nomination for the consideration of the Department though I am not prepared to recommend that Bishop Rix's nomination be accepted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

I believe he covered the work in grade nine. I have asked Mr. Anfield to send a report concerning him direct to the Commissioner. If this report is favourable I would recommend that William McKay be employed at $75.00 per month until a qualified teacher is secured.\n\nThere are forty-two children on the roll at the Lakalsap School in grades as follows:\n\n- Grade 1 - 22\n- Grade 2 - 14\n- Grade 3 - 4\n- Grade 4 - 2\n\nThe boy's father is much respected in the Village and could be counted on to see that his son gave conscientious service.\n\nIf Mr. McKay is given favourable consideration would the Commissioner approve of his being sent to Alert Bay for two weeks for intensive instruction under Mr. Anfield in methods of teaching and management. If this is done I suggest that the salary begin from the time the lad leaves Greenville, he to pay his own expenses. I would appreciate a wire if approval is given by the Department to the above suggestions. I ask this because of the infrequent mail service to Greenville.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

MacKay as teacher pro tem\nat the village of Greenville.\n\nMr. Gillett also makes the suggestion that if\nthe appointment is made, this young man come here for a few weeks to\nbrush up on subject matter and teaching technique.\n\nI am quite willing to recommend that the boy\nbe given a try but I quite honestly have doubts as to his ability to\nsuccessfully teach a room of six grades, most of them young children\nwith but little English. This boy completed Grade IX last year but\ndid not secure the necessary credits to allow him to proceed further\nand I was unable to recommend a continuance of his education to the\nDepartment, in spite of the earnest requests of both his parents and\nthe Bishop of Caledonia. However, in these times of war, we must put\nour suit according to our cloth and it is possible that this young man\nwho has a really good knowledge of English and how to use it, might\nmake a real contribution to his village in this way.\n\nRegarding Mr. Gillett's suggestion that he come\nback here for a few weeks, I am definitely against this, partly on\naccount of the expense but mostly because this is a graded school and\nwe could not give him a picture of the work that he would have to carry\nout in a small ungraded, perhaps over-crowded set-up. My suggestion\nwould be that he be sent to Kincolith to Mr. Green who is an experienced\nand successful school teacher as well as a missionary. The Kincolith\nSchool is comparable in size and grading to that of Greenville and\nyoung MacKay could go there, take extensive notes on work being done,\nactually handle small classes himself and learn the routine.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter dated October 24th received from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett with reference to the temporary employment of William McKay (Indian) as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nA copy of a letter dated October 24th from Mr. Gillett to Mr. Anfield, and a letter dated October 27th from Mr. Anfield are also attached for the information of the Department.\n\nThis whole matter has been discussed in detail with Inspector Barry and both he and I are definitely of the opinion that it would be a very great mistake to employ the Indian as a teacher, either at the Lakalsap school or anywhere else.\n\nInspector Barry points out that William McKay was not even recommended by Mr. Anfield for Grade 10 work at the Alert Bay Superior School and that, regardless of his position or the position of his father in the Greenville Village, the boy has no professional qualifications whatever as a teacher and would not appear to the Inspector to be in any way qualified to be placed in charge of the young Indian children at the Lakalsap school.\n\nWhile the correspondence is being forwarded for the Department's decision in the matter, I am not prepared to recommend the appointment of William McKay, even as a temporary measure. A reply by air mail is requested.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDoctor H.W. McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI know you have much knowledge of the Indian Village School situation in Northern B.C. You know also that I am Bishop of Caledonia and that I am therefore intensely interested in these natives' welfare. Owing to the war and the joining up with the forces on the part of many teachers, it has been found impossible to provide teachers for all the schools. In this diocese there are at present three schools without teachers. During the late summer I had two applications: one from a very young girl and at that time I only knew of one school likely to be vacant and as it was extremely isolated I wrote her advising that she would not consider it; later another girl asked for my nomination, but before it could be arranged she got a school in a white section. An experienced teacher asked to be changed from Greenville to Metlakatla. This I advised against as she had been only a year at Greenville and was well liked there, but she then wrote me that she had decided to remain with her mother for the year as her mother was not well.\n\nI tell you all this to show you the difficulty in getting teachers.\n\nThen I consider a great mistake was made in the letting go of the teacher, Mr. Bryant, of Metlakatla who could have been retained. With the real dearth of teachers, everything should have been done to retain this excellent teacher, one of the best in the North.\nI have searched everywhere for competent teachers. I have asked the B.C. Indian Office to find them. The only condition desired was that they should be Protestant. The Vancouver Office has been unable to find any. Then I began to suggest the temporary appointment of unqualified but really competent persons.\n\nI suggested Mr. Hayhurst the husband of the teacher at Gitwangak. She had taught at Greenville and he assisted her there in a very efficient manner, besides that he was skilled in the dispensing of drugs. Mr. Hayhurst was willing to go to Greenville and the people were anxious to have him but Mr. Barry, the Indian School Inspector, turned it down. Even when there was no one else in sight. Then it occurred to the Indian Agent and myself that a well educated native could fill the position as a temporary expedient and a young man who had done well at a boarding school, William McKay, was suggested. This person was also acceptable to the people of Greenville, but again Mr. Barry turned it down. The Indian Commissioner sends me the answers to my letters but he always says the matter has been referred to Mr. Barry.\n\nEver since I have had anything to do with the Indian Schools in this area, I have found the School Inspector a most difficult man to get along with. He offers no co-operation, especially at this time when everyone ought to do everything in his or her power to carry on. It does seem to me that we ought to be able to look to the officials who have as their sacred duty the welfare of the native people for every possible assistance in making the best of an extremely difficult situation. It is a tragedy that these three schools are closed. It will most seriously set the children back in their education. The natives themselves resent what they mightily consider as a neglect of their right.\nI am writing directly to you and over the head of the Vancouver Office, for we are quite unable to get reasonable co-operation there. I think Major McKay would co-operate, but with Mr. Barry the case seems hopeless. He seems to search out reasons which justify him in opposing any suggestions made by anyone else.\n\nI can assure you that I am not alone in my objections. May I hope that you will give us the authority to fill vacant schools during the war with any reasonably qualified person so that the children upon whom so much effort has already been spent may not slip back.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n19th November, 1941.\n\nSKEENA RIVER AGENCY\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF OCTOBER\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is regretted that there is no teacher at Greenville or at Metlakatla. It is unfortunate that the Department did not see there way to agree to the scheme submitted by the Agent. The native children could be at school rather than running around the village and could at least have been kept from slipping back in their studies and losing interest entirely. My experience and observations over a period of some twenty-three years among Indians shows that Native teachers have done some very good work in their respective villages. Massett Village had no less than four Indian teachers of whom none had even eighth grade tuition and the proof of their success is the fact that most of the prominent men of this village today were their pupils. Some of the credit for this must be due to these teachers. I cannot see the reason for thinking that it would be better to let the schools remain closed rather than have unqualified teachers. A person with grade nine standing should be able to teach the \"three R's\" which is all the education a good many Indians require for practical purposes.\n\nJ.Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 22, 1941.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by me from the Right Reverend G. A. Hix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, and also a copy of my reply thereto.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of fully qualified teachers that now exists in the province of British Columbia, I have been wondering if you could submit for departmental consideration certain recommendations that would meet even temporarily existing conditions. The shortage of teachers in British Columbia, I should add, is more acute than in any of the other provinces.\n\nWould it be possible for you to discuss this matter with the officials of the Department of Education at Victoria? If the provincial authorities have experienced difficulty in securing the teachers necessary to operate the public schools in the province, they might be willing to release a limited number of the more successful normal school pupils at the end of the Christmas term. If they are unwilling to do this, they might supply you with the list of candidates awaiting entrance to Normal, and from these you might be able to select a few fairly successful teachers.\n\nIt is the opinion of the officials here that if we must employ teachers lacking professional standing, these teachers should at least be mature men and women and not teen-age boys and girls. Your immediate attention to this matter will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, November 22, 1941.\n\nMy dear Bishop Rix:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your unsigned letter of November 12, in which you discuss the difficulty experienced by you in securing fully qualified teachers for a number of Indian day schools in your diocese.\n\nIt is perhaps inevitable that in a critical period such as this a shortage of qualified teachers should develop and that circumstances may arise whereby we shall be compelled to select the best teaching material available, regardless of professional standing.\n\nThe experience of the officials in the Welfare and Training Division, however, has been that with a few rare exceptions the employment of teachers other than those with full professional standing is a sheer waste of public funds.\n\nIndian day and residential schools are, as you know, subjected to very severe criticism from time to time, and I am personally disposed to think that this criticism will increase as tax imposts become more burdensome. You will readily appreciate, therefore, that the greatest care must be exercised by our officials in the selection of teachers and in the general conduct of our educational institutions.\n\nI note that you refer to the case of William McKay, a native, who might have been employed to take charge at the Laskalsap (Greenville) School. The records indicate that this school has an enrolment -\n\nRight Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nenrolment at this date of 45 pupils and that McKay himself did not succeed while in attendance at the Alert Bay Residential School in passing his Grade X examination. The Principal of the Alert Bay School, to whom this case was referred, in a letter dated October 27, 1941, states:\n\n\"I am quite willing to recommend that this boy be given a try, but I quite honestly have doubts as to his ability to successfully teach a room of six grades, most of them young children with but little knowledge of English. The boy completed Grade IX last year but did not secure the necessary credits to allow him to proceed further.\"\n\nI can readily understand the hesitancy on the part of our officials in British Columbia to recommend the employment of this boy, with this expression of opinion from Mr. Anfield in front of them. I regret, therefore, that I cannot accede to the request contained in the last paragraph of your letter. However, I am today communicating with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, asking him to discuss the shortage of teachers in the province, not only with the members of his own field staff, but with the provincial authorities at Victoria. It is just possible that the provincial authorities might be willing to release a number of pupils who have had a limited amount of normal training.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn your agency report for October you refer to the inability of the church authorities and the Department to secure teachers for the Greenville and Metlakatla Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department is anxious that no misunderstanding should arise in respect to the attempts that have been made this year to secure fully qualified teachers for the operation of our schools. With the exception of a few schools in British Columbia and one or two in the province of Ontario, we have succeeded in securing fully qualified teachers for all the vacancies that have occurred this year.\n\nI am disposed to think that our Indian day and residential schools have been subjected to more criticism during the last year than they have been at any time in recent years. Therefore, the utmost care must be exercised by our officials in the direction of these institutions. With one or two rare exceptions, our experience in the Department has been that the employment of teachers, other than those with experience or with full academic and professional standing, is a sheer waste of public funds. The recommendation received by us, that Mr. McKay be employed at the Greenville School, was referred to the Principal of the residential school at which this boy had received his education. The Principal, in commenting upon the proposal, states:\n\n\"I am quite willing to recommend that this boy be given a try but I quite honestly have doubts as to his ability to successfully teach a room of six grades, most of them young children with but little English. This boy completed Grade IX last year but did not secure the necessary credits to allow him to proceed further.\"\n\nThe Director has already communicated with the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, asking him to discuss with his field officials the shortage of teachers in the province of B.C. and to forward certain recommendations in respect to how the schools now vacant should be operated. The Director, in his letter to the Commissioner, suggested that the provincial authorities might be prepared to release a number of students now in training.\n\nJ. Billett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nin training at the normal school at the beginning of the new year. The Director in his communication also intimates that if we are compelled to employ teachers lacking full academic and professional standing we should at least make an attempt to secure mature men and women and not teen-age boys and girls. It is altogether likely that you will hear from Commissioner MacKay in respect to this matter in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, November 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Gillett, in the report of his agency for October, is somewhat critical of the Department for our failure to accept his recommendation in respect to teachers that might have been employed at the Greenville and Metlakatla Indian Day Schools. The Agent states:\n\n\"It is regretted that there is no teacher at Greenville or at Metlakatla. It is unfortunate that the Department did not see their way to agree to the scheme submitted by the Agent. The native children should be at school rather than running round the village and could at least have been kept from slipping back in their studies and losing interest entirely.

I am strongly in favour of treating the situation as an emergency arising from war conditions and meeting it in the means at hand. Hence the reason that William McKay and Leonard Leighton of Greenville and Metlakatla respectively were recommended to be appointed as teachers.\"\n\nIt occurred to me that you should have in front of you these comments, received by the Department from Indian Agent Gillett, when you are reviewing the problem presented by the shortage of teachers in British Columbia, as suggested in a letter already sent forward to you by the Director.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 5, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI have received your letter of November 22nd, your file 168-35-1, with enclosures regarding the vacancies in certain Indian Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nIt would not be unfair to say that Bishop Rix himself is to some extent responsible for the vacancies in two of the schools in his diocese, inasmuch as he refused to agree to the transfer of Miss Arrowsmith from Lakalsap to Metlakatla, and the appointment of Miss Bird to Lakalsap, succeeding Miss Arrowsmith. Eventually Bishop Rix did agree to nominate Miss Bird for the Metlakatla School but the delay in his doing so resulted in Miss Bird's acceptance of a position in one of the Provincial schools. Miss Arrowsmith resigned and left the Province.\n\nThe reasons given by the Bishop for his stand in these cases were that he wished Miss Arrowsmith to remain at Lakalsap, despite the fact that she had requested a transfer, and that Miss Bird was too young a woman to go into an Indian village where there was not another white person. Miss Bird was at that time twenty-nine years of age and had over four years experience at the Mamillilikulla Indian Day School as well as some three years previous experience as a supervisor and teacher at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton.\n\nThe chief objection to the appointment of Mr. Hayhurst to Greenville, apart altogether from his lack of proper qualifications, is that his wife is the teacher at the Indian day school at Kitwanga, two widely separated points. Aside from this, the employment of man and wife at two different centers is likely to prove the subject of criticism.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nDecember 5, 1941.\n\nWith regard to the services of Mr. Bryant at Metlakatla, the Department will remember that his work was not satisfactory there. Indeed, it was of such a nature that, considering his age and lack of Normal School training, he could not be retained in a village where even the Indians had asked for his removal.\n\nInspector Barry has advised that the appointment of teen-age Indian boys as teachers in our schools, when such boys have not completed high school, could not be recommended by him for the following reasons:\n\n1. The teaching of elementary reading, writing, and arithmetic to beginners is one of the most difficult duties of even professional teachers. No hope of success could be expected in the case of young persons lacking even the most elementary training in methods.\n\n2. Young Indians would not command the respect of the children, and it is highly doubtful if such persons should be given the charge of young Indian girls in school. Moral questions are involved not to mention the difficulties in regard to discipline and possible punishment of pupils.\n\nI may say that I am disposed to agree with the Inspector in this respect.\n\nIt would probably be as well to mention here that one of the young Indians suggested by Bishop Rix as a possible teacher did not have a satisfactory record at Coqualeetza. Bishop Rix could not be aware of the records of the various Indian children going through our schools and may very easily make bad mistakes in all good faith.\n\nThe B.C. Normal School training is for one year only. Those seeking admission to either the Vancouver or Victoria Normal Schools make application in August and therefore the Provincial Department of Education would have no idea what candidates would apply for enrolment next year.\nI should like to emphasize that I am not opposed to the appointment of an Indian as a teacher at any of our schools, provided the Indian has the required training and is otherwise qualified for such duties. The employment of unqualified and only partly educated persons in our schools, even if only as a temporary measure, may easily lead to the loss of the services of some qualified person who may subsequently apply for a position, it being perhaps difficult to immediately dispense with the services of the person temporarily in charge of the school.\n\nDuring the last few days candidates for two vacancies were interviewed. The nomination of Miss L.W. Faithfull for the Hazelton Indian Day School was forwarded to the Department by air mail a few days ago, and the United Church is submitting the name of Mr. E.G. Moyer for the vacancy at Cape Mudge caused through the recent resignation of Mrs. Goodrich.\n\nInspector Barry has obtained the names and addresses of a number of candidates who had previously applied to the Provincial Inspector of Schools in this city and I am communicating with these persons with a view to having them interview our Inspector should they be interested in Indian school work.\n\nI regret that Bishop Rix has seen fit to criticize our officials. Inspector Barry and Inspector Coleman have done their utmost to secure suitable teachers for the existing vacancies in our schools, but conditions are not normal, and the refusal of Bishop Rix to cooperate in the matter of the transfer and appointment referred to in the second paragraph of this letter was responsible for the loss of two trained teachers to our service this year. Every effort is being made to secure sufficiently qualified persons to take charge of the schools now vacant for the last half of the school year commencing in January, and I have reason to feel that the situation is likely to resolve itself within the next two weeks.\n\nThe nomination of a teacher to fill the vacancy at Chehalis has been made by His Excellency Archbishop Duke and it is going forward to the Department tomorrow.\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nDecember 5, 1941.\n\nI was pleased to receive a call from the Right Reverend G.A. Rix this morning, when I endeavored to explain to him the difficulties in the way of securing qualified teachers at this time and the Department's reasons for not approving the appointment of unqualified, and in other ways unsuitable, Indians to take charge of our schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

This school will only be in operation until May 31, 1942, and consequently during the balance of this academic year Mr. Stewart should be paid from February 1 to May 31, 1942. I enclose copy of letter of appointment and the other forms will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the vacancy for a teacher at the Lakalsap Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency, and Departmental letter 186-35-1 of January 12th 1942, I may say that I am now in receipt of a telegram from Right Rev., G. A. Rix, D. D. Bishop of Caledonia, in which he nominates Mr. Noel Stewart, at present on the staff of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, as teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School from February 1st, 1942.\n\nMr. Stewart's qualifications are well known to the Department as he was in charge of the Hazelton Indian Day School and later the senior division of the Alert Bay Indian Day School before going to Lytton. He also taught at St. Paul's Indian Day School at Cardston, Alta., from 1931 to 1936.\n\nMr. Stewart has a permanent First Class Certificate (Alberta) and has attended the Provincial Summer School in Victoria on two occasions, 1937 and 1939.\n\nUnder the circumstances - and I may say that this matter has been discussed in detail with Inspector Barry - I would recommend that Bishop Rix's nomination be accepted and that Mr. Noel Stewart be appointed teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School as from February 1st, 1942.\n\nI should be glad to have the Department's decision by air mail and to know the salary that will be allowed Mr. Stewart at the Lakalsap School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Under the circumstances I am retaining the questionnaire, forms etc., which were forwarded with the Departmental Air Mail letter of the 8th instant mentioned above.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to my Air Mail letter 15/8/3893 of the 5th instant, in which it was suggested that Miss Dorothy Strickland be appointed on a temporary basis as Teacher of the Lakalsap Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nI have this morning received a letter from Miss Strickland, a copy of which is attached for the information of the Department, in which she withdraws her application for the above mentioned position.\n\nWhen Miss Strickland called here she informed me that her health was good and that she had no hesitation, whatever, in going to such an out-of-the way Indian Day School as Lakalsap. However, when Miss Strickland sought a private interview with Inspector Barry on the night of January 6th, and of course, subsequent to my letter to the Department quoted above, she brought with her a member of her Church Committee and the conditions at the Lakalsap Indian Day School were fully discussed in their conference with Inspector Barry.\n\nCaptain Barry informs me that Miss Strickland admitted at this conference, that she had had some sort of a nervous breakdown in China during the Japanese occupation of her area, but that this break down was not entirely due to war conditions, she did not wish to discuss with the Inspector the family matters also involved.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nInspector Barry is inclined to agree with the decision of the Missionary Committee of the Church of Scotland here that, under the circumstances, it would be better for Miss Strickland to seek easier work than that involved at the Lakelsap School, and I would, therefore, request the Department to cancel Miss Strickland's application for the teaching position at that School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEncl.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commission,\nBox 70,\nVancouver,\n\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nI beg to withdraw my application for the post as teacher at the Lakalsap Indian Day School. I regret very much having to do this. Since making my application I have received a letter from Scotland for the Church of Scotland Women's Foreign Mission secretary (as you know I am one of their missionaries) instructing me that I should consult the rest of our missionaries here on any work I propose taking up. In view of my recent nervous trouble (even though I am now fit for work again) these other missionaries consider that the work at Lakalsap is too hard with which to make a beginning. I myself felt I could undertake it, and, when I made my application, I honestly believed I had the right to do so without consulting the rest of our missionaries. I think it is my duty to the Church of Scotland Missions Committee to take the advice of these missionaries, and try myself out in lighter work than the Lakalsap School.\n\nI regret the inconvenience I have caused you, and hope, when my health proves to that it is good enough to take up such work, that you may consider a later application on my part.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"D. Strickland\".\nOttawa,\nJanuary 8, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant the Department approves the appointment of Miss Dorothy Strickland as teacher of the Lekalsap Indian Day School. She will be allowed salary at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month plus bonus and it is understood that the school will be in operation to May 31, 1942.\n\nI was especially pleased in this case to note that Inspector Barry is giving her some assistance. At another Indian day school we have a teacher who returned recently from foreign missionary work and she is not very familiar with educational work in Canada at the present time, although she herself is no doubt well educated. It is, therefore, very important that Miss Strickland should be given every possible assistance. I attach the necessary forms which you should have her complete and return to this office as soon as possible. Please arrange to have the forms addressed to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Some of this experience was as Governess in private schools and families, where she taught children up to grade 6.\n\nMiss Strickland has recently returned from China where she was engaged as a Missionary Instructor in Industrial Arts and Crafts. As her area of work was included in a War zone it was necessary for her to leave China and she is now forced to remain in Canada, as it is impossible for her to return to England during the present emergency.\n\nMiss Strickland has lived by herself at various times while in China and she has no hesitation whatever, in going to an out-of-the way Indian Day School.\n\nThe matter of her qualifications has been discussed with Inspector Barry, who considers that she might easily prove highly successful in charge of Lakalsap Indian Day School. He has arranged to give her the necessary assistance with regard to the educational work that she would be called on to undertake.\nI would recommend that Miss Dorothy Strickland be appointed Teacher of Lakalsap School on a temporary basis to May 31st, 1942, as this particular school operates on an eight months' basis from October 1, to May 31st yearly.\n\nI should be glad if the Department will let me have a decision in this case by Air Mail as I am anxious to have the Lakalsap School opened at the earliest possible date, at the same time advising me of the salary to be allowed Miss Strickland.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

She was hoping that she might be transferred to some other school, hence the reason she did not hand in her resignation at our office.\n\nShe was not a complete success at Greenville, the isolation during the winter caused a nervous breakdown. Her tactlessness at the beginning antagonized the children and the people.\n\nI visited the school twice during her stay there and in spite of above remarks I consider that the younger children made fair progress. She may be more successful in a village less isolated and in a smaller school.\n\nJ.

However, I consider that we should regard this school as vacant and I have asked Bishop Rix to nominate another teacher for the position.\n\nMrs. McConnachie's application for another school could be considered when received should a school become available suitable to her qualifications and temperament.\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.M.

A. Rix\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith the nomination of Bishop Rix of Miss Ann Schmidt as teacher at Lakalsap (Greenville) Indian Day School in the Skeena Agency.\n\nMiss Schmidt left recently to take the position as dispenser at Kitkatla but as it was impossible to secure a teacher for Lakalsap and she appeared to be qualified for the position so far as she could be without professional training it was considered advisable to have her take over the school, particularly as the Indians had been pressing very strongly for the appointment of an old Indian as teacher. Miss Schmidt has been interviewed by this office and the Provincial Inspector of Schools, Major Manning, and we are satisfied that she could carry out the work. It is proposed that she commence her duties with the opening of the school term in the New Year at a salary of $95.00 per month, plus Cost of Living Bonus.\n\nD.M.

The weather is still very mild, and with the big tides which are beginning this week, it is thought that the ice will break up and come out.\n\nI radioed Greenville that the teachers were at Kincolith, and to make arrangements for their transportation at the first opportunity.

This man, age 38, is Canadian born (Winnipeg), of Polish descent, married with 3 children. The two oldest boys 11 and 16, are going to Vancouver Island in the fall to relatives. The youngest, a girl of 6 will stay with the parents. The wife appears to be a nice type of person. Uruski informs me he has no academic experience in teaching, but that he taught his own children as the family have lived in isolated places for years. He states that he did two (2) years at the University of Western Ontario at London, Ontario, in a pre-medical and science course. He has his matriculation in Ontario.\n\nHe is not an overly-energetic type, but he seems interested in the Indians and is keen to tackle Greenville. His wife offers to take on the dispenser's work. Uruski states he is a non-smoker and non-drinker. In view of the extreme difficulty in getting anyone for this village, the appointment of Uruski as teacher and his wife as dispenser is recommended. Appointment to be as at Prince Rupert and we will make arrangements to take them in. He could go in early and could do some work for a couple of weeks repairing the teacherage, school and sidewalks.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.

(RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-3, part 1)\nOttawa, July 16th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the June quarter return of the Lakalsap Indian Day School. Cheques for the full quarter's salary are being forwarded to the teachers.\n\nI note, however, that the school was only open for 24 days during the quarter, and from a note on the return it appears that the main reason for the school not being open for a longer time was the absence of the Indians from the Reserve. Would it not be possible to keep this school open during July and August, and have the holidays taken at that period of the year when the Indians are away from the Reserve for fishing? Between September 1st, last, and June 30th, of this year, the school was only open for 163 days, but salary has been allowed for the full ten months, and it is felt that, as the teachers were at the school, they were entitled to receive their salary. I would, however, appreciate having your views as to whether any arrangement could be made that would insure the school being open for a longer period during the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nof educating Indian children, as it not only takes them away from an environment not always conducive to their best interests, but ensures regular attendance at school throughout the year.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Moore are doing good work at Greenville and are endeavoring to keep the school open as long as possible. I am therefore glad that they have been allowed their full salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.B.S. J.J.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 16th last relative to the Greenville Indian Day School and in reply would state it would not be possible to keep the school open during the months of July and August as suggested as the Indians are all away at the canneries during these months.\n\nSeptember, October, November, December, January and February are generally the best school months during the year. Early in March the Indians leave for Fishery Bay to engage in the oolachan fishing and they do not return to the village until about the middle of April. In May they are constantly on the move putting in their potato gardens etc., and on the 15th June a general exodus takes place to the different canneries at the estuaries of the Skeena and Nass Rivers and they do not return to the villages before the end of August.\n\nThe great problem in connection with the school work in this Agency is the fact that the Indians are away from the villages so much throughout the year in pursuit of their living, the children accompany their parents there being no way of looking after them in the villages\u2014thus they lose their attendance at school.\n\nAttempts were made in the past to carry on school work at Fishery Bay during the time the Indians were encamped there and also at one or two of the canneries at the mouth of the river but with little success as the very children who should have attended school were usually engaged helping their parents in the fishing or working in the canneries.\n\nThe establishment of a boardingschool for the Agency is a great need and is the only successful way\nOttawa, August 23rd, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, relative to the teaching period at the Lakalsap (Greenville) Indian Day School. It is noted that the Indians are away at the canneries during the months of July and August and that it would not be possible to keep the school open during that period. It is further noted that from September of each year to the following March are generally the best school months as the Indian parents are then residing near the school. The teachers should carry on the work as formerly, keeping the school in operation as long as there is sufficient attendance. It is noted that both Mr. and Mrs. Moore are doing good work and the Department will keep in mind the circumstances as mentioned by you in connection with the period the school is open and due consideration will be given to the payment of the salaries of the teachers for the full year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-3, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nJ. M. Weaver \"First Aid Man and Dispenser\" at Lakalsap has been overpaid salary from October 1, 1931, to April 30, 1932 - 7 months - at $30 per month, a total of $210, which was paid from B. C. Vote. Deductions should be made by cheque from School Vote for credit of B. C. Vote at the end of the June quarter. This overpayment occurred owing to the Agent including Mr. Weaver's name on the quarterly pay list from his Agency \"as Dispenser\", File 68-168 B. $90 of the amount is to be deducted from Mr. Weaver's June quarter salary and, should it be necessary, $120 from Mrs. Weaver's salary, in order to make up the overpayment.\n\nMr. Weaver's salary is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1932-33, and is to be paid from that Vote.\nOttawa, May 3, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that there has been an overpayment in the salary of J. M. Weaver, First Aid man and dispenser at Lakalsap. As you were informed by official letter of August 18, 1931, Mr. Weaver's salary was to be at the rate of $30 per month. The Department neglected to inform you that, while his duties were to be as above, his salary would be paid as assistant teacher and that it would, therefore, not be necessary for you to include his name on your monthly pay list.\n\nAs Mr. Weaver's name was on your pay list each month, cheques were inadvertently issued in his favour from B. C. Vote from October 1, 1931, to the end of April, a period of seven months. He was also paid at the rate of $30 per month from the Appropriation for Indian Education, and cheques for $90 in his favour were issued and sent at the end of the December quarter and at the end of the March quarter. There was, therefore, an overpayment made him of $150, which amount should be refunded by Mr. Weaver or same will be deducted from the salary of his wife and himself at the end of the June quarter. It is presumed you informed Mr. Weaver of the salary that would be allowed in his case, and it is not understood why he accepted duplicate payments.\n\nYou should not include Mr. Weaver's name on your monthly pay list in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. F. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst. regarding the overpayment to Mr. J.M. Weaver, dispenser at Greenville, Mass. I do not understand why he has not mentioned the matter as he was certainly given to understand at the time of his engagement and Mrs. Weaver's in the Commissioner's office at Victoria, that his salary would be $20.00 per month.\n\nI very much regret this mistake as repayment of $180.00 in a lump sum will be a hardship to the Weavers, in their circumstances. I am writing them, and as soon as a reply has been received, will communicate further with the Department.\n\nAs requested, Mr. Weaver's name has been discontinued on our pay list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the overpayment to Mr. W.J. Weaver, Dispenser at Greenville, Nass River, I beg to enclose herewith Bank draft for the sum of $150.00 in settlement of same. Mr. Weaver states that he understood from the School Inspector that he would recommend an additional salary for his assistance in the Day school and therefore when the extra cheque was received he considered that the recommendation had been made and acted upon. I am sure there was no intention on the part of Mr. Weaver to take advantage of the mistake made by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDUPLICATE, FOR THE DEPARTMENT\n\nBANK OF MONTREAL\n\n$160.00\n\nVICTORIA, B.C., JUNE 19 32\n\nAppearing at the Receiver General's credit at this Bank is\nthe sum of ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS\n\nreceived from E.

(RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-3, part 1)**\nOttawa, August 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 21st instant, recommending the appointment of Miss Pennington as teacher of the Lekslap (Greenville) Indian Day School for the coming school year and Miss G. Parker, graduate nurse, to take charge of dispensary and health matters. In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Appointment Miss Pennington as teacher Greenville School approved. Salary ninety dollars per teaching month, less ten per cent. No funds to pay salary dispenser. Services Miss Parker not required.\"\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a dispenser and matron, I have to say that it has been found necessary, owing to a considerable cut in our Appropriation, to discontinue the services of a dispenser at quite a number of our schools and reserves. Therefore, it will not be possible to approve of the appointment of Miss Parker for this work.\n\nYou should inform Miss Pennington of her appointment and arrange with her to take up duties as early as possible in September. Full particulars should be forwarded to the Department regarding her Christian name and the qualifications and experience which she possesses. It is noted that her appointment has been recommended by Mr. Inspector Barry. When writing concerning Miss Pennington's qualifications, etc., you should also state the date on which she began duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nOttawa, August 25, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 24th instant, advising that, owing to the isolation of the school at Lakeland (Greenville), reconsideration be given to the appointment of Miss G. Parker as dispenser.\n\nIn reply I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Appointment Miss Parker assistant at Greenville approved STOP Salary Thirty Dollars per teaching month less ten percent.\"\n\nMiss Parker is to act as dispenser and give attention to health matters on the Reserve. There is no position classified as dispenser or field matron for this Reserve, and Miss Parker's classification will, therefore, be that of assistant teacher. She should prepare, and forward through your office, from time to time, a brief report, stating, in detail, the duties which she carries out.\n\nIt will not be necessary for you to include her name on your pay list. Her cheque will be sent at the end of each quarter at the same time as the teacher's salary is being sent. As stated in our telegram, the salary we can allow Miss Parker will be at the rate of $70 per month, less 10% for the ten teaching months in the year.\n\nIt is hoped that both Miss Pennington and Miss Parker will meet with every success in their work. I would request that you give them any assistance you can.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarter return of the Lakalsap Indian Day School and it is noted that the school was only open for ten days during the month of September. Please let me know the exact date on which Miss Pennington and Miss Parker began duties in order that the Department can decide what amount of salary should be allowed them for the period they taught the school during the month of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.

She was not able to arrive at the village earlier on account of transportation difficulties and had not been notified in time to avail herself of the monthly gasboat trip up river which carries mail and passengers.\n\nOwing to the fact that it was not Miss Pennington's fault that school did not open at the beginning of the term, I would strongly recommend that she be paid in full.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\nFor Quarter Ended September 30th, 1933.\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Miss M.H.

The old stove is badly cracked and unsafe and should be replaced by a new stove. The chimney at present runs through the side of the building and has been the cause of several small fires. I would recommend that it be taken through the roof and vitrified pipe used above the ceiling as an added protection against fire. The floor of the schoolroom should also be painted. The approximate cost of a new stove and alterations would be as follows:\n\n- 1 Circulator heater stove, $50.00.\n- 16 Ft. 8in vitrified pipe @ 65\u00a2 per ft., $10.00.\n- 1 Sk. cement, $1.25.\n- Lumber and nails, $6.00.\n- 2 Galls floor paint @ $6.00, $12.00.\n- 1 Paint brush, $.75.\n- Labour, $23.00.\n- Freight on material from Prince Rupert, $7.00.\n\nTotal, $110.00.\n\nA sum of One hundred dollars was placed in the estimates to provide for a new floor for this school. In view however of the greater need of a new stove and the carrying out of the alterations to the chimney, I would recommend that the money, if available, be expended in this way. If sanctioned I shall be glad of an early reply as the work should be taken in hand as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

It is noted that the approximate cost of the above will be $130.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB.

Since the estimates were prepared, the teacher has reported that the shingles of the teacher's residence are in bad shape and should be replaced immediately before another winter sets in. The total sum required for repairs amounts to approximately $173.00. If it is not possible to have all the work done, I would recommend that the reshingling of the roof, and renewal of the terra cotta chimney be given first consideration and if funds are available, the foundation ought to be done. The school toilets also should be attended to.\n\nThe work will be carried out by Indian labor under the supervision of Mr. Hayhurst, assistant teacher.\n\nAs the building is very old repairs are needed each year.\n\nI shall be glad to be advised as early as possible in the matter.\n\nThe other requisitions for classroom, domestic and teacher's residence supplies are recommended.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 26, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant with reference to repairs required at the Lamlamp Indian Day School.

C.\n\nThe Department sanctioned a sum in excess of $300.00 for repairs and equipment for this school, estimate of which cost was based on a report of the teacher who retired in June 1946. When I visited the School in October I found the condition of this teacherage to be such that a great deal more money would be needed than appeared necessary when the funds were requisitioned. The building is not really habitable without extensive repairs and on my return I approached the Bishop for the use of the Mission House if a teacher were secured for Greenville. He agreed that we could have free use of the Mission House which was without equipment or furnishings. An inventory of equipment at the School teacherage was taken and kept on file. In December, the Bishop informed me he had nominated Rev. Arthur Chapman as teacher and that he would arrive in Prince Rupert on January 3rd, 1947 to proceed at once to Greenville. Mr. Chapman had a wife and child coming with him and in view of the extreme need of implementing the furnishings and equipment at this school, I purchased and shipped these with Mr. Chapman's personal effects to Kincolith for transhipment to Greenville. At the last minute Mr. Chapman took ill and was unable to come and we had to have his personal effects returned from the Naas River and shipped east to him. The equipment, furnishings and supplies on the invoices attached have been stored at Kincolith and will be available for a teacher when appointed. It is recommended that the vouchers be approved and paid from votes available.\n\nIf a teacher is secured for Greenville, he or she can occupy the Mission House which with equipment there and the new supplies referred to herein, will make a comfortable home.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-35-5 WT\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of March 13th and vouchers 272 and 265 referred to therein.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Anfield used an accountable advance, forwarded to him for labour in connection with repairs to the Lakalsap Indian Day School, reference Mr. Neary's letter of August 23rd last, for the purchase of furnishings for the Anglican Mission House on the Reserve, plus an additional $42.17 for the same purpose. Of the $313.25 requested by Mr. Anfield, in his letter of August 15th, a copy of which was forwarded to you, only a small amount was required for repairs to the teacherage, and it is not seen why the repairs to the school and outbuildings could not have been carried out.\n\nAs the matter stands the Lakalsap School building, teacherage and outbuildings are still in need of repairs and an unauthorized expenditure of $191.17 has been made for furnishing the Mission House to which we have no right of occupancy, and which would not be available to us should the church appoint a missionary who would be unsuitable as a teacher.\n\nThe vouchers above referred to cover expenditures not authorized by this office or by the Department and until I have your views in the matter I am not prepared to issue a Purchase Order or recommend payment of the accounts. It is considered that Mr. Anfield should be instructed definitely that funds forwarded to him shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the advance was made without Departmental approval.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay in which he has forwarded your letter of March 13th in regard to the Lakalsap School.\n\nIt is evident from these letters that the money which you were forwarded for making repairs to the Lakalsap School has been expended for other purposes. This is contrary to all Departmental regulations.\n\nAn accountable advance forwarded to an Indian Agent for a specific purpose should not be diverted to any other use. Please adhere to these instructions in the future.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo regarding Indian Agent Anfield's letter of March 13th and voucher 272-265. We enclose for your information a copy of our letter of today's date to Indian Agent Anfield.\n\nWhile the procedure was irregular, the equipment has now been purchased by our Agent and under the circumstances we feel it should be paid for. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would issue the usual purchase order.\n\nBernard F.

Vancouver.\n\nRe your 12-11-3 of August 28th, 1947, the 1947-48 Estimates requested a total of $1,750.00 for repairs to Day Schools. It was anticipated at that time that at least part of the new building programme could have been put in hand this year, particularly at Metlakatla, Lakalsap, Hartley Bay and Kitkatla. The items requested were for temporary patching only. In view of the statement of the Department that no new schools can be built this year, it is considered that these repairs be put in hand immediately in order to keep these buildings in operation until such time as a building programme can be undertaken.\n\nIt should also be said that these estimates for 1947-48 were prepared at the time when I was supervising two Agencies. I dictated those for the Skeena River Agency to Mr. Findlay who drew them up at my request whilst I was preparing those for Bella Coola in the southern part of the territory. Had I known that no new buildings could be constructed this year, the requests for repairs could have been several times the total submitted. It is noted that $45,500.00 was included for new buildings this year and it is hoped that part of this vote might be transferred to the needed repairs.\n\nfor F.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., Box 70,\nVancouver.\n\nRe attached voucher no. 974 for freighting of supplies from Arrandale to Greenville, this account is recommended for payment on the grounds that the Indians were at the peak of the coho fishing at that time when Mrs. Cameron landed at Arrandale. Mr. Victor McKay who is the father of a large family stepped fishing to take Mrs. Cameron and her freight (departmental material including a kitchen range, chesterfield suite and school material and equipment) up to Greenville to get the school open for the term.\n\nI checked with the Cannery and found that average earnings were $75.00 a day that week.

The need for draining is apparently partly due to the small creek referred to in the Agent's letter forming a new channel across the site of the existing building and proposed school. Inspector Davey reports that on his last visit to this reserve he checked on the possibility of locating the school at some other point but the whole area of the village is low lying and there appeared to be no alternative other than to erect the new school adjacent to the old building.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApplication is made for an accountable advance in the sum of $200.00 for draining and clearing land on the Lakalsap Indian Reserve, Greenville, Naas River, B. C. It is planned to build a new school in this village next spring and I would like to undertake the digging and draining as well as clearing of this property as soon as possible. There is a creek behind the playing field at Greenville which is draining out under the school and across the lot on which it is proposed to erect the new school. This creek will have to be detoured involving considerable digging. The weather is still open and we could get this done, I believe, before the freeze-up.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.

It is considered that Indian labour will be available for the next month who can be put to work clearing these sites. At Hartley Bay, the site is heavily overgrown and some stumps will have to be shot. At Greenville there are stumps to be removed and overgrowth to be taken off. At Kincolith the site is in fairly clear condition but a drainage ditch should be dug immediately in case the river rises to that point whilst construction is under way. It is further recommended that $300.00 be made available as an accountable advance for each of these schools so that the sites can be prepared for staking out without further delay. This entails a total of $900.00 and the necessary advice is recommended and the Department's instructions requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Lakalsap Indian Day School\n\nIn view of the increased need for pupilage accommodation at the Lakalsap Indian Day School, we have, since early October, been communicating with Superintendent Anfield, with a view to arranging temporary accommodation in an Indian hall. Our arrangements have now progressed to the point where we have the services of the teacher assured and have for consideration a proposal from Mr. Anfield involving an expenditure of approximately $1,100.00 for improvements to the building, to make it suitable for classroom use and for the provision of accommodation for the teacher.\n\nI might mention at this time that we certainly did not anticipate that an expenditure of this amount would be necessary but are assured by Mr. Anfield that the building cannot be prepared for school use for less and that the materials required will be put to good use when new school accommodation is provided.\n\nMr. Anfield's letter of November 1st and enclosures dealing with the expenditure necessary are attached hereto and as it would appear that there is little likelihood of our plans for the construction of the new school at this point being proceeded with for some time, I would recommend approval of the expenditure required.\n\nI am writing under separate cover with regard to the appointment of a teacher for this second classroom.\n\n[Signature]\nH.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lakalsap, (Greenville) Indian Day School, Second Classroom\n\nRe, letter of October 6th, file 2-11-3-168 and paragraphs 1 and 3 thereof in particular.\n\nIt was impossible to ascertain the exact amount of money required to put in the second classroom at this village, as there was some indefiniteness as to the type of quarters required for the teacher. Had Mrs. Moraes gone to Greenville, she could have lived with Mrs. Cameron; this however is out as she has declined the position. Mr. D. A. Galford is proceeding to Greenville tomorrow and he will have to live in separate quarters. It has therefore been necessary to do extensive alterations to the old hall, loaned to the Department by the Greenville Band to make both a classroom and living quarters for the teacher, suitable for the severe weather experienced in this village during the winter.\n\nIt was also necessary to line the ceiling of the present teacherage, as on examination, prior to the return of Mrs. Cameron it was found that this building had deteriorated further and to get through the winter, the ceiling of this teacherage should be lined with Donnaconna Board.\n\nWill you therefore cancel the 37 A forms enclosed with my letter of Oct. 6th and substitute the ones attached and if at all possible, forward Purchase Orders to cover same immediately. Labor on this job is estimated at $487.30, which amount includes the work to be done in the present teacherage as well as lining up and partitioning the new hall to provide a classroom and two room suite.\nOttawa, November 7, 1969.\n\nHonourable:\n\nHONOURABLE\n\nNorth Bay, Kinnellith and Latchop\n\nIndian Day Schools\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1968-69 is the sum of $35,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teachers' residences on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Valmilet, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school, and obtained teachers' residences and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Kamloops for $39,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a separate school at Valmilet.\n\nAt Cape Mudge, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teachers' residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc. We are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Mudge School was $29,754.75.\n\nAt Fort Stikine, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teachers' but received one tender only, in the amount of $67,392.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices demanded by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nRegardless to whether or not the Department are proceeding with a new building, at this point, we will have actively operating in this village, a two room school complete with quarters for both teachers and with the quarters for each.\n\nImmediate approval of these works is recommended and your instructions requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfe/a/ym\nencl.\nOttawa, November 7, 1949.\n\nHonorable:\n\nHARRY JACOBSON\n\nNorth Bay, Kincolith and Tahltan\nIndian Day Schools.\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1949-50 is the sum of $30,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teachers' residences on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Nelson, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $18,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Similkameen for $27,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a prefabricated school at Nelson.\n\nAt Cape Breton, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc. We are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Breton School was $20,744.75.\n\nAt Fort St. John, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teachers' residence but received one tender only, in the amount of $47,351.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices demanded by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nschools should be erected on each of the above three reserves. Their decision in this regard has been aided by the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected the two-room school and teachersage at Pemberton House in the New Westminster Agency and the one-room school at Keshlochto in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 485, Vancouver, B.C., and I attach both the previous order-in-Council covering the provision of the Pemberton House School and photographs taken by Inspector Harvey of the completed building.\n\nOur officials are perfectly satisfied with these buildings and Mr. Indian Superintendent Ashfield, who knows how to supervise the erection of this type of school from his experience at Keshlochto, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Hall, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachersages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nWith regard to advertising for tenders, not only have we our previous disappointments as a guide, but Mr. Ashfield makes the following statement:\n\n\"I have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Curry, Green and Bridgman, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk to transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Ainslie concurs in these recommendations and points out that these buildings can be erected at a cost to the Department considerably less than we could get a quotation from a contractor. In this regard he makes the following statement:\n\"The mill note Mr. Ashfield's reference to the need for employment at these Indian villages. Erection of these schools will provide some of their much-needed employment and in addition will ensure most urgently required classroom accommodation and, as previously pointed out, at a saving of several thousand dollars in each case.\"\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are not recommended by our field officials.\n\nTherefore, I have no hesitation in recommending to you for presentation to the Minister, the attached submission to Council covering the purchase of three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 469, Vancouver, B.C., for erection on those three reserves in the Skeena River Agency. We have foremen-carpenters in mind and can employ the Indians who are fairly competent mechanics and carpenters, under white supervision, for the erection of these prefabricated buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\nNovember 7, 1969.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT it is immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1949-50 Estimates, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, to provide three two-room school day schools with attached teachers' residences on each of the following reserves: Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Laxaloop, all of which are in the Skeena River Indian Superintendentcy, near Prince Rupert, in the Province of British Columbia.\n\nTHAT it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Laxaloop Indian Reserves;\n\nTHAT Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 166, R.S.C. 1927, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest ...........\"\n\nTHAT due to the very isolated situation of these reserves, there are no builders or contractors in the area nor are outside contractors interested in tendering if invited as aforesaid, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nTHAT a competent building company, namely Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 487, Vancouver, British Columbia, has agreed to undertake immediately the provision of these prefabricated two-room schools with attached teachers' residences at each of these reserves, on a basis of $7,750.00 each, f.o.b., Vancouver, plus freight and erection supervisor's wages, taxes and expenses;\n\nTHAT it is considered that the provision of these schools is a pressing emergency and within the exception provided in Section 36 above quoted and further, it is considered that the work can be more expeditiously and economically executed as suggested herein.\nOTTAWA, NOVEMBER 7, 1948.\n\nREQUEST FOR THE GRANT OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.\n\nRequesting authority to enter into a contract with Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 459, Vancouver, B.C., for the provision of a two-room Indian day school with attached teachers' residences at each of the Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Laxkamp Indian Reserves, on a basis of $9,750.00 f.o.b.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRe the attached voucher No. 1035. I am afraid I have over-stepped things in charging this material but we had to send this stuff in, in order to make the present teacherage habitable for the winter. The heat from the stoves in this building goes straight up through the ceilings and out through the roof. The only way to retain the heat was to seal it in with donnaconal.\n\nThese items were included on a previous requisition for a proposed second classroom.

On account of the lateness of the season, however, it was found impossible to get the building material to Lakgalzap before the cold weather set in, and, in consequence, I was obliged to postpone the erection of the shed until such time as the lumber could be brought up the Nass River. As there will be an opportunity of doing this in September when the lumber for the re-building of the Indian houses is taken up the river, I should be glad to be informed whether the appropriation for this purpose is still available.\n\nI have just been informed by the Archbishop of the diocese that the mission house at Lakgalzap which has been occupied by Miss Hannam, the school teacher, will not be available this winter as the building will be required for the use of a clergyman and his wife to be appointed next month.\n\nThere being no other house at Lakgalzap which can be used by the teacher, especially since the recent fire, I would suggest to the Department that the appropriation be slightly increased so that it may be possible to erect a one-roomed addition to the present school building for the teacher to live in. It is most important that this should be done as otherwise there may be difficulty in inducing the school teacher to remain at Lakgalzap during the coming winter.

C., Vancouver.\n\nAttached please find Credit Voucher No. 272 for $149.00 and Voucher No. 265 for $42.17 payable to Gordon and Anderson Ltd., Prince Rupert, B. C.\n\nThe Department sanctioned a sum in excess of $300.00 for repairs and equipment for this school, estimate of which cost was based on a report of the teacher who retired in June 1946. When I visited the School in October I found the condition of this teacherage to be such that a great deal more money would be needed than appeared necessary when the funds were requisitioned. The building is not really habitable without extensive repairs and on my return I approached the Bishop for the use of the Mission House if a teacher were secured for Greenville. He agreed that we could have free use of the Mission House which was without equipment or furnishings. An inventory of equipment at the School teacherage was taken and kept on file. In December, the Bishop informed me he had nominated Rev. Arthur Chapman as teacher and that he would arrive in Prince Rupert on January 3rd, 1947 to proceed at once to Greenville. Mr. Chapman had a wife and child coming with him and in view of the extreme need of implementing the furnishings and equipment at this school, I purchased and shipped these with Mr. Chapman's personal effects to Kincolith for transhipment to Greenville. At the last minute Mr. Chapman took ill and was unable to come and we had to have his personal effects returned from the Naas River and shipped east to him. The equipment, furnishings and supplies on the invoices attached have been stored at Kincolith and will be available for a teacher when appointed. It is recommended that the vouchers be approved and paid from votes available.\n\nIf a teacher is secured for Greenville, he or she can occupy the Mission House which with equipment there and the new supplies referred to herein, will make a comfortable home.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 168-35-5 T\n\nMarch 28, 1947\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of March 18th and vouchers 272 and 285 referred to therein.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Anfield used an accountable advance, forwarded to him for labour in connection with repairs to the Lakalsap Indian Day School, reference Mr. Neary's letter of August 23rd last, for the purchase of furnishings for the Anglican Mission House on the reserve, plus an additional \u00a342.17 for the same purpose. Of the \u00a313.25 requested by Mr. Anfield, in his letter of August 18th, a copy of which was forwarded to you, only a small amount was required for repairs to the teacherage, and it is not seen why the repairs to the school and outbuildings could not have been carried out.\n\nAs the matter stands the Lakalsap School building, teacherage and outbuildings are still in need of repairs and an unauthorized expenditure of \u00a3191.17 has been made for furnishing the Mission House to which we have no right of occupancy, and which would not be available to us should the church appoint a missionary who would be unsuitable as a teacher.\n\nThe vouchers above referred to cover expenditures not authorized by this office or by the Department and until I have your views in the matter I am not prepared to issue a Purchase Order or recommend payment of the accounts. It is considered that Mr. Anfield should be instructed definitely that funds forwarded to him shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the advance was made without Departmental approval.\n\nP. W. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, File 827-5, part 3)\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of a letter from Indian Commissioner MacKay in which he has forwarded your letter of March 13th in regard to the Lakalsap School.\n\nIt is evident from these letters that the money which you were forwarded for making repairs to the Lakalsap School has been expended for other purposes. This is contrary to all Departmental regulations.\n\nAn accountable advance forwarded to an Indian Agent for a specific purpose should not be diverted to any other use. Please adhere to these instructions in the future.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

We enclose for your information a copy of our letter of today's date to Indian Agent Anfield.\n\nWhile the procedure was irregular, the equipment has now been purchased by our Agent and under the circumstances we feel it should be paid for. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would issue the usual purchase order.\n\nBernard F.

Vancouver.\n\nRe your 12-11-3 of August 28th, 1947, the 1947-48 Estimates requested a total of $1,760.00 for repairs to Day Schools. It was anticipated at that time that at least part of the new building programme could have been put in hand this year, particularly at Metlakatla, Lakalsap, Hartley Bay and Kitkatla. The items requested were for temporary patching only. In view of the statement of the Department that no new schools can be built this year, it is considered that these repairs be put in hand immediately in order to keep these buildings in operation until such time as a building programme can be undertaken.\n\nIt should also be said that these estimates for 1947-48 were prepared at the time when I was supervising two Agencies. I dictated those for the Skeena River Agency to Mr. Findlay who drew them up at my request whilst I was preparing those for Bella Coola in the southern part of the territory. Had I known that no new buildings could be constructed this year, the requests for repairs could have been several times the total submitted. It is noted that $45,500.00 was included for new buildings this year and it is hoped that part of this vote might be transferred to the needed repairs.\n\nfor F.

Mr. Victor McKay who is the father of a large family stopped fishing to take Mrs. Cameron and her freight (Departmental material including a kitchen range, chesterfield suite and school material and equipment) up to Greenville to get the School open for the term.\n\nI checked with the Cannery and found that average earnings were $75.00 a day that week. It can, therefore, be said that McKay's interest in getting the school open and the teacher installed merits financial recompense. The trips do not include personal freight of the teacher.

The need for draining is apparently partly due to the small creek referred to in the Agent's letter forming a new channel across the site of the existing building and proposed school. Inspector Davey reports that on his last visit to this reserve he checked on the possibility of locating the school at some other point but the whole area of the village is low lying and there appeared to be no alternative other than to erect the new school adjacent to the old building.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApplication is made for an accountable advance in the sum of $200.00 for draining and clearing land on the Lakalsap Indian Reserve, Greenville, Naas River, B.C. It is planned to build a new school in this village next spring and I would like to undertake the digging and draining as well as clearing of this property as soon as possible. There is a creek behind the playing field at Greenville which is draining out under the school and across the lot on which it is proposed to erect the new school. This creek will have to be detoured involving considerable digging. The weather is still open and we could get this done, I believe, before the freeze-up.\n\nThe Department's instructions will be appreciated.\n\nF.

It is considered that Indian labour will be available for the next month who can be put to work clearing these sites. At Hartley Bay, the site is heavily overgrown and some stumps will have to be shot. At Greenville there are stumps to be removed and overgrowth to be taken off. At Kincolith the site is in fairly clear condition but a drainage ditch should be dug immediately in case the river rises to that point whilst construction is under way. It is further recommended that $300.00 be made available as an accountable advance for each of these schools so that the sites can be prepared for staking out without further delay.

Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Lakelsep Indian Day School\n\nIn view of the increased need for pupilage accommodation at the Lakelsep Indian Day School, we have, since early October, been communicating with Superintendent Anfield, with a view to arranging temporary accommodation in an Indian hall. Our arrangements have now progressed to the point where we have the services of the teacher assured and have for consideration a proposal from Mr. Anfield involving an expenditure of approximately $1,100.00 for improvements to the building, to make it suitable for classroom use and for the provision of accommodation for the teacher.\n\nI might mention at this time that we certainly did not anticipate that an expenditure of this amount would be necessary but are assured by Mr. Anfield that the building cannot be prepared for school use for less and that the materials required will be put to good use when new school accommodation is provided.\n\nMr. Anfield's letter of November 1st and enclosures dealing with the expenditure necessary are attached hereto and as it would appear that there is little likelihood of our plans for the construction of the new school at this point being proceeded with for some time, I would recommend approval of the expenditure required.\n\nI am writing under separate cover with regard to the appointment of a teacher for this second classroom.\n\nEncl.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B. C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lakelsap, (Greenville) Indian Day School, Second Classroom\n\nRe, letter of October 6th, file 2-11-3-168 and paragraphs 1 and 3 thereof in particular.\n\nIt was impossible to ascertain the exact amount of money required to put in the second classroom at this village, as there was some indefiniteness as to the type of quarters required for the teacher. Had Mrs. Moraes gone to Greenville, she could have lived with Mrs. Cameron, this however is out as she has declined the position. Mr. D. A. Calford is proceeding to Greenville tomorrow and he will have to live in separate quarters. It has therefore been necessary to do extensive alterations to the old hall, loaned to the Department by the Greenville Band to make both a classroom and living quarters for the teacher, suitable for the severe weather experienced in this village during the winter.\n\nIt was also necessary to line the ceiling of the present teacherage, as on examination, prior to the return of Mrs. Cameron it was found that this building had deteriorated further and to get through the winter, the ceiling of this teacherage should be lined with Donnaconne Board.\n\nWill you therefore cancel the 37 A forms enclosed with my letter of Oct. 6th and substitute the ones attached and if at all possible, forward Purchase Orders to cover same immediately. Labor on this job is estimated at $457.30, which amount includes the work to be done in the present teacherage as well as lining up and partitioning the new hall to provide a classroom and two room suite.\nRegardless to whether or not the Department are proceeding with a new building, at this point, we will have actively operating in this village, a two room school complete with quarters for both teachers and with the quarters for each.\n\nImmediate approval of these works is recommended and your instructions requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfes/ym\nencl.\nOttawa, November 7, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHartley Bay, Kincolith and Lekalasap Indian Day Schools.\n\nIncluded in our main estimates for 1948-50 is the sum of $30,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teacherages on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Deloslet we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Saskatchewan for $29,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a quonset school at Deloslet.\n\nAt Cape Mudge, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc. We are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Mudge School was $29,744.75.\n\nAt Fort Babine, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teacherage but received one tender only, in the amount of $67,391.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nschools should be erected on each of the above three reserves. Their decision in this regard has been aided by the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected the two-room school and teachers'age at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and the one-room school at Metlakatla in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., and I attach both the previous order-in-Council covering the provision of the Pemberton Meadows school and photographs taken by Inspector Davey of the completed building.\n\nOur officials are perfectly satisfied with these buildings and Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, who knows how to supervise the erection of this type of school from his experience at Metlakatla, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teachers'ages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nWith regard to advertising for tenders, not only have we our previous disappointments as a guide, but Mr. Anfield makes the following statement:\n\n\"I have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, Groar and Bridden, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk re transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Arnell concurs in these recommendations and points out that these buildings can be erected at a cost to the Department considerably less than we could get a quotation from a contractor. In this regard he makes the following statement:\n\"You will note Mr. Amfield's reference to the need for employment at these Indian villages. Erection of these schools will provide some of that much-needed employment and in addition will ensure most urgently required classroom accommodation and, as previously pointed out, at a saving of several thousand dollars in each case.\"\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are not recommended by our field officials.\n\nTherefore, I have no hesitation in recommending to you for presentation to the Minister, the attached submission to Council covering the purchase of three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., for erection on these three reserves in the Skeena River Agency. We have foremen-carpenters in mind and can employ the Indians who are fairly competent mechanics and carpenters, under white supervision, for the erection of these prefabricated buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On account of the lateness of the season, however, it was found impossible to get the building material to Lekgalzep before the cold weather set in, and, in consequence, I was obliged to postpone erection of the shed until such time as the lumber could be brought up the Nass River. As there will be an opportunity of doing this in September when the lumber for the re-building of the Indian houses is taken up the river, I should be glad to be informed whether the appropriation for this purpose is still available.\n\nI have just been informed by the Archbishop of the diocese that the vicarage house at Lekgalzep which has been occupied by Miss Hammans, the school teacher, will not be available this winter as the building will be required for the use of a clergyman and his wife to be appointed next month.\n\nThere being no other house at Lekgalzep which can be used by the teacher, especially since the recent fire, I would suggest to the Department that the appropriation be slightly increased so that it may be possible to erect a one-roomed addition to the present school building for the teacher to live in. It is most important that this should be done as otherwise there may be difficulty in inducing the school teacher to remain at Lekgalzep during the coming winter. In out of the way places like Lekgalzep...\nif has always been a problem to find suitable \nhouses for the school teachers and field matrons \nto live in. Teachers will not live in Indian houses \nand I do not think they should be expected to do \nso. Had it not been that the mission house at Lake- \nglen was unoccupied at the time of Miss Hannah's \nappointment and placed at her disposal she would \nnot have accepted the position.\n\nThe proposed addition to the school building \ncould be made very comfortable for this winter and \nif funds should be available next year another room \ncould be added.\n\nThis addition would be put up for the sum of \n$200.00 which would include labour and freight of \nlumber and other material to the site.\n\nIt would be a distinct advantage to have the \nschool teacher living close to the school as she \ncould look after the school property and as in this \nparticular case, the teacher would be saved a long \ntrip every morning through the deep snow during the \nwinter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nw e Colburn\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6461, file 827-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, August 17, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with further reference to the building of a wood shed at the rear of the Lakalap Indian Day School, also the erection of a one-roomed addition to the present school building, to provide living quarters for the teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, with regard to the wood shed, that the Department will renew the authority for the erection of the same. In this respect, you should carry out the instructions contained in official letter to you of November 4, 1921. In this letter you were also given authority to have a plank walk built, the cost of the material for which you estimated to be approximately $30.00. If this work has not been completed, it may be carried out at the time the wood shed is being erected. It is noted that the Indians promised to perform all the labour, if the material for the building of the wood shed and plank walk was supplied.\n\nRegarding the erection of a one-roomed addition to provide accommodation for the teacher, as the building now used by her will be requisitioned for the use of a clergyman and his wife, it is noted that you estimate the cost of the labour and freight on the lumber for this addition to be approximately $300.00. It is presumed that the cost of the labour and other material required in the erection of the addition would be extra; or, is it the intention to utilize for this purpose some of the lumber which is being taken in for the re-building of the Indian houses.\n\nWe have no special provision for the purpose of erecting this addition; but, as this work is reported by you to be necessary, authority is given to have it done.\n\nAll material supplied for the erection of the wood shed, walk and teacher's residence should only be supplied after competitive prices have been obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. The material and labour should be supplied at the lowest possible cost, and no undue expenditure should be incurred in having all this work done. Proper time sheets should be kept of the labour engaged and, when completed, properly certified vouchers should be submitted by you, covering the amount involved in the purchase of the lumber and for the labour employed. The Indians should perform as much of this labour as possible, without charge.\n\nE. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLincolnith, B. C.\n\nThe Department\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6401, file 827-8, part 1)\nThe Department will leave this work in your hands, to make the best arrangement possible to have it completed at the lowest possible cost.\n\nIt is noted that the lumber for the re-building of the Indian houses will be taken up the Naas River in September, and you should arrange for any material required to be forwarded at the same time. The work should be completed as soon as possible after that date, in order that suitable living accommodation can be provided for the teacher. You will kindly have the work done under your personal supervision or in charge of a competent foreman, and it should be completed to your satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

The lumber is to be purchased from the Georgetown saw mill\u2014being the lowest tender\u2014and taken to Lakgalzap on a large scow. It is proposed to send the material required for the teacher's residence at the same time in order to minimize the cost of transportation as much as possible.\n\nAs my first estimate was incomplete, I should be glad to receive as early as convenient, by wire, the Department's authority for the expenditure as shown by the enclosed estimate of material for the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, September 28, 1922.\n\nW.

The total cost of materials, labour and transport of such material amounted to $259.36, which is $79.36 more than what was authorized for this purpose, namely $180.00. This can be accounted for by the fact that it was found necessary, soon after the building was commenced, to add another small room for a dispensary, as Miss Hamann also holds the position of Field Matron at Langalap and it was therefore necessary to provide a place where medicines and other medical supplies in connection with her Field Matron duties could be kept. This extra room was not provided for in the original estimate.\n\nThe expenditure of $56.36 on a few articles of furniture and stove was an absolute necessity, as Miss Hamann had no furniture of her own, having used the Mission furniture during the time she occupied the Wesley House. The teacher's residence, being now partly furnished, will save considerable expense to future teachers and matrons who may come after Miss Hamann.\n\nThe additional expense of an extra room for the purpose of a dispensary and the purchase of a few pieces of furniture, required to make the place habitable for the teacher, has brought the entire cost to $311.36. The most careful economy was exercised in the purchase of everything used in the construction of the building, which is well put together and should withstand the extremely cold weather at Langalap during the long winter months.\n\nI regret it was necessary to spend more than the authorized appropriation but feel sure the Department will realize the unforeseen difficulties and expenses connected with such an undertaking in an out-of-the-way place like Langalap, and authorize the payment of the extra cost as shown in the enclosed statement. I have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6401, file 827-8, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (118532-5) of the 11th, with enclosure of cheque No. 3251 for sum of $11.71, in favour of Messrs.

(RC 10, Volume 6401, file 827-8, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that the school teacher's residence at Greenville on Skeena River, will need a new chimney before next winter. When the building was constructed last year, terracotta or drainpipes were used instead of bricks, as they were cheaper and easier to handle. After one winter's use, it has been found that the pipes have not been a success owing to extremes of heat and cold, and are now so badly cracked that it is unsafe to use the chimney until alterations are made.\n\nI have been advised that cement chimney blocks will be even better than bricks, as they are not only cheaper, but can be put together without the services of a bricklayer, which would add so much more to the cost of building a brick chimney. I would recommend that the work be done as soon as possible before the winter school term expires.\n\nAs the total appropriation provided last year for the erection of the teacher's residence, was just sufficient to include the cost of painting the residence and the construction of a small woodshed, I would recommend that this also be done before the winter.\n\nThe teacher's residence and school house, being all under one roof, I am asking for sufficient roof paint to cover school and residence, as otherwise, the work would look half finished.\n\nThe enclosed estimate will show the materials required and approximate cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If possible, competitive prices should be obtained in the purchase of all material, and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. The work should be completed to your satisfaction, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost of the material, as well as for the labour employed, together with receipts and vouchers covering the cost of the freight. We note that you estimate the cost of the above work to be approximately $165.45, and this amount should not be exceeded.

The total cost is $75.52, plus freight, amounting to $15.00. It is not possible to obtain tenders, as no one firm will guarantee delivery.

I would recommend that they be bought. They can be purchased locally from Gordon's Hardware for the prices quoted thereon.\n\nThe kitchen range at the teacher's residence is in very poor condition. Mrs. McConnachie is not able to bake in the oven and it smokes. I investigated this and found that the lining in the oven is burnt out. It was only a cheap stove to begin with, a sheet iron affair. I do not consider it advisable to have it repaired. I recommend that a new one be purchased, as listed on the requisition, which is a cast iron and a very suitable range.\n\nThe total cost of the materials is $59.85 and the freight, including transportation by sea-boat, will be approximately $12.00.\n\nJ.G.\n\nJ.

Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of November 29th attached, it is recommended that authority be granted for purchase of the items for the Lekelsap Indian Day School teacherage, with the exception of tea towels. It is considered that the teachers should supply their own linen.\n\nD. A. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nmh enc.\nOttawa, December 9, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, file 12-11-4, the Department approves purchase of the items requested by Indian Agent Anfield for the Lakalsap Day School, with the exception of the tea towels. We do not purchase linen for residences at Indian day schools.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\n416 Federal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lakalsap Indian Day School\n\nMrs. Phillips-Cameron (newly remarried), has just returned from a visit to Greenville to look over the teacherage, which as you know is a pretty grim spot. She informs me that the kitchen range is in extremely poor condition and would like a new one sent in with her when she goes in this weekend.\n\nThere are two ranges available locally: (1) At Gordon and Anderson - a Beach Standard at $149.50 (open shelf) and (2) at Gordon's Hardware, an \"Escort\" range, ordinary, at $147.00, (open shelf). Purchase of one of these ranges plus freight is recommended. The present range is a cheap \"Daisy\", has been in use for many years, and I can speak from personal experience and say that it should be replaced.\n\nThe only furniture in this teacherage is a table and an occasional chair, plus two or three kitchen chairs.\n\nI have today been with Mrs. Cameron and inspected the following used furniture which is in very good condition and a very good price:\n\nOne Chesterfield and two armchairs, with new covers, price $50.00. These can be purchased from Mr. Dick Woods, 860 Summit Ave., Prince Rupert, B.C.\nOne bedroom suite, consisting of double bed, with spring filled mattress; dresser and mirror and chiffonier and chair - Price $100.00. These can be purchased from Mr. Jack Scott, 629-5th Ave., West, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nIf these items can be purchased, it would make a comfortable house for Mr. and Mrs. Cameron for the winter. All items could be moved into the teacherage when the new school is built next year.\n\nIf the Department is willing to purchase used furniture, same is recommended, as these articles new would cost three times the offered price. Will you signal me your instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

Arnell, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe yours of Sept. 22, file 12-11-2 re Mr. Cameron, husband of Mrs. Cameron, teacher at Lakalsap Indian Day School.\n\nWhen this teacher applied for this position she was a widow and remarried prior to her departure for the Naas River. Mr. Cameron is quite elderly and more or less retired. He is a carpenter by trade and I believe will be quite capable of acting as foreman on the new school projected for this village next spring. It is expected that he will be able to take on the work of dispenser at this village during the school term, and application is being made for a small grant of $25.00 per month for his services in this regard. He will live at the teachorage with his wife.\n\nF.

I should like to see a small grant made to the school to cover the salary of an Indian woman at about $5.00 per month to teach basket weaving here once a week during the afternoon session. Some materials would be required but the total cost should not be as much as $100.00 per year. This sum might well I believe be taken from the B. C.

The islands are embraced within the North West Coast Agency under Mr. Wm. Todd, Agent at Metlakatla, who is paid a salary of $1800. The population of his Agency is 4116, of which reside on Queen Charlotte Islands, made up as follows,\u2014 Massett Indians, 376, and Skidegate Indians, 250.\n\nIn the same connection I send file 122,728/1 containing a letter from Mr. Maxwell, M.P., in which he forwards application of Mr. Harrison for appointment to the position of teacher in addition to that of Agent. You will see from Mr. Benson's memo, that there is no reason why a change should be made in the position of teacher for the school at Massett, which, so far as the Department knows, is properly conducted.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith for the information and consideration of the Department a letter, dated the 15th instant, received from Mr. Agent Lorenz, of the North West Coast Agency, B.C., covering a communication of the 15th of last month addressed to him by the Right Rev. F.H.

Massett would be the best place to begin an improved Day School. It is a large Indian village very much isolated. It has a fine new building erected by the Department and the people. When I last inspected this school there were about forty scholars present and all had not returned after the summer. Provided I had the assurance from the Department that a larger grant would be made I would begin at once to seek for a well qualified teacher, a white man (and his wife); lessons could be given in carpentering to the boys, and sewing, etc., to the girls. Rev. W. E. Collison who looks after the medical needs of the people could give instruction in sanitary matters and care of the health. The people would be far better pleased with this than with sending their children so far away, and I believe the results would be very much better.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"F.H.

Vowell with a copy of your letter to Mr. Agent Lorenz regarding the possibility of affording better educational facilities for the Indians of the North W. Agency B.C. In your communication you suggested the improvement of the Day School on the Aiyansh Reserve stated that the Indians were willing to set aside part of their Reserve for school purposes if something done to teach them farming. The Department will carry out a plan for extending the usefulness of day schools when it is assured that the time is favorable for doing so. Full should be forthcoming as to whether there sufficient number of children permanently to justify the expenditure of the amount properly conduct a new type of school.\n\nWhen this fact is established question of securing the services necessary qualifications to carry the Department would like you to\n\nRight Rev. M.H. DuVernet, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nMarried man for Teacher, whose wife would be able to assist in carrying out the scheme, which includes improvements in the domestic habits of the women on the Reserve; the aim being to educate the Indian children amid their native surroundings and while insinuating principles of thrift and self-dependence to improve at the same time the conditions of life in their homes. It need hardly be pointed out that the success of the proposed plan depends largely on the persons selected to inaugurate it; they should capable beyond all doubt of carrying on the work in which they are to be engaged. The Department is of the opinion that only such persons as are well versed in the condition of the country and have the welfare and improvement of the Indians at heart should be employed in this work.\n\nI ask that you will give this matter careful consideration and report to the Department at your earliest convenience whether it would be advisable to have the new teacher appointed on early date so that any field or other difficulties may be overcome in good time. Would you also be kind enough to state what would be considered a fair salary?\n\nYou also mention Haggott as being interested in opening the Day School, and as the Department is desirous of affording assistance to a suitable teacher, &c., if he is willing to settle in this locality, we would be glad\nto be furnished with any suggestions you may make regarding the educational needs of the Indians at the latter place.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMar. 23, 1909.\n\nThe Secretary, of Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAbsence from the mainland at Nassett, Q.C.I. has delayed my answering your letters of Feb 13 and 19, No 67,340-1, and 125,342-1 which awaited my return.\n\nI take these letters as asking for my candid opinion upon what we all feel to be a most difficult problem. Let me say first that I am most anxious to assist the Department in every possible way in carrying out their new policy of improved Day Schools. I have thought the matter over long and carefully and discussed it with some of our missionaries. I am quite willing to sacrifice denominational pride for the best interests of the Indians. Allow me to express my views freely in hope of helping the cause.\n\n1. No one policy will suit all parts of Canada. It is necessary to modify a general policy according to local conditions. The policy of an improved day school as outlined by the Department seems to suggest the Prairies rather than British Columbia.\n\n2. Speaking for the Church of England in Northern British Columbia let me try and explain the local conditions.\n\nWe began Christian work among the Coast Indians over fifty years ago. Our 2,300 Christianized Indians have their homes in villages, most of them live in modern houses, dress well etc. In almost every village there is a clergyman and his wife and family. The clergyman is practically a doctor.\n\nWithout\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nWithout any remuneration he is constantly tending the sick, gives practical advice, tells them the danger of evil germs, urges them to keep their houses clean, his wife (like Mrs. Collison of Kincolith) is constantly giving the women hints in domestic matters, there is a day school in the village, usually taught by a white woman, a single lady who lives with the missionary and his wife. It would be impossible for a single lady to live elsewhere in the village. The cost of reaching these villages up the rivers is considerable. The freight on food etc. is excessive, and yet the Department only allows $300.00 a year, subject to reduction, to keep up this Day School, pay travelling expenses and teacher's salary. I have inspected the Day Schools at Nettlacatla, Nikkatla, Nassett, Kincolith, Lakkalzep, Aiyansh, Citwangak, Hazelton etc. and found, not as I have found east of the Rockies, three or four children in a school, but from fifteen to forty five. The younger generation of our Indians have all passed through these Day Schools and the result is far beyond what the Department could possibly expect from such inadequate support. I have heard a young Indian man read the lessons in Church in English better than many white men could and yet he had had no other education than that obtained at the village day school. Viewed in the light of relative expenditure I have no hesitation in saying that there has been far greater returns from the Day School than the so-called Industrial School which on the per capita system could not afford to keep first class trades instructors. It is on this ground that I appeal to the Department to use some of the money saved from the closing of our Nettlactle Industrial School and strengthen these Day Schools which under great disadvantages have accomplished so much good.\n\nIt seems\nIt seems invidious for me to name two of these Day Schools and leave the others out. I mentioned Nassett because it is the largest Day School, 50 on the roll, and the place is 80 miles from the mainland, and Aiyansh because a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamike would answer both villages and give a good number of children but all these Day Schools should be considered and an increased grant made.\n\nAccepting the policy of the improved Day School and applying it to our local conditions here what are the modifications necessary?\n\nFrom the description given of our villages it will be seen that a nurse is scarcely needed. Some one should have authority to inspect the Indian houses and order a thorough disinfecting once or twice a year.\n\nExcept in the case of a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamike a mid-day meal does not seem necessary. Many of our Indians are adopting our food. They all have kitchen stoves. They know how to cook. They are not in want. It is mistaken policy for the Government to relieve the parents of the duty of providing for their children.\n\nIn regard to industrial training, very few of the children attending day school are old enough to profit from a course of industrial training.\n\nThe very best thing the Government could do for our Indians is to employ a first class carpenter and boat-builder and have him visit our villages in turn forming classes of young men from 16 up. Most of our Indians are very quick with tools, the Nassett men build fine schooners. A skilled white man could teach them much that would be most useful in a short course. It would not be necessary to visit each village.\nvillage each year.\n\nLet me now mention the one great difficulty in the way of making the Day School meet the need of the ordinary Indian child. Absence from home at certain seasons. If our Indians lived all the year round in their villages there would be no need whatever for Boarding Schools or Industrial Schools except one central undenominational one for a few of the most promising and perfectly sound children, but this is not the case. The canning season from June 15 to Sept. 1st. does not seriously interfere as most of this is vacation time, but in most of our villages there is another season which comes in March or April when the parents go off and take their children. They would gladly leave them behind them if we could in any way house and feed them for a few weeks. I have thought much over this and talked it over with our leading missionaries. They all agree that this is the problem.\n\nMeet this difficulty and the Day School is all that the ordinary child needs, and the parents will not feel the separation as in the case of a distant Boarding School. \"My child might as well be dead\" said one mother bitterly when she found she could not get her child back for eight years.\n\nIn some cases only a few of the people go away at one time. If we had a man and his wife in charge, a tent that would hold a dozen children, with blankets to might meet the need. I think the parents would be willing to provide food for their children during their absence. Our Missionaries are willing to co-operate as they see the importance of keeping the children at school. The difficulty is that an equipment is needed for a short time.\n\nTo come to details. Nasset has 50 children on the roll.\nIf anything in the way of an improved Day School is attempted, this school should stand first. If the Department takes up the proposal to have a joint school midway between Aiyansh and Gitladamiks, giving a midday meal I understand that the Aiyansh people will give 1 and 1/2 acres, and Gitladamiks the same on the boundary. There is a good road winter and summer. Distance from each village about one mile. As the Department has promised new school houses there should be economy in combining buildings, salaries &c.\n\nAs to Hazelton we have a splendid teacher there, Miss Seal, who also is a deaconess and visits the native people in their homes. I have heard that the Methodists are pressing for a Boarding School there. The Church of England has in Hazelton and neighbourhood about 600 Indians, the Methodists none in Hazelton but in the vicinity (10 miles north and 10 miles south) about 270, the Salvation Army a few dozen, the Roman Catholics have a village 3 or 4 miles away.\n\nPlainly the only way to have a successful Boarding School is for us all to unite upon an interdenominational school with the privilege of giving religious instruction to our own flock. So far as our Indians in Hazelton are concerned an improved day school on the line indicated would, I think, meet the need. Why should the Government take children away from their parents and clothe and feed them when these parents live in good houses, earn good wages &c.?\n\nAs I have already pointed out travelling expenses are high, the cost of living much greater than in the East, it is necessary to offer a man and his wife a good salary to make...\nto make it worth their while to go to an out of the way place and live among Indians. I earnestly trust that the Department will recognize the fact that the Day Schools cannot be made efficient on $300.00 a year. Until I know how much the salary is to be I cannot very well secure capable teachers but I shall be looking out for such.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nP.M. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nEXD.\n\n12273/1\n\nOttawa, September 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo in reference to the engagement of a teacher for the Massett School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in opening the school in charge of Miss Josephine Edenshaw.\n\nIn March, last, His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia proposed to the Department that Mr. Sherwood should go to North Island with the older children who would be taken there by their parents during the fishing season. With that object in view you were authorized to purchase material for the erection of a building. It is presumed, in view of the request recently received for aid to erect a dwelling house, that it is the intention of Mr. Sherwood to return and take up his work at Massett.\n\nIn the meantime the Department will await the result of your communication with the Bishop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThomas Douay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nThe Editor,\n\nSir R. H. Ballantyne,\n\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nI am requested to inform you of the fact of a meeting for the purpose of discussing the question of the Indians of the North-West, and of the action taken after consultation with Mr. Walter Hope, Chief Commissioner, and others.\n\nMr. Hope, the former Secretary to the Department of Indian Affairs, has returned here, and the Indians have been called into the Reserve since that time.\n\nThe question has been discussed by the Chiefs and other representatives in the matter of sending the Indians (women) away from their homes, and the proposal has been made to send them away. As I have stated, the Indians of this area are very few in number, and there is no reason why they should be removed from their homes. The Indians are not a threat to anyone, and they should be allowed to live in peace and quietness.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my sympathy with the Indians of this area, and to assure them that they will be treated fairly and justly.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He considers that the remuneration of the Teacher is so small that he must take some other occupation, during the Summer months.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the School should re-open immediately on the return of a sufficient number of children to attend.\n\nI enclose copy of a communication received from His Lordship Bishop DuVernet on the subject.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOn Str. Inlander going up Skeena River,\nSept. 22. 1910.\n\nTo the Indian Agent,\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nDear Mr. Deasy.-I am today in receipt of your letter of Aug. 31st re. the absence of Mr. Sherwood. I very much regret his action. As the salary is small and it is difficult for us to keep teachers even when the Church adds to the Government Grant and pays the salary regularly every quarter. I told Mr. Sherwood there was no reason why he should not during the Summer vacation, earn a little more money, if he was sure to be back in good time for the opening of the Day School, which was usually about the 1st Sept. I am afraid he has misunderstood matters.\n\nMiss Josephine Edenshaw has been the Assistant Teacher, the Indian Department having promised a supplementary grant for her when the numbers warranted a second teacher (at the rate of $300).\n\nUnder the circumstances I think that you and Mr. Hogan have acted most wisely in re-opening the School; but I do not think Miss Edenshaw qualified to take the whole school when it grows larger.\n\nOur Church has been at considerable expense in securing Mr. Sherwood, paying his traveling expenses from a distance. In order to retain his services we, at our August meeting of our Executive Committee, promised him an increase in his salary, as no White man, in any way qualified as a Teacher would teach for the Government Grant alone, even though it has been raised to $500 (subject to reductions).\n\nWe also discussed the difficulty about a house for him. I felt strongly that we should not be able to hold him unless we did something in this direction. Compare what the Public School Teachers receive.\n\nI sincerely hope that Mr. Sherwood has long before this returned as it will be hard, at a moment's notice, to secure another teacher. I shall await further word with much concern.\nI was very sorry to be away when you called. I hope to be able to go to Massett and have a talk with you over the school question; but I cannot for a few weeks yet.\n\nWith kind regards &c.,\n\n(Sd.) F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nSENT UP FOR TRIAL\nON CHARGE OF THEFT\n\nJoe Howe Must Face Serious Charge in Higher Court\u2014Gallagher Sentenced to Six Months' Imprisonment.\n\nJoe Howe, a half-breed Chinese, was committed for trial in the higher court yesterday afternoon on charge of stealing $25 from an Indian half-breed named Mathew Youmans at Masset on Graham Island, B.C., Canada. According to the statement of Youmans, Howe came into his house while his limbs were still paralyzed the morning of the theft. Youmans said that he had been in the city giving evidence in a big Graham Island case when he returned home to find the result of previous earnings and fees received in his room by his friend Mr. White, who said that Howe had been there and needed help. They allowed him to sleep on the floor until they heard of his intention for a trip to Victoria. They came back to Vancouver to take him to the police station but the north again and last Friday night had taken him back. When Howe suggested that they should go to the police station to get drunk, he told two men from the North refused to go. Howe then went to the police station where he had a small flask of whisky. He had a small glass and drank from it. Youmans said afterwards that he gave Howe another glass. Youmans said that after drinking it he became unconscious and was unable to lift his arms, and while in this condition left with his money.\n\nWhen the policeman found Youmans the next day he was crying over the loss of his money as he had not been able to get it back. Youmans went to the North. On the description he gave, Howe was placed under arrest. Mr. L. V. W. Innes, who appeared for the accused, reserved his defence for the higher court.\nQUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\nMASETT, B.C., Jan. 4th 1911\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-I have the honor to enclose herewith the Report of Teacher N. S. Sherwood, of Massett Indian Day School for the Quarter ending 31st Dec. 1910.\n\nIn connection with this School permit me to state that changes are contemplated by His Lordship Bishop DuVernet whereby better results are expected.\n\nI would also be pleased to receive information regarding the School Hours in the Day Schools. In the Massett School four hours per day is considered the longest time for the pupils to attend. It would be far more advisable, in my opinion, to open the School at 9:30 a.m. and continue until noon and to have the afternoon session from 1 p.m. to 3 or 3:30 p.m. The construction of a residence, for the Teacher, would induce some person with a knowledge of teaching to come to Massett, and a married man would, possibly, come then, although the salary provided for a good teacher is insufficient. The female teacher of the \"Bite children, at the town 2 1/2 miles away, where only about eighteen pupils attend, receives $85 per month, and is not a teacher with a certificate. The cost of living here is high and $60 per month is not sought after, especially when the teacher must provide his own residence. This matter was brought up before and the conclusion has now been arrived at that, if $1,000 could be appropriated for a residence, and the same built on the Reserve, where the teacher might have an acre of land, it would go a long way in inducing a good teacher to come here and reside permanently. I feel sure the Indians would grant the land and the teacher might erect the residence. His Lordship, Bishop DuVernet, Rev. Mr. Hogan and...\nall of us who understand the conditions here, realize that it would be impossible to have good results from a Day School, which is closed a portion of the year, without a disciplinarian in charge. The Teacher we have is not of this stamp and he realizes that he cannot manage the school. He is not at all anxious to continue in charge; but it would be difficult to replace him under present conditions and salary.\n\nIn the annual report on the schools reference will be made to this question.\n\nI would also recommend that a Woodshed be built at the School and Water Closets, at a cost of $150. There is no place in which to keep the wood dry, during the rainy season.\n\nThe average attendance at the school, during this time of the year, is not what it should be. I am endeavoring to induce the parents to send their children to school; but they will not go to any trouble to see that the children attend. I have gone over the Reserve, time and again, and found children staying away without reason. With a Teacher who would investigate into the reasons for non-attendance and one who would take an interest in the work, good results would surely follow. Such a man requires good pay. His Lordship informed me that an attempt would be made to get such a teacher, and, for the good of the Indians, I hope we will get such a person. The boys and girls who attend the school seem eager to learn and, with a change in the school the parents might take a great deal more interest.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication (No. 122723/1) of the 9th inst., with reference to \"the proposed erection of a school building for the Massett Indians at North Island\" and asking me \"to advise the Department fully as to what has been done.\"\n\nThe erection of the proposed building was one of the matters that had been in the hands of the former Indian Agent, and, when I took office, was transferred to me.\n\nAfter considering with the local clergyman it was decided to purchase and store the lumber. The only small sawmill on Massett Inlet has been closed down during the summer and only started work again a short time ago, to cut the timber for the wharf on Massett Inlet. In the meantime I have been anxious to meet His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, to discuss school matters generally, and this school in particular. When I called at his residence, during my visits to Prince Rupert, he was absent, visiting his large Diocese. It was only on my last trip to Skidegate that I met His Lordship\u2014a few days ago.\n\nThe local clergyman, and the Indians had changed their minds regarding the utility of building a schoolhouse at North Island. As the map of the Queen Charlotte Group will show, North Island is off the extreme end of Graham Island and is deserted for over ten months of the year. The Indians only go there to fish for \"Spring Salmon.\" There is always the possibility of the Indians giving up this kind of fishing, and now, that a Whaling Station has been placed at Virago Sound, nearer their homes, a number of the Indians will seek employment there. The present Teacher of the Massett Day School gives me to understand that he is allowed to spend the\ntime the Indian children are away from Massett as he thinks fit, and, during this year, he worked on the Yakoun River \u2014 even after the children returned, compelling us to engage Miss Edmonshaw to re-open the school and teach for a month, before he returned. He complains that the salary is not sufficient and, considering that he is appointed by the Bishop, I did not take any further action in regard to his absence further than to confer with the local clergyman and the Indian Council and to ask that the school be opened. His Lordship informs me that Mr. Sherwood, the teacher, has been notified that his services will be no longer required, and I agree with him, for the reason that Mr. Sherwood is not conducting the school as he should.\n\nI did not report on the matter of this schoolhouse until now, in order to find out the views of His Lordship and he is of the opinion that some means should be adopted to keep the children at their homes, while the parents are away, fishing, and at the canneries.\n\nI enclose copies of communications recently received by me, on this matter.\n\nWhen at Skidegate Reserve, Dr. Spencer also felt that some means should be devised to keep the children of the Skidegate Band at their homes. A child had just died, one that had been several years in the Coquileetza Boarding School. Dr. Spencer said that it would be almost impossible to send any children to Coquileetza School, for some time now, on account of the death of this girl\u2014the Indians considering that it is too far away and they have no means of quick communication should the children in the boarding school become ill.\n\nThere is another reason adduced by the Indians for not desiring to send their children to Boarding Schools where a large majority of the scholars belong to the tribes living near the place where the school is located. The few from our outlying settlements are not met in a proper spirit by the Indian children of other reserves, and, being in the large\nminority, they feel out of place.\n\nThe remedy suggested by both His Lordship, by Rev. Dr. Spencer, by the local clergyman and the Indian Councils is that steps should be taken to open Summer Boarding Schools on the Massett and Skidegate Indian Reserves, either placing the scholars in tents or buildings, and keeping them there while the parents are away. In the past the Indians leave about April and did not return until September. During the rest of the year they received four hours schooling each of the five school days of the week. The balance of the 24 hours they would be back in their homes, talking their native language. While away with their parents they learned little or nothing, and forgot a great deal of what had been taught in the Day School. There are no advanced Day School pupils on either Reserve\u2014in my opinion there never will be, under existing conditions. I can point to a large number of men who graduated from the Boarding Schools, and smart business men they are.\n\nI am pleased to state that all parties concerned on the Massett and Skidegate Reserves, clergymen and Indians, desire to make the schools all that could be desired and their opinion is that Summer Boarding Schools would aid materially. They would keep the young from the influences found around canneries; the clergy would have them all the year round; the teachers would be able to enforce discipline; there would be no break in the studies; the children would be at their homes\u2014where some of the Indians remain and the parents would be reached quickly, should any of them become ill. More than that, I am advocating that we induce the Indians to till the soil and am willing to educate the children in that work. They have the best of land for the purpose and, if our Indians are going to advance, or even keep pace with the incoming settlers, they must be kept away from the baneful influences found in the cities and towns and around the canneries. I enclose a clipping which will show you one recent occurrence. Here we\nhave the Indians under surveillance. Once away a number of them fall and, when they return to the Reserve are a source of trouble.\n\nI must report, after giving the matter a great deal of consideration, that the building of a schoolhouse, at North Island, would be an expense that would result in little good. If they went to North Island during April and May there would be but forty school days in that term, each day of four hours. Some children would attend, others would be out with their parents, fishing and getting firewood.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop DuVernet informed me that he did not feel too sure that any great good would be accomplished\u2014that the plan was suggested to him. The local clergyman, and the Indians themselves do not now consider that we would advance the children very much, in this way. The Indians may stop away from North Island at any time and I think you will agree with me, that we should do everything in our power to keep the Indians, men, women and children, where they are always under the care of their clergy, teachers and agents.\n\nI fully realize the importance of educating the Indians, and am doing everything in my power to make our schools what they should be. In this Agency I am proud of the Indians, who have attended the Industrial Schools, and are endeavoring to aid in advancing the young; but I would advise waiting until next year, before taking any further steps in the North Island School matter. I will try to go there with them and see for myself the condition of things; but, whether the Department carries out the proposition or not, permit me to state that the only way to educate the Indians of this Agency is to give them the education in their homes, on their Reserves.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nPrince Rupert, B. C.,\n\nDec. 8th 1910.\n\nThos. Deasy Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Massett, Q. C. I.\n\nMy dear Sir:-I think it due to you to enclose you a copy of my reply to the Massett Council. As you are on the spot your recommendation to the Department will carry great weight. It will, however, be contrary to the avowed present policy of the Government if they create a new boarding school on the line of the \"Improved Day School\" they seem willing to do anything within reason, only their policy needs to be modified to suit local conditions. They agreed to provide tents with board floors, cots &c to house the children while the parents are at North Island in the spring. I do not see why something on this line could not be worked. To take thirty children out of their homes in the village, clothe and feed them all the year, without any cost to the parents, who are all well able to keep them does not seem reasonable. The great problem is how to retain them at school for the few weeks the parents are away.\n\nI very much regret that things seemed to be mixed up regarding the Massett Day School. As I understand the situation it is this-the Government at my request raised the grant for a white male teacher to $500. On my representation that for part of the year the school was too large for one teacher-a supplementary grant for an assistant teacher while needed was made at the rate of $300 a year. As head of the Church in charge of the Mission I am expected to nominate the teachers. I secured Mr. Sherwood, paid his traveling expenses, promised him $700 a year ($600, first) which is paid regularly by our Diocesan Treasurer, Rev. J. H. Keen, Metlakatla, every quarter. The teacher when he receives his Government cheque endorses it to be paid to our Treasurer. I also recommended Miss Josephine\nBramshaw as Assistant Teacher. Owing to Mr. Sherwood's most unfortunate misunderstanding everything seems now in a muddle. Our Treasurer has been instructed by me to make no further payment of salaries until we receive a definite statement, with dates, so that we can know what the Government cheques will be.\n\nWishing you a Happy Christmas,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours &c.,\n\n(Sd.) F. H. DuVernet\n\nBishop of Caledonia.\nMay it please Your Lordship:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 3rd inst., after my return from Prince Rupert and after the conversation with you over school and other matters.\n\nI also thank you for copy of letter sent to the Massett Indian Council.\n\nThe schools of this Agency engaged a great deal of my attention, since my appointment and I am pleased to inform you that the local clergyman, Rev. William Hogan takes a deep interest in the Day School at Massett. We have worked together, and with the Indian Council, to aid the children; but the results have not been all that we expected. The teacher, Mr. Sherwood, is not a disciplinarian and, from my consultation with you, I understand that he is to be relieved. It was not my place to complain, considering that you have Mr. Hogan, who has been visiting the school and keeping the children in order. I understand also that when I am on the ground things have progressed better than before or when I am away in other parts of the Agency. I know nothing of the financial affairs of the teachers and the Diocesan Fund. Each time I received cheques, they were given to the parties to whom addressed. While Mr. Sherwood was at work, at the Yakoun River, and after I found that there was no teacher present when the children returned, I consulted with Rev. Mr. Hogan and the Chief Councillor regarding the opening of the Day School and we were unanimously of the opinion that it was necessary to place someone in charge. Mr. Sherwood knew the Indians were home; but he remained at the Yakoun River until\nthe work there was finished for the year. It was not my place to ask him to return and, when Miss Edenshaw handed me the quarterly report, to the 30th September, I submitted it to the Department of Indian Affairs. Later I received a cheque in favor of Miss Edenshaw and handed it to the young woman.\n\nMr. Sherwood returned to Nassett on the 1st October and again took charge of the school, on the 3rd October. From the time I arrived on the Reserve, until Mr. Sherwood took charge, on the above date, I did not meet him in the school. He left here on the 4th July, for Prince Rupert, and returned shortly after. He then proceeded with the river clearing party, to Yakoun River, and did not return until the 1st October. The school had been running one month, under Miss Edenshaw, when Mr. Sherwood returned.\n\nI can well understand that the salary is small for a competent teacher\u2014too small to secure and retain a man qualified; but the Indians are not at home during the months of April, May, June, July and August and I agree with you that something should be done in the way of a summer boarding school, where the children might be kept while the parents are away. We know that the children learn little of any use to them in the country camps and towns\u2014in fact the grown Indians would be better off at home. If we could only have them take up gardening, on the beautiful reserve of theirs, how many girls and young men we would save from the temptations they meet with away from home? I am offering to start them in this line and am writing the Department of Indian Affairs on the question of an experimental garden, to teach them how to cultivate the large stretch of good territory included in this reserve, which is now allowed to go to waste. We could teach the children, if they remained at home and give them a means of making a living in the future. Here your clergyman would have an opportunity to supervise them the year round and the Agent could watch over them also. It would wean the fathers and mothers from going away and they would, naturally, fall into the mode of\nlife which will eventually mean the preservation and increase of\nthe Band. Your Church, with the assistance of the Department,\nhas the best body of Indians I have met in my long experience\nwith the Indians in British Columbia. As a law-abiding and pro-\ngressive people there are no Indians on the Pacific Coast to com-\npare with them. I have been among the Indians, from the North to\nthe Kootenay country, and know whereof I write. There are men in\nthis band, who were taught in Metlakatla, who are superior to any\nother Indians, and they are anxious to have the children learn\nand take their places with the Whites. The Day School will not\nmeet the wants of the Indians\u2014considering that they go away for\nso many months in the year, and I hope the Department will second\nthe endeavor to keep them at their homes and have them taught\nto grow out of the language and customs of former days.\n\nThanking you for your kind wishes and hoping you will have\na Happy and Prosperous New Year,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nDec. 6th 1910.\n\nTo Alfred Adams, Chief Councillor and the Members of the Masset Council:\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI had hoped before this to visit Massett and talk to you face to face about school matters, which is so much better than writing, but I have not yet been able to secure the time to go over and back.\n\nYour communication regarding the establishment of a Boarding School at Massett followed me about and did not reach me until several weeks after the letter was written.\n\nI fully appreciate the difficulty of retaining the children at school during the few weeks in the Spring when the parents are away and have again and again taken up this matter with the Indian Department in Ottawa. The Department is willing to do anything in reason to tide over these few weeks, but the authorities in Ottawa do not think it wise to take the children away from their parents for a long time, and relieve the parents of all responsibility regarding their own children whom they are bound to clothe and feed. They hold strongly that the results from the Boarding Schools have not justified the immense sum of money spent upon them, and their present policy is to do all they can to improve the Day School. They are willing to provide for the housing of the children, for the few weeks the parents are away but not for the whole year. This is my impression gathered from an extensive correspondence. If the Government is willing to build a suitable Boarding School and bear the whole financial cost I shall be glad to do all in my power to help on the work, but we as a Church feel that we are not justified in spending money on such work. We found at Metlakatla that the Government grant per boy or girl was not enough to pay expenses and we were getting more and more into debt and so had to hand the Indus-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\ntrial School back to the Government, who instead of keeping it open as we expected promptly closed it. The Church is at present paying part of the salary of the white male teacher of the Day School as well as paying for his traveling expenses to bring him to Massett, otherwise no man teacher could be found to live on the Government Grant.\n\nAs you have now an Indian Agent living amongst you who takes a deep interest in your school it may be possible for you through him to prevail upon the Indian Department to establish a Boarding School at Massett, and support it, but after our experience at Metlakatla we as a Church would not undertake to manage it upon a grant of so much a child as before, as I know we should soon get into debt.\n\nWishing you a Happy Christmas and hoping to visit you in the New Year,\n\nI am &c.,\n(Sd.) F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nOn the 1st March it is the intention of His Lordship, Bishop DuVernet, to make a change in the teacher of the Indian day School. The new Teacher is new here and the change will be beneficial. The new man is a practical farmer and understands Carpentry. I recommended that a change be made to the Bishop, for the reason that the present teacher is not able to manage the children. Someone had to call the attention to the lack of discipline in the school, and I considered it my duty to do so. His Lordship agrees with me that a change should be made to which Rev. Mr. Hogan, the Clergyman here, agrees.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThomas Deasy\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the question of a school where the children could remain while the parents are away at their Fishing Grounds, and the Canneries\u2014practically during the whole of the Summer\u2014the Indian Councils of Massett and Skidegate have been discussing the matter and are unanimously in favor of some means to keep their children at home and have them educated.\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a communication which the Massett Indian Council of 1910 forwarded to His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, on the question, and which elicited the answer forwarded in a communication to the Council and myself, from His Lordship.\n\nThe Old and New Councils consider a day School, during a few months of the year, insufficient to properly educate their children and express their ideas in the enclosed copy.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nHis Lordship Bishop DuVernet,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nHis Lordship: We, the Council of Massett, have considered the question of the children of our Band who require an Industrial School education and consider that there are many reasons why there should be a Boarding School in Massett.\n\nWe have had eight children here and they are endeavoring to go to a Boarding School. We applied for places for them and were told that there was only room for two or three at Alert Bay. Some parents are talking of sending their children to Chilliwack and as we desire to have the children taught and raised in their own denominational school, we have endeavored to have the parents wait until something can be done for them. Whenever the steamer leaves for Prince Rupert some children are taken to the wharf at Massett, to be sent to Chilliwack, and some of them would have gone had the parents found someone to take care of them. We feel sure that at least twenty-five boys would attend a Boarding School at Massett and would be left there during the absence of their parents. There are about the same number of girls ready for school. The Day School gives but a few hours' education each school day and all who attend have no more than twenty-four hours of schooling every week, and, for months, there is no school at all. The children live at home, going back to their language and ideas, and there is little improvement, as in school where they live under English teachers and are always under the influence of those who keep them from the streets and are always learning them to talk the English language. We find the Boarding School has brought our people to a stage that cannot be attained in a Day School and as we are anxious to have our children advance, both morally and socially, we ask Your Lordship to take steps to have a Boarding School opened. The Massett Band cannot always be at home, in order to keep their children at school. The various occupations require them to leave for the salmon canneries and other places, where influences are not always for their betterment. They go with their parents to the towns, and see things that children would be better if they did not go there.\n\nThere would be no necessity for building the North Island school, as we had a boarding school, and we feel sure that a great benefit would result to our people, both in their learning and their conduct in the world, when they have before them always the influence of Christian teaching.\n\nTrusting that Your Lordship will give our petition early consideration,\n\nYour Obedient Servants,\n\nThe Massett Council.\nOttawa, January 31, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the Cassette Indian day school.\n\nIn reply to that portion in which you deal with the school hours I beg to say that the Department considers that the school sessions should be from 9 a.m. to 12 and from 1 to 4 with a recess of any half an hour during each session. No regulations in respect to the length of sessions have been as yet promulgated by the Department, but action along these lines will be taken before long.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the provision of a residence for a teacher will be considered.\n\nThe Department realizes the difficulty in obtaining teachers with professional qualifications for the outlying districts in British Columbia, but to a person whose general attainments are such as to fit him or her to give instruction to the Indian children and who will take an active interest in the welfare of the pupils a larger salary will be allowed. We have in many of our Indian schools teachers who, although they have no professional qualifications, have that natural aptitude which is essential to success as teachers particularly of Indian children, and are actuated by a desire to uplift not only the children but also the parents among whom they work.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nperson with qualifications such as are referred to above\nthe Department is prepared to allow a salary of $600.00\nper annum.\n\nYou will be good enough to communicate with the\nbishop and advise him as to the tenor of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nMay 12th 1911.\n\nThomas Deasy Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:-Will you please forward to the Indian Department my urgent request that they would increase their grant to the Indian Day School Teacher at Massett to $700 a year. I was very pleased with what I saw of Mr. McConkey's work in the school when I visited Massett a few weeks ago. As the amount of assistance in the Mission above school work which he can render is so little our Church does not feel justified in paying him much in addition to the Gov. Grant, and from what he said to me I fear we cannot retain his services unless the Government increases the grant for his salary which at present is only $500.\n\nI would also point out that the supplementary grant for an assistant, at the rate of $300 a year, is only drawn for a portion of the year and that a total of $1,000 from the Government, for a school with seventy children on the roll would be only reasonable.\n\nI hope to confer with you later about the keeping of the children at Massett while the parents are away. I hope we can work out some plan and we as a Church are willing to do our utmost provided we are not asked to carry too much of the financial burden. I think the day is fast coming when the Government should take over the entire responsibility of educating the Indians, leaving the Church of the Mission to look after their spiritual and moral welfare.\n\nI remain &c.,\n\n(Sd.) F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 12th inst. and must apologize for the delay in answering by stating that I have just returned from Skidegate and found the letter on my arrival at Massett. While in Prince Rupert, I endeavored to interview you; but ascertained that you would not be at home during my stay.\n\nUnfortunately, there is some misunderstanding regarding Mr. McConkey. I do not know the terms on which he was engaged. On the 28th April he had but six children in the school. We endeavored to have more attend. A few more did attend; but, on the 3rd May, but six were present. On the 11th May Mr. McConkey decided to close the school and he left on the steamer for Prince Rupert.\n\nThis morning Rev. Mr. Hogan called on me and stated there are 23 children in the village and asked what I intended to do. I informed him that I did not know what arrangements had been made by you, regarding Mr. McConkey's services. A large number of the children left, with their parents, for the North Island fishing station and, whether the 23 children will remain, I do not know. I will not repeat the whole conversation; but it all appeared to hinge on Mr. McConkey's appointment and the reasons for closing the school. In former years the school was closed when the Indians left for North Island.\n\nWhen the Indians were preparing to leave the attendance dwindled to six children. How many of the 23 would attend now, if the school opened I do not know. Mr. McConkey stated that his business called him away and he intended to interview you, at Prince Rupert, regarding his future work. I was pleased with his work, as School Teacher and a large number of the Indians, in fact all I spoke to, informed me that he conducted the School in most creditable manner. Now, that fault is found with him, I consider that the matter should be called to your attention. With you, I am convinced that Mr. McConkey was a good teacher and it would be most advisable to retain his services, if possible; but, if his retention interferes with the judgment of a teacher\u2014if he is liable to cause dissatisfaction to any other person which might lead to unpleasantness, it would be better, considering that it is my duty to report to the Department and to you on the School, to state that I do not think Rev. Mr. Hogan looks on his appointment as I do and inform me that his services are not as satisfactory to him as the engagement of some other person would be. It is not my place to interfere in the selection of a teacher and every step taken by me was in the interest of the Indians and your advancement. I know that you appreciated the manner in which Mr. McConkey conducted the School.\n\nA copy of your communication will be forwarded the Department of Indian Affairs with a recommendation that your request be granted. I feel sure the Department is anxious to assist in every way the advancement of our Indians and will give your request every consideration.\n\nYour &c.,\n\n(Sd.) Thomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the Massett Indian Day School was closed on the 9th inst. and the Teacher is leaving for the South.\n\nThe attendance has been so scant, recently, that it was considered advisable to close. The Indians are leaving for their fishing grounds, and are taking the children with them. We do not expect to open the school again until September, after the Indians return from the Canneries.\n\nI trust that some arrangement will be made to retain Mr. McConkey as school teacher. He has proved a splendid man for the position and is to be congratulated on the marked progress made during the short time he had control of the scholars.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th March last (No. I22723/1) with reference to \"the erection of a Boarding School in the village.\"\n\nIn reply permit me to state that a copy of your letter will be forwarded His Lordship Bishop DuVernet and, in compliance with your letter, No. I26932/1, on the same subject, Rev. Dr. Spencer will be informed of the action taken regarding the establishment of a Boarding School for the Skidegate Indians.\n\nYour letter states: \"They are away for a few weeks each season.\" The school returns will show that they have already commenced to leave. From 74, on the roll, the numbers have dwindled down to 30. The Assistant Teacher's services have been dispensed with. It is expected that the school will be closed on or about the 1st May and will remain closed until September\u2014about five months. Skidegate will also be in the same condition.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop DuVernet has been in Massett recently, and held several conferences with all parties concerned, on this matter. The Indians asked for a Boarding School during eight months of each year. They claim that all of the families are not on the Reserve until the 1st\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember.\n\nAt meetings with the Bishop of Caledonia, and with the Indians and also with the clergyman here and the Teacher, the matter was thoroughly discussed and, on leaving Massett, His Lordship promised to write me fully on the matter, for submission to you. We thoroughly understood that it was a problem, that required due consideration. We have now a very practical Teacher and he is advancing the Indians of Massett Reserve wonderfully; but I understand the arrangements with him are only temporary. Everyone realizes that good results would follow the retention on the Reserves of the children. The ways and means can only be reached after due consideration, and I will advise you of the action taken by His Lordship immediately on receipt of his views on the matter.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March 20th, last, and previous correspondence in reference to the appointment of Mr. McConkey as teacher of the Massett Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this appointment is satisfactory and payment will be made at the rate mentioned in official letter of January 31st, last. It is trusted that Mr. McConkey will meet with a large measure of success in his work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\n\nThos. Denay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor, in reply to your letter of the 8th inst., (No. I22723/T) to make the following report on the Teacher of Massett Indian Day School:\n\nName\u2014Charles A. McConkey.\nQualification\u2014articulated.\nFormer Experience as Teacher\u2014None.\nReligion\u2014Church of England.\nAge\u201434 years.\nNationality\u2014Canadian.\nFormer Occupation\u2014Farmer\u2014understands carpentry.\n\nAppointed by His Lordship The Bishop of Caledonia.\n\nIs a disciplinarian and takes a great deal of interest in the School. He is educating the children on practical lines and his method appeals to the children and parents.\n\nWill teach carpentry and has already taken up the teaching of gardening. With the assistance of the pupils fenced in a small enclosure round the schoolhouse, for a flower garden.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ult. (No. I22723/1) with reference to \"School Hours, Teacher's Residence and obtaining Competent Teachers.\"\n\nThe change in the Massett Indian Day School will be understood and appreciated when I inform you that the former teacher, Mr. Sherwood, notified me that he closed the school, not being able to handle the children. I had been allowing the new teacher to live with me, until Mr. Sherwood completed the month which had been given him to turn over the school, and, at a conference with the man now in charge, Mr. A. McConkey, and Mr. Sherwood\u2014held in my office\u2014the former immediately took charge of the school, where a marked change is noticeable. Mr. Sherwood could not enforce discipline, and, although a splendid man, otherwise, could not handle Indian children. He acknowledges inability to enforce discipline and takes no offence at being relieved. The new teacher is a good man and we will be fortunate if his services can be retained. He is a practical farmer and a carpenter and a good scholar.\n\nI will forward a copy of your letter to His Lordship Bishop DyMernet. It is certainly encouraging to know the Department realizes the difficulties, especially\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\nin this portion of the Dominion. I might state that the lady teacher, in the adjacent White settlement, (who is not a teacher with a certificate) receives $80 per month for teaching about 20 White children. Living is high; we are isolated and it is difficult to obtain the necessaries of life\u2014depending on one steamer, fortnightly\u2014and freight charges are unreasonable.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n382988\nEXD.\n\n122723/1\n\nOttawa, March 8, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 31st, last, and in reply to that portion in which you refer to the appointment of a new teacher who was to assume his duties on the 1st instant I have to ask you to report fully to the Department as to the name, qualifications, experience, age, etc., of this teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.M.T., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Dandy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWanette, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 57/May/II\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith copy of a communication received from His Lordship Bishop F. H. DuVernet with reference to the Indian Day School at Massett Reserve.\n\nIt has been difficult to obtain a good teacher and His Lordship requests an increase, to $700 per year, for the services of Mr. McConkey. Considering that the White teacher, in the adjacent White settlement, receives $85 per month, and is not in the possession of a certificate, the difficulty in obtaining a good White male teacher will be understood.\n\nWith regard to the Government taking over the school, I also agree with his Lordship. This can be understood when I state that His Lordship travels over a large area, and it is difficult to reach him, at times. The teacher receives his instructions from the Bishop and is responsible to him. We have our stated instructions, regarding the school; but no control over the teacher. At the present time, the school is closed. On the 11th inst., the teacher considered that it would be useless to keep the school open. The Indians were preparing to go to North Island, to their fishing grounds, and it was impossible to have a large attendance. On certain days, when I visited the school, but six pupils were in attendance. We used every endeavor\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto make the children attend, threatening to close the school and interviewing those who would call them together; but they would not attend and the school was closed. The teacher left for Prince Rupert, where, he stated, the Bishop would be interviewed by him.\n\nOn my return from Skidegate Reserve Rev. Mr. Hogan interviewed me regarding the children on the Reserve and informed me that the school should be re-opened. He stated that 23 children were on the Reserve; but a number of them had not attended school before the closing thereof and if only six could be relied on at the time (we had only that number at the end of April) I felt that to open the school again would be useless. When we had over 70 children in the village, and only six would attend, the number would surely be smaller when we had but 23 children. Further: The teacher was away and I did not know what arrangements he had made with the Bishop. It has always been usual for the school to close, when the Indians go to North Island and they left on the 15th inst.\n\nDuring His Lordship's visit, the clergyman, teacher and agent met with him. Questions arose which all present did not agree on. The former teacher informed me that he was under the orders of His Lordship and it was not known how the discipline of the school had fallen until I interviewed the Bishop on the question. The control of this school should be in the hands of a local officer, considering our isolation and the fact that His Lordship is away so often, even from Prince Rupert. Last year, the Teacher did not come to Massett until the children had been home a month. It would not interfere with the moral and spiritual education of the children and the present teacher is of the same denomination with the Indians, and always should be. It would avoid complications and would save a great deal of trouble. You have the Agent near the schoolhouse and he could be called on for advice and instruction. Instead of having the Bishop, clergyman, teacher and agent with separate duties, in connection with the school, where one or the other might consider advice an interference, there would be an understanding of the duties and responsibilities. As it is at present, the Teacher scarcely understands where his responsibili-\nties begin or end. We are all anxious to advance the Indian children; but complications will arise. I have been blamed for recommending Mr. McConkey, who was a stranger to me when he arrived here; but who, I learned was a good, conscientious man. Still, his appointment interfered with the plans of others, and I have found that no matter what we do in the public interest\u2014there are people to blame one for doing his best to advance even the Indian.\n\nThe letter from His Lordship speaks for itself and I am heartily in accord with the recommendations therein contained.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nIndian Agent's Office\nMasset Reserve, Massett B.C.,\nOct. 30th 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. McConkey reopened the Massett school, which was closed through sickness among the children.\n\nWith two good white male teachers, the day schools of this agency should now show marked improvement and it is also a matter of congratulation that both Anglican and Methodist Churches take so much interest in the schools that they have increased the salaries of the teachers, supplementing the grant allowed by the Dept. Mr. McConkey now receives $1600.00 per year and Mr. Russell $800.00.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. B/Aug/II.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMassett Reserve No. I, Massett B.C., Aug. 4th 1911.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of letter dated July 17th, (No. 122723/1) with reference to the School Building and the salary connected with the Massett Teacher.\n\nIn reply permit me to state that His Lordship was shown your letter, of the 14th June last, while I consulted with him, in Prince Rupert, and He made a note of the contents.\n\nThat His Lordship understands your advice to me I am positive of; but, in accordance with your instructions, a copy of your letter will be forwarded at once.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 14, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th ultimo with copies of correspondence that has passed between yourself and His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia in reference to the continuance of Mr. McConkey as teacher of the Massett school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the satisfactory reports received on Mr. McConkey's work the Department is prepared to assume the responsibility for his salary and will pay him at the rate of $700.00 per annum from the first of the current quarter. It is hoped that Mr. McConkey will see his way to remain and that this action will prove in the best interests of the school work at Massett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deny, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Cheque No. 1359, for the sum of Seventy-five Dollars, which I am holding, pending further instructions from you and for the following reasons:\n\nMiss Edenshaw did not teach during the Quarter ending September 30th 1911. The Indians were away, at their fishing camps, and it was not necessary to have an Assistant Teacher during that time.\n\nIn conversation with His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, I understood that some arrangement had been arrived at, with the Teacher, Mr. McConkey, regarding the teaching at the Massett School, and the services of an Assistant Teacher were dispensed with, when the attendance fell below a specified number of pupils. At the present time Mr. McConkey is teaching the whole School.\n\nI also understand that the payment of the Teachers is made by the employees receiving the Cheques and forwarding same to Rev. Mr. Keen. That gentleman then forwards them the amount arranged between the Church authorities and Teachers.\n\nI am writing His Lordship on this matter, enclosing a copy of this letter. You will please find copy of Letter to His Lordship attached.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nI have the honour to enclose copy of a letter forwarded the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\" with reference to a cheque received, in favor of Miss Josephine Adenshaw, in salary for services as Assistant Teacher of the Nassett Indian Day school for the quarter ending 30th Sept. 1911.\n\nIn withholding the Cheque permit me to state that Miss Adenshaw did not teach during the quarter end, being aware that you had made arrangements with Mr. Hosenkey, for the conduct of the school, and also with reference to the salary to be paid him, I considered it advisable to consult with the Department, and also with you before issuing the cheque.\n\nIn the course of a conversation we had, on my last visit to Prince Rupert, I understood that it was your intention to take up the matter of the salaries and the teaching staff of the Nassett Day School. I also understand that Miss Adenshaw intends to marry and will not be able to take up teaching, although I have not been officially informed that such is her intention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) [Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nHis Lordship,\nBishop P. H. DuVernet,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nOttawa December 5, 1911.\n\n16 Nov/11\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo with reference to cheque No. 1369, for $75.00 drawn in favour of Miss Edenshaw, assistant teacher of the Masset Indian day school which you are holding pending further instructions, I have to request that you will return this cheque to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nAs the Department had received no notification of Miss Edenshaw not returned to her duties during the September quarter, it was presumed she was still teaching, and the cheque was issued at the usual quarterly rate for her salary. In all future cases, where two teachers may be employed at any of the schools in your agency both should sign the quarterly return. You will also be good enough to see that full explanation is given in the column for \"Notes\" on the quarterly return with reference to all holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAset. Deputy and Secretary\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nMasset, B.C.\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th Nov. last with reference to the Indian Day School at Massett and, in reply, beg to state:\n\nMiss Adenshaw received a cheque for the sum of seventy-five ($75.00) dollars for the quarter ending June 30th 1911. During the quarter ending 30th September, Miss Adenshaw did not teach. The June cheque paid Miss Adenshaw for teaching during April and May, therefore I did not see my way clear to hand over a cheque to the young woman for a quarter in which no teaching was done, by her, until further advised by the Department.\n\nMr. Sherwood, on his own statement, was unable to control the children he had under him, when Miss Adenshaw was his Assistant and asked to be relieved. The present teacher, Mr. McConkey, finds no difficulty in teaching the children now in attendance and, should an Assistant be required, I do not know where we can obtain one for the sum appropriated. Mr. McConkey did not ask for an Assistant and I find that he is making better progress with the children than was noticeable last year. His work has always appeared satisfactory and I would be sorry to lose him; but he informs me that he does not intend to remain permanently. He states that he will finish the year, as agreed on, with you; but will give no assurance that he will remain longer. Mrs. McConkey would be willing to teach the girls to sew, provided the $300 grant is allowed. Mr. McConkey and I consider that the salary should not lapse, for the\n\nHis Lordship,\nBishop F. H. DuVernet,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nreason that an Assistant might be required at any time.\n\nMr. Hosenkey has a young child and household duties, and could not take the place as Assistant Teacher; but might teach the girls.\n\nWith reference to a Boarding School, I am of the opinion that your arguments against the installation of one, at Massett, are very sound. At the same time there is the question of educating the Indian children, and my diary shows that, from the beginning of May, to September, for five months, and even longer, the children do not attend the Day School. Only recently, at the end of November, did the children attend in any appreciable numbers, making six months of the year that the school is doing good for the majority. When the Indians returned from the canneries, they brought \"flue\" and \"smoking cough\" with them, and a number of the children died. The canneries are not good for the older Indians, let alone the children. They come back sick and unselfish, losing the moral and other training they had in the past. Some of the women do not return at all and others have lost all restraining influence. Associating with the whites, Japanese and Chinese, at the canneries, is not good for the Indians and, if we could keep the children at home, or in a boarding school, would mean everything for them in the future. As we stated in our conversations, it is a very difficult problem to solve.\n\nThere is also the question of the half-breeds. We have some here, and what is to be done with these children? Women marry and live with whites. The men leave them, or they die, and the women return to the reserves, bringing up the children as Indians. The marriage law among Indians is also the source of a great deal of immorality, which cannot be checked as the law stands.\n\nI am sorry to state also that some of the educat-\nled Indians are the worst offenders, in the way of drinking intoxicants. They associate with the Whites and appear to imagine that they must adopt some of their evil ways. We are now at the point where the influences of the evil disposed whites are being felt by the Indians of this Island. We now have saloons within a few miles of our reserves; there is no police restraint at all. Law and order is not enforced and it is to be deplored that the Indians are obtaining intoxicants. I cannot arrest men and try them too. Mr. Adams is doing his level best to stop it; but he is practically alone. The clergyman, teacher and agent are doing all they can to make the Indian realise that sobriety is essential to well-being; but the liquor habit is one that appeals to the Indian, and the result of the saloon and the easy manner of obtaining liquor is having its effect, not so much on the old and ignorant Indian, as on those who, through moral training and education, should know better. I have applied time and again for a Constable, and the Department informs me that it is the duty of the Provincial Police to preserve law and order. I am in hopes that a Dominion Police Officer will be appointed for the Island, should the Provincial Government not see fit to have an officer in this neighborhood. If moral suasion will not keep the traffic down, then the law must be invoked, and the sooner this is done, the better for our Indians.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Donkey\u2014I hope we can retain his services. He is bringing the Indian children forward and is very earnest in his work.\n\nA copy of your letter will be forwarded the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nNov. 30, 1911\n\nDear Mr. Deasy,\n\nOn it being represented to me that Mr. Sherwood was unable to teach the Massett Day School when the numbers were very large, I made an appeal to the Department and received the following reply dated Dec. 3rd, 1909. \"It will also pay his assistant, Miss Edenshaw, at the rate of $300 per annum during the time she is actually employed. Vouchers for the additional salary due to Mr. Sherwood and for the amount earned by Miss Edenshaw from April 1st to September 30th last should be forwarded through the Indian Superintendent for payment. Future returns should show whether Miss Edenshaw has been engaged in any quarter and for what time.\"\n\nIf Miss Edenshaw taught during the month of April last, and part of May she is entitled to receive salary for the time she taught. The school returns should show this. The fact that she did not teach in September does not debar her from receiving her just due for April and May.\n\nBefore this supplementary Grant at the rate of $300 per annum is allowed to lapse I should like to be assured both by you and Mr. McConkey that one teacher alone is able to teach over fifty scholars. If you deem Mr. McConkey quite able to manage alone perhaps the Department would allow this $300 to be added to his salary provided he remained the year round and added some Industrial training, such as farming, gardening, for boys and his wife teaching sewing &c. to the girls.\n\nFrom our experience of the great financial cost I hesitate to ask the Department to establish at Massett a full Industrial School. There would\nhave to be practically two boarding schools, one for boys and one for girls, and if there were twenty in each, from our experience at Metlakatla there would have to be three ladies for the girls school, and at least three, including a qualified trades instructor, for the boys. This means an enormous expense. The per capita grant cannot cover the cost unless there are at least 60 or 70 scholars. I am sure even if the Skidegates joined you could not keep the attendance up to this. If there is a death in the school, followed soon by another at once the parents take alarm and it is only by a warrant that you can force the children back.\n\nTherefore I still favour introducing into the Day School something of the Industrial element. Now that Mr. McConkey has his new house and large grounds I think he could well work in something of this sort especially if his wife will help with the girls, and I think the Department would favour this. Of course if Mr. McConkey is going to make this his life work, settling down in Massett as his home he should receive a larger salary than he is now receiving, and the Department might well add the supplementary Grant to what he is now receiving.\n\nAs you are on the spot and have studied the conditions I should like to know your views on the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\n\nThos. Deasy Esq.\nIndian Agent, Q.C. Agency.\nMasset, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 18/3/22\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nMassett Reserve, Massett, B.C., March 7th 1912\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the Massett Indian Day School, I have the honour to report that the attendance varies from six to ten pupils daily. In consultation with the Teacher I advised that the School be closed, with the consent of the Missionary here and that the Teacher should correspond with His Lordship Bishop DuVernet on the matter. Four of the ten pupils are children of one family, Mr. Henry Macdonald's, and I have written you on the status of this resident of the Reserve.\n\nI considered that it would be more to the interest of the Department if the Teacher should finish the construction of the residence; but he is under the orders of the Bishop and I did not wish to interfere in the School arrangements. His contract with the Bishop expires in May, and he states that he will not teach longer unless a Boarding School is placed here.\n\nThe question of a day school, at Naden Harbour, is one that requires consideration. The Indians are there now. The clergyman has been over, to select a site for a Church\u2014which can be used as a schoolhouse\u2014and, after its erection, by the Cannery Company, the placing of a School Teacher there, can be taken up, with His Lordship.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nThe teacher can see but one way of keeping the Indian children at school, and that is the creation of a boarding school here at which the Massett and Skidegate children would be taught the whole year. He feels satisfied that over sixty children would attend. Rev. Dr. Spencer, of Skidegate, favors the boarding school. Apparently, His Lordship Bishop Dynevor, did not desire to have a boarding school, under the auspices of the Anglican Church. I understand, from the teacher, that His Lordship has no objection to a school, to be conducted by the government, and under the spiritual direction of the clergy of the reserve. Dr. Spencer asserts that the Indians are not favorable to sending their children to schools located so far from their reserves that they cannot reach them, in times of illness.\n\nIt is but one hundred miles, to Skidegate and all of the Haidas are on this island, wintering at two reserves, Massett and Skidegate. They work at fishing, and in the canneries, during the summer, and the day schools have been closed, for months, each year, the Indians taking their children with them. A boarding school would keep the children at home and Dr. Spencer has no objection to the Skidegates attending a boarding school for both bands. Mr. McConkey states that he would take the principalship of a boarding school, under government control, and the head teacher, he suggested, might be a member of the denomination of Rev. Dr. Spencer's church. In the day school there is no control of the children, so far as attendance is concerned. When a family goes away, for wood, or for any other purpose, they take the children, and the attendance is never what it should be. There is, apparently, only one way to properly educate the Indian children of this agency, and that is in a boarding school. I find that few, if any, of the day scholars, who have been in the day schools, that can take their places with the women and children raised in the boarding schools. They attend school for four hours, daily-five days a week-and talk Haida the rest of the time, in their homes and among themselves. The Indians who have\nadvanced, are the pupils of the Boarding and Industrial School, formerly in Metlakatla. These men are eager to have the children advanced and the Teacher here desires to show results for his labours. He will not continue in the Day School, after this term, feeling that the results, occasioned by the nomadic pursuits of the Indians, takes away his brightest and best pupils.\n\nConsidering that the Haidas are looked upon, on this Coast, as Indians apart from the large majority-in advancement-I feel sure the Department will take up this question and assist in making the school arrangements for this Agency the best possible. It is a problem that has been considered by those, perhaps, better able to judge than I am; the Department understands the Day and Boarding School question, better than I do; but no children can be advanced unless taken from their environment and handled by their own superior knowledge. Indians they are; Indians they will remain; unless we take them from their parents and show them the customs and habits of the Whites, they will not be above the old customs and habits insculpted by their forebears.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 8/2/12\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C., February 6th 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th January last (No. 122723/I) with reference to \"the work of an Assistant Teacher at the Massett School,\" and, in reply, beg to state:\n\nThe contents of your letter I laid before Mr. and Mrs. McConkey, and, considering that it is the intention of Mr. McConkey to give up teaching the School, they did not feel disposed to accept the offer made.\n\nWith the change now going on, and the Indians at Virago Sound, the attendance at School has fallen to \"fourteen\" pupils, on the 5th inst. It is apparent that the School, on the Massett Reserve, will not have a good attendance, during the next eight months. The Cannery, in course of erection, will take the people there for some time. It is the intention of the company to erect buildings, in which the Indians will live, and, while the men are fishing, in Hecate Straits, the women and children will make their homes at the cannery, twenty miles away from Massett. A few of the Indians will remain in Massett; but the large majority will reside, for the best part of the year, at Virago Sound.\n\nWith the deep sea fishing industry engaging the attention of those interested, and cold storage plants at Prince Rupert and other places, the male Indians will be\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbe scattered, in the various fishing camps, and many of them will take their wives and children with them. The nearest Reserve to the Cannery is \"Kung,\" across the harbour from the place where the cannery is under construction.\n\nIf the plans of the fishing company are carried out, and the Massett Indians are engaged for the best part of the year at this cannery, it would be either advisable for the Department to apply to the company for a site for a school and residence, near the cannery, where the Teacher could reside during the months the Indians are engaged there, or to have a Boarding School, at Massett, for the Skidegate and Massett children.\n\nOn account of this change, and Mr. McConkey's intention to resign, the directions to engage Mrs. McConkey cannot be carried out.\n\nI would recommend that the Bishop of Caledonia be consulted on the question. It would be a matter affecting the Church, as well as the School, and, considering that His Lordship engages the Teacher, it is possible that he has plans which would tend to have a man at Virago Sound to look after the Spiritual affairs of the Indians, who could also act in the capacity of school teacher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 10, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo in reference to the work of the assistant teacher at the Massett School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is inclined to favourably consider your suggestion that the wife of the teacher assist in the class-room during those periods when the attendance is too heavy for one teacher to satisfactorily perform the duties, or to take charge of the classes while Mr. McConkey is engaged in giving instruction in industrial training, such as farming, gardening, etc. At other times Mrs. McConkey's duties would be to teach domestic science to the girls and also to do some field matron work in the homes of the Indians on the Reserve when called upon. For this service a salary of $300.00 per annum will be allowed and, if the terms are suitable to Mrs. McConkey, she may take up the work at once and the salary will be paid from the date on which she commences. Short monthly reports showing the work performed should be forwarded through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Denay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith letter received from His Lordship Bishop R. H. DuVernet with reference to matters pertaining to the Indian Day School on Massett Reserve and also regarding the Cheque in favor of Miss Edenshaw, which has been withheld, pending instructions from you.\n\nIn regard to the contents of His Lordship's communication, I am enclosing my answer, which will explain the condition of things and which will, I trust, meet with your approval.\n\nReferring to the Cheque: Miss Edenshaw did not teach since last April and received the salary cheque for the June quarter. During July and August, until the 1st September, was the closed season and Miss Edenshaw did not act as Assistant Teacher since the time His Lordship considered that one teacher could manage the number then attending\u2014in April last. The cheques sent through me I hand, or mail, to the person whose name appears on same. Knowing that Miss Edenshaw did not teach during the quarter, I withheld the cheque pending further instructions.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nquestion of a Boarding, or Industrial, School is one that\nthe Indians brought up, during the visit of the Bishop at\nMassett, in April last. The Indians desired to leave their\nchildren at home, while away at the Canneries, and the\nSkidegate band also wished to do likewise; but it is a\nsubject, as His Lordship states, of such magnitude that\nit is questionable whether it can be entertained. If we\ncan induce the Indians to remain at home and cultivate their\nland, and if the cold storage of fish, which is now being\nconsidered, could be carried out, we might stop the exodus\nevery Summer, to the canneries, which only means trouble\nand sickness and which the Indians are beginning to realize\nis not for their benefit.\n\nRegarding the Teacher, Mr. McConkey, he is\ndoing good work and, as he remarks, his services are\nworth all the Department can afford to give him. I understand\nthat he receives a salary, at the rate of $1,000 a year, from\nHis Lordship, while teaching. Should he leave, it would re-\nquire more than one teacher to manage the scholars and he well\nearn the money now paid him. His wife might be engaged to\nteach the girls sewing &c., and to take charge of them while\nMr. McConkey is engaged in teaching the boys gardening and\nother outside work. Just now, Mr. McConkey has one of the\nlarge boys assisting with the Primer classes. He is giving\nthe children object and drawing lessons and appeals to them\nin many ways that brings them forward; but the break in each\nyear will always deter any teacher from making satisfactory\nprogress, and this Mr. McConkey feels, as we all do.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As this change would entail some expense the Department is prepared to pay the actual moving expenses of Mr. McConkey and his wife to Naden Harbour and return. On account of the distance from Ottawa and the length of time that it takes for communications to go and come the Department would like you to try to arrive at some satisfactory solution of this difficulty, but it should be understood that no additional expense will be incurred to the Department other than the transport of the teacher and for any supplies that it may be necessary to send in for the schoolroom, such as desks, etc. The old desks might be sent to Naden Harbour. I shall be glad to hear what arrangements are finally made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 34/3/12\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\nMassett Reserve No. I., Massett, B.

The teacher appears to be very unsettled; but is doing his best under the conditions caused by the expulsion of the Indians to Naden Harbour. There is no fault to find with the Indians, for going where so large a number received employment, or with the teacher, who is doing his best to keep up the school, with a very small attendance.\n\nIt is my intention to visit Naden, when the next steamer, or launch, leaves Massett. I will then report further.\n\nThe letter to His Lordship explains all other matters concerning the school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform Your Lordship that instructions have been received, from the Department of Indian Affairs, to take up with you the question of a Day School at the new Cannery, now in course of construction, at Naden Harbour.\n\nThe attendance, at Massett Indian Day School, is so small that the Teacher, Mr. McConkey, closed the institution, for some days; but re-opened it when he found that from ten to twelve children would attend. With the exception of Mr. Edenshaw's family, there are few children in Massett. The cannery company will build houses and, I understand, will erect a building, for Church and school purposes. We could send over the desks now in the Massett school, with the books and other articles required; but the question of making provision for the Teacher arises. Mr. McConkey states that he will go to Naden Harbour; but he considers that he should receive certain expenses for so doing. I hear that he is corresponding with you on the school question. It is not my place to advise him on any matter concerning the management of the school, although we talk over matters for the betterment of the children and do everything in our power to advance them. He states that his engagement expires, in May, and we should know whether the school will continue, under the changed order of things, after that date. I have consulted with Rev. Mr. Hogan His Lordship.\n\nF. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nand we are of the opinion that the attendance would be good\nmore would be accomplished, by having a teacher at Naden\nHarbour. I have no official information regarding the con-\nstruction, by the Cannery Company, of a building. If one is\nerected, provision should be made for two, or three, rooms\nfor a teacher to reside in. I understand that Rev. Mr. Hogan\nis corresponding with the Cannery Company.\n\nDuring the month of April, the Indians will leave for\nNorth Island, to fish for spring salmon. Whether they will\ntake their children, or leave them at Naden Harbour, is a\nmatter that should be considered. When they start fishing,\nthey will go into camp, in various places, on the island, and\nthe cannery steamer will call there and take the fish to the\ncannery. Women will be employed, in the cannery, and this\nshould mean that the children will be left at Naden Harbour.\nI do not think that the Department, or the church, should go\nto any great expense, in connection with opening a school at\nNaden Harbour. The Nassett teacher could be transferred to\nthat place; we could use the books and other school material\nnow in the Nassett day School. It would only require that\nthe teacher be arranged with.\n\nWe are ordering fifty simple desks, for the Nassett\nday School, and will be able to place the old desks at Naden.\nIt is also proposed to paint the Nassett schoolhouse and place\na good chimney thereon. It is a certainty that the Nassett Band\nwill spend the winter months, at Nassett Reserve, and the\nsummer months on Graham Island, which means that they will be\naway from the old cannery town and mixing with other people.\nNaden Harbour is over twenty miles from the place where in-\ntoxicating liquor is sold, by licence, and this will help in\nkeeping them away from evil influences. We will have them\nunder the direct supervision of your Missionary and the Agent\nall of the year. If it is possible to keep the children at\nschool, this arrangement would be a blessing. They are at\nNaden Harbour now, and but few on the Reserve. Just so long\nas the cannery company keeps them at deep sea and river\nfishing, they will remain at Naden Harbour. It would mean\nthe closing of the Nassett school from April to September,\nor later, and the change would give the Indians an opportunity\nto have their children at school.\n\nThe Department has now legalized the Indian Council.\nUnder the Advancement Act, the Indian Council can compel the\nattendance of children at school, under penalty for non-attend-\nance. We might try the plan, for this year, provided the can-\nnery company will erect the buildings, and we would be in a\nposition, before the close of the cannery, to know whether it\nit would be advisable to take other steps to educate the Band.\n\nI would be thankful to have your views on the matter, for\ntransmission to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Thomas Dray,\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 35/3/12\nAND\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMasset Reserve, Massett, B.C., March 30th 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Duplicate of a Letter received from His Lordship Bishop F.H. DuVernet, with my answer thereto, in reference to the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nThe Teacher, Mr. McConkey, has been over to Prince Rupert, and conferred with His Lordship on the matter.\n\nWith the Rev. Wm. Hogan, the Missionary here, I have been to Naden Harbour, and looked over the situation. The Indians are still camping there, in tents, and a number of houses, a cannery and a wharf are in course of construction. We interviewed the Superintendent there, and he is now corresponding with the Managers re. the construction of a combined School and Church, a frame building, 50 feet by 26 feet, with two rooms adjoining, for the accommodation of a teacher. We could take the old desks and the other material, now in Massett Day School, for use there and bring it all back, when the Indians return home, in the Fall.\n\nI do not understand what the intentions of Mr. McConkey, the teacher, are. Whether he will go there, or not, or whether he will remain here, when his contract with His Lordship expires, are matters that I am leaving with His Lordship and Mr. McConkey, considering that he was engaged by His Lordship and is directly responsible to him.\n\nWith regard to the contents of the letter from His Lordship, I might state that no instructions are given\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\ngiven the Teacher, at any time, from this office. We inspect and report to you, on the School, and carefully avoid interference of any kind in the management.\n\nThe question of an Advisory Board and Governmental control are matters that are not within my province and are submitted to you for consideration.\n\nMr. McConkey has been advising that a Boarding School is the only solution of the problem of educating the Nassett and Skidegate Bands. This matter also is one that required careful consideration, on the part of all concerned, and I informed him that the Department could not consider it, this year, in time to meet the changed order of things consequent on the Indians moving to another place.\n\nI feel that it would be advisable for a Teacher to go over to Naden Harbour; but he cannot be expected to live there and teach until a residence and a school building have been placed. Considering that it is private property, on which the Indians will live, I also advised that the Cannery Company erect the buildings and allow the Department to use them, for school purposes. Thus they appear willing to do and, when all is ready, I would advise that the Teacher be moved there.\n\nApparently, the reason for His Lordship's suggestion, with regard to an Advisory Board, is our isolation. There are times when matters of importance should be decided in less than a month. We have but a fortnightly mail and a letter takes a month to receive attention and an answer. I have been consulted, very often, by the Missionary here, Rev. W. Hogan; but cannot take any responsibility that might interfere with the arrangements of the Bishop and the Teacher. The Teacher also consults with me, and I give advice that might prove beneficial; but must always refer him to His Lordship for direct orders, on any matter pertaining to the conduct of the school. Mr. McConkey is not pleased with the advancement being made, and the attendance, desiring results that cannot be attained when pupils are moving from place to place. This, unfortunately, we cannot help. I know that the clergyman, Rev. Mr. Hogan, gives him no instructions.\nThe School has been going on, all Winter, as usual; but the sudden departure of the Indians has thrown out all calculations, and we now know that they will not return for many months.\n\nThe Teacher has just moved into his new residence, and a change, to Naden Harbour, will upset his plans also; but we must do what is requisite for the good of the Indians and it appears to me, it will be necessary to have a teacher at Naden Harbour as soon as the arrangements are made for the accommodation of the children and teacher. We must all remember that we are here for their benefit, and, should it bring inconvenience, the good of the Indians must be our first consideration.\n\nI am also of the opinion that the salary of the Teacher is a fair one. He now has a house and grounds, teaches four hours each school day and has two days in each week to himself and after school hours. The Provincial School Teachers pass examinations and are under expense, for rent and otherwise. Of course, where living is high, and we are isolated, the position is not an enviable one; but we all have to accept conditions, as they are, and the school teacher should take the same view of affairs that we do. Living on a Reserve, among the Indians, is a condition that we make when we accept positions, and, although we would all like to better ourselves, still, the question of duty calls for our best efforts.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nMar. 20, 1912.\n\nThomas Deasy Esq#  \nIndian Agent, Q.C.I.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th Inst. regarding the Massett Day School.\n\nOn account of the manner the people of Massett are shifting about the school problem is a very difficult one. As I am some distance away and it is necessary that action should be taken sometimes without much delay I would suggest through you to the Indian Department that there should be an Advisory School Board for Massett consisting of:\n\n1. The Bishop of Caledonia,\n2. The Indian Agent of Queen Charlotte Agency, and\n3. The Anglican Missionary in charge of the Massett Band.\n\nThat the teacher be employed for the whole year to act under the advice of this School Board. This Board to decide whether the teacher should follow the people from Massett to Naden Harbour, North Island &c.\n\nThat in the event of the teacher following the people and teaching the children for the full school year, allowing only six weeks holiday, that the Department be requested to raise his salary and pay him $1,000. a year. The number of school children is large and provided by following them he can secure a good average attendance this, while putting the teacher to some inconvenience, seems about the most economical method of dealing with the problem. By having a School Board the Indian Agent, and through him the Government, not only has, as at present, a general\noversight, but a direct voice in deciding when the teacher should move over to the summer school, when he should take his holiday &c.\n\nAs the Indian Agent is resident at Massett this could be done in this case. It seems to me that such an advisory School Board under the circumstances would be a happy solution of one difficulty. At present the teacher scarcely knows whose instructions he is to follow.\n\nAs the teacher's full time will be given to the school work, and none to Church work it is only fair that the Government should pay his salary.\n\nAs I have already said I am prepared to hand the whole matter over to the Government provided that the Church's right to give religious instruction to our children in the Day School or Boarding School is duly safeguarded.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to secure qualified teachers for Indian Day Schools when we cannot offer a salary equal to the Provincial School teacher's salary.\n\nIf you have any suggestion to make I shall be glad to confer with you. Our agreement with Mr. McConkey will end May 15th next. I think it would be a mistake to lose him, and yet I feel that unless something such as I have indicated is done he could scarcely be expected to continue.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nIndian Agent's Office,\n\nNassett Reserve, Nassett, B.C., March 30th 191\n\nMay it please Your Lordship:\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., with reference to the Nassett Indian day school and agree with you that the shifting about of the Indians of the Nassett band makes the school problem a difficult one. Your letter will be submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs for consideration and I will await instructions.\n\nThe suggestion, with respect to an Advisory Board, consisting of Your Lordship, the Anglican Missionary, and the Agent would appear to be timely, considering our isolation and the question of the Teacher following the Indians, on the islands. The recent move was made without notice to us and but four families are now here. The erection of a cannery and buildings, at Naden Harbour, means a large pay-roll, to the Indians, and there is no doubt that they will be there, for some time. I understand that the cannery company will construct a schoolhouse and church, combined, and rooms for a teacher to reside in, near the residences of the Indians. It would be impossible for a teacher to follow them to their scattered camps, on North Island (Hungrara), so might induce the Indians to leave their families at Naden Harbour, during the time the men are fishing for spring salmon-six weeks-about 56 miles from Naden.\n\nWith regard to the salary of the Teacher: The Department raised the salary, and provided a house and grounds. He teaches but four hours each day-five days\n\nHis Lordship,\n\nP. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\neach week. We have tried to make it as comfortable as possible, for Mr. McConkey; but he has informed me that he will not remain, unless the children are in a Boarding School. The Agent visits the school and consults with the teacher; but gives no instructions to him, reporting to the Department. The Inspector of Schools, the Inspector of Agencies and the Missionary visit the school; but I have not heard that Mr. McConkey receives instructions from any other source but from Your Lordship. He has brought several matters before me; but I always refer him to you. There is no doubt that the absence of the Indians, during the summer, is not conducive to their advancement, and is a disappointment to the teacher; but this cannot be avoided. He has been a good teacher and, as stated, the Department has made many provisions to aid him; but the Boarding School question, as discussed by all concerned, is a problem also, which deserves a great deal of consideration. That it would be of benefit, I am convinced; but the ways and means and the taking charge of same by the Government, are questions that Your Lordship and the Department must decide. Mr. McConkey suggests the handing over of the education of the band to the Government\u2014whether originated with him and was probably brought before you at his recent consultation with you. It was one that I would not discuss, with him considering that it was no part of the business of the Indian Agent.\n\nI feel that Mr. McConkey should inform Your Lordship whether he desires to continue teaching, after the 15th May, when his agreement with you expires. The salary, with a free house and grounds, with the hours on duty, appears to me to be very fair. It is a more remunerative one than mine, considering the time we are employed. The Department also offered to employ Mrs. McConkey, as an Assistant; but the position was not accepted.\n\nThe Cannery, at Naden Harbour, is on private property, and the building of a combined Church and School should be undertaken by the owners. Rev. Mr. Hogan corresponded with Mr. Wallace on the matter and we are awaiting results, after selecting a site. With no accommodation, it is not considered advisable for the teacher to go there now and we are awaiting developments. The Indians employed took their families with them, and are camped, in tents. Their houses will be ready shortly, when Massett will be entirely deserted.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nThe holding of school, at Massett, is doing little good, on account of the very small attendance.\n\nWhether the Indians will take their children to the fishing camps, on the island, during the summer, is a question. We feel sure that they will not be again in Massett for many months. Of one thing we can be thankful\u2014the Indians will not go out to the towns and fishing camps on the mainland. We will be in touch with them all the year and able to look after them better, and they will not return with sickness and death as a result of the season's work. There are one hundred men now employed, at good wages, which means a great deal to them. The problem of educating the young Indians is as far from being solved as ever; but we hope for the best and all are doing everything that is possible to make them moral and to advance them spiritually and intellectually. Their financial condition will improve and we have little doubt that they are better off, at the work now undertaken, than ever before, physically, with little sickness and the yearly report will show that there has been an increase in numbers.\n\nI know that your lordship is anxious about the welfare of your people, and the Massett, as a band, can compare favorably with any Indians on the coast. We are unanimous in our efforts, without the least friction to cause anxiety to you, the Department or the bands. They have been receiving employment from the Government and are all content.\n\nIf there is any matter, concerning the school, which can be dealt with by me, kindly advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You were also in that letter informed that the Department would bear the expense of the transport of the teacher and necessary supplies to Naden Harbour.\n\nThe Department is not of opinion that the services of a formally constituted school board, as suggested by His Lordship, are necessary; at the same time any recommendations and suggestions made by His Lordship or the Missionary or yourself as Indian Agent will be gladly received and given due consideration.\n\nWith regard to the salary I may say that it is considered that the salary now allowed Mr. McConkey, $700.00 per annum with residence at Massett, is a fair one when it is taken into consideration that a further sum of $300.00 per annum is to be allowed Mrs. McConkey at Massett when the attendance is too heavy for one teacher.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nto perform the duties.\n\nIt is considered that the question of the time when the teacher will leave Massett for Naden Harbour may safely be left to the judgement of yourself and the teacher, as the movements of the Indians after all are what control this.\n\nI may say that the Department is not prepared at the present time to consider the question of the erection of a permanent boarding school at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency.\n\nMassett Reserve, Massett, B.C., April 3rd 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith quarterly report on the Massett Indian Day School for the quarter ending 31st March 1912.\n\nIn connection therewith permit me to state:\n\nThe Indians left for Naden Harbour, on the 1st February last, to work on the construction of cannery buildings. Few children were left in Massett. They are asking for a teacher at Naden Harbour and correspondence has been in progress, with His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, directing his attention to the changed order of things and the necessity of having the Teacher moved to Naden. The Indians there are not on a Reserve, and the cannery proprietors have been asked to erect a building for school purposes, and a residence for the teacher. The Teacher visited Prince Rupert and consulted with His Lordship on the question.

He also stated that no action, towards the engagement of a teacher, would be taken, until he heard from the Department.\n\nSince the time of the resignation of Mr. McConkey, we have been without a teacher. An application was made, to me, by Mr. R. W. Baker, for the position and, under the circumstances, I considered it in the best interests of the Department to appoint him, temporarily, his duties to commence on the 22nd inst. Considering that the large majority of the children have not been attending school, since the 1st February last, and will possibly be located at Naden Harbour for some time yet, I have asked Mr. Baker to proceed there. I consulted with Rev. W. Hogan, the Anglican clergyman in Massett, and he recommends\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Baker. In the application, Mr. Baker states: \"I hereby beg to apply for the position of school teacher, to the Indians at Old Mac Graham Island. I would require seventy-five dollars and house included, per month. I am married and my wife is with me, and also two children. The qualifications that I can offer are certificate for matriculation at Edinburgh University and subsequent five years study. I have also certificates for surgery and infirmary work, and my knowledge in that department may prove useful in emergency cases at Naden Harbour etc., where no doctor is present. If it should be decided that I take this appointment, I shall earnestly do my best for the Indians in every way. I can offer the following references as to my standing and life during the past several years:\n\nDr. Lionel Pentreath, Port Hammond, B.C., cousin of Archdeacon Pentreath, whom I know personally. The Rev. Govier, Port Hammond, B.C., Dr. Dolby, Dunsmuir Street, Vancouver, B.C., Mr. R. Layeby, J.P., Port Hammond, B.C.\"\n\nAfter consulting with Mr. Baker, he added the following to his application: \"Until further arrangements are made, I am willing to accept present salary at rate of $700 per annum.\"\n\nJust so soon as arrangements can be made for a conveyance, to Naden Harbour, the teacher, with his effects and his family, and the desks and other supplies, will be sent there, and school opened.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMr. Baker.

A. McConkey, and to submit to following with reference to the Massett Day School:\n\nOn the 1st February last, nearly the whole of the Band moved to Naden Harbour, to work on the construction of Cannery Buildings, for the Wallace Fisheries Company. The few children remaining went to school for a short time; but the attendance became so small that it was decided to close the school, the Teacher, in the time between the closing and when his resignation took effect, worked at painting the residence of the school teacher, a new residence which he occupies; but he did not complete the work before his term expired. In the meantime, we had made arrangements with the Fisheries Company to have a building near the Cannery, for a school at Naden Harbour. This building is now ready; but we are in need of a Teacher. I have corresponded with His Lordship Bishop De Vernet, on the question, and also had a number of interviews with the local clergyman. The old school desks, and other supplies, are ready for shipment, to Naden Harbour, and I\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nwill endeavor to see His Lordship on my way to Skidegate, from which place I leave, to-morrow, via Prince Rupert.\n\nIt is impossible to obtain a good teacher in Massett. Rev. Mr. Hogan suggested Miss Edenshaw, for the position; but, in a letter, received some time ago, from the Bishop, he did not then consider Miss Edenshaw, who is a member of the Band, capable of handling the school. She has served, as Assistant Teacher, with the small children; but with a large number of children, we require someone older and one who will exercise discipline and management, with the power to carry out any instructions given. Where we have Indians, related to one another, as the Massett's are, an outside teacher would be preferable. I was sorry to lose the services of Mr. McConkey; but he stated that he could not continue, at the salary offered at the expiration of his term, a matter over which I have no control.\n\nI trust that the interview, which I hope to hold with His Lordship\u2014should he be at Prince Rupert\u2014will result in the immediate appointment of a teacher.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nJune 28, 1912\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn my letter of May 30th, dealing in particular with the Massett Indian Day School but touching upon the broad question of the relationship between the Indian Department and the Church authorities in so far as Indian Day Schools are concerned I pointed out the gradual change which is taking place which can only have one conclusion.\n\nSince writing another illustration has arisen bearing upon the same general policy of the Department.\n\nIndian School Inspector has reported to the Department that our lady missionary, Miss Jackson, who has taught the Indian Day School at Metlakatla so faithfully for so many years, should be removed. The Department has written to Mr. Perry, Indian Agent at Metlakatla, instructing him to notify me to this effect, which he has done.\n\nFor fifteen years our Church has paid Miss Jackson $500 a year. Up to a short time ago the Department allowed only $300 a year. Now the grant is only $400. Nothing being allowed for travelling expenses in securing a teacher from a distance.\n\nIn the Department's letter to Mr. Deasy, Indian Agent at Massett, the following sentence occurs: \"It is considered that the question of the time when the teacher will leave Massett for Naden Harbour may safely be left to the judgment of yourself and the teacher.\" This is conclusive proof that the Department recognizes the Indian School Inspector and the Indian Agent as the authorities to remove, direct, and control the Indian Day School teachers. It simply allows the Church authorities with great difficulty and with much cost to secure a teacher, and add sufficient to the Department's grant to make it worth while accepting, with the possibility of the Indian School Inspector reporting against the teacher.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nIt seems to me that there can be only one possible outcome of such a development. I am not protesting against it. I think it a logical conclusion. If the Department will in the case of Indian villages where our Church has full charge of the religious side of the work only make provision that our missionaries shall have the privilege of imparting religious instruction in the schools to our Church children I see no reason why the Department should not have full control of the Indian Day Schools. As I said in my last letter it might not be wise to change too rapidly\u2014for example in an Indian village far away from an Indian Agent where our clergyman who talks the language is the only white man he must in a sense be the chief representative of Civil as well as Religious authority, but in the case where there is a resident Indian Agent who feels that the Department expects him to exercise authority where Department money is being expended there cannot be any reason for a divided authority. I am not complaining of the action of either Mr. Perry, or Mr. Deasy. They have endeavoured to be fair to the Church. But from the Church's standpoint the drift of events has made the dual position untenable. With a sincere desire to promote the best interests of our Indian Day Schools and to co-operate most cordially with the Department I would in the case of both Nassett and Metlakatla where there are resident Indian Agents, relinquish the privilege so kindly hitherto granted me of nominating the teacher for the Day Schools.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

DuVernet, with reference to the resignation of Teacher, Mr. C. A. McConkey, and requesting that some temporary arrangement be made to fill the position of Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nAlso, please find enclosed, my answer to His Lordship.\n\nIn this Western country, especially on Queen Charlotte Island, it is difficult to engage teachers, at the salary paid them. The Indians are making three dollars per day, and a teacher for the Provincial Government receives $80 per month. The school hours have been increased, and Mr. McConkey informed His Lordship that his lowest salary would be $1,000 per year, receiving pay for the months employed, at the above rate. The Teacher at Skidegate Reserve informed me that he is also resigning. Both Mr. McConkey and Mr. Russell were good teachers.\n\nThe school building, at Naden Harbour, will be ready next week; but we are now without a teacher, and, when I called at His Lordship's office, I was informed that he would be away from Prince Rupert for a month.

Denny Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter enclosing Mr. McConkey's resignation to take effect on the 4th of this month.\n\nAs the time is too short for me to secure a suitable teacher I think if you and Mr. Hogan could make some temporary arrangement it might be best. $60 a month while teaching five days in each week. Government cheque to be endorsed to Canon Keen to cover this period. Under the new regulations we are sure the Government will pay.\n\nI have written to the Department asking them to assume the full responsibility but until we hear from Ottawa I am willing to accept a temporary teacher recommended by both of you for the salary mentioned, time not to exceed three months.\n\nYours &c.,\n(Rd.) F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nMay it please Your Lordship:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th inst., with reference to the resignation of teacher, Mr. J. A.

Consulted with the Reverend gentleman there and endeavored to have a teacher sent from Prince Rupert.\n\nConsulted here, with Rev. W. Ross, and we could not find any person suitable for the position in Massett. It is unfortunate, at the present time, when we are making arrangements to move the school furniture to Haden Harbour and will have a building ready for occupancy on the 1st of June.\n\nI will forward a copy of your letter to the Department and enclose to you copy of a letter received from the Department on the question of a formally constituted School Board and the salary allowed the teacher, by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nHis Lordship\n\nF.

It is to be hoped that you will be able to arrange for the services of some competent person to take charge of the school temporarily during the summer and in the meantime you should communicate with the Bishop with a view to obtaining the services of a permanent teacher.\n\nWith a number of your communications lately you have enclosed copies of your correspondence with others.

Mr. Macdonald informed me at the expiration of the time of his contract with you, on the 15th June, and he will require a new teacher before the school can be opened. The children have been at school herself, since the last February, and we are anxious to have the school opened as soon as possible.

We have also removed the old desks in the school house and had things arranged to move to Naden Harbour, on receiving advice from there that the building is ready.

Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 28th, with reference to the administration of Day Schools in your Diocese, I have to inform you that the Department is prepared to pay to properly qualified teachers the salary paid in the various localities by the Provincial Government. The Department does not wish to weaken the interest taken by the Church in the educational work amongst the Indians, and will co-operate with the Church Authorities in endeavouring to procure persons who can give satisfactory service as teachers. In cases where the Department has been able to engage the teacher and where he or she would not be competent to impart the religious instruction, opportunity will be given to allow the Missionary to impart such instruction at proper times. I note that your Lordship says, \"I see no reason why the Department should not have full control of the Indian Day Schools.\" The actual control has always remained with the Department but it is not the desire to sever connection with the religious bodies who have assisted with the School work.\n\nI may say that a teacher has just been engaged for the Massett School and will be paid at the rate of $850.00 a year, which includes his wife's services in the capacity of Field Matron.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHis Lordship F.

Clement, M.P., by the Councillors of the Massett band of Indians dealing with school matters on their reserve, I beg to say that the Indians state that since the closing of the Metlakatla Industrial school their children have been practically without education as the constant change of teachers occasioned by the small salary allowed has resulted in no advancement being made by the children.\n\nThe Indians claim that they ought to have a good school. There are 53 children of school age on the reserve and the enrolment for the September quarter was 52 but the average was only 10, as most of the children were absent with their parents. There is nothing to prevent a good school being carried on there, if a permanent teacher could be secured. The only way to obtain one is to pay a liberal salary. The poorest class of teachers in white schools\nin this section of British Columbia receive $360.00 a year\nand the Department will have to meet the local salaries.\nMr. Deasy reports that the last teacher has just resigned\nand that he has secured the temporary services of a Mr Clay-\nberg, a university graduate. Mr. Clayberg will only accept\nthe position on the assurance that he will be paid at the\nrate of $85.00 a month or $850.00 a year. He is a married\nman and his wife is a High school graduate.\n\nI would recommend that the services of Mr. Clay-\nberg be accepted at the above rate on the understanding\nthat Mrs. Clayberg does some field matron work among the\nIndian women on the reserve.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nWe must meet Mrs.\nCompetitive Salary of Mr.\nProvincial School Teacher Reserve\nfor teachers of locality\nConsidering the locality\nMrs. Salary is now\nannually.\nH.S.

On our reserve at Massett there is an Indian Day School and that school has been placed there for a number of years; and we sorry to say no result has been shown yet from that school.\n\nAfter the Institution at Metlakatla was closed our children are about standing still under the present circumstances. We ought to be given a good institution where we can put our children to learn the things they should learned. At present we are very sorry to say that some of our children are now beyond control, just for lack of education. There is institution on the other end of the province but we under our conditions we are not affording to send any expenses towards the sending of our children to such destination.\n\nAnd also for these last many years we would not keep a teacher in Massett of account of salary is so small. We had a very good man last year named Chas McConkey and lost him on account of small salary and again not long ago Mr Rev Hogocon had managed to found a man got a family who is now doing what he can for our children and we afraid we may lose him too as the salary he is getting now will never keep him and his family.\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nChief Councillor Alfred Adams\ndo Roger Wia\u0161\n\n(And three others)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir:-I have the honour to inform you that I have just received the resignation of Mr. E. W. Baker, teacher of the Massett Bay School, with the following explanation, from him:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Deasy:-I regret to have to inform you that I must resign my post as School Teacher, on the return of the Indians to Massett. I have rather expected it for a week or two, owing to the reluctance of the Land Agent to grant me leave of absence from pre-emption; but have only heard definitely from him this week, hence the short notice. It appears several preemptions have been \"jumped\" the last year at Tow Hill, and although I could get an extension of two months, over the two months allowed off (four in all), it would not be worth while changing to Massett for a few weeks. Also, as you know, the Government made no mention of my application for a salary of seventy-five dollars per month. I told them (as you know) in my application, that I would take the position temporarily at the present salary until I heard from them re. a rise in salary. This was totally ignored, and at present salary (about $58.50 per month) it is not worth taking it on. I hear there will probably be a rise next quarter; but, in any case, I should have to leave before then, to save my land, even if I got four months leave.\n\nCasually I heard Mr. Clayberg was looking for a position here or at Rupert, and I recommended him to try for this, and thus save any break in the quarter. I believe he has written you on the subject. I must thank you, and shall do so, next week, personally, for your kindness to us, during our short season, and only wish we could have kept it.\"\n\nI have also received the following from Mr. Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 64/02, File 828-1, part 1)\nH. L. Clayberg:\n\n\"Mr. Baker tells me that he is obliged to resign his position as School Teacher to the Indian Day School, in order to go upon his land. That being so, I beg to apply for the position, to fill the vacancy created by his resignation. As to qualifications, I have had a first-class education, having taken a four years course and graduated from a university. I am married and have my wife with me. I feel that I am in every way competent to fulfill the duties and obligations entailed by the position and give satisfaction. If the position were given me, I can assure you I would do my utmost for the children in every way compatible with my duties and the regulations of the government. I should, however, require a substantial increase upon the present salary, for I cannot support myself and wife comfortably on sixty dollars per month. I am informed that the instructor to the White children, at Massett, is receiving compensation at the rate of eighty-five dollars per month, and I understand he is neither a certified teacher, nor a graduate. Under those circumstances, I can see no reason why I should not receive at least the same compensation he does, particularly as my work will naturally be much more difficult instructing Indian children while he has White children to teach. However, I would accept the present salary for thirty days, to enable you to communicate with the Department. If, at the end of that time I did not receive the increase to amount stated above, I would desire to reserve the right to resign the position, at once. If you care to take me on these terms I could come over immediately with the Indians and take up the work where Mr. Baker drops out. If necessary I could probably manage to get over there and interview you personally, on receipt of word from you to that effect. I trust you will let me know as soon as possible, for I have another position in view in the South, which I must refuse or accept shortly, and in the event I cannot get this one I wouldn't want to delay so long that I would lose that one also.\"\n\nMr. Clayberg called at the Indian Office, before the above letters arrived and I sent him to Rev.

The Department does not wish to have any of these children turned away from the school and is prepared to pay a salary for an assistant teacher during the winter months, if one is available who might, under the direction of the head teacher, give instruction to the younger pupils, as was done previously by Miss Edenshaw and Mrs. McConekey. If it is not possible to obtain the services of such a person could not Mrs. Clayberg give at least a portion of her time to the instruction of these children instead of giving it all to the field work.\n\nYour letter of the 6th instant enclosing a communication from the teacher has also been received and an advance of $100.00 on the December quarter's salary of Mrs. Clayberg is being sent. The returns should be forwarded promptly at the end of the quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas Doody, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nAsst.

Clayberg, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School, acknowledging receipt of a copy of your telegram of Nov. 16th ult. and applying for an advance of One Hundred Dollars.\n\nConsidering the circumstances and realizing conditions here, I would respectfully recommend the granting of the above sum.\n\nMr. Clayberg has been teaching under temporary appointment since 21st October and Mrs. Clayberg since 1st October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nMasstett Reserve, B.C.,\nDec. 2nd 1912\n\nHonourable Deputy Chief\nIndian Agent,\nMasstett Reserve, &c.\n\nDear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ult., containing a copy of telegram received by you from the Department stating my services and those of my wife would be accepted as teachers of the Indian School here at a salary of $850.00 per annum, provided I became naturalized, and that a letter followed.\n\nBefore positively refusing or accepting the position permanently at the salary stated in the telegram I will await the receipt of the letter mentioned therein, and will write you fully with reference thereto at such time.\n\nI have been teaching the school, under temporary appointment since October 21st and my wife since Nov. 1st. The present quarter ends with the end of this month and, of course I cannot expect to receive our salary in full until my quarterly report has been turned in, at the end of this month.\n\nThe mail on arrives here twice a month, and so, under such service, and in the regular course I could not get our full salary probably before the end of January.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 328-1, part 1)\nMy finances were very low when I came here in October, and I have been compelled to ask credit for provisions and house furnishings from the tradesmen at Massett. Naturally they would like to be able to close their accounts at the end of the year and I desire to settle my accounts with them.\n\nTherefore I am requesting an advance of one hundred ($100.00) dollars on our salary to enable me to do so. I do not like to make this request; but, under the circumstances I see no other way to make a payment of the accounts at the time stated.\n\nYou would oblige me greatly if you could arrange to get me this advance.\n\nHoping you will be able to do so, and trusting I am not asking to greet a favor.\n\nI remain,\n\n(Sd) H. L. Clayberg.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose Agent's Report on Massett Indian Day School for month of November last.\n\nIn connection therewith permit me to state: Mr. and Mrs. Olyberg are taking a great deal of interest in the scholars. The large attendance shows the parents and children are also doing their duty.\n\nThe new Single Desks are not very strong, and the meetings in the school buildings at night, if adults, is quite a tax on the strength of seats. I am having them strengthened.\n\nIn regard to the age of children attending school, the teachers complain that Indian children, of six and seven years, retard the work. They are so young that nothing can be done with them. With fifty scholars, the small children occupy time and learn nothing. In this school, should a bright child, of\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nsix or seven years attend, it would be most advisable to educate the applicant; but the Indian Council appears anxious to have young children at school and the winter time is the only opportunity we have to educate the older boys and girls. Those under eight years are not fit, physically or mentally, for the school room and the time spent on them is lost to the children capable and eager to learn. I would respectfully recommend that the compulsory attendance of children in this School be limited to those over eight years unless Teachers are of the opinion that they can educate certain pupils under that age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThomas Deasy\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 15, 1913.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 27th ultimo and in this connection I beg to inform Your Lordship that the Department has agreed to pay Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg at the Massett school at the rate they have asked, viz. - $100.00 a month when both are engaged in teaching and $75.00 when Mr. Clayberg is performing the duties himself. The Department trusts that the school will now prosper.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. F. H. DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, January 15, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo with enclosure from Mr. Clayberg, teacher of the Massett School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to pay Mr. Clayberg at the rate asked for from the first of this month, viz., $100.00 a month when both Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg are engaged in teaching and $75.00 a month when he is able to perform the duties himself without an assistant. You will be good enough to advise Mr. Clayberg accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.D. McLean\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nOn November 16th, last, the Department engaged Mr. H. L. Clayberg as teacher of the Massett School and his wife as field matron, the combined salaries to be $550.00 per annum. Upon the return of the Indians to the reserve from the fishing station the attendance of pupils at the school was so large that it was not possible for one teacher to satisfactorily do the work, there being some sixty on the roll, and on the 17th of December the Department asked that arrangements be made to have Mrs. Clayberg give at least a portion of her time to the instruction of the younger children instead of giving it all to the field matron work. Mr. Clayberg in a letter dated the 21st ultimo states that the salary fixed by the Department is not satisfactory and he asks that Mrs. Clayberg and himself, while both engaged in the teaching work, be paid at the rate of $100.00 per month and that the salary be $75.00 per month for the rest of the year. It is understood...\nstood, of course, that Mrs. Clayberg will do a certain amount of field matron work during this period.\n\nThis is an important school and it is necessary to have two teachers during the winter months, as has been the practice of the Department for sometime. Mr. Clayberg is well recommended and the Agent states that the attendance has been exceptionally good and the teacher is very energetic. I think it would be too bad to lose their services and would recommend that Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg be paid at the rate asked, as living expenses are very high at this point.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDec. 27, 1912\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th Inst. No. 122,723-1 replying to mine of June 28th. with reference to the administration of Day Schools in this Diocese.\n\nI wish to express my warm appreciation of the action of the Department in assuming the full financial responsibility in regard to the teachers of the Indian Day Schools, as indicated in the words:-\n\n\"The Department is prepared to pay to properly qualified teachers the salary paid in the various localities by the Provincial Government\".\n\nI also wish to heartily thank the Department for the permission granted in the words:-\"In cases where the Department has been able to engage the teacher and where he or she would not be competent to impart the religious instruction, opportunity will be given to allow the Missionary to impart such instruction at proper times.\"\n\nI assure the Department that our missionaries will do their utmost to co-operate with the Department and that our Church will continue to take a deep interest in the educational work amongst the Indians.\n\nIn reference to your criticism of my remark about the Department taking full control of the Indian Day Schools, and your reply \"The actual control has always remained with the Department\", my point was that \"full control\" implies \"full financial responsibility\" which the\nDepartment has now graciously acknowledged.\n\nIn connection with the gradual evolution from CHURCH schools to STATE schools which has been quietly going on the last ten years may I point out that in several cases yet such as Hazelton, Gitwangak, Gishgegas, Tahltan, CHURCH BUILDINGS are still being used by the State for the Day Schools, only in the last mentioned place is rent allowed.\n\nI have just returned from a visit to Masset. There were 61 children on the school roll, with over fifty present. The new teacher and his wife seemed to be doing good work. Our missionary Rev. Wm. Hogan, an old school teacher, gives religious instruction at certain times in the week. As this is the first school I have visited under the new plan where the Church does not assume any authority over the teacher I wish to say that I think the plan is working well though the Indian agent fears that $850 is scarcely enough to hold the man and his wife. They have, however, a comfortable house.\n\nAgain thanking the Department for taking up the matter presented by me and dealing with it so satisfactorily,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. H. Du Vernet\nBishop of Calcutta\nIndian Agent's Office,\nQueen Charlotte Agency\nMasset Reserve, B.C., 21st Dec. 1918.\n\nI have the honour to enclose a letter received today from Mr. H. L. Clayberg, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School, with reference to his position. Mr. Clayberg was anxious to understand his position on the salary question before the new year started and, for that reason I am sending his letter on return boat.\n\nYour Obed. Servant,\n\nThomas Deasy\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nNot having received any information with reference to the temporary appointment of myself and wife as school teacher and assistant at the Indian Day School at the Reserve, other than the telegram received some weeks ago, I am writing you in the endeavor to find out what has been done with reference to the salary, and whether or not my appointment has been made permanent. Enclosed here from the telegram above mentioned, that the salary would only be eight hundred fifty dollars per annum for the both of us, which I consider absolutely inadequate and insufficient. We cannot live on that amount in this country, let alone care anything about buying any of the rate of seventy dollar per month for two of us. There are over sixty children in the school, and the work is very hard for each of us. We have had to furnish the house and our food, clothing and other necessaries, and we all we could get on that salary. The quality is varied and unless we receive more salary, at least one hundred dollars per month for the two of us, while an assistant is required, for my services alone, I will have to hand you my resignation. I would like to have this matter definitely settled before starting on a new quarter, or as soon as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.M. Clayberg\nI have the honour to enclose herewith quarterly Report of Massett Indian Reserve Day School for the quarter ending 31st Dec 1912.\n\nThe reasons for forwarding now are that the mail steamer will not return here until the 10th January 1913. The school closed for the holidays on the 28th and will not resume this year.\n\nThe attendance has been exceptionally good and the teachers very energetic.\n\nI am afraid we will not be able to retain the services of Mr. and Mrs. Odayberg. They are acting until some final arrangement is made.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Duvernay has been visiting the reserve and is pleased with the school building and progress of scholars.\n\nHe met the Indians and informed them that the Church is no longer in charge of the school.\n\nMr. E. W. Baker left the school when it closed at Seada Harbour, on 21st October last. Mr. H. L. Odayberg then took charge. Mrs. Odayberg was Assistant Teacher from 1st November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames Deasy\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have the honour to inform you that the following has been received from Mr. S. A. Baker, who was, for a short time, teacher of the Massett Indian Big School, at Haden Harbour.\n\nDear Sir: Enclosed please find receipt for cheques sent by you Nov. 12, 1912. I do not see your grounds for doubting the correctness of account forwarded to you by me in my Edenhowe. Mr. Gilmore brought us over certainly as far as Massett but surely if he had not done so the government would have? The reason I wrote you from Haden Harbour stating I had to resign on the return of the Indians to Massett was, as you know, due to the Land Act & we should have come with them, had not Mrs. Baker & the children been laid up for several days in bed. I gave you notice that I had to resign from Haden. Directly I knew myself but that was to enable Mr. Clayberg to see you & try for the position. You know very well that I had to get back & my reason in giving notice was to enable the Indians to lose as little of the Term as possible. I do not think you would have liked it better.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nif I had arrived at Massett wharf at government expense and given you notice right there! My expenses from Hadden to Fox Hill were $52.25 which I can prove to your satisfaction any time; $32.25 for board during delay by storm + $20.00 for our trip here. I fail to see your object in doubting this. However, if you do not think you are justified in complaining this to the department, I will write and endeavor to do so myself, considering that you assured me that our expenses would be paid on the evening of October the twenty-fourth, I fail to see your surprise at the account.\n\nI do not think the government intend their school teachers etc. to have to spend $52.25 on a journey home from the \"job\" when their salary is under sixty dollars per month. Can you see where our personal expenses are to come from?\"\n\nWith reference to the above letter, from Mr. Baker, it was in answer to the reply forwarded him and contained in my letter to you, No. 9.11.12, of 12th Nov. last.\n\nMr. Baker is mistaken when he states \"you assured me that our expenses would be paid.\" I never gave assurances of that kind. He sent in an account for transportation from Hadden Harbour in favour of Mr. Edenhouse. I know that he arrived in Massett on a larger steamer, at no expense between Hadden...\nHarbour and Massett. I understand Mr. Edenshaw took him, with his family and effects, from Massett to New Hill.\n\nThe Department paid $16. for bringing Mr. Baker and family to Massett from New Hill.\n\nThe pre-emptor is allowed to be absent from his claim more than four months every year, Mr. Baker knew this when he applied for the position. He led us to believe that he would permanently lack. He remained the four months and resigned on short notice. His predecessors paid to bring their families and household effects here; so also did his successor. He asked for $75 per month and complained about receiving no answer to his application. Mr. A. Hagan introduced him and highly recommended him; but he did not think proper to remain and lose the land he pre-empted. All employees on Reserve are debarred from pre-empting and Mr. Baker knew the requirements of the Land Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThomas Leary\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant enclosing a copy of a letter received by you from Mr. Clayberg.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is surprised that you are evidently not aware of the day school regulations. Copies of these for each of the schools were sent you when they were issued. I am sending copies now for the guidance of yourself and the teacher. These are the regulations that will cover the Massett School.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the attendance in the summer are noted. It is not considered feasible to dispense with the teacher's services in the summer and engage another in the winter. There has been a great deal of trouble and a volume of correspondence in connection with Mr. Clayberg's appointment. The Department will expect him to go to Naden Harbour if the conditions call for it and you should use your discretion in the matter.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 29th ultimo I beg to say that Mrs. Clayberg's salary will be paid, as you were recently informed, upon the receipt of vouchers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nJ.O. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, February 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo in reference to the salary paid the teachers of the Massett Indian Day School for the December quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the first arrangement was that the combined salary would be $850.00 per annum and Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg were paid for 44 days in the December quarter or $187.00 in all. The salary was not divided. On January 1st a new arrangement whereby the salary was increased to $100.00 when both were teaching and $75.00 when Mr. Clayberg was alone went into effect. As Mrs. Clayberg is giving up the work she will be paid at the rate of $25.00 a month for January and February upon the receipt of returns forwarded through your office and Mr. Clayberg will be paid at the rate of $75.00.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th ultimo regarding the attendance of junior children the Department is of opinion that children under six years of age should not attend the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nThomas Denny, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 49/1/13\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nMassett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., Jan. 29th 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reporting to you that Mrs. Isabel C. Clayberg intends to leave Massett, at the end of February, and has tendered her resignation, I have the honour also to state that I do not think it will be necessary to have an Assistant Teacher after that date. The Indians will be leaving, for the canneries, and the attendance, at the Indian Day School is already falling off.\n\nOn account of leaving Massett, Mrs. Clayberg asks that a separate Cheque be made out, in her favour, for the two months salary, as Assistant Teacher, and separate from Mr. H. L. Clayberg's Cheque.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 26th January last, with reference to salaries of Teacher and Assistant at Massett Indian Day School. A copy of same was forwarded to Mr. H. L. Clayberg and the following is his reply:\n\n\"Dear Sir\u2014Received your letter of 27th inst., No. \"364/13, enclosing copy of a letter from the Department \"with reference to my salary and that of my wife, as \"teacher and assistant at the Indian Day School on the \"reserve. The amount mentioned in said letter, viz. $100 \"per month when both myself and wife are teaching; and \"$75 per month for myself alone, when no assistant is \"required, is satisfactory to me, provided my salary is \"paid all the year around, and that I am allowed the usual \"holidays and vacations provided for by the Department. \"In other words, if the Department retains me at an annual \"salary of $900.00, payable quarterly, I will accept the \"position permanently and remain. The Department regula- \"tions require the Indian Day Schools to be kept open at \"least 216 days in the year, and I am prepared to keep \"the school open such number of days at the salary of \"$900.00. The remaining number of days in the year are \"Saturdays and Sundays and certain holidays, as provided \"in the Department regulations, and I desire it understood \"that nothing shall be deducted from my salary on account \"of any and all such holidays. Of course, I understand \"the Assistant's salary is only to be paid during the \"months such Assistant is necessary. Kindly let me know \"definitely about this as soon as possible, and oblige, \"(Sd.) H. L. Clayberg.)\n\nRegarding the above, permit me to state: The salaries mentioned are now sufficient to have good teachers for the children of the Massett Band, with the residence provided by the Department. I can understand Mr. Chamberlain's idea of requiring the salary to run for the whole year. There will be 104 Saturdays and Sundays in this year, leaving 38 week-days, for other statutory and school holidays, provided the school is kept open for the prescribed number of days\u2014216.\n\nWith nomadic Indians, who take to their boats and go fishing, at the approach of good weather, it has been usual to close the school, on account of non-attendance. Under the old system, when Mr. Sherwood and Mr. McConkey were Teachers, the school closed down when the attendance dropped off to less than ten. Last year, we were fortunate enough to have a building placed at our disposal, at the Naden Harbour Cannery, and sent the Teacher there. Otherwise, the Massett Day School would have been closed, for months.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 328-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIndians are now being engaged to go this year, to the river canneries. We believe that there will be a number of Indians at Naden Harbour, this summer, and the school might be re-opened there. Under their agreement with the Bishop of Caledonia, Mr. Sherwood and Mr. McConkey were released when the attendance fell below ten scholars, until the Indians returned to the reserve. From April until October, the attendance has been very low, and it would not be fair to be paying a teacher for months without that official having anything to do. In my opinion, there is a way to make the Teacher take an interest in his work, and that is to allow the salary while the attendance is up to a certain limit, say ten, or fifteen scholars. I have seen schools kept open with three or four Indian children in attendance, as I found at Skidegate last year. It was not the fault of the Teacher; but it appeared to be almost useless to keep a Teacher on the pay list, with only three or four scholars.\n\nWith the holidays allowed, and only five days a week, at short hours, the salary, and free house rent, makes the position a very good one. I am not thinking of Mr. Clayberg's case, it is a question of good service and proper remuneration. With some incentive, the Teacher will work all the better, and no teacher can expect pay when the school is closed, through no fault of ours. If the Indians go to the river canneries, they will be away for months. During the Spring salmon fishing, which begins in April, they will take their families to their camps. If the Naden Harbour Cannery engages women, there will be enough of the scholars there to open the school.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that a limit be placed on the attendance, in order that the Indians and teachers should know that the Department is willing to assist, provided there is a reason for giving a salary amounting to \u00a375.00 per month and house rent free.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File S28-1, part 1)\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 17th December last with reference to my report on the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nThere appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the children. At the time of writing, Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg were teaching over fifty children, in two rooms in the schoolhouse. Mr. Clayberg had the most advanced pupils\u2014Mrs. Clayberg the junior classes. As you are aware, the children, when they first attend the school, talk only in the Haida language. On the return of all of the Massetts to the Reserve, and living in close neighborhood to the school, small children, that Mrs. Clayberg found it impossible to do anything with, were sent to School. Mrs. Clayberg informed me that it was impossible to teach them anything, and, in endeavoring to make them understand, the others, who were progressing, had to be neglected. It also appeared to me that parents were making a kindergarten of the school, sending children there who could not be advanced in any way. It is only during the winter months that we have an opportunity to have so large an attendance at the school. The progress of the children has been remarkable and the reason is that the teachers classify them. If they give time to the individual Indian children, who are too young to learn anything, it is a loss to the older boys and girls.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nI understand the Indian Act, under the Advancement Part, calls for the attendance of children between the ages of six and fifteen years. In the same schoolroom, with the little children who cannot understand what is said to them\u2014boys and girls, in the junior classes, of the ages of nine, ten, eleven and twelve years. Some of them hardly understand a word of English, and the teachers endeavor to bring them forward. I have seen little children asleep, on the seats, who are too young to be away from home and it is very difficult to judge the ages of the smaller boys and girls.\n\nThe teachers are very anxious to have a full roll, and I am sure the winter attendance here is larger than any other Indian Day School in the North. The two teachers have only a few hours each day, and five days a week, to teach the whole of them, and we would only ask to be allowed to send the little ones home that nothing can be done with.\n\nMrs. Clayberg has been teaching, ever since Mr. Clayberg took over the School. Mrs. Clayberg takes the junior classes, in a separate room, and advances them to Mr. Clayberg's room.\n\nWe have not used any person for Field Matron Work. Mrs. McConkey did not teach, at any time. Miss Edensaw is married, and away from the reserve.\n\nI do not know whether Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg will remain. It is difficult to obtain teachers, in this locality, at the salary provided. Living is high here and the Indians refuse to work for less than $2.50 and $3.00 per day. Where teachers have other positions, it augments their salaries; but there is no means of making more than the salary here.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 344/13\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMassett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., Jan. 24th 1913.\n\nI have the honour to forward the following, received from Mr. H. L. Clayberg, Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School:\n\n\"Dear Sir-The two Cheques, for $100 and $75, respectively, in payment of my salary as teacher of the Indian Day School on the Reserve, for the last quarter, duly received, for which same accept my thanks. There appears to be some mistake however, as my wife has not received her salary as Assistant Teacher for the same period. She has been my assistant, in the school, ever since I took charge of the same, and is still acting as such, and devoting her entire time to it, the same as I am doing. The amount I received as my salary is only at the rate of about $75.00 per month, which is little enough in this country, to live upon and to support a wife with any degree of comfort, let alone laying any aside for a rainy day, and I am in urgent need of Mr. Clayberg's salary also. I came here with very little money, and have had to go to the expense of buying necessary furniture for the house provided by the government, and also provide myself and wife with necessary food and clothing, during the last three months, and to do this I have been forced to obtain credit at the store at New Massett, and used both our salaries to settle any obligations there, and also for the firewood I have had to purchase from Indians. Most of the Teachers of Indian Day Schools throughout the Dominion, are either connected with some\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

But, in my case, I have to depend for my livelihood solely and entirely upon my own salary as school teacher here, and that of my wife as assistant, for I have no other income or source of revenue, and hold no other position, nor can I obtain any other position here, or means whereby I could increase the amount I receive from the government for my services as school teacher.\n\nAnother matter I desire to call your attention to in this connection is the fact that the school on this Reserve is, probably, the largest in number of pupils enrolled (the number being sixty-one) of any Indian Day School in the Dominion, with few exceptions, if any, which entails harder work and more arduous duties upon the teachers, than in the average Indian Day School.\n\nAgain, being situated upon the borders of civilization, as it were, in a new country just beginning to be settled by the Whites, and hundreds of miles from the great trade centres and markets of the world, the cost of living is very high, greatly in excess, I venture to say, of that on the reserves where other Indian Day Schools are situated, with one or two exceptions, possibly.\n\nTaking all these matters into consideration, I feel that I am not demanding an excessive salary when I ask for $75.00 per month for myself and $25.00 per month for Mrs. Clayberg, as assistant teacher. I am satisfied\nSir,\n\nto accept as my salary alone, the amount received as mentioned above, for the last Quarter, or for the time I acted as Teacher during such Quarter, being all of the same with the exception of the first three weeks, and will accept as my salary during this Quarter, and in the future, a salary at the same rate, provided Mrs. Clayberg is paid $25.00 per month during the time it is necessary for her to act as my assistant. If I can be assured of this, I will certainly remain here and continue to do my work, to the best of my ability, otherwise I will be compelled to hand you my resignation\u2014for I cannot live and support my wife on a lesser amount. Trusting that you will take this matter up as soon as possible, and, with reference to the omission or failure to send Mrs. Clayberg's salary for last quarter, you will kindly have the mistake rectified, I beg &c., (Sd.) H. L. Clayberg.\"\n\nWith reference to Mr. Clayberg's long letter, permit me to state: Mr. McConkey was engaged at the rate of $1,000 per year, for the time he was teaching, and Miss' Jadenshaw received $25.00 per month, as assistant.\n\nWhen Mr. Clayberg's letter was written, I do not think he was aware that Mrs. Clayberg intended to resign, and leave for the South. I have notice, from Mrs. Clayberg, of her intention to resign, at the end of the next month.\n\nIt is a most difficult situation, to secure any good teachers, on this island. The only way to obtain, and hold them, is by giving them good salaries. With Mrs. Clayberg leaving, about the time the Indians go to the\nSir,\n\ncanaries, we will be able to get along with a good, male, teacher, to follow them to Naden Harbour, should enough of them go there. An Assistant Teacher is only required during the Winter months, when all of the Indians are at home. It is the same in Skidegate. Mr. Connery informed me that he would not remain.\n\nIf we had men who would be satisfied, it would be better for the Indians, and I feel sure that Mr. Clayberg will not remain after this Quarter.\n\nIf some arrangement could be made, whereby the salary would be fixed, and we could get a married man here, and in Skidegate, it would have a good effect and put a stop to the changing of teachers, like we have had in the past.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo. 35/1/13\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nMassett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., Jan. 24, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you of the receipt of the following, from Mr. Isabel C. Clayberg, Assistant Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School:\n\n\"Sir:- I am leaving Massett, early in March, and hereby give notice of my intention to resign the position of Assistant Teacher, at the end of February next. Would you kindly have my Cheque for the two months of the March Quarter made out in my favour, and separate from that of the Teacher, Mr. H. L. Clayberg.\" Your &c., (Sd.) Isabel C. Clayberg.\"\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File S28-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., with reference to Mr. H. L. Clayberg, Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, and the \"Regulations governing same.\"\n\nIn reply permit me to state that suggestions made by an Indian Agent should not be ascribed to his knowledge, or lack of same.\n\nI have been given to understand, by His Lordship, Bishop DuVernet, that he no longer desired to have any connection with the conduct of the Massett Indian Day School, further than to give spiritual advice to the pupils. Further than that, I have had no instructions regarding the new conditions caused by the change. Mr. Clayberg was engaged as Teacher, and, in order to avoid any friction, I asked him to interview the Missionary here, before his temporary appointment. His Lordship formerly arranged with the Teacher regarding the time the school should be closed, through non-attendance of pupils. The cheques, for Teacher's salary were sent to the Church authorities, by the Teachers, and no vouchers went from this office. It was, and is now, the same, at Skidegate Indian Day School, which is under the Methodist Church.\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop DuVernet, informed me that there was no trouble with our school; but something occurred, at Metlakatla, which caused His Lordship to ask that all schools, where the Agent's reside, should be taken over by the Government. Since that time, Mr. Clayberg was appointed and his salary raised. Under the regulations there are certain pre-\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 328-1, part 1)\nscribed days when the School shall be opened and closed. Considering that our Indians are nomadic, I desired to know if Mr. Clayberg closed the school, through non-attendance, would his salary continue? At times, in the past, the attendance fell off to two, or three, both at Massett and Skidegate. Mr. Clayberg desired to know where he stood in this respect. The trouble and correspondence referred to was caused by Mr. Clayberg's inquiries, which were, certainly, voluminous; but the changed order of things, caused by His Lordship's action, brought, with the lack of teachers, in this isolated country, the question of my connection with the teacher and the responsibility resting on both of us. It is one thing for His Lordship to inform me that he no longer has charge of the school, and another to know whether that change is acceptable and the responsibilities that the Church assumed, in the past, should divert to the Agent. I have always been careful not to interfere with Church work, in any way, and write for instructions, and carry them out.\n\nWith Mr. Clayberg it was a question of salary. He desired to know whether he received pay during the summer holidays and when willing to teach and the attendance might be nil. The Regulations state: \"In computing salaries for broken periods, teachers will be paid in proportion that the number of days they taught bears to the total number of teaching days in the year.\" I desired to have the teacher take interest by doing all he could to have at least ten pupils in attendance, when the Indians leave for fishing grounds, or canneries. Where I misconstrued the regulations I would like to understand.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File R28-1, part 1)\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 5, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo with further reference to Bennett Day School. In reply I beg to say that the Department understood that Mr. Clayberg would go to Naden Harbour, when the Indians go to fish, and conduct the school at that point. The question of closing the school for inattention would therefore not arise, as it is presumed the children will attend when in the village. The dates for opening and closing of schools are set by the regulations, but it might be well to take the two months vacation at some other time than July and August. This is a matter to be left to your discretion but if any change is desired authority should be obtained.\n\nIf there are any children at all to attend, the school should be kept open. Even if closed for a short period through lack of pupils, Mr. Clayberg is entitled to his salary.\n\nThe paragraph in the regulation covering payment of salary for broken periods, does not refer to teachers employed for a year, but is intended to define the method computation of salary for periods less than a year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deny, Sec.\nIndian Agent,\nBennett, N.C.\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., April 5th 1913.\n\nNo. 14/3/13.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith quarterly Report on the Massett Indian Day School, submitted by the Teacher, Mr. H.

Clayberg.\n\nIn connection therewith permit me to state that the attendance was small, after the 26th February, and Mrs. Clayberg resigned.\n\nMr. Clayberg was very attentive and the School attendance has been better than usual recently. I expect the Indians will leave, for their fishing grounds, in a short time, when the attendance will fall off very materially.\n\nIncluded please find Vouchers for Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg's salary.

L. Clayberg, Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School:\n\n\"I note by the Department regulations that the two months' summer vacation, allowed teachers of Indian Day schools may be taken at another time during the year, with the consent of the Department, upon the recommendation of the local Agent. I wish therefore to respectfully request you to recommend to the Department that I be given permission to take my two month's Summer holidays during the months of May and June. It is almost certain that there will be only three or four children of school age in the vicinity by the end of the month. There are less than twenty attending school now, and practically all of these are going to leave with their parents for the fishing grounds within the next two weeks, for the spring salmon fishing, which will last at least two months. I believe it will be for the best interests of the school if I take my vacation at the end of April, for there will be no children here anyway, and after the spring salmon run is over, the first of July, there will undoubtedly be enough either at home or at Naden Harbour to start the school again. I have not as yet been definitely informed as to whether or not my salary will be paid during the holidays allowed by the Department regulations. In addition to this I desire to know whether or not it will be paid in the event there are other times during the year, when I am here ready to teach, but there are no children of school age in the vicinity? It is almost impossible to obtain work around here, and I cannot afford to jeopardize at such times. If there should happen to be times when there are no children here, I could not leave to get work elsewhere, for I would have to hold myself in readiness to open the school when some children returned. I am willing to hold myself in readiness to conduct the school two hundred days in the year, as the regulations provide, at an annual salary of $900, but should it become impossible to hold school the two hundred days in a year, on account of the absence of the children at some time or other, and through no fault of mine, I want to know definitely whether or not my salary will be withheld for such time. I cannot find anything definite in regard to this matter in the regulations, and so I must trouble you for the information. I feel satisfied that there will be sufficient children ready to manage and keep the school open for the two hundred days required; but I want a clear understanding of the matter in the beginning, in case it should occur so there will be no question about it at such time. Trusting you will let me know definitely with reference to these matters as soon as possible and will recommend my vacation as requested above.\n\nI Remain &c., (Sd.) H. L. Clayberg.\"\n\nWith regard to the above, I could give Mr. Clayberg no positive information. In the first place, the Indians have not decided where they will go, this year. We have no information regarding the opening of the Cannery at Naden Harbour, where the Indians went last year. Mr. Clayberg is looking for\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nsome other occupation during May and June, and he, therefore, wants holidays during those months. The Indians are nomadic, and are fishermen. We have always had difficulty with them, during the Summer, in keeping open the schools. For that reason we opened a school, at Naden Harbour, last year, following them there. During the Summer, they go and come and no person can tell, during five months of the year, how many will be where we have schoolhouses. A number of families have been engaged to go to the Mainland, at the end of June, to work in the river canneries; they will be away during July and August.\n\nI must be plain in these matters, in duty to the Department and the Indians. Mr. Clayberg and his wife took the positions of school teachers. Mrs. Clayberg resigned, and left here\u2014not intending to return. Mr. Clayberg agreed to take out his naturalization papers\u2014he has not done so yet. Mr. Clayberg requires $900 per year, with two months leave, commencing on May 1st, to take up some other occupation, for the two months. The school was opened, at Naden Harbour, to teach the Indian children, while the fishermen were out at Kangara Island, in that vicinity. Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg took the school, when Mr. Baker found that he must return to his preemption, to comply with the Land Laws. I have no fault to find with their teaching; but we should have a married man here, whose wife and family will remain permanently. There is no guarantee that Mr. Clayberg will not remain, after the holidays. From all I can understand, he does not intend to remain, permanently. I desire to be fair to him, but do not consider, under the circumstances, that it is my duty to recommend the granting of the leave, not knowing whether the Indians will live at Naden Harbour and before I understand conditions. Mr. Clayberg puts up these questions, to me, and, although I know the correspondence, regarding him and his occupation, is voluminous, it must be understood that he\nholds a lawyer's certificate, and is very technical, to say the least.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining teachers, and other officials, on these islands, and holding them, can only be realized when the conditions are known. The isolation, and other drawbacks, with the conduct of Indian schools, under adverse circumstances, are reasons for having a man with a family, who is willing to sacrifice a great deal, as we are all compelled to do, and not to take up positions for a short time, to hold the same while looking for something else.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that Mr. H. L. Clayberg, Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, forwarded me the following, on the 28th inst:\n\n\"Sir,-I beg to inform you that I called the School to-day; but that no children appeared to attend in response to the bell. During the whole of last week there were never more than six in attendance, and on Friday only two. Awaiting your instructions, as to whether or not I shall go to Naden Harbour and open school at once, I &c., (Sd.) H. L. Clayberg.\"\n\nIn answer to the above I replied as follows:-\"Sir:-I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 28th inst., with reference to the attendance at the Massett Indian Day School, and, in reply, would request you to open the Day School, at Naden Harbour, at your earliest convenience. A large number of the Indians have left Massett Reserve and it is possible that there will be enough children, at Naden Harbour, to open the School there. On the return of Mr. Edenshaw, from the West Coast, I will endeavour to make arrangements with him to convey you, with your furniture and school supplies to the Wallace Canneries, where arrangements have been made for a building for school purposes. Your &c., (Sd.) Thomas Desay, Indian Agent.\"\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Clayberg will move to Naden Harbour, about the 1st May. I was at Naden Harbour Cannery, a few days ago, and made arrangements with Mr. Gilmour, Manager of the Wallace Canneries there, for the use of the building and a place for the Teacher's residence. We hope that a number of families will be employed, and live, in the houses of the Cannery Company, and I will visit there and endeavour to have as many children attend as possible.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 10, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 25th and 30th ultimo, in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your action in moving Mr. Clayberg onto the school at Hudson Harbour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Denby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBennett, B.C.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 54-200.\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nMasset Reserve, Graham Island, B.C., July 28th 1913\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following extracts from a letter received from the Teacher of the Massett Indian Bay School, in which he states that it is his intention to resign:\n\n\"I fear I'll have to quit the school when my year is up. If I could get appointed Dominion Constable I would remain here. I will not quit the school until I have put in a year, because it would not be fair to you or the Dept. after having had my two months vacation; but at the end of that time I feel that I have given value received for my salary. I will open the school on the 23rd; but I fear there will be few children in attendance. There are a half-a-dozen or so here now; but they are coming and going all the time, and I don't know of any way to make them attend, unless their parents will force them to do so. They don't seem to care one way or the other. I will do my best, however.\" (Signed) H. L. Clayberg.\n\nMrs. Clayberg left Massett some time ago, and is now in New York. It is not her intention to return. Mr. Clayberg did not take out his naturalization papers, and, apparently, intends to resign, at the end of the present Quarter, giving time to obtain another teacher.\n\nIt would be of great benefit to the Indians if we could get a teacher, and wife, the latter to attend the sick Indians, when not teaching. Considering the salary attached to the position, there should be little difficulty in obtaining a married man, provided the $300 per year is allowed the lady, and for her to take up the matron work among the Indians. The Missionary here is always directing my attention to the necessity for a nurse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Clayberg's wife, who was to assist him in the work and act as matron, has left the reserve and it is most likely that Mr. Clayberg will follow. Should he leave I think it would be well to secure the services of Mr. Trainor, as it is a difficult matter to secure a teacher for this locality.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that I visited Naden Harbour and Massett on the 5th of June. I had been informed that school would be conducted at Naden Harbour during the summer months. But on visiting the place I found the school closed, the teacher not being able to get the children to attend. The Indians were divided, a number having gone with their families to \"North Island\", twenty miles from Massett. The others with thirty children were at Naden Harbour. After failing to get the children to school, the teacher decided to take the summer holidays early, hoping to secure an attendance later.\n\nThe Indians were making big wages catching Spring salmon; they do not use nets but troll for them. One Indian and his boy, in a small gasoline boat having four or five nets out, has made a \"catch\" which has given him an average of $57.00 per day. They get four cents a pound for the fish just as they are caught.\n\nThe Indians waited on me expressing their wish for a Boarding School for their children on Graham Island. They stated that formerly they were only away from their villages from two to three months in the summer, living home most of the rest of the year. But now with a whaling station, a cannery and a white settlement they were away so much that the children had a poor chance to learn. They also spoke of their desire to have the children taught to cultivate the soil.\n\nI told them I could make no promises, but would report their wish to you, the Department.\n\nIf a Boarding School were established where both the Massett\nand delegate children could attend, it would accomplish a great deal more good than the two day schools do at present.\n\nFrom Naden Harbour I visited Massett and saw Mr. Indian Agent Deasy there. There was only one Indian in the village.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Hogan, the missionary, also spoke strongly in favor of a Boarding School for the two Hydah villages. He stated that in his opinion it was the only way that these children could be educated under the present conditions, which take the people so much from home.\n\nI have the honor to remain\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 13, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing an extract from a letter received by you from Mr. Clayberg, teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action of Mr. Clayberg in closing the school for the summer holidays when he did and the question of improving the attendance after the school re-opens will receive consideration. In the meantime the Department will retain Mr. Clayberg's services and you should send in the usual requisition for the quarters salary after the 30th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Permit me to state that the demise of the late Rev. W. Hogan will be a great loss to the Indians and the Department.\n\nAt all times, the deceased was ready to assist in the work at this Agency, and the Indians are mourning far more than they would over the loss of the highest man in their Tribe.\n\nDuring the four years that I have been associated with the late Mr. Hogan, he proved a power for good. We can only trust that one as capable will take his place among us.\n\nI have also to report that the Rev. Thomas Crosby, Methodist Missionary, among the Indians of the province, died recently.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMarsett, Graham Island,\nB.C.\nFather Hogan Gone to His Reward\n\nA Great and Good Man Has Passed Away\n\nThe massive frame, the aged lin June 15, 1893 and buried in Ross Bay cemetery, the headstone Christian Victoria July 2 of the same year. The impressive services of the spirit that animated the Rev. W. H. Wilson and reached Michilimackay July 9, Anglican church for the dead were held in Ross Bay cemetery. After five years spent there he read and sang, the bishop delivered the eulogy. The coffin was closed by Bishop Wilson and Father Hogan placed in the grave. In his last moments Father Hogan spoke about the Lord's Supper. Then came the final words, \"Rest in peace, Lord.\" The next morning brought tears to the eyes of Old Masset, including eight services of the last rites.\n\nHe was moved to worship. The month at the time, Father Hogan was Arthur's beloved pastor of the Anglican church. He went to Port Simpson where Robinson, James Crothers, O. W. Smith, and others had gathered. He remained eleven years. Dec. 17, Mr. Hughes, A. E. Kennedy, joined himself to the people of the parish. 1909 he returned to Old Masset. Bishop N. S. Sherrard, James Macdonald, Graham Island, three, and had been stationed there since then. A. L. Kennedy, chaplain of the diocese of British Columbia, was till then in charge of the mission. Presided by Bishop Masset, Indians from all parts of the island attended. Father Hogan, who was often heard to say that the body was not important and that the soul was, was immediately known throughout the islands in the missionary following. His care and zeal during his long service was a large man with a big heart, almost the entire population of Old Masset ministry in the north had come to love him. His commanding stature and New Masset and a very large number of friends, which lasted until his death, dissolved by death.\n\nMr. Hogan was taken ill about the first of May, suffering with a cold which had developed into pneumonia. Dr. Kerwin of Prince Rupert was summoned and he arrived on the John a week ago, accompanied by a trained nurse. May, the daughter, was also suffering from the same illness. She had been in bed with the steamer and did not reach here until today. Mr. Hogan's condition was pronounced very grave by the physician, both lungs being affected and the heart action very weak. In addition symptoms of Bright's disease were evident. Mr. Hogan had chills spells, but had rallied on Saturday night and Sunday morning he began to feel rapidly and the end came shortly before eleven o'clock.\n\nA few hours before the final summons the dying pastor repeated the full services of the last rites. At 12 o'clock he hesitated and muttered, \"Can't some of you help me out with this?\" Then he lapsed into unconsciousness. Father Hogan seemed to have had a premonition that his days on earth were drawing to a close. Several weeks ago, while at the cemetery, he had said to Mrs. Long, \"I am going west corner and remarked that he wished to be buried there. When the illness came he lost all heart and expressed the belief that his recovery was hopeless.\n\nMr. Hogan was born at Enniskerry, County Galway, Ireland 62 years ago and was married in 1884. He left Dublin flowers, the tribute of loving memory, Jesus is born in a world where one has worked with such a man for years, he can understand the loss of 'Father Hogan' and believe that those whom he loved will miss him. Father Hogan was a man of great integrity and a friend to all. He was a man of the highest honour, and at the request of his beloved mother, took his place in the ministry. In youth filled with anticipation and hope, anxious and daring with dreams sufficient for a lifetime, he threw away all worldly cares and worries, and worldly honors, to labor for the saving of souls that were blinded by ignorance and superstition. Far away from home and friends he traveled to the shores of the new continent, like the missionary old, laid down his life for the faith that he had in the Supreme Ruler of the Universe. Among the natives of Port Simpson, and with the Haidas of Masset, he baptized, married, and buried the old and young. Leading them along from darkness into light, he showed them the better road of Christian piety and virtue, the respected 'Father Hogan' was always looked upon as their Chief Councillor and advisor. Twenty years among the Indians of the north, he sought no higher honors than to remain with his charges and well he carried out his mission. With his open, impulsive nature ingrained from birth, he led the Indian members of the Anglican church in such a way that they always respected his sound advice. He had a remarkable memory, and was sought both on the platform and in private, to recite the \"deeds of our ancestors,\" Odin dwells in the fisher's hut and catches a bear. In the Hindu legends, Hari dwells with the peasant among peasants. In the Greek legends Apollo lodges with the shepherds and Jove rusticated among the poor Ethiopians. So, in Anglican church services will be held as usual here each Sunday.\n\nRev. Mr. Long and child, accompanied by Mr. Long's mother, were visiting here and in Old Masset during the week.\n\nRev. H.

E. TRAINEOR, Manager\n\nThursday, February 5, 1914\n\nThe greatest forest revenue ever paid into any provincial treasury in the history of the Dominion during a single year has been received by British Columbia during the year which has just closed. The revenue from forest sources this year amounts to nearly $3,000,000 or approximately $25 for every inhabitant.\n\n\"British Columbia is the only province in Canada which is not overcutting her forests,\" said H. R. Macmillan, provincial chief forester, in discussing the work of his branch during the past year. \"I believe that the forest revenue will largely increase from year to year as the markets for our timber develop and the logging operations which are now merely on the fringe of the forests are expanded until our annual cut keeps pace with the normal forest growth.\n\n\"The estimates of an even greater revenue in the future are based upon surveys of the timber wealth of the province, which have been continued during the past year by the forest branch. These surveys have shown that our timber wealth is by no means confined to the coast district and the southern interior, which is now being opened up by new railways; there are large areas of timber of a better average quality than is to be found in the stands that constitute the chief forest resources of Ontario and Quebec.\n\n\"The forests of this province, if protected from fire, will, I am confident, form the basis of a future industry of such magnitude that the most optimistic cannot grasp its possibilities today, which will assuredly develop under the creation of new markets on the northern prairies and in northern British Columbia.\n\n\"Negotiations are now under way which will lead to an increase in revenue from timber royalties and which will preserve to the people of this province that share of the increment in the potential forest wealth which was provided for under the license system of disposing of timber.\"\n\nW.

Mrs. F. Trainor commenced her duties as Assistant Teacher on the 15th January last, but neither the teacher or Mrs. Trainor are living in the house provided for them on the Reserve.

The duties connected with the teaching of Indian children should be sufficient to occupy the attention of those engaged, and the salary is sufficient at present, to give the Teachers a fair remuneration for giving their whole time to the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(sig) Thomas Deasy\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\nOttawa, March 3, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to that portion of your report for the month of January in reference to the Massett Day School I beg to say that the Department would like you to inform Mr. and Mrs. Trainor that it will expect them to take up their residence in the house provided for them on the reserve, so that their whole time may be devoted to the object for which they were engaged, viz.-the teaching of the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the receipt of the following, from F. L. Clayberg, former Teacher of the Nusset Indian Day School:\n\n\"Yours of 14th ultimo just received with reference to the balance due me on my salary. I note the explanation of the Department makes reference as to why there is only $25.00 balance due me. I am perfectly willing to have such balance computed on the basis they mention, viz., since I am receiving the sum of $900.00 in all for my salary for the entire year I retained the position. The Department claims that with the $25.00 they sent me, I have received the said sum of $900.00 between the 20th October 1912 and 20th October 1913.\n\n\"There is where I will have to disagree with them, and they can determine wherein they are wrong if they will look back over their records and the checks they have sent me. You remember they paid me only the sum of $187.50 from Oct. 20th 1912 to Dec. 31st 1912, and that was to be for my services and those of my assistant, who taught for the two months of November and December, and was entitled to the sum of $25.00 per month therefore, or $50.00, leaving only the sum of $137.50 paid me as my share for those two months. Then I have received three payments of $225.00 each totalling $675.00. The total I have received during my year there is $137.50, $675.00 and $25.00 making $837.50, leaving a balance still due me of $49.50 according to the figures of the Department itself. You will doubtless recall that when I received the check for $137.50 we had voluminous correspondence which finally resulted in the statement from the Department that that amount was for my services and also for the services of my assistant for the two months of November and December. I have that letter yet in which they make that statement. Now it appears to me very smell on the part of the Department of Indian Affairs to attempt to go back on their agreement and contract with me, to pay me $900.00 per year and my assistant the sum of $25.00 per month during the months she taught.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\n\"The amount doesn't mean so much to me as the principle involved, and I feel that if the gentlemen in charge of the Department of Indian Affairs are men of their words, and intend to live up to their agreements they should pay me what is due me according to their own figures. It doesn't look well for the department of the Government of Canada to refuse to fulfill their contracts with employees of such Government. I presume that because I am an American citizen has a great deal to do with it, and they feel it perfectly legitimate to take advantage of an American... I intend to stand up for my rights, however, even although the amount involved is small, and either get what is coming to me, or publish the facts of their treatment of me and the methods resorted to by that Department in keeping agreements between themselves and their employees. If I can get no satisfaction any other way, I am going to take the matter up with the Indian Agent General here, and through our State Department at Washington, where my father has influential friends. The American government would not resort to such quibbles and attempt to go back on their agreements, even with a foreigner. Now, I am not blaming you in any way, for you are powerless, but you will have to admit the facts as I state them herein are correct as to the amounts I received. Trusting you will forward this communication to the Department, and that they will at least let me know what they are going to do about it, I beg to remain, etc., H. L. Clayberg.\"\n\nIn reply I have sent Mr. H. L. Clayberg the following: \"Dear Sir: Your letter of 6th instant received. In reply, permit me to state that I had a great deal to do with your engagement, as Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, and will endeavour to answer your reference to my 'admission,' as you allude to your alleged grievances. I am very willing my opinion of the treatment you received. In the first place, you supplied for the position of Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, as stated in a letter dated Oct. 15th 1912 to take the position of Teacher at the salary then paid Mr. W. W. Baker until I heard from the Government regarding an increase. You also stated that you would become naturalized, and, although the Government understood that you would become a British subject, you did not take out naturalization papers, and remained one year in the position. Further: You received the sum of $187, and receipted for same, on 16th January 1913, being the amount due forenoon to Dec. 31st 1912. The Department letter referring thereto states: 'I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, (January) in reference to the salary paid the teachers of the Massett Indian Day School for the December quarter. In reply I beg to say that the first arrangement was that the combined salary would be $850.00 per annum end...\"\nSir,\n\nMr. and Mrs. Clayberg were paid for 44 days in the December quarter or $167.00 in all. The salary was not divided. On January 1st a new arrangement whereby the salary was increased to $100.00 when both were teaching and $75.00 when Mr. Clayberg was alone went into effect. As Mrs. Clayberg is giving up the work she will be paid at the rate of $25.00 a month for January and February, upon the receipt of returns forwarded through your office and Mr. Clayberg will be paid at the rate of $75.00. I handed you a copy of this letter when Mr. Clayberg asked to be paid the $25.00 monthly, independently of you, and received same. At that time you raised no objections to continuing at $75.00 per month. You received three quarterly payments of $225.00 each for the March, June and September quarters making in all, $675.00, and $38.00 for your time in October. During the year you were teaching you did not state, at any time, that you did not receive the proper amount agreed upon, and you received a copy of every letter from the Department, with regard to salary. You had two months vacation during that year, and closed the school several times, when the attendance did not come up to your requirements. It is passing strange that you direct attention to the fact of your nationality being a reason for not complying with what you require. When you, an American citizen, was permitted to teach for a year, left on your own initiative, and your letters are loud in the praise of the treatment you received here. (Signed) Thomas Darcy, Indian Agent.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nMassett, B.C., April 3rd 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Quarterly Report of Teacher of Massett Indian Day School for the term ending 31st March 1914.\n\nEnclosed also please find Voucher in favour of Mr. F. Trainer, Teacher, for the sum of $225.00, and Mrs. F. Trainer, for the sum of $60.00.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nThey do not take kindly to the Day School, and are always complaining about not having a boarding, or industrial, school.\n\nAt the present time, the Indians are out camping, at Naden Harbour and along the shores, on outside reserves, and there are few left in the Village of Massett.\n\nThe Council for 1914 was only elected on the 23rd of this month, and the printed By-laws only arrived on the 26th.\n\nThe Indian Act gives the Council power to compel attendance at School, under By-law, and the Constable informed me that he could find no other way to make the children attend, heretofore, but by taking them to the school, when he found them on the streets, and, in doing this, he met with rebuffs.\n\nI will circulate the By-laws, at once, and instruct the Council of 1914 to take action.\n\nThe past Chief Councillor, and the present occupant of the office have done their best to make parents send their children to school. When the \"child rules the home,\" as Indian Children do, and the parents will never chastise them, and will take them away from the reserve, on any pretext, you will understand the difficulty in the way of the Constable, Teachers and Agent. We are preaching and teaching, and even opened a night school, and I attended, as Teacher, for both men and children, so you may be sure we are doing our level best to have the people educated. It appears that the older Indians do not take the interest they should, with their old customs and ideas still uppermost. It is the middle-aged, and young that we are endeavouring to bring into the school; but the Day School does not appeal to the Indian. The restraint and compulsion exercised when Teachers\nSir,\n\nhave full control, is lacking, and the freedom of the Indian, to go and come, when and where he likes, with the nomadic life, in this Western country, is a deterrent and all the children receive is a smattering of education during a few months of the Winter, which many of them forget during the remainder of the year. They are not like White children\u2014talking English at all times\u2014and they hear little but the Native language.\n\nThe Constable is doing all he can to force the children to school; but the roll shows that they are now scattered over the reserves and will not return, permanently, until late in the year.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 17th ultimo, instructing me to reply to yours of 10th February ultimo, with regard to \"compulsory attendance at school of Indian children.\"\n\nIn reply, permit me to state: The Constable was instructed to take up the duties of Truant Officer, last year. When on the Reserve, he has been attending to the work. I have been driving the children to School, ever since I took office; but we could not find any law whereby we could impose penalties on parents or children, for non-attendance. On the day of the receipt of information of the passage of the By-laws of the Massett Council, I instructed the Constable and Chief Councillor to get, from the Teacher, the names of every child of school age, to visit the houses, and to see that all children of school age went to school, unless excused by the Teacher. This was done.\n\nThe Indians have a way of evading the law, by taking their children out for wood, going out and camping, and taking them outside the confines of the reserve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo quoting a letter handed to Mr. O. M. W. Hughes, constable for your agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it is noted that you furnished him with a copy of the By-laws of the Massett Indian Council. The Department would like to know whether you gave him the copy of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children, which was sent you in official letter of the 1st instant, as in these Regulations the duties of truant officers are defined.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nOttawa, April 21, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo embodying a communication from Mr. H. L. Clayberg, late teacher of the Massett Day School, in further reference to the amount of salary received by him for his services as teacher and his wife as assistant during the time they were employed at that school. From Mr. Clayberg's letter it would appear that he is under the impression that there is a balance of salary due him for the December quarter, 1912.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of February 20th, 1913, the salary for the December quarter for Mr. and Mrs. Clayberg was a combined salary and was not divided, being at the rate of $50.00 per year. They received $167.00 for their combined services for that quarter and consequently he is in error in stating that the sum of $25.00 per month is due for the services of his assistant for the months of November and December, 1912. The arrangement whereby the salary was increased to $100.00 per month when both were teaching and $75.00 when Mr. Clayberg was alone went into effect from January 1st, 1913. Mrs. Clayberg taught under this arrangement during January and February and was paid $25.00 a month for these two months. It is considered that Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Deasy, Esq., Indian Agent, Massett Reserve, Graham Island, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nClayberg were paid full salary for their services while at this school and received fair treatment in all respects. The Department cannot, therefore, consider any further requests from Mr. Clayberg in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Monthly Report on Massett Indian Day School for Month of March 1914.\n\nThe attendance is falling off, on account of the Indians going to outside Reserves, their gardens and fishing Camps.\n\nThe fishing season will commence, on the 1st May, and it is questionable whether there will be a number of children, at Naden Harbour, this year.\n\nI would recommend that the Assistant Teacher discontinue, on the 1st May, and that the Teacher be allowed his Summer Vacation, commencing on the 1st June next.\n\nAt the present time the two Teachers have small classes; but the Assistant Teacher has a number of very small children and having the two Teachers gives better satisfaction, allowing Mr. Trainer to devote more time to the older pupils. On the 1st May Mr. Trainer should be able to attend to the duties alone.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 27, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant enclosing your report on the Massett Indian Day School for the month of March.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation that the assistant teacher should discontinue on the 1st of May and that the teacher should commence his summer vacation on the 1st of June, next.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of March 3rd, last, in which you were instructed to inform Mr. and Mrs. Trainor that the Department will expect them to take up their residence in the house provided for them on the reserve, so that their whole time may be devoted to the object for which they were engaged, viz.\u2014the teaching of the school and you were asked to report whether they complied with these instructions or not. The Department would like to have this report at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

Hughes, Constable, a copy of the Regulations relating to the education of Indian Children, and, in reply would state:\n\nOn the day of the receipt of the said Regulations I handed Mr. Hughes the copy received. It was the first time that either of us read the Regulations and Mr. Hughes immediately went to work and I directed the attention of the Chief Councillor, Councilmen, and Indians to the matter. In Mr. Hughes' Monthly Report, and Diary, he directs attention to the manner in which he is carrying out the duties.\n\nI might also state that Teacher, Mr. F. Trainor, left, on the 5th instant, for Wallace Fisheries, at Naden Harbour, to endeavour to open school there, and I requested Mr. Hughes to accompany him and compel any children, living in the neighbourhood of the school, to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 27th April ultimo with regard to the Teachers of Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that Mrs. Trainor discontinued teaching on 24th April last, and the school was closed. I went to Wallace Fisheries, at Naden Harbour and consulted with the Manager, who kindly turned over the building, used last year, for school purposes, and, on my return, Mr. Trainor left for Naden Harbour, to endeavour to open there. All but three families left Massett reserve and the Indians of Massett and Skidegate are encamped at various places along the islands, at the fishing grounds. The Wallace Fisheries, and the B.C. Fisheries, will not \"can\" fish, this year. The Wallace Fisheries will salt and barrel Spring Salmon and it is likely that a number of Indian women will be employed at the plant, at Naden Harbour. Mr. Trainor is not meeting with success, at present; but remains at Naden Harbour, to ascertain whether it will be possible to open the school.\n\nIn looking over my file I find that the following was addressed to you, on the 28th March last:-\"I have the honour to inform you that Mr. and Mrs. Trainor, teachers of the Massett Indian Day School are now residing in the Teacher's residence, on the Massett Reserve.\" This letter must have miscarried. Mrs. Trainor is now living there, and Mr. Trainor took up residence there on the date mentioned.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Report on Massett Indian Day School for the Month of April 1914.\n\nThe Indians left for their camps and for the Wallace Fisheries during the month, and, finding only five pupils attending, I requested Mr. Trainer to close the school and I went over to Naden Harbour and made arrangements for a building at the Wallace Fisheries, in which we will endeavour to hold school during the fishing season.\n\nUnfortunately, the Wallace Fisheries will not use the canning department this year, and will only salt and mild-cure the salmon. The Indian women will not be employed, in any large number, and they will go, with the fishermen, to the camps along the sea-coast, and will take their children with them.\n\nThe Skidegate Band, also, will be employed by the Wallace Fisheries, and the whole Band migrated to the North end of Graham Island, and will camp along the shores, following the fish.\n\nLater in the year, during July, it is the intention of the Massette and Skidegates to go to the Skeena River Canneries, and they will not return until September, when they will leave for the rivers on the island to obtain their Winter supply of fish.\n\nWe cannot look forward to good attendance at the schools in this Agency until next November.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 4, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have acknowledged the receipt of your two letters of the 7th and 14th ultimo in reference to the teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department trusts that Mr. Trainor will be successful in conducting a school at Naden Harbour or wherever the Indians may be located for the summer months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sept. 1st, 1914.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the Queen Charlotte Agency for the month of August, 1914:\n\nThe Medical Officer of the Massett Band, and Constable Hughes, visited the reserve frequently during the month, and the teacher of the School opened that institution on the 3rd August. The attendance at the school was small, but is improving. It is not expected that many children will be in attendance until the Indians have visited the rivers and obtained their winter fish. The children are taken to the canneries, and afterwards to the rivers, for the reason that there is no boarding school on the island, where the children might remain.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThomas Deasy\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 4-200\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith \"Agent's Reports on Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools\" in this Agency for months of September and October, 1914.\n\nIn connection therewith permit me to state that the schools were closed, during the Summer\u2014the Massett School re-opening on August 3rd and the Skidegate School re-opened on September 8th.\n\nThe attendance at both schools was confined to a few children, until recently, when the Indians returned from their fishing camps, where they went, after coming home from the canneries. Ever since I have been in this Agency it was noticeable that the school attendance fell off about the first of May and it was, usually, in October, that the children returned, losing five or six months of the year.\n\nI took six children, on the way to the Boarding Schools, during my recent visit to Prince Rupert. Others are going to Port Simpson or Coqualeetza. There does not appear to be any effort made to take the children in the Anglican schools, excepting that the Principal of the Lytton school states that there is room for some. At no time did any of the Massette go to Alert Bay school.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It must put you to extra trouble and inconvenience sometimes looking after them, looking them up, writing letters and listening to the complaints. I have received instructions from the Department to build a new dormitory with accommodation for twenty more children. This dormitory is on the most modern and approved plan, light and airy and warm, with accommodation for two teachers in charge. It will be completed by Wednesday of next week. I can take ten more pupils from your Agency in this proportion, seven boys and three girls. If larger number of pupils than that, I will endeavour to make provision as soon as possible. With reference to the matter of fares, that has always been a source of difficulty, and I will leave the matter to your discretion. If the people are able to pay, they should pay the fare. If there are promising, healthy, children you think should be in an industrial school, I would advance it with the understanding the parents paid when the child completed the course at school. Or sometimes it has been managed in this way: On Saturdays the children get many a chance to earn a little money and some, I believe, have repaid the fare advanced. The fare should not stand in the way of a child's advancement and I would rather help than deprive the child of any advantage.\"\n\nI feel that the advance of fares will aid in getting more of our children to the school, and I trust this will benefit them more than attending a Day School for half of the year.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nMonthly Report \u2014 January, 1915\nPrimary Grade, Massett Indian Day School,\nMassett Reserve, Q.C.I\n\nThe attendance of pupils during the month was very good, the record showing an average daily attendance of about 56 per cent of the total.\n\nThe health of the pupils was fairly good for the month.\n\nMrs. Frank Fairweather\nAsst.

The line is drawn, in the Boarding school, and the danger of forty or fifty day scholars, sitting in a heated day school, with children suffering from tuberculosis is just as dangerous as it is in the Boarding school. Our Indians are dying off from tuberculosis and the question is to eradicate it. The medical attendant of the band should visit the day school at least fortnightly and report on the condition of the scholars. In the Massett day school we have now an epidemic of influenza and I requested the medical officer to visit the school and report on the question of closing the institution for a time. The whole village seems to be affected and influenza is a dreaded disease here. So far we have had few deaths for this year, due to the care of the medical officer and all concerned. I am also a believer in giving the children single desks to keep them apart while in school. It is plain to us that many have symptoms of tuberculosis and if we must eradicate that disease we must take extreme measures. If we had a place for patients suffering from the disease, it would help in isolating the cases that are in the homes, roaming the streets and endangering the healthy men, women and children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nI consider that thirty per cent of our Indians have\nthe germs of tuberculosis in their systems and the wonder is that our\nlosses will not outnumber the births, during the fiscal year.\n\nThe Skidate band is fighting the disease in every\nway and the Massetts are doing better every year; but we have an\nup-hill fight where so many Indians congregate in two towns\nand where so many attend the two schools during the winter time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) Thomas Doan\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the receipt of the following from Mr. Frank Trainer, Teacher of the Massett Indian Day School:\n\n\"Sir:-I beg to make application that my vacation, as Teacher of the Indian Day School at Massett, be during the months of June and July of the present year.

A. Graves, and also to Dr. Wright. Unfortunately, the children have been leaving the schools, for the gardens and camps, and the attendance will be small during the Summer months. In fact, the attendance is now so small that no idea can be ascertained of the condition of the pupils. During the months of November, December, January, February and March, the attendance is large; the Indians start to leave, just as soon as the weather clears, and the children, whether sick or well, are taken away. In a short time, the schools will have to close, through non-attendance of pupils, and the Medical Officers will not have a fair opportunity, at present, to examine those who might prove a menace to their school associates.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nRoom 14,\n249 Hastings St.East,\nVancouver,B.C.\nMarch 29,1915.\n\nJ.D.McLean,Esq.,\nAsst.Deputy and Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,Canada.\n\nSir;\n\nI have noted carefully what you say in yours of March 22,NO.122723/1.regarding the work of Massett Day School.\n\nThe same mistake I found in at least two other schools.There was not sufficient oral work.Pupils that are learning a new language need much oral work.so that they may become familiar with sound of the words.\n\nIn consultation with the teacher,a suit-\nable time table will be drawn up on the occasion of my visit to that school,giving prominence to oral work.especially in English.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOttawa, March 31, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Queen Charlotte Agency which refers particularly to the schools I beg to say that the Department wishes you to request Drs. Graves and Wright to visit the schools at Massett and Skidegate and make special reports as to the health of the pupils and particularly as to the prevalence of signs of tuberculosis germs. These reports should contain full information and recommendations as to what should be done to improve sanitary conditions in the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 25th September instant, I have the honour to report that the Indian Day School has been closed, all church services and congregations of Indians suspended, and every endeavour is being made to stamp out the disease, which the Medical Officer reports to be Chicken Pox.\n\nI notified the provincial authorities, and quarantined the families of the affected children in their houses, placing a guard to obtain anything required and to see that they did not leave the buildings.\n\nThe Provincial Constable takes \"night duty\" on the reserve, remaining in the Village until all of the people retire.\n\nIt was necessary to obtain food and other necessaries, for the infected families. I enclose accounts for the supplies given them when they were instructed to remain in the houses.\n\nSix families have been quarantined. Notices have been put up, on the houses, and throughout the village, and no children under fifteen years of age are allowed to visit the White settlement, three miles away.\n\nThe White residents have been instructed to keep off the reserve.\n\nOn account of the Field Matron and Nurse having a family of eight children, I considered it advisable to notify her not to visit the infected houses.\n\nThe fathers and mothers of the infected children can\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nlook after their children. The medical Officer informs me that they require no medicine; but that the disease must run its course.\n\nWe are keeping a good watch over the remainder of the Indians and, should other cases develop, the families will also be quarantined.\n\nConsidering that I live on the reserve, and have the opportunity to see all that is going on, and that the Indians not affected are fearful of the disease, I hope to have it stamped out as quickly as possible.\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nINLAND AGENT'S OFFICE,\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nNassett, B.C., April 1st, 1916\n\nNO. 4516-1.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Quarterly Report of Teacher Frank Trainor, of the Nassett Indian Day School, for the term ending 31st March, 1916.\n\nAlso Agent's Monthly Report, for the month of March, 1916.\n\nThe Indians are now moving away, to their camps, and outside gardens, and will remain at those places until they leave for the fishing grounds and the canneries. In consequence, considered it advisable for the Assistant Teacher to be dispensed with from the end of March.\n\nDuring the next seven months, the attendance at the Indian Day Schools, in this Agency, will be very small. It is possible that the canneries, on the islands, will be in operation, this year; if so, and we can find enough children to attend same, the Teachers will be sent to the canneries. Unfortunately, the canneries work the women and children, and, for that reason, I consider it necessary to have a Boarding School, in this Agency, where at least seventy-five of the children would attend and remain the year round.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 13th January, with reference to overcrowding the Massett Schoolroom, and the necessity for more desks.\n\nIn reply to your inquiry permit me to state that the Indian children are now leaving for the fishing grounds, with their parents, and there will be no more overcrowding, or necessity for desks, until late in 1916, when the Indians return to permanently stay on the Reserve.\n\nI will ascertain from Mr. G. D. Tite, who supplied the desks now in use, the size of the desks, and other particulars, and will send in a requisition for same before the return of the children, later in the year. The single desks now in use cost $6.50 each and the number required, 12, would call for an appropriation of $80.00, including freight from Prince Rupert.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Quarterly Report of Teacher of Massett Indian Day School for the term ending 31st December, 1915.\n\nOn account of the Christmas holidays, commencing on the 22nd instant, the report was prepared to leave on the fortnightly steamer, leaving here on the 28th instant.\n\nThe presence of \"Chicken Pox\" in the Village, which was discovered, to such an extent, that it was liable to spread all over the large settlement, necessitated closing the School, on the 24th September last. During 30 school days, the School was closed, on this account.\n\nAs usual, in the Winter, the attendance is large; the Assistant Teacher, Mrs. Trainer, assumed her duties on the 1st December, with a full attendance.\n\nThe school rooms have been painted, and the ventilation is better. The children are well dressed and clean. There is a marked improvement in all directions; but we find it difficult to impress on the parents the necessity for sending their children to school. A constable visits the School, frequently, and is continually looking for truants. On any pretext, the parents take their children away to the camps, off the reserve, and it is next to impossible to show good results, when children spend the greater part of the year away from the schoolhouse.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

If we had a boarding school, in this neighbourhood, we could send fifty more to it. Every child of school age, in Nassett and Skidegate, would attend a boarding school, if we had one on the island.\n\nIt might be possible to engage Mrs. Trainer to teach for four months of each year, at the salary asked for, provided the attendance of pupils warrants the engagement of an assistant teacher. I am certain that Mr. Trainer cannot handle the full number of pupils attending, during the Winter months.

Trainer, Assistant Teacher of Massett Indian Day School:\n\n\"Sir: Will you kindly transmit to the Bureau of Indian Affairs my humble application for an increase of salary as assistant teacher of the Indian Day School at Massett Reserve? At present the remuneration for the work is $25.00 per month for each month I am engaged, the term of my employment being often four to six months as the attendance warrants.\n\n\"There are forty-four pupils in all on the roll of the primary department.

The Teacher, Mr. Frank Trainer, receives $75.00 per month, with a house, free of rent, and, in comparison with the Indian Agent, his position is more remunerative, considering the time he is occupied.

The reports on the work of this school are satisfactory and the teacher, while not possessing professional qualifications, appears to be doing very good work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWilliam Banks, Esq.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nOrange Order,\n70 Dawson St.,\nToronto, Ont.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNO. 161-10\nALSO\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quarterly Report of Teacher Frank Trainer, of Massett Indian Day School, from the term ending 30th September, 1916.\n\nIn reference to this Report permit me to state that the Indians of this Agency are fishermen.\n\nThey all leave the reserves early in the year and remain away until November, at Canneries and fishing camps.\n\nIt would be advisable to close the Day Schools in this Agency from May to November in each year. The engagement of Teachers, when we have no children at the schools, means an expenditure that can be avoided in this way. I have suggested that some means should be taken to keep the children at home, by providing them with food and lodging. With the Boarding Schools filled up, and no place to send the children, it is the custom of the Indians to take them to the canneries, and have those that are old enough do work in the canneries. The Indians appear to think more of making money than they do of educating their children. They even try to have the children sent home, from the boarding schools, during the Summer, in order to have them employed.\n\nI objected to this procedure, to the Principal of\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nAt Okanagan Industrial Institute, where a number of the Massett and Skidegate children are pupils. In fact, I feel that a law should be passed preventing Indian children, under a certain age, from working in canneries. From my knowledge of the way a large number of the Indians conduct themselves at the canneries, and the class of people they have to associate with, it would be far better for the Indians if they never went away from their homes. Young boys and girls, and Indian women generally, see and learn nothing to their advantage. If we could take the children away from the atmosphere of the cannery and the Indian reserve, until they were able to know something of moral training and hygienic laws, it would be possible to make good, independent, self-supporting people of them.\n\nThe engaging of day school teachers, during the summer, when we have the schools open but fourteen days in three months, and but a short time in the previous quarter, shows that at least six months of the year are not of much benefit to the children. The Teachers have two months of a vacation, in June and July, one month in each quarter. An inspection of the schools will show that the Indian children advance very little during the remainder of the year. The parents appear to move away, seeking wood, fish, and for other reasons, even during the winter months, and take their children from school on any pretext. The Truant Officer is busy, when the Indians are at their homes; but he receives little assistance from parents. The Indians consider that they are entitled to a Boarding School, and we find that forcing the majority of them is the only way by which we can get them to the Day Schools, even when they are at home. I must say that the Day Schools in this Agency are not a success, under the conditions found here, in more ways than one.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 27, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing the quarterly return of the Massett Day School for the September quarter last.\n\nWith reference to your remark that the day schools in the Queen Charlotte Agency should be closed from May to November in each year as there are no children to attend, they being absent from the reserve with their parents at the canneries, I beg to say that the present arrangement as to the engagement of teachers at these schools during the entire year will have to stand for the present.

He was also informed that there is a residence for the teacher and that fuel would be provided and that, if at any time during the winter months the attendance would justify the employment of a second teacher, the Department would be prepared to make the teacher's wife an allowance for her services if she would act as assistant.\n\nYou might consult with Mr. Cairns in regard to securing a suitable teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. M. Tyson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 2nd instant, informing me to Mr. Inspector Cairns' report on the Massett Indian Day School, and instructing me to inform Mr. Frank Trainer, the Teacher, that his services would not be required after the 30th June next.\n\nMr. Trainer has been so informed and stated, verbally, \"that he expected to leave and intended to resign before the close of the year.\"\n\nWith reference to Mr. Cairns' report, I might state that his two annual visits were at times when Indians were absent, and but few of the children were at home. It is unfortunate that the Indians of this Agency leave their reserves, during the Summer, to make a living at fishing, and they remain away for months.\n\nI did not consider that Mr. Trainer was attending to the duties, satisfactorily. He was appointed without consulting the Indian Agent, as all employees are, and I asked that a programme of studies should be given, specifying what I considered right, to be taught, during certain school hours. I also consulted with the Teacher, calling attention to many things; but no notice was taken. I reported on things, as I found them. The fact that our Indians are not at home, during the Summer, and that there is a large attendance, during the Winter\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nmonths, is due to circumstances over which we have no control. We send as many children to Boarding School as can be accommodated, and could send many more.\n\nIf the Indians lived in large numbers, at any specified place, during the summer, the Teacher might follow them there. They do not. Some go to cemeteries; others go fishing and live along the coast; others go to gardens and camps, and the two towns are practically deserted. They return, for a few days, then scatter out, to get their winter fish and wood, and return, about November, to remain during the winter.\n\nThe children have progressed; but not as they should. The parents must live; they are fishermen. We have no industries near the reserve. That Mr. Trainer is not a competent teacher, is not denied; but the system of appointments is not conducive to getting satisfactory results. We are expected to supervise the schools, and know nothing of these placed under our charge. We recommend improvements; but they are not carried out, as in the case of specifying certain studies at certain hours, which I was informed would be posted up. Mr. Trainer did not adopt several recommendations made to him, and I consider that it will be for the betterment of the School that the proposed change should be made. I believe Mr. and Mrs. Trainer have done their best; but they did not understand Indians and what is required of teachers in Indian schools.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 21, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in regard to the appointment of a teacher for the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is taking steps to secure a suitable teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 3rd instant, with respect to the report of Mr. Inspector Cairns, on the Massett Indian Day School, and instructing me to notify Mr. Frank Trainer, the Teacher, that his services will not be required after the 30th June next.\n\nIn reply permit me to state that a copy of your letter was forwarded to Mr. Frank Trainer, on this date.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 3rd, (No. 122723/1), instructing me to inform Mr. Frank Tominer, teacher of Massett Indian Day School, that his services would not be required after 30th June next, permit me to state that it would not be advisable to fill the vacancy until September next, on account of the absence of pupils from Massett Reserve. This would mean a saving in the salary, and would be no inconvenience, or loss, considering that the Indians will not return to Massett Reserve until that time, in sufficient numbers to open the Indian Day School on the Reserve.\n\nI would further ask that consideration be given to my letter of November 28th last (No. 42611-16). Although I am not partial to Indian teachers, we have some exceptional Indians, the product of Metlakatla Indian School of former days, who are thoroughly able to teach the pupils in Massett Indian Day School. The Indian Agent, Field Matron and Nurse, and Constable, could assist an Indian teacher,\u2014when a white teacher might object. It is results we are looking for, and all should assist. We have three Indians here\u2014Alfred Adams, Henry Shenshaw and Peter Hill\u2014who could teach the children. Two of them might be engaged during seven months of each year, at $60.00 per month, each.\n\nThe Agent, Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nThis plan would allow the Constable to live in the teacher's house, where he would be immediately available to look after truants, and also to attend on cases of infraction of the law.\n\nIf we had a regular attendance, the year round, I would advise the permanent employment of white teachers. The Indians are now going to their camps. They will not return, to permanently reside here, until the end of next September. Paying teachers for several months, when the schools are closed, both here and at Skidegate reserve, is a waste of money. It is difficult to get white people to take up positions, and remain on these islands, for any length of time. We would be showing the Indians that their efforts to improve would bring them occupations. If an Indian woman is good enough to teach at Skidegate Reserve, Indians are also capable of teaching, on this reserve. A start, in this line, was made there, and the Massett Indians consider that they also deserve recognition.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent-General met both Alfred Adams and Henry Idenshaw, and knows that they are two of the most progressive Indians on the Coast. Peter Hill is also a graduate of Metlakatla school.\n\nI place the above before you for what it is worth. It is my aim to have the Haidas progress. Our Indian Day Schools have not been a success, for reasons beyond our control. The Indians must leave the islands, during the Summer, to live. Without a boarding school, we have been handicapped. The boarding schools, outside, are filled up with pupils. We could send over 100 children to a local boarding school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 22, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to securing a teacher for the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your suggestions, you may appoint either Alfred Adams or Henry Edenshaw to take charge of this school when the Indians return to Massett and the salary allowed will be at the rate of $60.00 per month. If at any time during the winter months the attendance would justify the employment of a second teacher, these two young men may then be engaged at the same salary.

I am at present teaching in Copper Mountain School in the Similkameen district, but desire to move to a situation which will offer permanency as its special feature.

Clotworthy for the Massett Day School.\n\nMr. Clotworthy has splendid qualifications and I feel confident he will do good honest work.

Adams is, in my opinion, the most progressive Indian in this Province\u2014eager to advance the Indians, morally, socially, and intellectually. He is a sober, steady man, and should be a success as Teacher. I consulted with Rev. A. J. Price, the Missionary here, and he is of the same opinion.\n\nRegarding the Assistant Teacher: We have Henry Johnson, and Peter Will, to select from. When the time comes, for the selection of an Assistant, the choice should go to the most worthy of these men.\n\nI would recommend that the Constable be allowed to occupy the teacher's residence. It would not be advisable for an Indian to have the place.

Mr. Clotworthy is a married man, twenty-six years of age and is at present teaching at Copper Mountain, B.C.\n\nMr. Cairns has been informed that Mr. Clotworthy may be placed in charge of this school when the Indians return to Massett and that he will be allowed a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum for his services.

The export of certain kinds of fish is prohibited. See section 5.\n\nSection 13 is further amended by adding thereto the following subsections:\n\n17. Notwithstanding any provision of any regulation heretofore made, no Indian or other person shall send, ship, bring or carry, or cause to be sent, shipped, brought or carried, any sockeye, spring or chinook, coho, humpback or dog salmon which has been caught, taken or removed above a tidal boundary, to any place below such boundary; provided that when such salmon is in a cured condition, an Indian may bring below such boundary any salmon thereto forced by him and his family may require for their actual food purposes, but not for sale or barter.\n\n18.

Some of the Indians are signing the paper, without reading it. I certainly told the Indians that they cannot fish in the rivers of these islands, with gill nets, for commercial purposes. In fact, fishing with nets, in any of our rivers, or streams, is illegal. Some time ago, a blind Indian\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof the Massett Band, named Frederick Young, was fined, by the Inspector of Fisheries, and his net and boat confiscated. I desire to conserve the fish of our rivers, for the Indians. One \"gill net\" will stretch across any of our rivers, which are, really, what one would call \"streams.\" I enclose a copy of the \"Fishing Regulations,\" and endeavoured to keep the Indians out of trouble, and have fish, for Winter food.\n\nMr. Edenshaw, with his gasoline launch, towed a scow, belonging to the Wallace Fisheries, to Port Clements, a few days ago. Some Indians were there, catching and smoking fish, for Winter use. An attempt was made to have the Indians sell the fish, \"sockeye salmon,\" caught in the Yakoun river, to the White man in charge of the scow. I informed several Indians that the fish caught in the river, I understand with \"gill nets,\" could not be sold to be shipped to a cannery.\n\nIt was after Mr. Henry Edenshaw returned from Port Clements, in company with Chief Councillor William Matthews, and found that Alfred Adams had been appointed Teacher, that he went to Langara Island fishing grounds and asked Indians to sign a petition, which, I am informed, calls in question my work.\n\nThe Indians depend on the salmon, from these streams, for their food supply. If they catch, and sell, the fish to canneries, the streams will soon be \"fished out.\" I have not troubled the Indians regarding their food supply, or made inquiries regarding the way they catch fish, in the streams. I tell them not to sell salmon caught in the rivers of this island, to save the Indians from fines, or imprisonment.\n\nA large number of our Indians can sign their names; but cannot read. I have been informed that Indians signed Henry Edenshaw's paper, without understanding the contents. Edenshaw is a man I have helped, in many ways; but he was not the most deserving or most capable man, for the position of Teacher, and he is now indignant, because his wife is not the Field Matron and Nurse.\nand he did not obtain the position of Teacher.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a great deal of \"jealousy,\" among Indians. Edenshaw was not a graduate of Metlakatla Industrial School, like Adams and Hill. An Indian girl was appointed Teacher at Skidegate. Peter Kelly, a Haida, is teaching in Nanaimo. I considered that we had Indians here, capable of teaching in the Day school, and so informed you. I did not recommend any; but sent you three names\u2014Adams, Edenshaw and Hill. You instructed me to appoint \"either Alfred Adams, or Henry Edenshaw.\" I appointed the first mentioned\u2014a good, sober, reliable man, without showing favoritism, in any way. Then informed Henry Edenshaw that he could have the second place, if he wished. He indignantly declined, and called in question the appointment of Alfred Adams. Peter Hill will take the place of Second Teacher, and was not offended, at not receiving the first place.\n\nI am writing you, to explain conditions. Have not seen the paper which Henry Edenshaw is placing before Indians, for signature. If there is any complaint therein, that requires investigating, I am willing to give any explanation necessary, and would be pleased to have a copy of same. Considered it advisable to let you know the action of Henry Edenshaw, and William Matthews, who is fishing with him, and who also was at Metlakatla School.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nWe, the Councillors and the majority of the Haidas in the Queen Charlotte agency desire that you would cause an inquiry to be made as early as possible into the affairs of this agency.\n\nFirstly, Mr. Beasy appears to us to be running this agency for the benefit of himself and a few favoured followers and not for the benefit and advancement of the people generally; therefore we desire to have him removed as quickly as convenient.\n\nSecondly, through Mr. Beasy's influence a teacher has been appointed that is not acceptable to the parents of the children who attend School, and although he has been notified to that effect will not cause a change to be made. During the past our children have received instruction from White Teachers and have improved generally. Mr. Triner the last White Teacher was dismissed, and one of Mr. Beasy's followers Alfred Adams has received the appointment. We desire our children to be taught by a thoroughly competent and qualified Teacher so that when they leave School they will be able to take their place in life on the same footing as the children who are taught in the Provincial School.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will investigate these our grievances at an early date, as we who have signed this Petition desire only the welfare of the people in the districts in which we live.\n\nThe names of the Councillors and those who have signed this request to you are herewith attached.\n\nWe are\n\nyours respectfully,\n\nHenry Edenshaw\nW.

I have also informed Constable Jessup of your instructions regarding the teacher's residence.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent.\n\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 26th ultimo, which reached me on the 19th instant.\n\nIn reply permit me to state that, anticipating the arrival of Mr. Clotworthy, with a wife and infant child, I delayed visiting Skidegate, anxious to prepare the house for them. I took upon myself, at last, the responsibility to have the interior of the residence, fumigated, washed, and painted, and to have the place put in a sanitary condition. Mr. Clotworthy, with his family, arrived on the last steamer, and took up residence in the Teacher's house without loss of time. He is well pleased with the work already done. I left the outside painting, and drainage, until his arrival. With Mr. Clotworthy, I will attend to the remainder of the work, which will be done as economically as possible. The interior floors, walls and ceiling, have been washed and painted, and necessary clearing of weeds done, outside the building. It is proposed to build a wooden drain, to tidewater, and to paint the roof and walls, outside, which should be carried out under the appropriation asked for.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the honour to ask the date from which Mr. A. C. Clowes' salary will commence, as teacher of Massett Indian Day School, for the quarter ending 30th September next?\n\nMr. Clowes informs me that he left his former residence, for Massett, on the 9th August. He reported to me on the 16th August, and opened the Massett Indian Day School on the 26th instant, when we found a sufficient number of pupils on the reserve to commence operations.\n\nThis inquiry is made in order to make out the Pay List of Teacher, on the 30th September.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you of the receipt of the following, from Mr. A. J. Cletwerthy, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School:\n\n(Copy)\n\nMassett, B. C., Aug. 27th, 1917.\n\nT. Murray Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Queen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett B. C.\n\n\"Sir:-I beg to draw your attention to the following matters: First, when I applied for the position of teacher in the Massett Indian Day School, I understood from the Inspector of Indian Schools that fuel was to be provided for me. In fact, I received by letter from the Department at Ottawa, dated March 25, 1917, reads: 'There is a residence for the teacher and fuel would also be provided.' The supply of fuel at the house is now very low and I wish to know whether you will have the wood deposited at my residence or whether I will make my own arrangement about cutting wood, delivering same, and charge the cost of same to the Department.\n\nSecondly, I distinctly applied for the position of teacher in the Indian Day School at Massett, and not for the position of Janitor. I find however that the teacher is supposed to attend to sweeping, dusting, fires, etc. In all my communications with and from Mr. R. H. Gairne, the Inspector of Indian Schools, there is no such mention of such work. I, therefore, cannot consider janitor work here as part of school duties. Unless someone else can be obtained to do such work, I am prepared to do the sweeping, dusting, fires, i.e., the daily routine of janitor work for five ($5) dollars a month, and will scrub the floors of both rooms as well as the outside for an additional five ($5) dollars a month, such scrubbing to take place twice a month. I will perform the duties of Janitor until the Department replies; but as a matter of principle I protest strongly against being called upon to carry out these extra and unexpected duties.\n\n(Sd.) A. J. Cletwerthy, Teacher.\"\n\nWith reference to the above, permit me to state that the former teachers provided their own\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 1)\nfuel, at their separate residence. I have no instructions to provide fuel for the teacher. The janitor work was done, in the past, by the teacher and pupils; no provision is made to pay anyone to do janitor work.\n\nWhen the last teacher vacated the residence, he left a quantity of wood\u2014his private property\u2014which Mr. Cletworthy is now using, free of charge. We all find it difficult to obtain wood\u2014the Indians prefer fishing to the cutting of wood, hence my application, some time ago, for permission to obtain a supply of coal.\n\nYou approved of a requisition for ten cords of wood, for the school; but I cannot get anyone to cut wood until the Indians return from the canneries and fishing grounds. The demand for labour is so great that Indians receive more from fishing, mill work and other occupations than by providing wood for the residents.\n\nWe are all under great expense here. Everything is mounting higher and higher in cost. Transportation of food, high cost of labour, and raised prices, in this out-of-the-way country, makes it almost impossible to live on the salaries provided, without considering the inconvenience we are under in obtaining what is required to live.\n\nI endeavoured to make it pleasant for Mr. Cletworthy, and his wife, on their arrival. The house was ready for their occupancy, was cleaned and painted. He found a small supply of wood there, and we intend making further improvements. I give his letter, as handed to me, and await your instructions.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ult., embodying a copy of a communication which you received from Mr. A. J. Cloworthy teacher of the Massett Indian Day School with reference to the fuel supply for his vehicle, and janitor's services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, with reference to the fuel required for the school and teachers residence, that you will be good enough to purchase the quantity required for such purposes, the Department agreeing to furnish the fuel for the teachers residence. You will be good enough to purchase the quantity of fuel required at the lowest possible price, and forward properly certified vouchers, covering the expenditure incurred, to the Department for payment. You should give this matter your early attention, and have the fuel delivered as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to the services of a janitor for this school, I beg to say that, if the teacher will do this work, the Department will allow him a salary at the rate of $50 per year for his services, which will be paid quarterly upon receipt of properly certified vouchers from you. For this amount, he will be expected to do the sweeping, dusting, and the making of the fires daily, and should also have the school scrubbed at least once a month. You will be good enough to inform the Department, after consulting Mr. Cloworthy, as to whether he will undertake to do the janitor work required above, and if not you should obtain\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\nobtain the services of a competent Indian to do the work at the same salary as is offered the teacher.\n\nRegarding the salary of Mr. Cloworthy, as mentioned in your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that payment will be made him from the 10th of August last, the date on which he arrived at the school. As the Department is paying his transportation expenses, it is not, therefore, considered that he is entitled to any salary from the 9th to the 16th of August, the time which he took to reach the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent, Deputy and Secretary.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\n\nMassett, B.C., January 2nd, 1917\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Quarterly School Report of Mr. A.J. Closworth, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School, for the quarter ending 31st December, 1917.\n\nWith reference thereto, permit me to state that no Assistant Teacher is available. Mrs. Closworth is not in a position to take the place, and it is possible that an Assistant Teacher, as usual, will be required, on account of the large number of children in the Massett Band.\n\nA number of families of Indians have located at Port Clements, a sawmill town, 26 miles from Massett, where the men obtain employment. It is possible that a majority of the Indians will be located there, for some months. The men employed at Port Clements are paying a Provincial Tax of $5.00 annually, and have asked me whether their children are not entitled to the benefits of the Provincial Day School there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There appears to be no discrimination against Indian children and I think there is no question about their right to attend the public school.\nOttawa, January 30, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 2nd and 16th instant in regard to the appointment of an assistant teacher for the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you consider that an assistant teacher is required at this school during the winter months, you should communicate with the Church authorities with a view to obtaining a suitable person for this position. Any applications you receive should be forwarded to the Department for consideration, with full information as to the age, religion, qualifications, experience, etc., of the applicants.\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of 2nd instant, in which you state that a number of families of Indians have located at Fort Clements and that they have asked you whether their children are not entitled to the benefits of the provincial day school there, I beg to say that the Public School Act of British Columbia, Chap. 206, R.S.B.C., provides that all public schools shall be free; that the salaries of teachers shall be provided from the two following sources, the Provincial Treasury and the District Assessment; that it shall be the duty of the rural board of school trustees to provide school privileges free of charge to all the children between the age of 6 and 16, inclusive, who may be resident in the district; that every child\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nchild from the age of 7 to 14, inclusive, shall attend some school or be otherwise educated for six months in every year.\n\nThere appears to be no discrimination against Indian children and there is no question about their right to attend the public school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 30th ultimo, with reference to an Assistant Teacher for Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply permit me to state that the attendance at this school has fallen off considerably, and there is no necessity for another teacher. The Indians are employed at sawmills and logging camps, away from the Reserve. On my two recent visits to Massett Indian Day School the attendance showed thirteen pupils.\n\nNo Indians applied for admission to the Provincial Public School, at Port Clements. I understand the Whites are averse to Indian children attending school. I did not advise the Indians to apply for admission, under the circumstances, at the same time, I feel that the \"Poll Tax\" should not be collected, from Indians, unless they have the same privileges with the Whites. Until we become assured that the Indians intend residing, permanently, at Port Clements, I would not advise the opening of an Indian Day School there.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nQueen Charlotte Agency,\nMassett, B.

C., May 4th, 1916.\n\nT. Deasy Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent,\nMasset Reserve, Queen Charlotte Agency, Massett, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nBe our attention on the following matters: In the letter of March 27th, 1917, No. 1273/1, I was informed that my salary was to be paid at the rate of $300.00 per annum, and that ten (10) months constituted a school year. I therefore take it for granted that the school year ends on 30th June.\n\nAlso in the leaflet headed 'Indian Day School Regulations,' one item reads: 'Where a teacher is engaged to take charge of a school, duties to commence after the Summer holidays, payment for the September quarter will be made as provided for in the case of broken periods in the previous paragraph; and at the end of the year, -- that the necessary adjustment will be made, and all arrears, if any, paid.'\n\nTherefore, if I find that circumstances necessitate my resigning at the end of June, my services to terminate at the end of July, will I be paid the necessary adjustment, i.e., I believe eighty-one ($81) dollars? I have already received $114 for September quarter, $325 for December quarter, and $265 for March quarter. There should, therefore, be $265 remaining to me at the end of this school quarter, which will leave owing (as far as I can judge from the agreements under which I came here) the sum of $81. Will you therefore kindly inform me whether the Regulations mentioned are still in force, and if so, will I receive the eighty-one ($81) dollars simultaneously with the two hundred and twenty-five ($225) dollars for the June quarter.

Deasy Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent, Massett Reserve,\nQueen Charlotte Agency, B. C.\n\n\"Dear Sir:- I beg to ask that the Summer holidays in the Massett Indian Day School be taken in June and July of this year, for the following reasons:\n\"I find it has been customary in previous years to take June and July for the holiday months. (2.) At present the school has dwindled down to about ten, and these will be away to their gardens when the weather becomes settled. (3.) At the end of the month (May) the Indians will be scattered-some will be gardening, some fishing, some hand logging and some working in the mills. By the end of July however, the majority will doubtless be employed in fishing and the women in the cannery. Then there will be more opportunity to commence school either at Massett or at Naden harbour at the beginning of August. (4.) In any case there will be no children here, at the end of May. Therefore it would be advisable to take June and July for the Summer holiday. (5.)\n\"A. J. Clotworthy, Teacher.\"\n\nWith respect to the above, I am of the opinion that the Indians will not remain in Massett,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nduring June and July. There is some possibility of finding the families located, later in the year, at Naden Harbour Cannery, on Virago Sound. At the present time, the attendance, at Massett Reserve School, is very small.\n\nIn case of the Indians congregating at the Wallace Cannery, Naden Harbour, is it the intention of the Department to have the Teacher attend to the duties there?\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Clotworthy, the Teacher, he informed me that it was not his intention to continue teaching the Massett Indian Day School after the end of this quarter. He did not tender his resignation in writing; but so informed me, verbally.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1918.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th ultimo embodying a copy of a communication from A. J. Clotworthy, teacher of Massett Indian Day School, I beg to say that your letter was mislaid and it is regretted that a reply was not sent you before this date.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Clotworthy's request that he be allowed to take holidays during June and July, as the Indians are away from Massett for the fishing season, I beg to say that if the school has not been closed during the present month, it is considered that it would be advisable to keep the school open until the end of the month and the summer holidays can be taken at the usual time during July and August. If, however, Mr. Clotworthy has closed the school during the present month, his action will be approved. If it is not his intention to continue teaching after the end of this quarter he should forward his resignation in writing.\n\nWith reference to the amount of salary which will be paid him for the period he taught this school, I have to say that provided he teaches until June 30th of the school year and completes the requirements of the year, namely, 200, he will receive upon receipt of his quarterly return.\n\nThomas Denay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset Reserve,\nGraham Island,\nB. C.\nSir,\u2014 I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 14th June ultimo, with reference to the \"vacation and salary of Mr. A. J. Clotworthy, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School.\n\nThe Massett Indian Day School was closed on the 22nd May last on account of absence of pupils\u2014the children going with their parents to logging camps and other places.\n\nI handed a copy of your letter to Mrs. Clotworthy to be forwarded to Mr. Clotworthy, who is away from the reserve, for a short time.\n\nMr. Clotworthy did not tender his resignation and I am not aware of his intentions. He has spoken about teaching the White children, at New Massett school, after the Summer vacation; but his family resides in the house of the teacher, on the reserve.\n\nI would recommend that the day school re-open at the Wallace Fisheries, Naden Harbour, at the end of the Summer vacation. A majority of the children will be there for some time, while the parents work in the canneries and fishing for the Company operating there.\n\nIn consultation with the Missionary and with the Chief Councillor, we have been formulating a plan to keep the children on Massett Reserve during the Summer months. Rev. Mr. Gillett, the Missionary, has placed his suggestions before His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, for his approval, before taking the matter up with you. It is\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nthe custom of the parents to take their children away, during the month of May, and to return about November, in each year. The children receive little education, during the Winter months, and forget a great deal of what they learn, during the Summer. If we could educate them for ten months of each year, how much better it would be for them, and how much more satisfactory for us!\n\nThe work our Indians now engage in will mean that the Indians will be away a great deal, even during the Winter months. It is plain that a great number will not send their children to the only available industrial school, at Chilliwack, a long distance from these islands. The parents need the older boys and girls, during the Summer, to produce fish from the sea and to work in canneries. It is almost useless to teach our Indians farming. We have no farms on these islands. Our products are timber and fish. The Indians produce enough vegetables for their own use, in the gardens on reserves, and where they find a little open land, outside.\n\nTeachers, and others, soon lose interest, when a large number of the pupils attend school for a few months, and spend the remainder of their time at Outside camps and towns.\n\nThe Teachers' report shows seventy-five children of school age, on the Band roll, and fourteen on the roll of the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, from the Massett Band alone. This should entitle them to a boarding school. It may not be the proper time to ask for a boarding school; but some means might be devised to keep the children in Massett during the whole school year, and we are working out a proposition on those lines, for consideration. Education is the only hope of the Indian, and we need it more now than ever.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, I beg to say that as soon as Mr. Clutterby informs you of his future plans, you should advise the Department.\n\nIn the event of his resignation, you state whether a teacher can be secured.\n\nBefore authorizing the opening of the school at the Wallace Fisheries, Naden Harbour, the Department desires to know what accommodation there is at this point, also, if the school were opened, would it mean additional expense and, if so, how much.\n\nThe Department's appropriation is so limited at present, that the question of establishing a boarding school for the Massett band can receive no consideration, whatever.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nT.

J. Clotworthy, Teacher of Massett Indian Day School, in reply to a letter of the 26th June last, regarding the status of the Teacher, from the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"As regards my being here after the Summer holidays, I intend to leave, provided I receive my salary from the Department in time to enable me to leave for another school. Judging from the answer to my letter re. salary, it seems I am not paid the full yearly salary unless I teach 200 numbered days (200 days). As no teacher has done so for the past five years (see Register) and as the nomadic habits of the band make such a condition impossible, I must resign my position as Teacher.\n\n\"I most protest against a teacher being induced to come here for a yearly salary and then being deprived of part of that miserable pittance ($200 a year) on the grounds that he has not completed 200 teaching days.\n\n\"Surely it would be fairer to inform a teacher before his coming here that his salary depended on the number of teaching days and then tell him that no teacher has been able to put in that number of days for many years.\n\n\"It is fairness to the teacher and also yourself, it surely would be better for the teacher to be assured that your Agency and not thru' the Inspector, who does not understand local conditions and so is apt to mislead a teacher into coming here. (Sd.) A. J. Clotworthy.\"\n\nWith reference to the above extract from Mr. Clotworthy's letter, it appears to me that a mistake has been made. All other teachers received \"full time,\" whether the Massett Day School was open, or closed, through no fault of the teacher. I informed Mr. Clotworthy that it was the intention to open the School, at\n\nthe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 328-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNaden harbour, on the 1st August. The large majority of Indians are there now. The Massett Day School closed on 22nd May, and has not been reopened, through lack of pupils.\n\nA copy of your letter of June 14th ultimo (No. 122723-1) was forwarded Mr. Cloworthy, of which he takes notice, in his reply, and to which he takes exception.\n\nRespecting the future conduct of the School: I had several interviews with the Missionary here, and the Chief Councillor, both vitally interested in the education of the children. The following plan has been formulated by us, and brought before His Lordship Bishop DuWernet, and is now placed before you: It is proposed, considering the the Department is not in a position to erect a boarding school, for the 75 children of school age in this band, that Rev. J. Gillett and Alfred Adams take over the Teaching Duties connected with this School, at the salaries allowed for teachers, viz.: $900, and $300-for a teacher and assistant teacher. That they give full time to the work and either follow the children to the logging camps, fishing camps and sawmill towns, or that the children be kept on the Massett reserve, the Department allowing for the bedding and maintenance of the children, while the parents are absent from the reserve. That the full control of the school remains with the Department. We have but one schoolhouse, on Massett Reserve. Towns, logging camps, fishing plants and other industries are springing up, and something must be done to give the children an education. The Indians remain d on the Massett Reserve, during the Winter; but they are now scattered out, every Winter, and few will remain, permanently at their former home village. The production of aeroplane spruce, for war\nThe Whites, at Port Clements, and other places, do not want our Indian children in the Provincial pay Schools. Conscription is taking away the Whites. Indians take places in mills and logging camps, assisting in \"winning the war,\" by the production of \"aeroplane spruce,\" of which we have vast quantities on these islands. It is our duty to look into the proper education of the children of these Indians, and I am making suggestions that can be carried out. We have Day School Teachers, coming and going. They teach a few children, during a few months, and want a yearly salary guaranteed, for doing little during a greater part of the year. We cannot expect them to come to these islands, take up this work, and not have enough to live on; but we are looking for the education of the Indian children, in return for the payment of salaries, and the upkeep of the school.\n\nIf the Department, and the Bishop, are willing to allow Mr. Gillett and Alfred Adams to take the school, the future work of these two earnest men, who also are looking for results, will be beneficial, far more so than under the present system.\n\nAs your Agent, I make suggestions, some of which are approved; other suggestions are not carried out, as in the case of the appointment of teachers, last year, and in the cancelling of their appointments. The result was sending Mr. Clotworthy here, and, although he gave satisfaction in his work, he was not content with the arrangements made with him, from the start. Teachers, doctors, constables, and other officials come and go. Even the Missionaries do not stay long on these lonely islands; they look for results from their labours, and soon become dissatisfied with conditions. The Indians remain, and the question is, their welfare, and this depends upon their education.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\npurposes, and the catching of fish, for the use of the local and outside markets, means that things are changed, and it will be impossible, under the old order, to keep a Day School open for many months of each year, in fact, the attendance, during the last winter fell off to an average of 8.79. during the June Quarter, which is too low, where we have 75 children of school age.\n\nI also notice that no girls are at present in the Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, from this Band. The Institute is about 1,000 miles from Massett. We have no girls in any boarding school, and few boys.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining, and holding teachers, is known. If the Department, and His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, agree with the arrangement we propose making, we will have the children on the reserve all the year round, living in their own houses, or in places provided for them. Mr. Gillett and the Chief Councillor are anxious to bring results, and it is the education of the Indians that will affect their future standing. The Indian children learn little or nothing, in our Day Schools. Closing the schools in May, and re-opening them in October has been the rule. What educated men we have, came from the Wetlakatla school, which was closed, some years ago. They are getting old. Alfred Adams is one of them, and he is 32 years of age. I am sure the Department would be glad to keep up the record of the Haida Indians, as the progressive Indians of British Columbia. I am more than anxious about these Indians and their education. Things have changed, and the Indians are no longer living in communities. They are scattering out, to the towns, logging camps and fisheries of these islands. To educate the Indian children, we must keep them together, or build more school houses. The proposed plan, of keeping the children on Massett Reserve is the only feasible one.\nOttawa, August 12, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo embodying a copy of a communication which you received from A. J. Clotworthy, late teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, with reference to the amount of salary which he was paid for his services during the period he taught this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Clotworthy, according to the returns forwarded by him, began duties on the 27th of August, 1917, and taught till May 22nd, last, when the Indians left Massett for points along the inlet. Clotworthy has been paid $219.00 of his salary of $300.00.\n\nIf he remained at Massett till June 15th, he would have been unable to teach on account of the absence of the Indians. The Department will allow him the balance of his salary, viz., $81.00. It is recognized that, owing to the habit of the Indians in moving from point to point, it is impossible to keep school open. Kindly state whether you consider should be paid the above balance due to complete his salary.\n\nWith reference to the statement that Mr. Gillett and Alfred Adams teachers connected with this school at Massett, Mr. Gillett was paid $300.00 for teaching full time to the work and Mr. Adams $300.00.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\ncamps, fishing camps and sawmill towns, I beg to say that, provided this arrangement meets with the approval of His Lordship Bishop DuVernet, the Department will agree to the appointment of these two men as teacher and assistant teacher respectively, to begin duties on or about the first of September, next.\n\nThis seems to be the best arrangement that can be made for the present, as the Department has no funds to provide for the bedding and maintenance of the children at Massey while the parents are absent.\n\nIt is hoped that Messrs. Gillett and Adams will succeed in their work as teachers of this school. Will be good enough to inform the Department whether they accept these appointments and, if so, the date on which they are prepared to begin their duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 12th instant, with reference to school matters, in Massett.\n\nIn reply I have the honour to state that the contents of your letter was explained to Rev. Mr. Gillett. He informed me that His Lordship, Bishop DuVernet, was not favourable to the plan, under existing conditions. With only one clergyman on Massett inlet, where so many new towns are springing up, for the productions of aeroplane spruce, for war purposes, His Lordship is of the opinion that Rev. Mr. Gillett would be employed in Church work, in the various localities. Rev. Mr. Gillet was willing to take up the work of teaching; but could only do so with the consent of Bishop DuVernet.\n\nIn order to open the School, and to give the Indians an opportunity to show whether the teaching they received at the Metlakatla School fit them for the work of teaching, I would suggest a temporary arrangement:\n\nAlfred Adams and Peter Hill, two of the Massett Indians, might be engaged until the end of this year, at $60.00 per month each, to take charge of the work. They are anxious and willing to take up school teaching, and the appropriation would not be exceeded.\n\nWe close the school, during the Summer. In the past, school teachers received pay during the time the school was closed. An understanding with Adams and Hill could be arrived at, whereby they would only be paid for the time actually engaged as teachers. They would not\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nreceive pay during the Summer holidays, should their services be required, or when the school is closed, on account of non-attendance of pupils.\n\nI am of the opinion, during these strenuous times, that it would be difficult to engage teachers\u2014Whites\u2014who would give the attention these men are willing to perform. They are both married, and have families. They could talk the native language, to the pupils, and explain, in English, the different lessons. Our Indian children have not advanced, under the Day School system, as we hoped they would. Should a number of the Indian children go to any of the neighbouring towns, one of the teachers, or both of them, could follow.\n\nI understand that Peter Kelly, a Haida Indian, is teaching in Nanaimo. There should be no reason why other Indians, if competent, might be given the opportunity to show whether they can improve on the system of having White teachers for Indian work. Adams and Hill are advanced Indians, and they graduated from Metlakatla Industrial School, where the late Mr. Scott was teacher. I feel sure Rev. Mr. Gillett would be pleased to have these men in the school. In fact, he asked me whether Adams could not be engaged. Adams is a musician, and a Lay Minister in the Church here. He could take the senior class, and Hill the junior.\n\nI find the White teachers become discouraged at Indian work, and feel that Indian teachers would try to improve their own people. It would not be an experiment. I feel sure that good results would follow.\nSir,\u2014\nThe Indians claim recognition, and they ask me why they are educated, if they are not placed in positions they are capable of filling?\n\nThe Indians of the Massett Band thought enough of both of these men to elect them as Chief Councillors. The department placed a Skidegate Indian girl in charge of the school there, some time ago.\n\nI feel sure that Messrs. Adams and Hill would give good service. The arrangement need only be temporary, until we are satisfied that they are competent, or are not acceptable.\n\nRegarding the services of Mr. Clotworthy, I forwarded you a letter respecting the payment for his services. He began teaching on the 27th August, and was paid to 30th June. The school closed in May. He was dissatisfied with things, generally, during the whole of his stay, informing me that he was sent here under \"false pretences.\" He might have opened school at Naden harbour, early in August; but decided to leave, without giving the customary notice. Considering that Mr. Clotworthy complained, in letters which I sent you, it might be looked upon as prejudice, for me to state whether he should be paid the balance of a yearly salary, or not. The Department understands exactly what services the gentleman performed, and the amount paid him. He received more than any other teacher and left before a year expired, from the time he arrived here.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nQueen Charlotte Agency\nNassett, B.C. October 1st, 1918.\n\nThe Nassett Indian Day School building has been cleaned and the toilets have been re-boarded; I have made arrangements to have the \"wells\" in Nassett village placed in good order, for the winter. We have enough children in the village, to open the school, and I would respectfully ask that teachers be appointed, either the two Indians suggested or that a man and his wife be sent here. If desired, I could obtain a man from Vancouver to fill the position.\n\nI would ask whether some Boarding School is not open for the admission of Indian children from Nassett and Skidegate. I understand Coqualeetza Industrial Institute has all the pupils it can accommodate, just now. Is there a boarding school at Metlakatla?\n\nYour obedient servant,\nThomas Deney\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Act. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 23, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report of the last instant regarding the Massett Indian Day School and also in reply to your letter of the 27th of August last, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Massett Indian Day School, I beg to say that it is noted that you were not able to secure the services of Rev. Mr. Gillett as teacher, as his full time is required in church work.\n\nThe Department will agree to the suggestion made by you to the appointment of Alfred Adams and Peter Hill, two of the Massett Indians, to take charge of the work as teachers of this school. This is to be considered as a temporary arrangement and their continuation in the position will depend on the success which they make in their work and that the results show that they justify the Department in continuing their services. A salary at the rate of $60.00 a month will be paid to each, which will, however, only be paid for the time they were actually employed in the work as teachers. The salary will not be allowed during the summer holidays or for other periods when the school is closed for any length of time. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements with these two men to have them begin duties as soon as possible, and you should inform them that their engagement is a temporary one and depends upon the satisfaction which they give. Mr. Adams is to take the senior class and Mr. Hill the junior.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Department whether they accept the position on the above terms and, if so, the date on which they begin duties.\n\nIt is noted that you have had the school building cleaned and the toilets re-boarded, also, that there are enough children in the village to re-open the school.\n\nI may say that there is no boarding school to which the children from Massett and Skidegate could be sent, other than the Coqualeetza Institute, which, however, at the present time, has its full quota of pupils. The Industrial School and the Girls' Home at Alert Bay might be able to take several children and if they can be sent there without undue expense the Department would consent to their admission, provided they are of school age and in good health. The Metlakahtla Industrial School was closed several years ago.\n\nRegarding the salary of Mr. Cloworthy, the late teacher of Massett school, I beg to say that it is considered that he received ample compensation for the period which he taught this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island,\nB. C.\n\nAssistant Secretary\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith pay List of Teachers of Massett Indian Day School, for the month of March, 1922.\n\nTeacher Peter Hill is now ill, with \"Influenza,\" and unable to attend to the duties, being under the care of the Medical Officer.\n\nThe School was closed, during three days, on account of the death of Joseph Adams, brother of the other Teacher, Alfred Adams.\n\nAlthough it was considered advisable, to re-open the School, the endemic of \"Influenza,\" which attacked the Indians, late in January, is not yet eradicated. We considered it advisable to open the School, for the benefit of those able to attend, for the reason that we find it better to have the children in the warm school room, instead of on the streets or around the houses where sick patients are domiciled.\n\nThe death list does not include any of the school children so far. Infants and grown Indians died, and the disease did not appear to have the same effect on those who spent greater portion of their time, during the day, in the school room. So far, the school children appeared to have only slight colds; but we are not free from the disease, by any means.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Teacher Alfred Adams was taken seriously ill, early in April, and was attended by the Field Matron and Nurse of the Band. In the absence of a Doctor, it was considered advisable that he should proceed to Prince Rupert, and consult with a Doctor there.\n\nHe went out on the last steamer. Teacher Peter Hill took charge of the whole school, the number of pupils in attendance having decreased, on account of the Indians leaving for their camps and fishing grounds.\n\nI received the following message from Mr. Adams, after his arrival at Prince Rupert, and after consulting with a doctor there: \"Examined. Nothing serious. Improving nicely. Will be back next boat. (Sig.) Alfred Adams.\"\n\nIn my opinion, one schoolteacher will be sufficient, at the beginning of May. Teacher Peter Hill will then continue teaching, until the school closes.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 15, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant enclosing the December quarter return of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to note the large attendance of Indian children at this school and the success with which the teachers are meeting in their work.\n\nWith reference to the re-arranging of the class-rooms to provide more accommodation and the engaging of the services of another teacher, I beg to say that, as the large number of pupils will only be in attendance for a short period each year, the Department cannot undertake the expense of providing another teacher. It is considered that the present teachers can arrange the existing school-room to handle the children who attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Quarterly report of Teachers of Massett Indian Day School, for the term ending 31st December, 1920.\n\nThe Indians have been going and coming, until they are now settled down, for the Winter months, on the main reserve.\n\nWith one hundred children, on the School Register, (and a number located at Cogumleetza Industrial Institute), it is apparent that the accommodation and teaching staff is taxed to the limit. In fact, the two rooms, in Massett Schoolhouse must be re-arranged, to place all of the girls. The room they occupy is too small for the number attending. Considering that we have these children, for only a few months in each year, it might be possible to increase the teaching staff, for the time being, as one hundred children appear too many for two teachers.\n\nIt is encouraging to notice that the children are eager to learn, and the parents are taking quite an interest in their education. The children are slow, to grasp the English language, but are doing as well as can be expected\u2014and are progressing more favourably than they did a few years ago\u2014under another system of teaching, and with native teachers. The young Indians require to have explanations made, in their own tongue, and make far more progress in object lessons, and otherwise, than when the teacher is unacquainted with their language.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File R28-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Teachers' Salary list for month of January, 1920, Nassett Indian Day School.\n\nAfter the Christmas holidays, the School opened with Seventy pupils in attendance. Considering that a number of the Nassett children are attending Coqualeetza Industrial Institute, and several families away, the attendance has been good, and the children take a great interest.\n\nBasketry work, under Mrs. Edenshaw, is also receiving a great deal of attention, from the girls. Teacher Adams instructs the children in singing. The Nassett Indians are musical. They held an entertainment and proved that the work now going on will produce remarkable results.\n\nI am more than pleased with the interest taken, by teachers and scholars, during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 7th ultimo, with reference to the payment of \"Teachers Salary for month of October.\"\n\nThe Teachers inform me that they received the Cheques, through \"registered mail.\"\n\nI feel it would be advisable, in order to keep my account book in order, that the salary cheques might pass through this office.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 7, 1919.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing voucher, in duplicate, for the payment of the salaries of Alfred Adams and Peter Hill, teachers of the Massett Indian Day School, for the month of October, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that cheques for $75.00 are being sent for these teachers, being salary for the month of October.\n\nIt is hoped that when the Indian parents and their families return from the fishing camps there will be a large and regular attendance of Indian children during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith \"Pay List\" of Massett Indian Day School, for the month of October, 1919.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, contained in your letter of September 23rd ultimo, I notified Messrs. Alfred Adams and Peter Hill, Teachers, of the decision of the Department, with regard to their salaries, and they opened the School on the 1st October instant.\n\nThe attendance has not been great during the month, caused by the absence of a large number of Indian families at the fishing camps, preparing their winter food, and also at the gardens, gathering their potatoes. The Indians are now returning to their homes, and we expect a large number of pupils, during the Winter months.\n\nThe Teachers were pleased and thankful for the salary the Department decided to grant them.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, November 6, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the question brought to your attention by the teachers of the Massett Day School regarding the recess to be allowed the pupils during the morning and afternoon sessions.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that copies of the Indian Day School Regulations are enclosed herewith for your information and by reference thereto you will see the period the school should be open each day and the time granted for recess. These Regulations cover the entire school year, there being no distinction between winter and summer periods.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform that, on a recent visit to the Massett Indian Day School, a question arose, with the teachers regarding the \"Recess,\" called for in the Regulations governing Schools.\n\nWhen the Day Schools open at 9:30, during the Winter months, and a \"recess\" is allowed, both during the morning session, and during the afternoon, forty minutes come from the time of the school day.\n\nI would be pleased to have the \"Winter Regulations\" governing Indian Day Schools, showing time of opening and closing, and recess.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 23, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, embodying a copy of a communication which you received from Messrs. Alfred Adams and Peter Hill regarding the question of their again taking up duties as teachers at the Massett Indian Day School and the amount of salary that will be paid them for their services.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the reports received as to the success which these two teachers met with during the past year, the Department will agree to their re-appointment as teachers. A salary at the rate of $75.00 a month will be paid to each. This will only be paid during the time they are actually employed in the work as teachers and will not be allowed for summer holidays or for other periods when the school is closed for any length of time.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform them of their appointment and of the amount of salary they will be paid. You should forward properly certified vouchers at the end of each month for the salary due them.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. Denny, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island,\nB. C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you of the receipt of the following letter from Messrs. Alfred Adams and Peter Hill, on the question of opening the Massett Indian Day School, and the salaries paid them during the last term.\n\n(Copy)\n\nMassett, B.C., Sept. 2nd, 1919.\n\n\"Mr. Thomas Deasy,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\n\"Dear Sir:- Regarding the teaching at Massett Indian Day School, we are of the opinion that the Department was satisfied with our efforts, up to the time the school closed. We presume, therefore, the Department expects us to continue, when enough scholars are in Massett. With great eighty children on the roll, and a large attendance during our term, we are again willing to take charge and do our level best for the pupils. At the same time, we are of the opinion that we should obtain a fair remuneration for the time we conduct the school. The cost of living has increased. We are families, men, and a White teacher, with only eight pupils, is receiving over ninety dollars per month, at new Massett. With over fifty regular scholars, we received only the sum of $394.80, for our six months services, last year; for the expenses of both of us.\n\nWe consider that we should receive something near the cost of conducting the school under other teachers. We propose to you that the Department allow us $75.00 per month, while the school is open, as the work is difficult, and we must live, like others, during the time that expenses are so high.\n\nOur desire is to have our children advance, and we are willing to put forth every effort in the future as we did in the past, to advance the Indian children of the Band. We received no bonus or vacation.\n\n(Sd.) Peter Hill,\n(Sd.) Alfred Adams,\nTeachers Massett Indian School.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 2)\nEXTRACT FROM THE ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL REPORT OF INDIAN AGENT DEASY.\n\nWe have introduced a new innovation by the appointment of native teachers, temporarily, in our day school. The change had a remarkable effect from the start. The Indian teachers understand their pupils. They explain the meaning in Haida and English words. The teachers and scholars cooperate and all take an interest in the task. If the Indian teachers continue to advance pupils, the results will show that it was not a mistake to give Indians capable of teaching an opportunity to take positions of trust and will be an incentive to others.\n\nI would recommend that the native teachers Messrs. Alfred Adams, Peter Hill and Henri Green be retained and receive salaries during the time schools are open.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Quarterly Report, to 31st March, 1919, of teachers Alfred Adams and Peter Hill, of Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn connection therewith I beg to state that the quarter was the most successful, from the standpoint of attendance and learning, ever enjoyed by the children during my residence here.\n\nThe two men took great interest in the advancement of their charges. The children reciprocated, and were eager to attend. I have learned that native teachers, with education, advance the younger Indians more rapidly than white teachers, imported for the work, and utter strangers to the language, customs, and ways of Indians. Able to inform their pupils, in their own language, of the meaning; with object lessons; and by encouraging confidence in their superiors\u2014the children attended in large numbers.\n\nUnfortunately, the gardening and fishing season is coming on, and the parents will leave the main reserve, shortly, taking with them their children. The attendance must then, necessarily fall off, until the school, as usual, will be closed, later on. I hope the good work of these native teachers will continue.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, November 17th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a voucher for the salary due Peter Hill for the month of October, last, as teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for $75 in payment of his salary for the full month will be sent.\n\nIt is noted that a classroom was fitted up and ready for occupation on the 9th of October, and that the attendance from that date was satisfactory.\n\nWe also note that the old church building belonging to the Anglican Church has been utilized for school purposes, and that permission was granted to use the same free of rent. It is hoped that this building will serve the purpose until such time as it is possible to provide the necessary funds for the erection of a new school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose \"Salary List of Teacher of Massett Indian Day School,\" for the month ending 31st October, 1922.\n\nThe Teachers of Massett Indian Day School are engaged, by the month. On account of the fire, which destroyed the Massett Indian Day School Building, it was necessary to obtain temporary quarters. We are permitted to use the \"Old Anglican Church Building,\" which required repairs, inside and outside.\n\nReceived a quantity of school supplies; had to set up stoves; replace broken windows, and have the building gone over, generally. An appropriation was made, for repairs, which were made, from the beginning of the month, it was necessary to have the services of Mr. Hill, in fitting up the interior of the building. He worked every day, until the school was re-opened. I supervised the work, both inside and out, and we had the building ready for occupation, on the 9th October, when Mr. Hill took charge of the pupils. From that time, to the end of the month, the school was in session, every school day, and I made a number of visits, as the \"school Report\" will show.\n\nThe children, in attendance, are receiving the same attention, and teaching, they had, before the fire occurred, and no time was lost. On account of the absence of the Indians, it was not found necessary to open a school, until the beginning of October, when but nine children appeared since then, the attendance increased to over twenty, and we expect a better attendance, later on.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you of the receipt of a quantity of school supplies, from the Stationery Department, Ottawa, and the Provincial Government, for the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nOn the 5th instant, opened school in the \"old Anglican Church building\" with Teacher Peter Hill in charge.\n\nWe are improving the building, to make it safe, after receiving permission from Rev. J. Gillet to use same, free of rent, found it would not be advisable to use the \"Town Hall.\" The Indians take little care of this building, and do not appear to desire to improve their village, without assistance from the Department, there is not one move they make, apparently, without looking for payment, even from one another.\n\nThe Old Church building requires shoring up, before the stormy weather arrives. It is roomy, and the ventilation is good. It stands, away from other buildings on Church property.\n\nThe attendance is small, on account of the Indians gathering their winter supply of fish, at the various streams, away from the village; but we expect a large number to attend, next month.\n\nTwelve children left the reserve, in September, for Coqualeetza Industrial Institute. Many more made application for admission; but the Principal cannot admit them. The Massette and Skidegate could send nearly one hundred pupils to a Home Boarding School, and they are very anxious to learn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 12th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say it is hoped that you will be able to arrange for a suitable building to carry on the classroom work on the Massett Reserve. It is noted that you are endeavouring to arrange with the council and church authorities for the use of a suitable building.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of the 30th ultimo, an order has been placed for the desks, and it is hoped they will arrive at Massett at an early date.\n\nRegarding the teachers, Alfred Adams and Peter Hill may be re-engaged and the salary allowed them will be at the same rate as was previously paid. The second teacher should only be employed during the time there is sufficient attendance to warrant the engaging of two teachers.\n\nWe hope you will be able to arrange to obtain a suitable building - either the town hall or the old church - and have the desks installed as soon as they arrive and the classroom ready in order that the work can start as soon as there is a sufficient number of children to attend.\n\nWe are leaving this matter in your hands to make the best arrangement possible for carrying on the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit \"Quarterly Report\" for the term ending December 31st, 1922, on Massett Indian Day School, in this Agency.\n\nThe attendance was small until the end of November, when the Indians returned from their camps, and outside employment.\n\nDuring October and November, Teacher Peter Hill was able to conduct the School. On December 1st, Alfred Adams was called in, and continued teaching during the month.\n\nTwo fifty-five pupils have reached Massett, a few days ago, and will be placed at the opening of the School, after the Christmas vacation. We have a good attendance, at present; but it must be remembered, that a large number of children attend at Qualqaleetla Industrial Institute, from Massett Band.\n\nThe Indians are so eager to have their children at school, that a number of the women remain at home, on the reserve, while the breadwinner is working in logging camp, or at a sawmill, further up the inlet, away from the vicinity of the school.\n\nIt appears to me, after visiting the South end of the Province, that the Massett Indians are doing very well, in comparison with other bands.\n\nThe Skidegate Teacher reports a large attendance, while the Massetts are doing their level best. We cannot keep them at home, the year round, and it would be a great convenience, to have some means of supporting the children, when the parents are compelled to leave the main reserves, to seek a livelihood. The children cannot be expected to compete with these from the mainland schools, yet it would surprise any visitor to notice the advancement of the \"Natives.\" I have nothing but praise for the teachers of our two day schools, and trust their good work will continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe as residents of the Massett Reserve would respectfully call your attention to the conditions under which our children are being educated, or rather the excuse of being educated.\n\nFor instance - why is it allowed that some of our own people, who have only a very ordinary education, and no training whatever for the position of teacher, are allowed to teach our children, and without any inspection whatever.\n\nAlso why is allowed during past years, that any ordinary white man, who has no ability as a teacher, and no training as such, is allowed to teach our children. Is anything good enough for us because we are Indians, even if we are not much expense to the Government. And is it to be allowed forever, that any fad that our agent takes in his head as to the teaching of our children is to be allowed to pass.\n\nWe humbly beg to call the attention of your Department to the condition of our people on this Reserve, who instead of advancing in civilization, have been at a standstill for the past ten years. And the cause as we see it is for the want of a good education.\n\nThere are at present time about 65 children going to our School here. And about 35 have been sent away to a school at Sardis B.C., which is a big lot of expense to us.\n\nWhat we earnestly desire you to do, is to do away with the existing teaching conditions here on this Reserve, and let us have properly qualified teachers to educate our children, so that they will have a fighting chance to earn their living, when thrown out on the world. And thus save both the Government added expense as well.\n\nWe would earnestly also beseech you to have a duly qualified nurse attached to the School, to take care of our children, and also to teach both them, and their mothers how to have them grow up in a good healthy manner.\n\nWe sincerely ask you to give this matter a very thorough investigating, as well as your very best attention, for it has been allowed to now drift along a very long time indeed, and recently this state of things has existed for the benefit of only a few people.\n\nAll of which is very respectfully submitted.\n\nWe are Yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Gillett, referring in general terms to the work of the two teachers. I have noted the suggestion of the Rev. Gentleman, that the two Indian teachers be retained for those months when the enrolment is large and that a white teacher be employed to supervise the whole activity and to teach the more advanced pupils.\n\nAs you have been informed, the Department approves of the engagement of a qualified teacher for this school, and if you secure the services of a lay teacher, you are authorized to offer as high as $1000 per annum supplemented by any bonus provided by law, if your nominee's qualifications are satisfactory. If a missionary with proper teaching qualifications is secured, the Department believes that a salary of $800 should be suggested, as the Church authorities will no doubt supplement this figure, because of his church duties. As soon as school opens in the fall, one of the Indian teachers should be on duty, and when the enrolment is large the second one can be employed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, Graham Island, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith quarterly Report of teachers of Massett Indian Day School\u2014Messrs. Peter Hill and Alfred Adams\u2014for the term ending 30th June, 1923.\n\nAs usual, the Indians migrate, during the summer to the fishing grounds, off these islands, and to the canneries, logging camps and sawmill, where they work, during good weather, to obtain the necessaries of life, for the winter. They will not return, to reside on Massett reserve, for any length of time, until the expiration of three or four months, and take the children with them.\n\nTeacher Adams was laid off, on the 1st May, on account of the attendance falling off, at that time; but Teacher Hill continued, until towards the end of June. The last steamer out, took off a large number, for the Skeena river, and other places.\n\nI also beg to enclose a letter, received from Rev. James Gillett, Anglican Missionary, at Massett, with reference to the work of the two Indian teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMasset B. Co.\nJune 20/1923\n\nT. Casey & Co.\nIndian Agent\nMasset Reserve.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have heard that your department has suggested putting a white teacher at the reserve for the next school term. Before the present Native teacher so I would like to give my testimony to the splendid work that they have done. I venture to say that there is\nI hope that your department will not dispense with the present teachers entirely for a white teacher cannot take a little child of six years old teach him or her like one that can speak his or her language. What I would like to see would be the present teachers kept on, one of them at least and both when the attendance warrants it; and a qualified white teacher to take the scholars so they have passed the native teachers.\n\nI think I suggested to you sometime ago, that it would not be a native school on the coast where the children have come so well in such a short time. I have visited the school several times and have questioned the children.\n\nI have also heard that a petition was sent from the reserve to the Department of Indian Affairs asking for a white teacher. The cause of this I do not know why but probably among a few others interested and perhaps by Mr. [illegible] (the man) who I am told was responsible for writing the petition.\nbe a good thing to have a clergyman as the white teachers to take the advance pupils. This would be a great help to all concerned, for we would be more than of having a minister living at the village, whose influence would be for good.\n\nI have taken the matter up with our bishop and he thinks it a splendid idea.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Rev) Hallett\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4-23M of the 21st ultimo, with further reference to the appointment of teachers at the Massett Indian Day School. I have noted your explanation of the petition that was sent to the Department and have read, with interest, the letter you enclosed, from Mr. Adams.\n\nIn reply I wish to refer to official communication of this file number, of the 26th ultimo, in which you were authorized to secure the services of a qualified teacher and to intimate which of the two Indian teachers would be retained as junior teacher. I have noted, however, that you consider there is sufficient seasonal work for three teachers, and I shall be pleased to have a further report from you, after a white teacher has been engaged and the academic year commenced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nMassett,\nGraham Island, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. Alfred Adams, one of the teachers of Massett Indian Day School, with regard to a \"Petition received by you regarding the engagement of White Teachers at Massett Indian Day School.\"\n\nI informed Messrs. Adams and Hill, of the proposed engagement of a white teacher, and also of the receipt of a letter informing me that a \"Petition, signed by Thirty Massett Indians,\" had been received, on the matter in question.\n\nI also consulted with the Anglican clergyman, Rev. James Gillett, and he informs me that he will not propose the engagement of a clergyman, for the position, if it meant the dismissal of the present teachers. Rev. Mr. Gillett considers that the two Indian teachers have made \"such remarkable progress, with the pupils, that it would be against the interests of the children, and of the Department, to discontinue the work now being accomplished, by Messrs. Adams and Hill.\"\n\nRev. Mr. Gillett considers, and I agree with him, that there is need for three teachers, during the winter months, in this school. The engagement of a white teacher, during the whole year, and the retention of the two Indian teachers, under pay when the school is open, would be a great benefit to the children. It would also place a permanent resident clergyman, on the reserve, to aid in Christianizing the Indians.\n\nThe \"Petition\" was written by, and the same was circulated, by two rival storekeepers of Mr. Adams, and does not give a fair idea of the wants of even the Indians, considering that it did not go through this office, shows that it was a plot, to dispense with these men, by others, who considered \"personal interests,\" before the \"good of the Indians.\" I find that Messrs. James Martin and Robert Bennett, have been advising the Indians, personally, on this, and other matters, not beneficial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMassett Reserve B6\nJune 20th 1923\n\nHon. Deputy Esq.\nIndian Agent\nMassett Reserve B6.\n\nDear Sir, I regret to learn the regretfulness of some of our people by giving their signatures to the petition drawn up by Jas. Martin merchant of New Massett, to put us out of our positions as teachers in our day school, and apparently the Indian Department is considering the petition if the Indians are now going to be allowed to exercise such work regarding officials be cancelled, whenever one feels offended over a trifle, and drags others to cooperate with him, such aims are very harmful to my estimation to the government and the Indians, so such offensive Indians will be encouraged to repeat such petition in near future; however I am always ready and willing to surrender to the good plans of our guardians.\n\nI might also be allowed to add these few statements regarding the past history of our Day School, ever since we took the school, glad to say that parents and also cannot help to admit that the children are very much enlightened to see better light in education, the progress is to be admired.\n#2\n\nHurt Deary Esq.\n\nmade by the children; by the parents and by the\nvisitors from Clarke, the Clarkens admitted\nthat our children have better pronunciation\nin sounding letters and words in preference\nto their children, and I think our yearly\nstatistics show that we have made the\nchildren realize what it is to hunger after\nideals of education.\n\nI regret very much that Mr. Carins\nnever gave us a chance to inspect\nour school since he has visited no classes,\nwhen we were first appointed, but\nI assure you that I personally fully\nconvinced that you had made every effort\nto advance our children and really appreciated\nyour help by giving me a chance to improve\nour children, and I assure you again that\nI was always happy when occupied during\nschool hours and the unity between the\nteachers, clergy, and yourself is unequivo-\ncal for the welfare of your people, spiritually,\nintellectually, physically, and records\nshow that the result is to be passed off\nshould the cancelled to dissolve my\nposition, assure you that I am willing\nto obey the command either way.\n#3\n\nHans Dray Esq.,\nReverence to me, is a joy in the end, and\nI am on a journey where my fellow\nmen are following the Morning Star.\nYours obedient servant,\nAlfred Adams\nOttawa, June 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 4-13-23 of the 13th instant, with reference to the engagement of a teacher for the Massett Indian Day School. I have noted that you are taking action, following official communication of this file number, of the 25th ultimo.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the petition, referred to in official communication above mentioned, has been denied it some petty jealousy rather than inefficiency on the part of the teachers who have been engaged in the past. I have noted that the progress in the Massett Indian Day School has been marked during the past few years. I have to inform you, also, that the Department is aware of the ease with which a petition can be prepared by members of an Indian band, and I have to assure you that your attention would have been drawn to their requests before taking any action, if we had not received the recommendation that a white teacher be engaged, in your monthly report for April, last.\n\nWhen you have secured the services of a qualified teacher, you should intimate his or her name and make a statement of the qualifications possessed. It will also be necessary for you to mention what Indian worker is to remain as junior teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThomas Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett,\nGraham Island, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 26th ultimo, with reference to the engagement of a teacher at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nYour instructions will be complied with, at the same time, I must make comment on the closing lines of your communication.\n\nAlfred Adams, the Chief Councillor of the Massett Band, who is also conducting the religious services in the Anglican Church, as a Lay Minister of the Gospel, and a graduate of Metlakatla Industrial School, has been teaching, with Peter Hill, another Massett Indian, holding the same office in the Church, and councillor selected by the Band, were the two teachers, during the time the attendance was large, at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nAfter school hours, and during the time Mr. Adams was not teaching\u2014when the attendance went below a certain number of pupils, he conducted a licensed store, on Massett Indian Reserve. A rival storekeeper talked to the Indians, telling them they should have \"white teachers for the School.\" I have heard but one Indian complain, and I cannot understand how the \"thirty\" Indians were induced to sign a petition, for the reason that, at no time, during thirteen years, did the children improve, as they have recently. It may be true, that Indian teachers have a limit, and I was beginning to feel that it might be advisable to have a white teacher, and so stated; but I desire to protest against the action taken, by those considering their own interests, and using the Indians, for such a purpose. My aim has always been, to advance these Indians, and no personal, or other interest ever stood in the way. I live with them; watch over them, and know that the Massett Indian children advanced, during recent years, in a wonderful manner. Our former white teachers came to me and said: \"What is the use, they will not attend, and one become discouraged.\" We had over one hundred children attending this school, during the time Messrs. Adams and Hill were teaching. The children\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nand parents took a greater interest than ever in the school work. Only one family appeared to stop away, and the head of that family, Mr. Henry Edenshaw, wanted to be a teacher in the school, and you are aware how he formulated a \"petition,\" some years ago, for the reason that he was not competent to teach in any school, and had asked me to appoint him teacher. Henry Edenshaw never went to a school in his life\u2014and would not have been a proper person to teach children. I told him so, and obtained his consent, at that time.\n\nThere is little doubt that the \"petition,\" now in your hands, emanated from those with \"selfish reasons.\" We must expect such proceedings, at times, in places where even the Indians are ill-advised, by whites, who are rivals, in business, with those occupying positions, and when disgruntled Indians consider that other Indians are occupying positions they consider should be in their hands.\n\nAs stated, I brought up the matter of a white teacher, after receiving the letter of Mr. Inspector Cairns. At the same time, the \"petition\" referred to, in your letter, did not emanate from me, or from this office. I knew nothing of it, until you referred to it, in your letter. I have handled this Abenaki, and made recommendations to you, and changes, for the good of the department, and the Indians, irrespective of personal interests, and at a loss, to me, of friends\u2014all faithfully. The Indians are persons, without consideration paid, without \"petitioning\" for anything, through them. However, we cannot expect things to run smoothly, when so many parties, with \"self-interest\" use Indians for their own ends. Patience, and perseverance, must be two attributes of an Indian Agent. Thirteen years of service shows that we have some of the qualifications required.\n\nI thank you for the information contained in your letter. It will be necessary for me to inform Messrs Adams and Hill of the proposed action. Few are attending\nSir,\n\nthe School, at present, and one Teacher has been \"off duty,\" since the 1st May. I would still recommend the retention of one of the Indian teachers, after the holidays, with the proposed Teacher, on account of the large number attending, during the winter months.\n\nThe Church authorities have a proposition, to have an Ordained Minister appointed, as Teacher, which might be considered, in the interim. The Schools will not open again, for lack of pupils, until some time in September.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 26, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your monthly report No. 40-1525 of the first instant concerning the advisability of employing a properly qualified teacher at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that you, in conjunction with Mr. Inspector Cairns if necessary, are authorized to engage the services of a Second Class professional white teacher. You may offer a salary as high as $1000 per teaching year plus whatever bonus is allowed by law. It is understood that such a teacher, when employed, will supervise the activity of the junior room. This action is being taken, not only because of your report and recommendation, but because of a petition signed by some 30 members of the Massett Indian Band, requesting better qualified teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Secretary.\n\nThomas Denby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett Reserve,\nGraham Island, B. C.\nOttawa, May 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have noted your request for better qualified teachers at the Massett Indian Day School, and in reply I beg to state that the Department intends to provide better educational facilities for your children, as soon as Parliament makes an appropriation for the purpose. In the meantime, your request meets with favourable consideration, and I have to inform you that a communication is being directed to Mr. Agent Beasy, instructing him to engage, as from the first of September, next, a properly qualified teacher who will teach the senior room and will be in a position to supervise the class-room activities in the junior room.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a graduate nurse for field duties on the Massett Reserve, I have to state that there is no provision in our establishment for such an officer, and, for the time being, the Department will continue the services of the field matron, as heretofore.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

J. B. Gibson, of Christ Church, Anyox, B.C., and Rev. J. Gillett, of Massett B.C. Rev. J. Gillett informed me your appointment would be satisfactory to the church authorities.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, authorized me to appoint a teacher for said school, at a salary of $500.00 per annum, should the income derived from Church work, with the expectation that the Church authorities would supplement that amount, on account of the assistance to be given outside of the necessary teaching, in the Day School. It was also understood that a residence would be provided, on Massett Reserve by the church authorities.\n\nIt was also understood that the Teacher would give all of his time to school work, during school hours, when the teacher would be under the direction of the Department of Indian Affairs. Considering that all of the Massett are under the teaching of the Anglican church, it is desired that Church and State work harmoniously, for the advancement of our wards, morally, socially and intellectually.\n\nOne or more teachers, from the Massett Band, will assist in the local school, when the number of pupils exceed a certain quota, and will receive payment, as under present conditions.

J. E. Pamplin as teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that Mr. Pamplin will accept the position, and that he intends leaving to take up duties on the 4th ultimo. Besides his duties as teacher, we note that he will act as lay reader and that the Church authorities will make a grant to him for his services in this connection. As he will be engaged in missionary endeavour, as well as school work, for which service the Church authorities will allow him payment, it is considered that a salary of $800 per annum for the ten teaching months would be a fair amount for this Department to allow. In addition to salary at the above rate, he will be entitled to the bonus provided by law. When writing you on the 5th ultimo, we were not aware that Mr. Pamplin would perform any other than teaching duties, and salary at the rate of $900 was mentioned at that time. However, it has been decided, in view of the fact that the Church authorities will allow him a grant for his missionary work, that the sum of $800 per annum, plus bonus, is all that this Department can allow. Please inform Mr. Pamplin accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Deasy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 2nd instant with reference to the appointment of Mr. W. J. E. Pamplin, as teacher of Massett Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Pamplin has been notified accordingly; but considered it advisable to make no mention of the letter of the 5th September last, regarding the rate of salary, mentioned therein.\n\nIn all correspondence, with Mr. Pamplin, it was understood the salary had been fixed at $800.00 per annum\u2014the church allowing extra salary, on account of the assistance Mr. Pamplin undertook to perform, after school hours. He was notified, that the salary would be at the rate of $800.00 per annum, and he accepted same. At no time, was the sum of $900.00 mentioned, to Mr. Pamplin, therefore, in my opinion, it would be unwise to bring the matter up, at the present time. I understand his arrangement, with the Church authorities will mean the additional payment, by them, to Mr. Pamplin, of $300.00 per annum.\n\nMr. Pamplin commenced duties, as teacher of Massett Indian Day School, on 1st October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe coming year, with the Indians scattered over the islands, will mean that better school facilities will be necessary. Although I was informed that the new Massett Indian Day School would be constructed by October last, no sign of construction is apparent at this date, whether this means that the Department is considering the advisability of erecting a boarding school, or intends to continue teaching the children in a deserted church building, I am not aware. Nevertheless, the largest number of children attending Indian day schools in this province are at Massett. It is true the attendance is falling off from what it was, and it is possible that the Massette will not remain at their main reserve in the future, as in the past. Next year the exodus of the Indians from the main reserve will commence early, and other schools will be required, near the industrial plants, where the Indians will be employed. A falling off of from eighty children to forty shows that families are away from Massett. A few months in a day school will not give us educated Indians.\n\nEvery visitor remarks on the advanced condition of the Haida Indians. The parents and children are eager to learn; but there seems to be some barrier to constructing a boarding school where one is most needed. No near-by boarding school will take them; those at Coqualeetza are nearly one thousand miles away from their homes. The parents and the children should be able to see each other occasionally, and the grown boys and girls return to these islands, after an absence of years, in a different environment. If our Indians remained in one place the year round, day schools would be sufficient; but they work, here and there, and take their children amongst whites, Chinese and Japanese, and they learn nothing but evil. Give the Haidas an opportunity and you will have the best Indians in the Dominion. They are a class outside of the ordinary Indians, and their education would mean their salvation. Otherwise they will drift as with many other Indians, and retrograde.\n\n(Sgd.) Thos. Deasy.\nOttawa, December 19, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report for the month of November which refers to school facilities in your Agency, I beg to say that the Department intended to give serious consideration to the erection of a day school during the coming year. However, in view of the fact that a number of families will likely move from Massett, it is doubtful if this would be advisable under the present circumstances.

I should be pleased if you would make a general report and recommendation in this connection. You should indicate how many would be helped and ascertain if Mr. Baillie is prepared to give any special vocational trend to this extra instruction. If your recommendation is favourable to the scheme, you might intimate what additional salary, if any, should be allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd ult., regarding the suggestion that Mr. Baillie, school teacher at Massett, should conduct a night class for the young men of the village, I beg to say that this matter was brought to my attention last summer by Mr. Baillie, and I advised him to defer it until the new school was completed, as it would mean extra expense to the Department.\n\nI am hardly in a position to state how many of the young people would likely take advantage of it as the movements of the people are so irregular.\n\nMr. Baillie states that he is prepared to give instruction in business arithmetic, book-keeping, and English subjects. Personally I am in favor of a trial being given for three or four months in the year, viz:-from October to January, after which time there is usually quite a scattering of the people from the village. Mr. Baillie is a married man with a family of three children, and is at present receiving a salary of \u00a31030.00 for ten teaching months, and is supplied with a free house and fuel. He finds it very difficult to make ends meet on this amount, and I would suggest that his salary be raised to \u00a31150.00, which is allowing an extra \u00a3100. for the three or four months extra tuition.\n\nThere will be some additional expenses with regard to school supplies, extra fuel and lighting, and I feel that if the young men are anxious to have\nthese classes they should at least contribute something towards the extra expense incurred.\n\nAn extensive requisition for books and stationery was received from Mr. Baillie which I am holding until the matter has been considered.\n\nIf this meets with your approval, a start might be made next October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.J.J.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 18, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 2.QCI of the 8th instant, relative to a night class for the more advanced young Indians at Massett. I note your recommendation that a trial might be made for a few months, commencing with October of this year. The Department agrees that the young men who would benefit should contribute something towards the costs of such a course and I believe it advisable to ask them to supply the extra fuel needed and the books and stationery that they would require. You may explain this to the teacher and to the members of the band and make arrangements for the night class, if you consider it would be a success, as from October first, next. The Department will agree to allowing Mr. Baillie an extra $100 on his yearly salary for each and every year the night classes are successfully conducted for four months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. B. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nCan you oblige me by forwarding my cheque for the current quarter to Rev. J. Gillett, Masset, B.C., by return of mail? A power of attorney is enclosed herewith.\n\nMy financial obligations are rather pressing, some of which date back to the time in Normal School. The cost of living here is high and a salary of $1050 does not meet the needs of a family. It was not possible last summer, nor does it appear as if it would be possible next summer to add anything to that income during the holidays.\n\nA night school for the older Indians was asked for here and authorized by the Department during Mr. Deasy's term as agent. Owing to the impossibility of securing a teacher at that time nothing was done. The Indians took the matter up with me on my arrival here last winter. After signing up the possibilities I wrote to Indian Agent Gilliom at Prince Rupert. He replied...\nat once, that owing to the unforeseen consideration of the scheme would have to be deferred by the Department. He added that I would be at liberty to carry on such a school in my own time.\n\nI conducted night school for three months, three nights a week, two hours a night. The attendance was small, about twelve, but those who attended, attended regularly and took a great interest in the work.\n\nI would be glad to carry on this work under any circumstances, if my salary were sufficient to make ends meet. Under these circumstances I would be glad to have the Department consider the possibility of making some provision for this work.\n\nIf it is at all possible to allow something for the past winter's work, it would be very acceptable, as I have so many pressing obligations.\n\nIf plans were made beforehand for conducting a night school, the attendance would probably be better, and it could be in session for five or six months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHamilton Boulton\nOttawa, April 24th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, forwarding the March quarter return of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nWe note that approximately one-half the pupils have left the village with their parents for the cannery at Tow Hill, where a school is being conducted for them under the charge of Peter Hill, the assistant teacher at Massett. This arrangement is satisfactory, and the Department will continue Peter Hill's salary until the end of May, next. He should prepare a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., and forward same through your office.\n\nMr. Baillie should, at the end of the quarter, prepare a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., at Massett, and this also should be forwarded by your office in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith, return for the Massett Indian Day School for the 21st March 1926.\n\nAs nearly fifty per cent of the pupils left the village with their parents for the Langara Fishing and Packing Company's clam cannery at Tow Hill about 15 miles from Massett, arrangements were made with the management to put up a small temporary building at the Cannery for school purposes so that the children could continue their studies.\n\nPeter Hill, the assistant teacher at Massett was placed in charge whilst Mr. Baillie continues to teach at Massett.\n\nAt the opening of the school on March 30th there was an attendance of 38 children.\n\nI hope this arrangement will be approved and authority given to continue Peter Hill's salary until the end of May.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, April 8th., 1926.\n\nL.H.Ballis,\nMasset, B.C.\n\nCheque mailed thirtieth ultimo.\n\nJ.D.

J. Gillett covering your salary as teacher of the Massett Indian Day School for the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th, next. In reply I beg to say that the power of attorney has been accepted. A cheque for $315.00, being your salary for the current quarter, is being sent under this power of attorney to Rev. Mr. Gillett.\n\nRelative to the night school which you have conducted for the benefit of the older Indians, I beg to say that we have no funds available in the current year's appropriation to pay you for this service. We have received a communication from Mr. Agent Collison regarding this matter, and we have written him that a night class for the more advanced young Indians at Massett might be given a trial for a few months, commencing with October, next, and providing these classes are successfully conducted by you for a period of four months, the Department would allow you an extra $100 on your yearly salary. In this connection, it is considered that the young men who would benefit should contribute something towards the cost of such a course and that they should supply the extra fuel required and also the books and stationery they may need.\n\nIt is hoped that, if this class is conducted by you, there will be a good average attendance and that the interest taken would be sufficient to warrant the Department in undertaking the expense of the additional salary that will be allowed in conducting the night classes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Hamilton Baillie, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nMassett, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWould you be good enough to give your personal attention to the matters contained in this letter and give me what assistance you can.\n\nThe first and most important is the matter of salary. Owing to the fact that I was obliged to be away from home for the greater part of the week, and for other reasons that need not be mentioned here, I asked Mr. Carins to advise me of any opening that might occur in the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 2)\nday school. I was then at the boarding school in Alberton. In November, he forwarded to me Mr. Collins's request for a married man for this school. After some correspondence, I accepted the position. Application was made to the Department for travelling expenses; this, in view of the fact that the salary was small. The Department replied that it was not done. I could name a instance when it was done. It cost me $150, which had to come out of the first quarter's salary, to get here with my family. Previously, to go to Alberton I attended Normal School at Victoria. We had a family to keep and no cash or hold. I actually got into debt.\n\nI still have some of these debts to pay. Last year I had $900 after travelling expenses were paid. This year I will have $1000 or $875 a month. The cost of living outside of rent, is much higher than in Vancouver. There is no opportunity for a man who is not a fisherman and the owner of a launch, to make money during the summer months. I have had considerable experience at bookkeeping and general office work, such as correspondence etc., but I am not free for the whole of the canning season. These are the only local opportunities.\n\nI would be glad to stay here for awhile if the income were sufficient to provide for my family. It has been suggested that a sub-agency or part-time agency might be worked in connect...\nfor with the school work. So this may sufficient income might be forthcoming without adding to the financial burden of the Department. This matter might be referred to Mr. Stock, M.P.\n\nThere are two or three matters in connection with the house which I would like to mention. As the Department is aware we are living in the Agency. The teacher's residence is a small house, about a mile from the school. It is large enough for two people. For that reason, as the Agency was unoccupied, we were asked to move in there temporarily. That is a year and a half ago. No definite answer what has been made.\nup with the Department this year.\n\nThe fence needs repainting. All these matters were taken up with the agent last year. A good deal can be done with the ground around the house, but I would like to have some idea of the permanency of my tenancy. Cattle need to be fenced out.\n\nThere are eight acres of land, I believe, in connection with the school. If this were fenced, the teacher might help out his living by keeping a cow. If the cattle are run at large, they could be kept. If they would be a good supply of grass, I am satisfied.\n\nI could add something to my income by keeping them, but again the matter of tenancy and fence needs attention.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary for a married man to support himself. His income is very low.\n\nOwing to the distance we are from a bank and the long period between visits, it would be an immense advantage if the Department could return to the payment of salaries monthly, as they did during the last few years when Mr. Weasy was the agent.\n\nThanking you for your consideration of this communication, I am truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nHamilton Ball\nP.S. The Anglican Church has a house and some twelve acres of land adjoining the school. This house has been unoccupied for several years. If the Department could provide this as a teacher's residence, the land could be fenced and poultry could be gone into fairly extensively. This with a couple of cows and a garden might be made to pay the bulk of the grocery bill.\n\nThere is a boy who will be ready for school in a year or two and provision must be made for him as well as for the others who are growing up. I have not been able to pay any grocery bills, let alone send them to school. Some sort of relief from the present situation is necessary immediately. If some means can be found to do the necessary work of material was purchased. The water supply needs attention. The main water tank is beyond repair. At the present time there is only a few inches of water in it and a very little in the well. The welling in the well looks as if it might go at any time. The nearest water is a mile about half a mile from the house. When I protested about the water supply last year Mr. Ellwood informed me that he had carried water from that hole without harm to himself. He lived within a few yards of it. I understand that he has taken the matter\ncould be furnished if providing some additional income temporarily, the necessary time could then be taken to work up to the point where possibly a more substantial would furnish the necessary subsistence.\n\nL.B.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a lengthy letter from Mr. L.H. Baillie, teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, regarding the difficulties he is encountering in living on his present salary and also requesting certain repairs to the premises in which he is residing. For your information I enclose a copy of our reply to Mr. Baillie.\n\nHe states in his letter that the agency house in which he is living requires papering and that he is prepared to do the necessary work if the material is provided. He also reports on the present condition of the well and asks that the necessary repairs be made. He further states that if a fence were placed around the lot on which the agency building is located, he would be able to keep cows and hens.\n\nAs an alternative to making the above suggested improvements, he states that it might be possible to secure from the Anglican Church authorities, as a teacher's residence, a vacant house close to the school.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to communicate officially with the Anglican Church regarding this residence but we would have no objections to Mr. Baillie making any private arrangements with them regarding the use of this house as his residence.\n\nPlease discuss the above with Mr. Baillie at the earliest possible date and advise the Department. In the event of the teacher and yourself deciding that it would be preferable for him to remain in the residence which he is at present occupying, you should supply an estimate of the probable cost of the paper required for papering the rooms and also the cost of repairing the well and building the fence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant. While it is regretted that you are finding difficulty in financing on your present salary, I would point out that the salary allowed at this school is as large as at any other Day school in British Columbia and as our appropriation is limited, we are unable to increase the amount. Your services as teacher have been satisfactory and we trust you will continue your work.\n\nYour suggestion that your appointment as a sub-agent would increase your income has been noted and a further communication will be directed to you regarding this.\n\nMr. Agent Collison is being written regarding the repairs which you state are necessary to the building in which you are living. Mr. Collison is being requested to discuss these matters with you at the earliest possible date and report to the Department.\n\nFor your information I may say that salaries of teachers of Indian Day Schools have always been paid quarterly. I would further point out that in your case we have endeavoured to assist you in your financing by paying your salary early in each quarter.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to pay travelling expenses of teachers of Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.H.

The account is a reasonable one, and there seems to be no cause why Mr. Baillie should not pay it.\n\nI might state here that Mr. Baillie is very much in debt with the local storekeepers at Massett\u2014a fact which does not appear to cause him very much concern. There has, however, been a little difference between Dr. Dunn and himself, and I thought if something could be done to persuade him to settle his indebtedness with the doctor it would be a good thing as Dr. Dunn is unable to recover his fee by other means.\n\nI would have left the matter to Mr. Gillett, the newly appointed Agent had I not already promised Dr. Dunn to take the matter up with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.G.

They take turns, one each day, to visit the school and get the list of absentees, and find the latter and see that they attend school. As a result the attendance has increased. On my last visit to the school there were only two absent out of an enrolment of about ninety.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. JAS. GILLETT,\nIndian Agent, for the month of January,\n1927.

JAS. GILBERT,\nIndian Agent, for the month of February,\n1927, on the Massett Indian Day School.\nReport dated February 26th, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File 157-2-7.\n\n\"I see no improvement in Mr. Baillie's room as far as progress is concerned. Boys and girls around twelve years of age are still at the first few pages of the first Canadian Reader. I am not saying this in the nature of finding fault with Mr. Baillie, but it is the conditions as I find them. The people of the village have complained to me. The standing of the school does not compare to that of Skidegate. The school Inspector has not been here for several years. I fancy he would be a better judge than I am, as to what can be expected of Indian children at those ages.\"\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith school reports from the Massett and Tow Hill schools for the quarter ending June 30th.\n\nThe school proposition is anything but satisfactory. Mr. Baillie will not be coming back, so that a new teacher will be required for his department. I see no reason why good progress should not be made with qualified teachers using up-to-date methods, the same as in the white public schools.\n\nI have been more or less in touch with the school on the Reserve for the past nine years, and it has made very little real progress. Making allowance for the large number of pupils and the unsatisfactory attendance, I think the greatest fault has been with the teachers. My experience has been that where up-to-date methods are used and the teacher takes a real interest in the pupils, the children are anxious to go to school.\n\nThere has been no Inspector here since 1919. I have been wondering if it would be possible to arrange for the Provincial School inspector to visit the Indian Schools. He comes at least once a year, and usually spends a week or more on the Islands. Therefore he would have plenty of time to inspect our schools. According to a conversation I had with the Inspector he would be willing to do it, if arrangements could be made. I feel sure he would be able to give suggestions which would be beneficial, and also be a means of stimulating interest among the parents.\n\nPeter Hill, the Native teacher has done fair work, considering the qualifications he has. I would like to suggest that two qualified white teachers be employed for the coming term. The greatest drawback is the housing situation. If a man and wife, both teachers, could be secured, or two women, the Agency building would be sufficient accommodation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 29, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the resignation of Mr. Baillie, of the Massett Indian Day School, and I note your recommendation that fully qualified white teachers be employed for the coming term. Your suggestion that two lady workers or a man and wife - both teachers - be engaged commends itself to the Department, and I should be grateful if you would see what suitable applicants can be found for this position. In the past, we have asked the Indian agent to get in touch with the Church authorities, who are somewhat interested in this school; but, as I examine our files, I find that the Department for some years has not had any direct correspondence with church officials in connection with this school. It is possible that the activity could be classed now as non-denominational as far as control is concerned. You however, are in a position to know if this is advisable. If so, you may make whatever arrangements you consider best for the engagement of teachers. Unless you see fit, it is not necessary to get in touch with the office of the Bishop of Caledonia. Please let me have an early reply and indicate what salary you think should be allowed.\n\nConcerning the penultimate paragraph of your letter, I have written to Mr. Inspector Cairns for his recommendation. Your suggestion is timely and I am hopeful that arrangements can be made for an inspection by a provincial public school officer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. James Gillet,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI think it quite advisable to leave the Massett Day School apart from Church control. I have written Mr. Cairns asking him to put me in touch with any qualified teachers he could recommend, and also to Inspector Fraser of Prince Rupert. I hope also to get in touch with the teachers Bureau in Victoria.\n\nWith regard to the teachers salary, if I can secure a man and wife both teachers, I would suggest a combined salary of one hundred and eighty dollars, which is equal to what Mr. Baillie and Peter Hill were receiving. If separate teachers are employed, I would suggest one hundred dollars a month each. I take it for granted that house, fuel and light will be provided, the same as for Mr. Baillie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to obtaining teachers for the next school year for the Massett Indian Day School. It is noted that you are taking steps to obtain qualified teachers.\n\nIf the services of a man and his wife, having the necessary qualifications, are obtained, the Department would allow a combined salary of $180 per teaching month. In the event of it being necessary to obtain single teachers, the Department would allow payment at the rate of $100 per teaching month each. Providing the house that was used by the late teacher, Mr. Baillie, is available, the new teachers would also have the use of same, together with fuel. It is considered, however, that light should be provided by the teachers themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Jas.

As mentioned in our letter of July 25th, last, salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month will be allowed to each. Please inform the Department as to the christian name and qualifications of each. I may say that a Miss Stella Shorland, who has a second class certificate with full normal training, was employed last year as teacher at the Kincolith Indian Day School. Is this one of the teachers whom you have engaged for Massett? We hope that these teachers will meet with every success in their work at the Massett School.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the purchase of the firewood required for the teachers' residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-1, part 2)\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter which I received from Alfred Adams re L.T. Baillie. I have been unable to locate Baillie. Mr. Cairns, the School Inspector, does not know his address, so I conclude that he is not now under the Department's employ. It is certainly unfortunate that he should owe an Indian this amount of money. I told Adams that I will not see how the Department could be held responsible for Baillie's debts, but that I would submit his letter for their consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 23rd, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from Alfred Adams with reference to an unpaid account of L. H. Baillie, former teacher at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Baillie is not now in the employ of this Department, and we have no knowledge as to where he is at present located. While agreeing with you that it is unfortunate that Mr. Adams has not been paid the amount due him, this Department is unable to accept any responsibility in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith the Annual Report for the Nesbett, Fox Hill and Shidgate Schools, for the month of May. I am also enclosing Mr. Inspector's letter to the Agent regarding these schools. His remarks on the Nesbett and Shidgate Schools refer to the number of teachers required, expressing the need which the Agent has seen for some time, namely two qualified teachers for Nesbett School, and one for Shidgate. Nesbett will be opened again during the fall, and Shidgate over forty. There will be more in both schools next term.\n\nIf the suggestion for three qualified teachers for the Nesbett school is carried out, it will be necessary to have another room, or at least the departmental original plans called for. I realise that there was not anything provided for in the estimates for 1928-29, to take care of this, so that I suppose the new room could not be added this year. However, the present school could be rearranged so as to make three rooms with very little expense. All that is required is the partition between the large room and the clock room, and the two new doors. The enclosed plan of the present school and a sketch of the alteration will show what I mean. If nothing can be done this year perhaps the old Church could be used as before the new school was built, with a little renovation. It would be temporarily, much more suitable than dismantling the present arrangements in the school.\n\nThe Shidgate school is quite an old building, I believe originally a Church, and a new one will be required in the near future. It is large enough to allow for a temporary partition, so as to accommodate two teachers.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is in getting the attendance large enough to require the number of teachers mentioned, during the months of September, May and June. But it could be gained from the middle of October to the end of April, with little more vigil enforcement of Sec. 10 of the Indian Act. The Shidgate attendance has been good, but the children who are in the village, Nesbett attendance 75% has not been for the schools. The people themselves are taking more interest in school affairs, and I am glad to hear from Mr. Fraser, that if the Indian Schools were conducted along the lines of our White Schools, the results would compare favourably. There would then be no reason why there should not be pupils from these schools taking the Entrance exam every year.\n\nThere would be no necessity for shifting the two teachers for September, or after April. I understand that there are plenty of teachers in B.C. who could be obtained at any time. As far as the present teachers are concerned, Miss Dorothy Sheppard will be coming back, but Miss Sue Sheppard hopes to go to University. Miss Murray will have to return to Shidgate. Sheppard has arrangements to become teacher of replace Miss Sheppard. Murray I suppose Shidgate the United Church will have the privilege of nominating someone for Shidgate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6403, File 828-1, part 2)\nOFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS\n\nPRINCE RUPERT,\n\nMay 23, 1928.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with your request, I found it possible to spend a few hours in your native schools at Skidegate and Massett, after attending to the inspection of my own schools at these points. I beg to give you in a friendly way my finding as follows:\n\nMASSETT:\nThere is here a large building with two good rooms. While the blackboard space is greater than in the Skidegate schoolroom, it is not so great as a modern school requires. Our ideal today is windows on one side of the room and blackboards on the other three sides.\n\nMost of the children were with their parents at the Tow Hill Clan Cannery. At this point I met with the teacher and children and saw enough of the work to assure me that both Miss Stella Shopland and Miss Dorothy Shopland have proceeded in a modern way to instruct the hundred or more pupils in their charge. It would seem that in these young ladies you have efficient, faithful teachers.\n\nWere this a Provincial school, we would employ three qualified teachers. It is our policy to employ a teacher for less than 40 pupils, two for between 40 and 60 and three for between 60 and 120. With the native children it would seem to me that 25 or 30 to a room would be quite sufficient until the schools had attained a higher standing. I do not see how one could look for really efficient work unless at least one more room were added to this building.\n\nMy remarks re attendance, punctuality and library in my report of Skidegate would also apply here.\n\nIn closing, I beg to assure you that having the time at my disposal, it was a pleasure to look more intimately than usual into your interesting schools. At the same time, I should like you to regard this as a friendly criticism and not in any way official.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H. C. Fraser,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, June 29, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Fraser, Public School Inspector, on his inspection of the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools, together with your recommendations regarding teachers and the providing of extra classrooms at each of these schools. The various matters will form the subject of separate communications to you.\n\nRegarding teachers for the Massett School for the next academic year, it is noted that Miss Dorothy Shopland will return and resume duties but that Miss Stella Shopland will attend university. It will be necessary to secure the services of a qualified teacher to succeed Miss Stella Shopland, and you might communicate with Mr. Inspector Cairns or the Public School Inspector, Mr. Fraser, with a view to obtaining a teacher. We would allow the same salary as was paid in the case of Miss Stella Shopland. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you secure should be forwarded for the information and approval of the Department.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion that a third teacher, having the necessary qualifications, be engaged for this school during the periods from October first to the end of April, in order to provide proper teaching facilities for the number of children who attend, I have to say that this matter will have to wait for the present, until we have full information from you as to the cost of fitting up an extra classroom. This question is being dealt with in a separate communication to you.\n\nIn future, when reporting matters requiring attention at the Massett and Skidegate Schools, I have to request that you will deal with the requirements at each of these schools in a separate communication. In this connection, I would refer you to the instructions printed at the head of this letter. This procedure is necessary, in order to facilitate our filing system. When several matters are referred to in one communication, it necessitates the making of copies for each of the files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Miss Lang commenced duties on day. Through Mr. Watson of the Teachers' Bureau in Victoria, I got in touch with Miss Lang personally when on holiday recently, and chose her from among several others. She holds a second class B.C. Certificate. I ask for the Department's approval of this appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMasset, B.C.\nOct. 31st, 1928\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a wire from Miss McSween to the effect that she is unable to take the third classroom in the Massett School, on account of circumstances which have arisen at home. I immediately wired to another teacher who had been recommended to me, but she had meantime got another position. I am leaving for the South tonight, and will get in touch with Mr. Watson of the teachers' Bureau in Victoria, as early as possible with a view to securing a suitable teacher for this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attendance in the Massett school today was One Hundred. The average attendance is always good when the people are in the village. We shall soon be confronted with the problem of the people leaving for Tow Hill, as I understand that the clam cannery there will operate earlier this year than usual.\n\nWhile there is a school at Tow Hill, it cannot accommodate all the children, and apart from that, the attendance is very irregular on account of the people going back and forth between the clam digs. Also, the cannery life is not conducive to good school attendance, as the gidding is at all hours of the day and night, and the homes are usually in a turmoil.\n\nI have been wondering if the Department would give any assistance towards keeping some of the younger school children in Massett. A good clean house can be secured here which will accommodate twenty-five. It was built two years ago, and is in a good location near the school. It is two and a half stories, well planned, and has plenty of windows. It can be rented for fifteen dollars a month. If the Department could allow twelve dollars a month per child, I think the best of food and management could be met. The people themselves would also be expected to provide at least two dollars a month towards board, and also provide bedding, clothing etc. for the children. The owner of the house, Mrs. Henry White, is a good, clean capable woman,(Indian), and is agreeable to being the housekeeper. Other help, for laundry etc., can be secured, as there are several graduates from Coqualeetza, who are well trained along these lines. The cost of this help, including Mrs. White, can be set out of the $12.00 allowance. The actual cost to the Department would be as follows:\n\n$12.00 per month for 25 children.............$300.00\nRent of house..................................15.00\nFuel and light.................................15.00\n\n$330.00\n\nWould the Department consider trying out the above suggestions as an experiment. It would be an encouragement to the people who are so anxious to have their children educated.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to sanction this, I would appreciate a wire, as the cannery is likely to open on February 15th, and the owner of the house would want time to finish off the attic, if the house is to be used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith reports for the Massett and Skidegate Day Schools for the month of November.\n\nAs requested in your letter No. 157-2-1 of September 30th, I have to say that Peter Hill was taken on steadily as third teacher, on November 11th. Previously to this he had taught five days in the Tow Hill school. I will submit a voucher in his favour at the end of this quarter. Judging from the attendance of other years, I do not think that Hill's services will be required after the end of January, as some of the people begin to leave the village then. Also, at least seven pupils will be leaving for Coqualeetza before Christmas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the appointment of a third teacher for the winter months at the Massett Indian Day School, and recommending that the services of Peter Hill, an educated Indian who formerly taught this school, be engaged.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Peter Hill as third teacher. As recommended by you, it is to be understood that he will only be employed when the attendance reaches 75 at the Massett School, or when there are 15 or more children at Tow Hill this Fall. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $4 per teaching day, which will include payment for his services as truant officer during the time he teaches. Please inform him of his appointment and arrange with him to begin duties and to continue as teacher during the period considered timely by you. Besides his teaching duties, it is expected that he will also give the necessary attention to the work as truant officer and see that there is a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age. You might inform the Department later of the date on which he begins duties, and when the quarterly returns from this school are being forwarded it should be definitely stated thereon the number of days for which he should receive payment for his services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jas. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.157-2-1, of August 14th, re securing the services of a third teacher for the Nassett Day School. I may say that I think it better this year to engage Peter Hill, when needed.\n\nThe reason for the above suggestion is, that it will be hard to tell when the Nassett people will all be in the village again, as the clam cannery at Tow Hill will be in operation this Fall. Other years it was open in the Spring only. If it opens again in February as last year, it would not be worth while to engage an outside teacher for the Nassett School.\n\nI would like therefore, to have the Department's permission to engage Peter Hill, an educated Indian who taught in the school several years ago, whenever the Nassett School becomes overcrowded, or at Tow Hill if the people remain there long enough to make it worth while. There are about twenty families there now.\n\nI would suggest paying Hill four dollars a day, for teaching days, and make him truant officer during the time he teaches. It would be understood that he would only be hired when the attendance reaches seventy-five, at the Nassett School, or when there are fifteen or more children at Tow Hill this Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 14, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department that you have engaged the services of Mrs. Mary Ashmore as second teacher for the Massett Indian Day School for the coming school year, and stating the experience which she possesses. In reply I have to inform you that the appointment of Mrs. Ashmore is approved, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. I assume that Miss Mitchell, who performed duties as second teacher last year, is not returning. Mrs. Ashmore should begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, on September 2nd, next.\n\nPlease advise the Department whether it will be necessary to obtain the services of a third teacher for this school for the period from about November 1st, next, to the end of March, following. If so, you should nominate in due time the services of a suitable teacher and inform the Department as to her name, qualifications, etc. The salary allowed will be at the same rate as was paid for the services of a third teacher last year, provided her qualifications are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Jas. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have engaged Mrs. Mary Ashmore as second teacher for the Massett Day School, for the coming school year. Mrs. Ashmore taught three years in the Indian School at Kitwanga, where I understand that she gave satisfaction. She is elderly, and for this reason I think she will find it more congenial with the other teacher, Miss Roode, than a younger person would. With her experience at Kitwanga, Mrs. Ashmore should give good satisfaction at Massett.\n\nI trust that this appointment meets with the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. Mrs. Ashmore has been engaged at a salary of One Hundred dollars per month, for ten teaching months.\nOttawa, February 1, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, recommending that a few children be kept at Massett during the next few months, so that they might attend school. The Department is glad to have this definite proposal and, under ordinary circumstances, would be glad to give the experiment a trial. At the present time, however, the Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned, and it is quite impossible to authorize any special expenditure during the next few months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

M. Kerr, assistant teacher, Massett School, winter months, approved, salary ninety dollars per teaching month. May commence duties when considered advisable by you.\"\n\nYou may therefore arrange with Miss Kerr to begin duties when you consider it timely owing to the increased attendance.

BUSKARD,\n\nOwing to increased attendance, it is necessary to engage a second teacher for the winter months at the Massett Indian Day School, on the Massett Reserve, Queen Charlotte Islands (Electoral District of Skeena), B.C.\n\nThe Department has always permitted Right Reverend G. A. Rix, Bishop of Caledonia, to nominate the teachers for this school, and His Lordship recommends that Miss K. M. Kerr take charge of the second room. Miss Kerr holds a first class certificate and is highly recommended.\n\nAs the services of this teacher will be required in the near future, I should appreciate your concurrence in the appointment of Miss Kerr.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI have today received a letter from Bishop Rip submitting applications of three teachers for the position of Primary Teacher at Massett Indian Day School, and I further from his remarks that he wishes me to make the selection although he favours Miss H. M. Harris of Vander B.C. She has a first-class certificate and is recommended by various parties.\n\nI would suggest that if the Department agrees to the appointment of Miss Harris that they were immediately to me, providing they approve of the second teacher assuming duties at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant, I have to say that, as soon as you hear from Bishop Rix, you should forward to the Department full particulars regarding the teacher he nominates. If it is necessary to engage her at once, you may do so, pending our approval. In such case, you should, of course, advise the definite date on which she begins duties.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to approve hiring a temporary teacher before Bishop Rix nominates one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI find that the situation at the Massett Indian Day School is such that a second teacher will be required to take duty on October 1st.\n\nIn recent years a number of the families have gone to Naden Harbour and elsewhere in the Fall, but this year it appears that the majority of them will stay in the village as there is no employment in sight, to take them away.\n\nThe daily average at present is forty-two, and the number that should attend 66, most of whom will be in attendance by October.\n\nI have written Bishop Rix, asking him to make his nomination of a teacher as soon as possible. However, as the Bishop is away at present, there may be some delay. I would therefore ask the Department to wire me permission to hire a local teacher as substitute should the situation require it. The Bishop's nominee could then be engaged to take duty on November 1st.\n\nI would suggest a salary of $4.00 per day for the temporary teacher. It would be understood that she would not be taken on permanently, and only if the attendance requires it, until the Bishop's nominee starts duty Nov. 1st. I would only consider hiring a temporary teacher if the daily average is over forty, or over.\n\nOf course, if the Bishop's nomination is already in the hands of the Department, I would ask permission by wire to engage the permanent teacher at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Gillett\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Indian Agent,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that Miss Eileen Gibson, teacher in the junior room at Massett Indian Day School, will not be tenoning after May 31st, and will not be on the pay-list of the Department after that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 31, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the salary allowed for Miss Gibson, teacher of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the amount mentioned in official letter of the 6th ultimo, viz., $90 a teaching month, is all that can be provided at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\nSir,\n\nThis is to inform the Department that Miss Eileen Gibson began duties at Massett Indian Day-School on January 7th.\n\nYour letter No.157-2-1 of Dec.oth,1935 states that Miss Gibson's salary will be at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month. This to my mind is unfair, as Miss Kent, in the same school and the teachers at Skidegate are each receiving $100.00 per month. Miss Gibson has 35 pupils at present and while her class is in the same building as Miss Kent, she is not considered as an assistant. I have found it is the best policy to have all teachers on an equal basis, and they are not considered as senior and junior teachers. Taking this into consideration and also the fact that Miss Gibson's services may only be required for five months I would strongly recommend that her salary be $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, regarding the appointment of a second teacher for the Massett Indian Day School as from the first of January, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Eileen Gibson, who has been nominated by His Lordship Bishop Rix. Miss Gibson is to begin duties as from January 1st, 1935. It is understood that her services will be required only for a period of approximately five months. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month. Please advise His Lordship.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

The Bishop says that Miss Gibson has proper B.C. qualifications, and is an unusually fine young woman. She is the daughter of Dr. Gibson of Prince Rupert.\n\nIt is not likely that a second teacher will be necessary in the Nesbett school until school opens in January.

I have already advised Miss Kent that I would submit her name to Ottawa, for the appointment.\n\nThere is not sufficient time now, for the Department to advise me by letter before September 1st, and I would therefore suggest a telegraphed reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I would ask, therefore, that the Department approve of this appointment.\n\nIt will be necessary for Miss Aylwin to begin duties on November 1st, as by that date there should be over fifty in attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.Gillett\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 10, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing the June quarter return of the Massett Indian Day School. In this connection it is noted that Mrs. Mary Ashmore, the second teacher, will not be returning when the school reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed Mrs. Ashmore, and I have, therefore, to request that you will give this matter your prompt attention and nominate the services of a teacher. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. If the services of a qualified teacher are obtained, salary will be allowed at the same rate as was previously paid in the case of Mrs. Ashmore, viz., $100 per teaching month.\n\nRegarding your report on your inspection of this school for the month of June, last, in which you recommend that school be taught five and a half days each week and the Christmas and Easter holidays dispensed with, and the school closed for the holidays around the 15th of May, I have to say that the Department does not approve of holidays being taken other than at the regular periods. School should reopen after the summer holidays on or about September 1st, and the usual holidays taken at Christmas and Easter, and the school closed for the summer holidays at the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJas. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith the Massett Day School report for the quarter ended June 30th.\n\nMrs. Ashmore, who was teaching at Fox Hill closed her school on June 5th, when the canning season was over. After she returned to Massett, she and Miss Roode took turn about teaching the few children who remained here. As the attendance fell lower on account of the people leaving the village, both teachers left on June 27th for the vacation.\n\nMrs. Ashmore will not be returning, but Miss Roode intends to resume her duties on September 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Massett Indian Day School has a rather neglected look. There are two fire extinguishers which I asked should be taken out of the corner of a spare room and put one in each of the used schoolrooms. This request was made about four years ago when I first visited the school. I find these extinguishers in exactly the same place now. I have instructed Miss Kowalik that these extinguishers placed one in each of the classrooms, now in use. There is dust in several of the rooms and the floors are quite too clean. I found old sacks in another corner. In general I asked that all the work such about the school be cleaned out and burned at the end of this school term. The floors are washed three times a year by Indians. I understand, I do not believe they do the work properly, and I do not believe they are supervised in it. In fact the whole school requires a thorough cleaning now.\n\nThe attendance in September and June is reported by the teacher to be highly irregular, some children coming one day and others another. No proper work could be done under these circumstances. I would recommend that this Massett Indian Day School be not opened in September but on the first Monday in October each year, and that at that time the classrooms be put into use with two teachers, the second teacher taking all children in Grade 1. Later on when the school regains its proper standing and the children are better classified through the Grades the Junior Teacher should have all Grade 1 and Grade 2 at least. I would further recommend that the school be closed at the end of May each year, the two teachers, leaving at the same time.\n\nI have reason to think that the Indians in Massett are rather out of hand at the present time. I understand that some of them are engaged in the production of intoxicants, and that Indians are often drunk on the Reserve. I certainly do not like the idea of the teachers living on the Reserve so many miles from white help, and I would ask the Department to accept my recommendation for the opening and closing of school in future so as to insure that the two teachers are there and not one attempting to live by herself as has been the case in the past. The teacher's house requires repair work inside to keep it in a sanitary state.\n\nEXTRACT FROM MR. BARRY'S LETTER DATED MAY 26TH, 1936, ACCOMPANYING THE ABOVE REPORT.\n\nIn forwarding this report I particularly wish to draw the attention of the Department to my recommendation that school be only opened here from October to May inclusive; but that the two teachers be employed for this time, as I certainly do not consider it safe for one teacher to live alone in the Indian Village some three miles from the \"White\" village of New Massett.\n1205 Comox,\nVancouver, B.C.\nJuly 13, 1936.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nVictoria, Oct.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby resign my position as teacher at the Masset Indian Day School, B.C., etc.\n\nIf you have no one in view I would suggest that my assistant carry on this term.

In emergency, I engaged the services of a local teacher (Mr. Simpson) to substitute for Miss Gibson. Your approval of this action is appreciated.\n\nAnother thing, as soon as I get so going to your notice, but there are too many of children under Miss Gibson, she finds it difficult to sit in the classroom without discipline. If we lose her class, will it be possible to retain the services of Mr. Simpson for two months?

It is also noted that Miss Gibson has begun duties owing to the fact that the Indians are residing on the reserve.\n\nThe appointment of Miss Gibson is approved and she will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire, which you should have Miss Gibson complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nMiss Gibson's salary for September and October will be paid at the end of October.

Gibson to the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nFollowing the resignation of Miss Kent, Miss Kerr, who was second teacher last year, will now take the position of senior teacher and Miss Gibson has been nominated by Bishop Rix as the second teacher. The Massett cannery being in operation this season on the reserve, most all of the Indians are already in the village. It was considered best that Miss Gibson should take up her duties immediately. As I am only acting temporarily with regard to the Queen Charlotte Agency, naturally, I was not aware that the second teacher was not employed on full time.\n\nIn regard to Miss Gibson's qualifications, these have already been forwarded to the Department in her own application, which was attached to my letter of the 11th ultimo. I am sorry not to be able to state the number of months the services of a second teacher will be required. This will depend entirely upon the length of time all the Indians are in the village. As stated, Miss Gibson has already taken up her duties at Massett, and I hope to be able to visit the Agency again shortly and will have an opportunity of visiting the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You are, no doubt, aware of the number of months that her services would be required. Please get in touch with Right Reverend G. A. Mix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, Prince Rupert, B.C., and ask him to nominate a second teacher for the Massett School for the period such teacher is required. If he approves of Miss Gibson being employed, this Department has no objection.

Although this visit was not reported, I was in constant apprehension, and when December came, my nerves were in such an unsettled state, that I decided that my only course was to resign.\n\nI was very reluctant to do this, as I was very interested and attached to my work at the school.

Berry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached please find a short report received from School Inspector Barry on the resignation of Miss Ker, teacher, Massett Indian Day School.\n\nI have read Inspector Barry's report of May 28th, 1936, and would recommend that this day school be opened and closed on the dates there mentioned in order that at no time would it be necessary for one teacher to live alone on the Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor some years past, one of the teachers at the Massett Indian Day School has been engaged for the full academic year and the second teacher for a period of eight or nine months.\n\nOn the recommendation of Inspector Barry, it has been decided that, starting in the academic year 1937-38, two teachers will be employed for a period of eight months only. Consequently, the Massett Indian Day School should re-open after the summer holidays on October 1st, 1937, and close on May 31st, 1938. During this period, two teachers will be employed.\n\nThe Department desires to deal fairly with the present teachers and, consequently, both of them may remain until June 30th, 1937. The senior teacher will be allowed the usual salary of $100 a teaching month and the teacher of the junior room $90 a teaching month.\n\nAbout the middle of June, you should ascertain from the present teachers whether or not they desire to be re-engaged for the eight month period the school will be open during the academic year 1937-38. As soon as you have a definite reply from them, you should advise the Department in order that we may be in a position to take whatever action is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. T. Phillips, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nMasset, B. C.\nOttawa, February 11, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn official telegram of January 25th, last, the Department approved the appointment of Mrs. Singer as substitute teacher at the Massett Indian Day School during the illness of Miss Gibson. This was recommended in your letter of January 14th.\n\nIn order that the necessary payments can be made, the Department requires the following information as soon as possible:\n\n(1) The exact date on which Miss Gibson found it necessary to give up duties owing to illness.\n\n(2) The date on which Mrs. Singer began duties as substitute teacher.\n\nYou should also state whether or not Miss Gibson has resumed duties and, if so, the exact date on which she did so. In the event of her still being unable to teach the school, you might let me know the approximate date on which she expects to return to duty.\n\nMiss Gibson was allowed salary for the month of January, but her name is being removed from the February pay list. The necessary salary adjustments for Mrs. Singer and Miss Gibson will be made when your reply to this letter is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. T.

File No 157-2-1, together with copy of letter the New Massett Community Club.\n\nThe above matter was taken up with the President (Dr Dunn) and Secretary (Mr H. Frost) and both admitted it was a mistake and should not have been sent to the Department, they informed me that this was taken up last Fall when the teachers were away, from school on their holidays, and that the Minister proposed the letter to the Department stating the conditions that existed at that time on the Reserve.\n\nSince my arrival here there has been no cases of breaking into houses, or stealing on the Reserve, and no complaints regarding this, the teacher reported a youth peering into the window one night in February, the native police have kept strict watch for a return visit by the intruder, but nothing since has happened, I may add that to date, the behaviour of the Indians on this Reserve is excellent.\n\nI interviewed both the Teachers regarding their residence on the Reserve, and both agreed that they did not want to live off the Reserve, they are interested in several social activities, Sunday school work, etc., in the evenings with the younger Indians, they find they can live much cheaper on the Reserve than at New Massett. They were surprised that such action was taken by the New Massett Community Club without their knowledge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.T.

Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast January I received a second letter of welcome when I started my work at Old Man's Indian Day School. At that time I did not feel in a position to answer anything concerning my work as I was so new there.\n\nDuring the six months at the school I gave a great deal of thought to my work and found that there are two main problems in our work. In the first place, we have splendid equipment and books for the children at school but not sufficient teachers. Last winter we had...\nover fifty children of school age and just two teachers. Indian children seem to need more individual instruction than do white children. Next winter we expect over a hundred children and we hope to have three teachers for at least five months.\n\nIt would also be a great help for the children to learn the old Indian handicrafts. There are a few old people in the village who do very clever work. My fellow teacher and I would like to suggest that these old people may be paid a small amount to instruct the young people in this valuable work.\n\nI thank you for your helpful letter.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nPhyllis Moon\nPrincipal of Old Manette Indian Day School,\nOld Manette, B.C.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1937.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to conditions at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nFor your information, I enclose a copy of official letter of the 10th instant, addressed to Acting Indian Agent Phillips.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Bishop Rix, of Prince Rupert, could be requested to do this at an early date.\n\nYou will remember that I have recommended that a third teacher be placed at this school to take charge of an intermediate room.

Major MacKay informed me by letter in September that you had allowed me a salary of one hundred dollars per teaching month. I am not aware of any mistake he has made or if there has been a cut in salaries since September 1st which I have not been informed.

Smith,\nTeacher Massey Indian School\nDear Miss Smith:\n\nThe Department has approved of your appointment as Senior teacher at the Massett Indian Day School. You will be allowed salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month. You are aware, I believe, that the Massett School will be in session from October 1, 1940, to May 31, 1941, a period of eight months, during the coming academic year. You should, therefore, arrange to be at Massett to open school on October 1st next.\n\nPlease complete the enclosed staff questionnaire and return it direct to the Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, as soon as possible after you commence duties, in accordance with the instructions at the foot of the form.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Rev. G.A. Rix, Bishop of Caledonia, of Miss Kate A. Smith, B.A., as teacher of Division 1 of the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Smith's qualifications were outlined in the first paragraph of my letter of August 16th quoted above but so far it would not appear that any reply from the Department has reached this office.\n\nMiss Smith relinquished her appointment as Senior teacher at the St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, in order to attend the University of B.C. during the past session to obtain her Academic Certificate in this Province. I am informed by Inspector Barry that she has been highly successful as Senior teacher at St. George's and that he considers she is likely to be just as successful in charge of the Senior Division of the Massett Indian Day School. I would, therefore, recommend that the appointment of Miss Kate A. Smith as teacher of Division 1 of the Massett Indian Day School be approved.\n\nShould the Department authorize the appointment of Miss Smith as recommended above, I should be glad to have a reply by air mail and to know what salary she will be allowed in her new position. The Department was previously informed that Mrs. Smiley is remaining as teacher of Division 2 at the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Smiley, teacher of the junior room at the above named school, had been transferred to the Gitlakdamix School.\n\nThe Department has now been informed that Mrs. Smiley has refused this transfer and has decided to remain at Massett. Her name should be again placed on the paylist for October and her salary will be the same as that formerly paid her at this school.\n\nThe appointment of Miss Kate Smith as senior teacher at the Massett School has also been approved. She should be paid at the rate of $100.00 per teaching month from October 1, 1940. Copy of letter of appointment in her case is attached and questionnaire will be forwarded when it is received.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nReplying to your letter of August 13th, I beg to advise that Mrs. Smiley has decided to remain at Massett and continue as our teacher there.\n\nIt is also understood that Bishop Rix has nominated Miss Kate Smith, B.A., as senior teacher at Massett and I would appreciate being advised if the appointment has been approved. Miss Smith is a graduate of the University of Manitoba and holds in addition a B.C. Academic Certificate.

The second paragraph of your letter is not very clear. Are we to understand that Mrs. Smiley will remain at Massett?\n\nI note the information contained in the first paragraph of your letter regarding Mr. Kinley. In this regard I have today received a telegram from Rt. Rev. C.A. Rix, Bishop of Caledonia, and enclose, for your information, a copy of our reply.\n\nWill it be possible to secure a qualified teacher to take charge of the Gitlakdamix School during the academic year 1940-41 if we dispense with the services of Mr. Kinley? If it is not possible to secure a qualified teacher it may be necessary to continue him for another year. It would be appreciated if you would give this matter your careful consideration and let me have your reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

T. Phillips, the resignation of Miss A. Saunders, the teacher of the senior room. As the transfer of Mrs. E. I.

I would appreciate your consulting the church authorities and forwarding their nomination and your recommendation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M.

Consequently, no further salary should be paid to her at the Massett School.\n\nThe Department has also received and accepted the resignation of Miss A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Massett Indian Day School inspected on May 30, 1940.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend that a third teacher be authorized for the next year. It was impossible to fill this third teaching position during the past year as qualified teachers could not be obtained. The future of the Crab Cannery at Haden Harbour is most uncertain. It is quite possible that this particular cannery may be moved to Massett. In any case I believe that to cut down expenses the school should operate for the coming year with only two teachers.\nAGENT'S REPORT ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY FOR MARCH 1940.\n\nThe average attendance at the Massett Indian Day school was as follows: Senior class 32.92 and the Junior class, 28.11. At the Skidegate Day school the average was Senior class 21.5, Junior class 24.47. Slate carving and basketry is progressing nicely at the Skidegate school and basketry is very good at the Massett school.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nAGENCY'S REPORT ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY FOR FEB. 1940.\n\nThe average attendance at the Massett Indian Day school was as follows, senior class 42.71 and the junior class 34.41. At the Skidegate Day School the average was senior class 22 and the junior class 20.76.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nAt the Massett reserve, I paid two visits to the day school also had several interviews with Dr. Dunn and the Field Matron, during the month community work has been done, levelling and grading also graveling on the roads, the second house this year is being built, size about 39' x 26' with brick chimney, good progress is being made on the new boat (Seiner) being built on the reserve and several row boats are also being built. Council meeting was held, and several matters were taken up some of which was Indian fishing rights, suggestions for Dolphins for mooring purposes at the North Island (Langara I.R.) Fishing grounds, also lights at the entrance of Lucy Island (near Perry Pass) together with other suggestions for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nB. T. Phillips,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the Council meetings held during this month at the Massett and Skidegate Reserves, I was asked to write the Department with a view to getting a nine months school term this year (to the end of June instead of May).\n\nThe majority of the women and their children of the Massett Reserve were on the Reserve last year until the end of June, working at the Crab Cannery, (on the Reserve), again this year the Cannery is operating, and will commence in March or April, and will run until the salmon fishing starts.\n\nAt the Skidegate Reserve also the men folk were are working at the Pacofi cannery, or in the district, also a number working at the Alliford Bay Air Port, their families being on the Reserve,\n\nIf it is at all possible, I would like to recommend that the Children of both the Massett and Skidegate schools be allowed to remain at school until the end of June this year.\n\nI have attached petition handed to me by the Council, from the families having children in school, but owing to it being so late in being brought to my notice, I did not wait to receive a petition from the Massett Reserve, as the boat service to these Islands are so uncertain, owing to bad weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.T.

The arrangement however, you will note, is for this year only.\n\nI trust that the action taken here will meet with the Department's approval.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Phillips,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\nI should be glad to know if you would recommend that both divisions of each of the above schools be continued in operation during June 1942, or if it would be sufficient to operate an un-graded school of one division at each of these schools during that month.\n\nIt will be necessary for you to consult the Teachers at both Massett and Skidegate with a view of ascertaining if they are willing to continue their work there during June. Should it not be necessary to operate both divisions at each of these schools during June, I should be glad to know which teacher you would recommend be employed to conduct the un-graded school in each village mentioned above, if such a school be authorized.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that Inspector Barry some years ago recommended that the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day Schools be operated on an eight months' basis as from October 1st to May 31st, yearly, as he was entirely dissatisfied with the attendance at these schools during the months of September and June. Inspector Barry is still extremely doubtful that the attendance during June at either Massett or Skidegate would justify the operation of even one un-graded one room school, and the Department has made it quite clear that permission to keep these schools operating during June 1942 depends entirely upon the satisfactory average attendance.\n\nWill you please consider this matter with care and let me have your assistance with regard to attendance, and your definite recommendation as to the type of school needed in order that I may again communicate with the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 16th, 1942, with regard to the Schools in this Agency remaining open until the end of June of this year.\n\nI am sorry that I sent the above matter direct to the Department, but in conversation with you on my last visit to Vancouver, I understood you to say that certain matters could be taken up with the Department, however, I will in future see that matters of the above nature will pass through your Office.\n\nReferring to the fourth paragraph of your letter, I should have mentioned that the Salmon fishing usually starts about the beginning of July, but last year very few families left the Reserves for North Island, and according to the both Councils they will not be going up there this year, the Crab Cannery at the Massett I.R. will be operating, and several families now in Prince Rupert will be returning to work in the Cannery, and digging clams on the beaches, this operation may go on until the middle of the summer.\n\nAt the Skidegate Reserve, they are starting in the Dog fishing (for livers) about the end of May and will continue until the end of July this year as the price of $1.75 per lb is over twice that was paid last year, which was 5\u00a2 per lb. and good money can be made at the above price, the fishing is in the district, so that the families will be on the Reserves.\n\nI have consulted both the Massett and Skidegate teachers with regard to the total enrolment expected during the month of June 1942, and at the Massett school it was expected that an enrolment of 20 in the Senior grade and 35 in the Junior grade, (possibly more) at the Skidegate school, it is expected that there would be an enrolment of about 30 in the Senior grade, and 24 in the Junior grade.\n\nI would like to recommend that both divisions in both schools be continued in operation during the month of June, 1942, and that all teachers be allowed to conduct their respective classes during that period.\nIn consultation with the teachers of both the Massett and Skidegate schools, all teachers were willing to continue their work during the month of June, 1942, if the above schools be continued in operation.\n\nSince Inspector Barry visited the above schools, the Crab Cannery has operated on the Massett Reserve, (which used to be at Naden Harbour) also at Skidegate, Dog fishing for livers, has started in the district which keeps the families at their Reserve, also several employed at the Air Port and logging camp,\n\nI have just received a phone call from the Field Nation at Skidegate informing me that a meeting of the parents or school children was held, with the teachers in attendance, assuring them of a good attendance during the month of June, 1942.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"B.

Phillips, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Phillips requesting that the day schools on the Massett and Skidegate Reserves remain open for a period of nine months instead of eight months during the current academic year. The following is an extract from the Agent's letter:\n\n\"The majority of the women and their children of the Massett Reserve were on the Reserve last year until the end of June, working at the Crab Cannery. (on the Reserve), again this year the Cannery is operating, and will commence in March or April, and will run until the salmon fishing starts.\n\n\"At the Skidegate Reserve also the men folk are working at the Pacofi cannery, or in the district, also a number working at the Alliford Bay Air Port, their families being on the Reserve.\n\n\"If it is at all possible, I would like to recommend that the children of both the Massett and Skidegate schools be allowed to remain at school until the end of June this year.\"\n\nProvided a satisfactory enrolment and average attendance can be assured, the Department has no objection to having these schools remain in operation during the month of June, 1942. I should, therefore, appreciate your communicating with the Agent with regard to this matter and advising what action you have instructed him to take.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.M.

Eight dollars were realized, this amount and one dollar from the children's school Junior Red Cross Bank were sent to headquarters to be divided between the Crippled Children Fund and the fund for General War Services.\n\nThe children are already planning to hold a programme of school numbers around Easter time, and to sell ice cream at the sports grounds on May 24th., the proceeds from these undertakings will be sent towards the Junior Red Cross Funds.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nB.T.

If my application meets with the favor of Bishop Kix, I hope to be advised by you or him as to when and where you wish me to come to British Columbia.

I wish to apply for the position.\n\nI am thirty years of age. I have taught seven years in rural and graded schools in Saskatchewan. I have a permanent First Class Certificate and am, at present, taking a summer course at the university here to obtain a Superior First Class degree.\n\nI am interested in organized sports and physical training and possess a certificate for the latter.\n\nI am a Protestant - a member of the United Church. I have had considerable experience in Sunday School work and for several years have been in charge of a Canadian Girl in Training group. If my duties should include work along these lines I will be quite pleased to act accordingly.\n\nI have lived near Indians for some years and so I have a first hand knowledge of the type of work that is carried on in Indian Day Schools. I realize the singularity and responsibility of this position and am prepared to co-operate to the greatest of my ability.\n\nI am married and I have a six year old daughter whom I would want to keep with me. If Miss Hannington is chosen as the primary teacher this arrangement is very agreeable to her.\n\nI would appreciate your consideration of my application. If it is of interest to you please wire me at the above address.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Mrs I. Sutherland.\nMr. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that a teacher is required for the Massett Indian Day School of Queen Charlotte Island; I wish to apply for the position.\n\nI am twenty-two years old and have two years teaching experience. I have a Saskatchewan First Class Certificate which includes Art and Music as well as the basic school subjects.\n\nBesides this, I have certificates for Playground Exercises Training; two Saskatchewan University Courses, Art and Primary Methods, and I am at present attending St. John Ambulance First Aid course.\n\nThe Art and Primary Methods courses should be especially suitable for this type of school as it includes handcraft such as clay modelling, weaving, soap carving and such construction, as well as sketching and formal teaching technicalities.\n\nI am a Protestant, and I expect that duties in this school would include some Sunday School teaching; I am perfectly willing to do this.\n\nI realize the responsibility of this position; also that it is unusual. But I am prepared to meet the situation, and am applying to you because I am very sincerely interested in teaching primary classes of this type. I have recently spoken to a Saskatchewan teacher of a \"Day\" Indian School and I know what to expect.\n\nIf my Certificate qualifies me to teach in British Columbia I would appreciate your considering of my application. If so, would you please wire me right away at the above address, or, after July 30th at Wild Rose, Sask.\n\nThank you very much,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Miss) Mary V.

Hannington for the Junior Room, and Mrs. I. Sutherland for the Senior Room.\n\nIt will be noted that both these teachers are in possession of Saskatchewan first-class certificates and appear to be fully qualified for the positions. Miss Hannington has already been nominated by Bishop Rix and the application of Mrs. Sutherland is now before him and I expect his nomination in the very near future. As teachers are almost impossible to get, I have taken the liberty of assuming that the nomination of Mrs. Sutherland will be forthcoming.\n\nSubject to the approval of Bishop Rix of Mrs. Sutherland, I would recommend the appointment of both these teachers; at a salary of $90.00 per teaching month for Miss Hannington, and a salary of $95.00 per teaching month for Mrs. Sutherland. The salary formerly paid to the Senior teacher of this School was $100.00 per month but, in setting the amount at $95.00, which has been accepted by Mrs. Sutherland, it will give us an opportunity to meet a demand for an increase the following term should this be made.\n\nIn order that I may have these teachers report for duty by September 1st, it would be appreciated if you would kindly advise me of your approval, subject, of course, to the Bishop's nomination of the Senior teacher.\n\nD.

As you are aware, the Bishop has from time to time endeavoured to have his missionaries appointed as teachers in the Skeena Agency and as they have no professional training in this respect their appointment has generally been opposed as once the position is filled in this manner it is unlikely that any continued effort would be made to secure a qualified teacher.

Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nQUARTERLY REPORT ENDING JUNE 30th, 1945, ON QUEEN CHARLOTTE AGENCY\n\nEducation:\n\nAt the Massett school the attendance dropped down sharply towards the end of the term, this is owing to the families moving off the Reserve to the fishing grounds the canneries. I visited this Reserve ten times during the quarter, visiting the school and teachers residence, where repairs and work was being completed, the senior class pupils who sent in drawings to the Victory Poster Contest at the Stanford University U.S.A. made a very good showing, there being one pupil who received a third prize, and six others who won certificates of merit. The Natives of this Agency appear to be very fond of drawing and music, some very good drawings were on display in both schools during my visits.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nDuring the last school year considerable friction developed between Miss L.J. Brunton, teacher of this school, and Mr. Indian Agent Phillips due largely to Miss Brunton's interference in matters entirely outside the scope of her duties as teacher. It is just possible, however, that her real aim was to be helpful. Miss Brunton has had long experience as a teacher and the Inspector's reports on her work at Massett have been favourable. It is doubtful, however, if she enjoys good health, a condition which may not have been helped by the wet, cold climate on the Queen Charlotte Islands. I had a long talk with Miss Brunton following her recent return to Vancouver from Massett and concluded that it would not be in the best interests of the school and our administration there, nor yet her own, for her to return and I would, therefore, recommend that she be not engaged to teach at Massett this coming year. It may be possible to place Miss Brunton in one of the schools much less remote than Massett, and if an opportunity to do so arises she will be advised and the matter referred to the nominating religious denomination.\n\nMrs. J. Fray, employed as junior teacher at the Massett school, should be re-engaged for the coming school year. Her record is quite satisfactory and she is prepared to return. I should say that an increase of $5.00 per month in her salary is indicated and I would so recommend.\n\nPlease let me have an early reply.\n\nD.M.

Brunton as teacher of the Senior Room of the above school effective July 1st, 1945 and no further payment of salary should be made to her.\n\nIt has been decided to increase the salary of Mrs. J. Fray teacher of the Junior Room from $90.00 to $95.00 a teaching month effective September 1st, 1945. I am requesting her to complete and forward a new T.D. 1 form.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nTO THE EMPLOYER:\n\nINCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS AND FAMILY ALLOWANCE PAYMENTS\n\nFrom salaries and wages paid after 15th July 1945, employers are required to deduct, besides deductions under the Table of Tax Deductions, additional amounts to avoid duplication of benefits for dependent children under The Family Allowances Act and the Income War Tax Act.\n\nThe additional amounts to be deducted will be determined by reference to the Percentages shown below, having regard to the information furnished by the employee on form letter TDL-X, a copy of which is attached. Employers must retain the said completed form letters on file for inspection by officers of this Division.\n\nEmployers should advise all employees who have made any claims on forms T.D.I for dependent children under 18 years of age that they must complete one of the said form letters if any application has been made for Family Allowance payments in respect of such children. Employers are also requested to make copies of these instructions available to the employees.\n\nSupplies of the form letter TDL-X, and of these instructions, may be obtained from the office of any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\nCalculation of Additional Deduction\n\n1. From the table below, determine the percentage appropriate to\n   (a) the single or married status, and\n   (b) the annual earnings over $700, as shown in paragraphs 2 and 3, respectively, of the employee's letter.\n\n2. Apply this percentage to the monthly Family Allowance payment shown in paragraph 1 of the employee's letter. The result is the additional deduction to be made each month if the employee is paid monthly.\n\n3. If your pay period is other than monthly, determine the appropriate deduction to be made each pay day as follows\u2014\n   (a) If you pay twice each month, divide the monthly deduction by 2.\n   (b) If you pay weekly, deduct 2/9 of the monthly deduction.\n   (c) If you pay every two weeks, deduct 4/9 of the monthly deduction.\n   (d) If you pay every day, divide the monthly deduction by 26.\n\nPercentages of Family Allowances to be Offset by Additional Deductions from Salary or Wages\n\n| SINGLE STATUS | MARRIED OR EQUIVALENT STATUS |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| ANNUAL EARNINGS | PERCENTAGE OF FAMILY ALLOWANCES TO BE DEDUCTED | ANNUAL EARNINGS | PERCENTAGE OF FAMILY ALLOWANCES TO BE DEDUCTED |\n| $700 - $800 | 15% | $1,250 - $1,400 | 10% |\n| $800 - $900 | 20% | $1,400 - $1,600 | 20% |\n| $900 - $1,000 | 30% | $1,600 - $1,800 | 30% |\n| $1,000 - $1,100 | 40% | $1,800 - $2,000 | 40% |\n| $1,100 - $1,200 | 50% | $2,000 - $2,200 | 50% |\n| $1,200 - $1,300 | 60% | $2,200 - $2,400 | 60% |\n| $1,300 - $1,400 | 70% | $2,400 - $2,600 | 70% |\n| $1,400 - $1,500 | 80% | $2,600 - $2,800 | 80% |\n| $1,500 - $1,600 | 90% | $2,800 - $3,000 | 90% |\n| $1,600 | 100% | $3,000 | 100% |\n\nNote.\u2014For single persons with annual incomes between $900 and $700 and for married persons with annual incomes between $1,200 and $1,250, the Income Tax adjustment will be comparatively small, being generally less than 10 per cent of the Family Allowance payments. Therefore, to avoid further calculations and probable over-deductions, the tax deduction of single persons in these income brackets will not be changed but any small amount of deduction will be recovered with their Income Tax Return.\n\nRemittances of Additional Deductions\n\nThe amounts deducted in accordance with the instructions contained in this letter shall form part of, and shall be remitted and otherwise dealt with in the same manner as, the deductions required under the Table of Tax Deductions.\n\nMinimum Salary or Wage Subject to Deductions\n\nTo avoid possible hardship, under any special set of circumstances that may arise, employers may refrain from making the deductions in any pay period when the gross salary or wage due to the employee is less than the appropriate amount shown below\u2014\n\n| SINGLE | MARRIED |\n|--------|---------|\n| Daily | $2.15 | $3.90 |\n| Weekly | $13.00 | $5.50 |\n| Bi-weekly | $26.00 | $7.00 |\n| Semi-monthly | $28.00 | $51.25 |\n| Monthly | $56.00 | $102.50 |\n\nEffect of Claim in Monthly Family Allowance Payments\n\nThis filing of further form letters TDL-X amending the amount shown in paragraph 1 thereof may be avoided, without interfering with the substantial correctness of the deductions, by having the employee enter in paragraph 1 the average monthly Family Allowance payment expected to be received during 1945.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation.\nDear Mrs. Fray:\n\nThe Department has approved of your reappointment as teacher of the junior room at the Massett Indian Day School.

At the Massett Reserve we have not been so fortunate, as to date we have not got a Senior teacher, but Mrs. Fray has her junior room going with 49 pupils up to this time, no doubt there will be many more when the Indians are all back on the reserve, Mrs. Fray however is able to cope with any increases, and the children are very orderly under her care.\n\nB.T.

At the Skidegate Reserve the Teachers of both the Senior and Junior rooms appear to have things well in hand, and it was noted that the discipline in both rooms are much better than in previous years, a Christmas Concert was held at the Community Hall by the pupils which was very good according to the Council, the parents were particularly pleased with the children. At the Massett school, we only had one teacher, (Mrs Fray) who took both senior and junior rooms morning and afternoon respectively. Mrs Fray was a very good teacher and a good disciplinarian and was very well liked by the pupils, however Mrs Fray was taken out by plane on the 15th of December to Hospital for an operation, her complaint is \"Ascites\" and the Field Matron has informed me that she will not be returning to teach at Massett, the school of course is closed down.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 15, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. HOBY,\n\nRe: Pages 1506 - 1507, Hansard, May 13, 1946.\n\nMr. H. G. Archibald (Skeena) is reported as having spoken in part as follows:\n\n\"I found in the school at Old Massett that the Grade 7 pupils were using Grade 6 books while the Grade 5 pupils were using Grade 4 books. They simply did not have proper textbooks for the children. The Indian Agent has been told of this but no action has been taken. There are no lights in the school and, as Honourable Members know, in that latitude the days are rather short in the winter time. There is no library; there are no reference books and no help has been received from the Agent in connection with these deficiencies. The Indians want to know who inspects the school. Apparently there is no proper inspection.\"\n\nThere are two classrooms in this school and the teachers who were in charge for the academic year 1944-45 resigned at the end of June, 1945. We secured one teacher, but Indian Commissioner MacKay was unable to secure a second teacher. During the period September 1 to December 18, 1945, this teacher conducted the senior room in the morning and the junior room in the afternoon. However, she became ill and had to give up duties on December 19, 1945. Immediate steps were taken to secure a replacement and finally we secured two teachers who began duties on February 1, 1946. The return for the quarter ended March 31, 1946, shows five pupils in Grade 7 and three pupils in Grade 6. These are the first pupils shown in these Grades since we received the return for the quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nA requisition was received from the teacher of the\n\n...... Massett\nMasset School, through the office of the Indian Agent, last month and the requisition was promptly forwarded to the Government Stationery Office. This requisition requested some books that are prescribed for Grades 7 and 8 in the British Columbia Provincial Schools. These books should have reached the school by this time.\n\nSince our own School Inspector resigned, the Indian schools in British Columbia have been inspected by the provincial inspectors, and on referring to our file I find that the Massett School has been regularly inspected once a year by Inspector Thorsteinson. His last inspection was on May 11, 1945. No doubt, he will visit the school again either this month or next month.\n\nWith reference to Kitkatla, Mr. Archibald complained about the condition of the school. We have received a report from the Acting Indian Agent, dated May 4, 1946, regarding this building, and evidently, due to the payment of family allowances, the attendance has increased very materially during the past few months. The Department is writing to him with reference to placing the building in as good a condition as possible, or, if there is any building we could rent, temporarily, he is being requested to report on it.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nQueen Charlotte Agency, B.C.\nApril 5th, 1946.\n\nREPORT FOR MARCH QUARTER\n\nEDUCATIONAL:\n\nThe schools of both Massett and Skidegate Reserves were visited several times each month. At the Skidegate school the teacher of the senior room has her class well disciplined, also in this class manual training has been introduced, and the boys have made a bookcase with doors, and shelves for their room, I have recommended that tools be purchased for their use, to encourage them in this work. At the Massett school both the teachers commenced their duties in February, and are doing very well with their classes, they are very active in social work on the reserve, have a teenage canteen and a kindergarten for those under school age under their supervision, the junior teacher (Mrs Conroy) was taken out by plane March 17th with a throat infection to Prince Rupert, but returned to her duties March 25th, both teachers are very well liked by the Indians of the reserve.\n\nB.T.

At the Skidegate school the teachers of both rooms, have made quite an improvement with their pupils during their terms, and it is regretted that Miss Merritt is being transferred to another school, however we are lucky in having Miss Strong return in her place, she too being a very capable teacher, Miss Mackie the Junior room teacher is staying for another term.\n\nAt the Massett school both the Senior and Junior teachers are not returning, both have done very well since they took over in February, however in conversation with Bishop Gibson, who was here on a visit, I was informed that he was sure that he would be able to recommend two teachers for this school for September both the Massett teachers were very active in social work and were very well liked by the Natives.\n\nB.T.

Although neither Miss Donison nor Mrs. Conroy are certificated teachers, in the absence of any teachers with these qualifications we appear to have no alternative but to avail ourselves of their services as otherwise it is almost certain that the school will remain closed for the balance of the academic year.\n\nI am unable at the moment to secure a completed application form from Mrs. Conroy, but the Department has on file information with respect to her qualifications.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve the appointment of these two teachers at a salary of $118.00 a month each and would appreciate word from you in this connection by airmail.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs.

Getting the classes organized and getting the pupils settled down after their long absence from school at this school they have a Kindergarten class in the spare class room for the little tots under school age, and which is looked after by one of the Native boys of the Village, this prepares them for the time when they can be registered for school.\n\nB.T.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 328-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 5th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. L. Hamilton Baillie, teacher of the Massett Indian Day School, regarding a number of matters which he states require immediate attention. In this connection I beg to confirm the following night letter to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"Teacher Massett School reports urgent need new stove and heater, to t extra fuel required, repairs needed to drain from toilet at residence and water supply unsatisfactory. Arrange purchase and forwarding stove and heater of suitable types. Obtain supply fuel required and have necessary repairs made to drain and water supply. Keep all expense low as possible.\"\n\nWith reference to the need of a stove and heater, Mr. Baillie states as follows:\n\n\"The Department provided a cook stove and a heater when I came here two years ago. The driftwood, which is the only kind available, is very hard on stoves. I have put in several linings, but the stoves are now completely done. It is very doubtful if the top of the cook stove will hold up until a reply can be received from you.\"\n\nWith reference to the fuel requirement, he states as follows:\n\n\"The yearly requirement is 20 cords, costing at present $160. We do not waste any, but it is well known that the kind furnished here has no lasting qualities, and the amount used is large. It has worked out as I estimated that 20 cords could be the year's requirement. Seven more cords are, therefore, needed to complete the supply of wood necessary to March 31st, 1927.\"\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-5, part 1)\nMr. Baillie has suggested that coal be supplied in place of wood; but, owing to the cost in having this delivered, it is considered that as long as wood can be obtained, we would not be prepared to authorize the furnishing of coal.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, he states that this has never been properly attended to, the water tank holds only a few days' water, and that, owing to the condition of the cistern, the well cannot be kept in use. In this connection I would refer you to previous correspondence.\n\nWith reference to the drain, he states that a flush toilet was provided at the house, a terracotta pipe was put in as a drain fifteen years ago, a part of this drain has crumbled, and the whole thing is therefore out of commission.\n\nAs requested in our telegram, the Department would like you to take immediate steps to have the work authorized carried out. The expense should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of Nov. 5th last relative to L.M. Baillie's requirements, I beg to transmit herewith, Voucher #2774 with account for 3 stoves purchased by him at Massett, and also a copy of my letter to him.\n\nWith regard to any repairs which may be necessary in connection with the water supply and waste drain; the matter is now referred to Mr. Gillett, the newly appointed agent, as he is right on the spot, and it is considered most advisable that any work to be done should be supervised by a responsible person if unnecessary expense is to be avoided.\n\nOwing to the cost of a new water tank and repairs to the well, I have taken no further steps in the matter, but have requested Mr. Gillett to investigate the requirements and make whatever recommendations he may deem necessary to the Department.\n\nAs to the use of coal for the school and teacher's residence at Massett, I think before long it will be found cheaper and more satisfactory to use coal as it can now be delivered in bulk on the Massett wharf at a reasonable cost. Wood is becoming more difficult to obtain on account of having to go farther afield for it, and the Indians are asking a higher price.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nIndian Agent\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nNov. 20th 1926\n\nI have your letter of the 17th inst. enclosing account for stoves supplied by Alfred Adams.\n\nInstructions were received at this office from the Department to purchase the stoves for the teacher's residence by tender as is always done with regard to Government purchases, but as you have taken upon yourself to make these purchases without authority, you have placed yourself in rather a peculiar position. However, I will O.K. the account this time, but in future kindly remember that unless directly authorized, you are to make no purchases whatever for the Department.\n\nWith regard to the drain pipe, as you have not forwarded the necessary measurements as requested, nothing further can be done until these are received. After making enquiries, I find that the cost of putting in a septic tank would be prohibitive, as it would mean employing a man from here to do the work properly. As the house is so close to the beach and there is good drainage, a septic tank does not appear to be necessary. Instead of a tile pipe as formerly, a wooden stave pipe will be used for the drain as this is easier to put in and will last almost as long. Let me have the correct measurements from the toilet to elbow at edge of bank, thence down the slope to the next elbow, thence to outlet on the beach. I have requested Alfred Adams to go over the ground with you in order that a correct estimate may be made. In the meantime, the part of the drain from the outlet to the break at the brow of the hill should be cleared so that it may be used temporarily until the new pipe has been put in.

(RG 10, Volume 6202, File 828-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward herewith the Agent's report for the Massett, Tow Hill and Skidegate Schools, for the month of May. I am also enclosing Mr. Inspector Fraser's letter to the Agent regarding these schools. His remarks on the Massett and Skidegate Schools regarding the number of teachers required expresses the need which the Agent has seen for some time, namely, three qualified teachers for Massett School, and two for Skidegate. Massett this year had over one hundred on the roll, and Skidegate over forty. There will be more in both schools next term.\n\nIf the suggestion for three qualified teachers for the Massett school is carried out, it will be necessary to have another room added, such as the Department's original plans called for. I realize that there was not anything provided for in the estimates for 1928-29, to take care of this, so that I suppose the new room will not be added this year. However, the present school could be rearranged so as to make three rooms with very little expense. All that is required is the partition between the large room and the cloak room moved, and two new doors. The enclosed plan of the present school and a sketch of the alteration will show what I mean. If nothing can be done this year, possibly the old Church could be used, as before the new school was built. With a little renovating it would do temporarily, and this would be better than disturbing the present arrangements in the school.\n\nThe Skidegate school is quite an old building, I believe originally a church, and a new one will be required in the near future. It is large enough to allow for a temporary partition, so as to accommodate two teachers.\n\nThe greatest difficulty is in getting the attendance large enough to require the number of teachers mentioned, during the months of September, May and June. But it could be done from the middle of October to the end of April, with a little more rigid enforcement of Sec. 10 of the Indian Act. The Skidegate attendance has been good for the time the people were in the village. Massett attendance has also been very good, but would have been better if it had not been for the scabies. The people themselves are taking more interest in school affairs and the Agent feels with Mr. Fraser, that if the Indian schools were conducted on the same lines as the White Schools, the results would compare favourably. There would then be no reason why there should not be pupils from these schools taking the Entrance exams every year.\n\nThere would be no necessity for hiring the extra teachers for September or after April. I understand that there are plenty of teachers in B.C. who could be obtained at any time. As far as the present teachers are concerned, Miss Dorothy Sheppard will be coming back, but Miss Stella Sheppard hopes to go to University. Miss Macnie will not be returning to Skidegate. Shall I make arrangements to secure a teacher to replace Miss Sheppard. I suppose the United Church will have the privilege of nominating someone for Skidegate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 29, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your letter of the 9th instant regarding your suggestion that three qualified teachers be engaged for the Massett Indian Day School and your recommendation that a third classroom be fitted up in the present building. I have to request that you will furnish further information. There are no funds to provide for the erection of another classroom. It is noted from the sketch which you submitted that the present school could be arranged so as to make three rooms with very little expense. Please state the approximate cost of having the partition between the large room and the cloakroom moved and two new doors installed. You should state, also, if any extra desks and blackboard would be required and, if so, give the sizes and the number of each size, and the dimensions - length and width - of the blackboard.\n\nWhen we have full information as to the cost involved, consideration will be given to authorizing you to have the necessary alterations made for the fitting up of a third classroom. The Department understands that the services of a third teacher would only be required from the first of October to the end of April following in each year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMasset, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to the Departmental letter No. 277-6-5 June 29th, I have the honour to report as follows.\n\nAfter making careful measurements, it would seem to be the best plan to make both partitions in the Rossetti school, making two rooms of practically equal size. The middle room will have a fire place clock which could serve as corridor for all the rooms. This would lend off the present class-room. This would require a new partition for the clock-room, and one new door to give access to the middle room. The enclosed sketch will show the proposed changes. An estimate for the labour material will be sent shortly. Two hundred and twenty-five dollars. I have consented to go over the plans with you, as this would be more of a reasonable estimate.\n\nForty-eight feet of bleached pine will be required, including four pieces of first purchase. A Prince Rupert at the time the school is built, this will cost $20.00. A gas stove will also be needed, at approximately $10.00. Including stove pipe. Possibly two to four extra cords of wood will be needed, but this will be determined later. Twenty-five new books will be required, fifteen small size 5s, and ten large ones size 7s.\n\nThe extra teacher will be required from November until April, so I take it that the salary will be the same as for the other teachers.\n\nIf the Department approves of the above, I would suggest that a wire be sent, so that material can be ordered, and the alterations made before school begins.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. Gillett\nIndian Agent,\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 8th, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the providing of three classrooms in the Massett Indian Day School. The sketch of the present building showing the proposed arrangement in erecting a partition to provide a third classroom and an estimate of the cost was also received. In this connection I have to confirm the following night telegram to you of today's date:\n\n\"May arrange to have partition erected Massett School as per sketch enclosed your letter 24th ultimo to provide third classroom. May also purchase blackboard and stove required. Department not prepared authorize second classroom Skidegate as proposed to erect new building next year.\"\n\nYou may, therefore, have the necessary partition erected, obtaining any material required and arranging for the labour. The total cost of the labour and material should not exceed your estimate of approximately $25. You may also purchase and have installed the 6'x8' of blackboard required and a new stove, including the necessary stove pipe. After the work in erecting the partition and the purchase of the blackboard and stove has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. The Department will leave the matter of the fitting up of the extra classroom in your hands to make the best arrangements you can at the lowest possible cost.\n\nRelative to the desks required for the extra classroom, I beg to say that you should obtain prices for 25 new desks of the sizes required from the following firms, and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price:\n\nRev. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B.C.\n\n- E. G. Parnell -\nE. G. Parnell\nClarke & Stuart Co., Ltd.,\nTait Pipe & Foundry Co., Ltd.,\nCaines, Ltd.,\n829 Powell St., Vancouver,\n550 Seymour St., #\n1150 Hamilton St., #\n\nYou should give these firms full information as to the size and number of each size of desk required, and ask them to quote F.O.B. nearest shipping point to the school. You should obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, and when the desks have been delivered, if in good condition, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nWe note that the extra teacher will only be required from approximately November 1st until the end of the following April of each year. Later on, you should take up the question of engaging the services of the extra teacher.\n\nIf possible, you should see that the carpenter work in the erection of the partition is completed before the school reopens after the present summer holidays, and the fitting up of the extra classroom should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOTTAWA - August 8, 1928.\n\nRev. J.

In this connection, I have to confirm the following night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"May expend Eighty-five dollars shingling roof temporary school for Massett Indians.\"\n\nOur funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned, and payment of accounts covering the above expenditure cannot be made until after April 1st, next.\n\nRegarding the carrying out of all the shingling required to this building, which it is noted you have estimated at approximately $150, which includes the above authorized amount, I have to say that, if the accounts covering the entire cost can be rendered after April 1st, next, you may arrange to have the work done at the present time. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed, and certified accounts covering the cost of the material and labour should be forwarded in the usual manner after the date mentioned above.\n\nYou might state whether this building is the property of the Department or who the owners are.

I take it that it will be the Department's wish to have the school there opened.\n\nThe school is a rough building which was put up by the Langara Fishing and Packing Co., in 1926, and is forty-five feet long including a lean-to, and twenty feet wide. In my estimates for 1931-32, I placed an item of $180.00 for shingling this building. The roof at least should be shingled before the school starts, and this will cost $55.00. Are there any funds available this fiscal year, so that the roof may be done at least. Or could I have the whole of the work done, and submit the bills after the first of April. Kindly wire if the Department approves of either of the above arrangements.\n\nI may say that the building is on Hi-Ellen Reserve, but not on the Company's lease. School has been held there each Spring since it was built. Mrs. Ashmore, of the Massett School will be taking charge there if the above is satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOffice of the Queen Charlotte Indian Agency,\n\nMasset, B.C., Sept. 13, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 773, amounting to $10.37 in favour of James Martin, Massett, B.C., for Elbows, dust pan, brooms, floor oil, etc., for Massett Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6402, File 828-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No.157-2-5, of February 14th, 1931, I may say the work in connection with Tow Hill school is now completed, and the bills in this matter are enclosed herewith.\n\nI took the liberty of having some extra work done, such as a woodshed, toilets built, and a rearrangement of windows including two new ones, to give better lighting. As the price of shingles had taken a drop since my estimate of cost was made, I found that I could have this extra work done, and still keep within the amount mentioned, ($150.00).\n\nReferring to that part of your letter dealing with the ownership of the school building, I may say that the Langara Fishing and Packing Co. supplied the material for the building and the Indian people put it up gratis. The Langara Fishing and Packing Co. take no claim to the building under the control of the Indian Agent. It practically means that it is the property of the Department, particularly now that repairs have been made out of Departmental funds. The building is used for school only, except for an occasional Church Service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, requesting authority to incur the expenditure required in restaining the roof of the Massett Indian Day School and repairing and cleaning the toilets, also to purchase two new heaters.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs required to one of the toilets made and have both toilets thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition. All expenses for the purpose should be kept as low as possible.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the restaining of the roof.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of two new heaters, of the type considered by you to be satisfactory for the purpose for which they are required. It is noted you estimate the cost to be under $60. The Department will be pleased if you can obtain these heaters at as low a cost as possible.\n\nAfter the repairs and the cleaning of the toilets have been attended to and the stoves purchased, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Gillett, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMassett, B. C.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe roof of the Massett Day School needs re-staining. Repairs are needed on one toilet and both toilets should be cleaned. I placed an item of Fifty-Five Dollars ($55.00) in the estimates for 1931-1932, and this amount will cover cost of both labour and material for the above mentioned work. Kindly advise if I shall have this work attended to.\n\nIt will be necessary to purchase two new stoves for the Massett School. I placed an item of Sixty Dollars ($60.00) in my estimates to cover this, but I think with today's prices, stoves can be bought for somewhat less than this. Kindly advise if I should purchase them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. Hillier\n\nP.S. The stoves required are Jumbo stoves the same as has been purchased before.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 29, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nFunds are provided in the Main Estimates, Indian Education, for the purchase of the mission house and the lot on which it stands, at Massett, B.C. This is required as a teachers' residence. It is at present in use for the purpose and we are paying a rental of $15 per month. Bishop Rix, of the Diocese of Caledonia, has offered to sell the property for $1,037.50. Mr. Indian Agent Gillett, when recommending the purchase, has forwarded a statement concerning the building and Mr. Orr considers the price very reasonable.\n\nBefore purchasing the property, it will be necessary to secure the authority of His Excellency in Council and then to place the matter in the hands of the Department of Justice.

The teachers' residence at Massett also needs staining and painting outside.\n\nThe roof of the teachers' residence at Skidegate requires re-shingling and staining.\n\nIn my estimates for 1932-33, I placed an item of $275.00 for repairs to the Skidegate teachers' residence and $200.00 for the Massett residence. Through an oversight I failed to estimate for repairs to the Massett school. If the two amounts mentioned above have been granted in full, it will take care of the Massett school as well as the residences, as it is now possible to secure labour at a much lower rate than when my estimates were made.\n\nI should like to have advise regarding this as early as possible, in order to give the work to Indians who would otherwise be on relief.

It is noted that you estimate the cost of these at $100 and other repairs at $25., or a total of $125.\n\nIn view of the fact that you recently authorized repairs to the teachers' residence at the Massett School without receiving authority from the Department, it is extremely difficult for us to find the necessary funds. However, if you consider that the toilets should be erected this year, you may proceed with their construction. You may, also, have the minor repairs done at a cost not exceeding $25.00.\n\nIndian Commissioner MacKay was written yesterday with regard to your action in arranging repairs to the teachers' residence without receiving authority. In future, the Department will be unable to favourably consider unauthorized expenditures.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. T.

The building would be about 7' x 5', and about 7' high with a screen outside the building for entrance to toilets. The total cost with the holes dug would be about $100.00.\n\nThere is also other repairs in the School Sash Cords, Window Panes, desks to be repaired, and several boards on the outside of Building to be replaced by new lumber, this work would cost about $25.00.\n\nThis would make the Total cost of $125.00 for the Massett Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB.T.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my recent visit to the Massett Indian Day School, a concert practice was in progress, and as mentioned in my last months School report (junior class) Mr Adams kindly loaned his Piano for their use.\n\nAs no doubt you are aware the Hiadas are very musical and this has been somewhat neglected owing to the lack of a Piano, however the Piano loaned by Mr Adams is only for the Christmas Concert, when it will be returned.\n\nMrs Read (the new teacher) informs me that the Piano is a real necessity, not only for musical lessons but marching in and out of school.\n\nI have had the offer of a very fine Piano (player) Large Solid Oak, by Mason and Risch from a Mr D. Rutten of New Massett in good condition and tuned last year for $75.00. I have not been able to get the Council together to take this from the Band funds, but it was through the efforts of the Chief Councillor that Mr Adams loaned his piano, so I don't think there would be any objections to taking the above from the Band Funds.\n\nMr Rutten has kindly informed me he will hold the sale of the piano until I have word from you, as two other persons are willing to buy it. I forget to mention above that there are about 50 Rolls of Music goes with the Piano.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nB.T.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDuring my recent visit to the Queen Charlotte Agency, I had an opportunity of inspecting the Massett and Skidegate Indian Day School buildings, as a result of which Mr. Indian Agent Phillips was requested to submit an estimate of the cost of painting the buildings inside and out, construction of a woodshed at the Massett School, and various minor repairs and alterations. The cost of these has now been determined at approximately $500.00 in the case of the Skidegate School and $630.00 for the Massett School.\n\nMr. Phillips made provision in his 1944-45 Estimates for part of these amounts, and it is requested that, if sufficient funds are available, authority be granted to have the work proceeded with. These two schools were the subject of criticism by the Provincial School Inspector and it would be advisable to have the necessary repairs and painting done as soon as possible.\n\nD. M.

C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant,\nwith reference to supplies requested by Miss L. J.\nBrunton, recently appointed teacher of the Massett\nIndian Day School.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize\nMiss Brunton to purchase the books for either the\nfirst or second year pupils or for Grades 3 and 4.\nWe have recently placed in stock, at the Government\nStationery Office, a large number of books which we\nconsider suitable for Indian schools, and we are\narranging to send a number of these to Massett.\nI feel certain that these will be suitable.\n\nYou may authorize Miss Brunton to purchase\nthe kindergarten material at a cost of $7.50. She\nmay also purchase the articles shown on the attached\nrequisition for janitor supplies.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMiss L. J. Brunton, formerly teacher at\nthe Citlakdomix Indian Day School and recently trans-\nferred to the Massett Indian Day School, has been in\ncommunication with Mr. Indian Agent Phillips regard-\ning supplies at the school. She is of the opinion\nthat the supplies on hand are inadequate, and has\nsubmitted the attached Requisitions to this office\nin the hope that authority will be obtained in sufficient\ntime to enable her to purchase a number of the articles\npersonally and take them with her to Massett.\n\nPage 1 of her Requisition requests a total of\n30 books for 1st and 2nd year pupils at\nan approximate cost of $20.00.\n\nKindergarten material as outlined at an\napproximate cost of $7.50.\n\n1 Doz. Supplementary Readers for Grades 3\nand 4, and material for Upper class room\nindustrial or manual art, at an approximate\ncost of $6.00.\n\nMiss Brunton, in addition, has requested\n6 Gramophone records of Marches, Games etc.,\nfor use in the school with her own Gramophone.\n\nThe items listed on Page 2 are self-explanatory,\nand are the ones which Miss Brunton is anxious to select\npersonally.\n\nPage 3 deals largely with Janitor supplies which,\napparently the previous teacher omitted to order.\nMiss Brunton is a capable teacher with many years experience, and I am of the opinion the supplies asked for are necessary, and will be put to good use should the Department approve of the purchase of same. It would be appreciated if the Department would forward their decision by air mail so that purchase could be made locally by Miss Brunton prior to her departure for Massett.\n\nD.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nOn my recent visit to the Massett Indian Day School, Miss Brunton requested that blinds for the bath school rooms be purchased to keep out the sun. I have not seen any blinds on these windows since I took over, but I do think they are necessary.\n\n12 Blinds, 7' long x 3' Cloth measurement (these are stock size) would be required for both rooms; long cords could be purchased locally, as they will pull up from the bottom of the windows.\n\nIf the above meets with your approval, would you kindly have them sent from Vancouver, as I could not purchase same locally without having the merchant to order same for me.\n\nB.T. Phillips,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Phillips' letter of October 13th, in connection with window blinds required for both rooms at the Massett Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe windows of this building face directly south and blinds are no doubt necessary. These blinds may be secured in Vancouver at an approximate cost of $15.00, and I would recommend that authority be granted for this purchase.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.
