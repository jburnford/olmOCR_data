Would you agree with this assessment?\n\nTHE JACKSON BANQUET.\n\nLast evening, the starvation of the Qu\u2019Appelle District assembled in grand form to honor Sir Herbert Parsons, nephew and son of Sir Edward Parsons. Sir Herbert is well known as one of the greatest of the day, and he presented quite a number from the Council Town, who were there in honor of his visit. He began the evening with a hearty greeting to all present, and proceeded to conduct the festivities in a most pleasant manner. Mr. Jackson, the Chairman of the District, made a few complimentary remarks concerning the evening\u2019s event, and then proceeded to present the evening\u2019s entertainment, which was provided by Messrs. J. L. Pogue and Mr. Kavanagh. The Hon. Mr. Johnson, H. Noble, M.P., addressed the gathering, and then asked Mr. Jackson to make a few words in conclusion. Mr. Jackson then presented a speech, which was received with great enthusiasm. Mr. Jackson then proceeded to sing a song in honor of Sir Herbert, and the evening ended with a hearty toast to Sir Herbert and his family.\n\nQU\u2019APPELLE\n\nQu\u2019Appelle Station.\nTHE NORTHWEST INDIANS.\n\nToronto Mail\u2014The Indian problem, which has been before the people of the United States now three-quarters of a year, has become more acute with the entry of the Northwest into the fold of states. Nathan Richardson never dreamed that he had embarked upon a career from which he could ever escape. The Northwest has not unnerved the aborigine; but, like most of his race, he finds his efforts more than resisted when the railroad penetrates his country and subdivides his tribal domains. Until then the tide of immigration had steadily rolled westward, and the great river separating the faithful Red men from white foes, must find them themselves bequeathed in a common enemy on the eastern side of that boundary line. According to recent developments they have buried their tribal antagonisms as doomed as animals to the bonds which environ the buildings which are being set up in opposition to his beliefs. They are resolved by making him a standard against the encroaching foe. Including the Black Hawk Washing area, there are not fewer than 30 east of the river, and varying on a scale from one-half to six acres in extent. Of this number, there are not fewer than thirty-three which have the characteristic appearance of the former, each having a burial place marked by the devices supposed by the practitioner in obtaining satisfaction of his work, so long as the erections remain. These marks are said to be known only to those familiar with them, although most of these structures stand at different elevations, some being very much distinguished from others.\n\nHUDSON'S BAY RAILWAY.\n\nThe practicality of the Hudson's Bay Railway has been assured. Mr. Jarvis, the engineer of the Company, who visited England, has just returned to Canada with an examination of the route. Accompanying the party was Mr. E. J. Mosley, C. E., assistant to Mr. Sheppard, the well-known English engineer, representing the Company, who are prepared to go on with the construction of the road if found practicable. Both Mr. Jarvis and Mr. Mosley are perfectly satisfied from their personal examinations. The lowest point on land is one mile above Lake Winnipeg, and missing is the mouth of Lake Nelson River. The construction of the line will draw ships from the Nile to the Missouri, and will bring this part of the Dominion upwards of ten thousand miles nearer the markets of Europe, which means an increase in the profits of our trade, and a decrease in the rate of transport costs.\n\nCorrespondence.\n\n(One column open on all paragraphs except initial part of each paragraph.)\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of ONE DOLLAR, with the object of enforcing advance payment.
