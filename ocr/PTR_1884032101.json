The task of complaint and remonstrance accompanied by the prayer for relief has so far proved too heavy a load to bear; the heads of the settlers in the Territories the accusation of being unreasonable grumblers, and impossible to satisfy. So long as the government continues to be represented by those who presume to pass judgment upon matters with which they have no practical knowledge, so long will their feelings be affected by their sentiments or opinions, and we consider that to answer them seriously would be at once to waste our time and unnecessarily increase the amount of our own exaggerated sense of our own importance. There are however a good many men who with more sympathy for the hardships of other, and more highly educated observers, are justly disposed to join the protestant voices of humanity referred to, yet constantly impress upon us the necessity of waiting patiently for the correction of the \"present evil.\" While we freely admit that a man with a grievance more, along with many of them, is apt to be anything but a \"job,\" we must confess that some degree of encouragement for the exercise of patience in various directions, could we discover any inclination to afford us voluntarily and spontaneously justice in others, it is decidedly discouraging to hear it said that, and that, and that for the very grievances, which, the principles and facts involved being undisputed, might be remedied by a scratch of the pen. Now while the utmost possible and most unexpected rapidity with which everything has poured into the Territories has rendered it difficult if not impossible for the government to keep pace with the changed conditions, things in every respect still are not optimistic; and there has been given to effect some more obvious alterations demanded by the new order of things. We presume that the declaration of war which was issued from the hands of granting monarchs to the safe guards of their rights and liberties contained in \"Magna Charta,\" Bill of Rights\u2014\"Grands\" Constitution\u2014Habeas Corpus\u2014Act of Settlement, etc., must be fairly alive to what their constitutional rights consist of\u2014and when they remember that the stroke of the axe, deprived King Charles I. of his liberty, and thus threatened Divine Right of kings in our fathers' land, and the attempt to tax without a parliament\u2014it is not likely that we will long submit to taxation without representation. However while we feel so perfectly easy as to getting such an open violation of our rights as this redressed, by all means let us be patient. With regard to settling the existence of another deliberative and flagrant outrage on our liberties as free men, we do not feel justified in counselling a further exercise of that most excellent virtue, by which the way may easily be opened for our degeneracy into vice. We refer to the exercise in our midst of men armed with the monstrous, extraordinary, abnormal and utterly unconstitutional (when combined) powers of Police Officers. We do not altogether condemn their desire to reflect upon the appointment in the past of those \"softening and complete unmitigating legal extremes.\" We are prepared to believe that in times past by circumstances of the country may have rendered their existence a necessary evil. Furthermore, we must not be misjudged into believing that any such act, or group of individuals of the combination order. What we oppose is the violation of a principle, the encroachment on our liberties. We believe that the same men, vessels, and strange powers, also, have, exercises been with such moderation and regard to the liberty of the subject, as their individual lights and the admonition of their own consciences, allow, but now, more than ever, we totally object, as British subjects, to being at the mercy of the Mounted Police Force taken together, has been made evident to each and every one, it must be desirable to let the men themselves, as well as the general public, understand more exactly the precise manner of their duties, and the nature of their acts, we sincerely acknowledge that such action is to be thanked to have been undertaken by municipal machinery enables us to dispense with their services, and to make use of the services of persons and privileges to their officers, unless under most exceptional circumstances, as we have already stated, we utterly refuse to humiliate. It is not within our province to say whether, or even watch the proceedings of police courts, be the police as well meaning as possible, how often this magistrates have to protest the most aggravating and outrageous conduct on their part. Again, just as it is well-known to medical men, that members of their profession who have made the study of lunacy a specialty, commonly discover, at least as sound as them selves, so does the police mind tend to find evidences of guilt, which are hidden from the less professional minds of jurymen and civic men. In addition to this, there must exist in the mind of the officer, although he may be quite unconscious of it, a strong pre-disposition when acting as a magistrate, to pronounce support of the action of his subordinates. Does this, added to the professional arbitrariness incidental to his position, render him a suitable judge to take the oath and estimate the value of evidence on a summary trial? Were this all it would be bad enough, but it seems hardly credible that such a monstrosity elementary as exists in this day, and in this country, exists as a man who within himself contains the power to order an information to be laid against a free man, arrest him, sit in judgment upon his conduct, and then lock him up and act as his gaoler, or fine him and levy a distress. If anything further be wanted to complete the impiety of such a possibility as this, it may be found in the facts that there are probably more offenses involving the possibility of a six months incarceration dealt with by justices of the peace in the Territories than elsewhere, and that from their decision there seems, in hardly any cases, to be any appeal. That this discreditible state of things must exist cannot have caused more trouble, nor largely be ascribed to the fact that there are few places of any size where either stipendiary nor local magistrates are within reasonable access, whereas in such places the good sense and taste of police officers generally induce them to send cases to be dealt with by them, in preference to irritating the public by the exercise of powers merely intended to be exercised when other cases are open. It is obvious however that such a matter as this must not be left to good taste of individuals. It is the possibility of such undesirable powers existing in the midst of the isolated communities of Her Majesty's subjects, that must promptly cease. If such still exist spots so remote that not only police officers, but magistrates, have ever visited, then let them be made clearly to understand that under such circumstances alone are they to act in that capacity. It may not be possible to prevent the doing of an evil we shall not have in creating, but it certainly is our duty to insist that one be found. Should this continue we will begin to speculate seriously as to whether the public sentiment is being not very gradually eroded for the reception of a military dictatorship.\n\nNO FOR THE WEST.\n\nGENERAL BLACKSMITHING\n\nAnd Horseshoeing\n\nDone on the Most Approved Principles and the following diseases remedied:\n\nContracted Feet, Hoof Bound, Weak Heeled Horse, Intesticking, and other diseases in the feet of horses.\n\nSleigh and Cutter Ironing,\n\nCarriage Repairing\n\nAnd Jobbing\n\nPromptly attended to.\n\nWM.
