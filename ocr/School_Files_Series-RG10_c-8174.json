Laprairie, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs understood with you when we were in St. Constant the other day, you will find attached statement of account in triplicate for the light and stove accounts at the teacher's residence in Caughnawaga.\n\nYou will notice that, in the month of May 1933, the readings for light and stove were about the same, as the difference was only 2 kilowatt-hours. The reading for light was 4250 and the one for stove was 4252. Our collector has mixed the readings in June; the reading shown for the light account was the reading of the stove meter, and the reading shown for the stove account was the reading of the light meter. The error has happened due to the meters looking exactly the same, and our collector did not follow the circuits to know which was the stove and which was the light.\n\nThis error has been running up the month of March, and the reason for finding it was that we checked up the readings and found that there was quite a difference in the consumption with the previous years. This can be verified with your Department in Ottawa.\n\nThe difference between what has been paid and what should have been paid is $102.16 net, as we have figured the discount every month on both statements. We would ask you to kindly take the matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs and ask them to let us have a cheque to cover at their earliest convenience.\n\nWe hope this will not cause you too much trouble in any way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER COMPANY,\nCommercial & Distribution Department.\n\nJDB/J.\n\nDistrict Accountant.\nOttawa, April 9, 1934.\n\nReverend & Dear Sister:\n\nEnclosed are copies of accounts which we have just received from the Shawinigan Water & Power Company, also copy of their letter dated March 23rd to Mr. Agent Letourneau.\n\nIt is almost impossible for the Department to check this account in such a manner as to decide whether or not it should be paid. I would appreciate very much if you would give the matter some consideration and let me have your views regarding the Company's request. I may add that, from our experience, it appears that this Company is extremely careless in the manner in which they prepare their accounts, as we are continually having difficulty with them.\n\nWhen replying, you should return the enclosed accounts.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have looked over very carefully the electricity accounts accompanying your letter of the 9th instant and am quite astonished to find such exorbitant prices charged for the January and March consumption, as our mode of living is always practically the same. Our lights are extinguished at 9 P.M. every night. Nothing extraordinary occurred during these months that would require extra lighting and we fail to see why there is such a sudden rise in rates unless a short circuit has arisen somewhere or the meters fail to register correctly. So many things depend on the electric current -- door-bell, oil burner, water supply, frigidaire, that we are at a loss to find out just what increases the cost so abruptly.\n\nThe electric stove is very seldom used except when the water pipe bursts in the coal stove and a new water front has to be put in. At such times the cooking is done, with great inconvenience, on the electric stove for only a day or two. Moreover, all the hot water required in the house has to be heated during this time on the electric stove until the coal stove has been repaired. The electric stove gave us some trouble in December and January as two lids refused to heat. Upon mentioning this fact to the Indian Agent, he sent a workman to replace the switches and lids. We do not know if this trouble had anything to do with the rise in the bill for these months.\n\nAll the meters on the Reserve were replaced by new ones, last November.\n\nI know for a certainty that soon after this change the Missionary put in a complaint for the big rise in the\nin the electric accounts. Finally, he made new contracts with the Shawinigan Company because too many things had been placed on the light account. Since January, his accounts went down about $5.00 per month. Would this be our case?\n\nWould you advise us to call in an expert electrician to see if the electric wiring is in good condition as well as the meter boxes? At any rate, we have decided to ask the collector, on his next visit, to teach us how to read the meter so that we ourselves can keep a record of the consumption from time to time and send you the same when required.\n\nWe are sorry we are unable to give further explanations concerning this matter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\n| Reading | Consumption |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Jan.    | 6536        |\n| Feb.    | None        |\n| March   | 7596        |\n\n(Brought forward) 54.32\n\n17-670 Billed stove account\n\nIndian Affairs.

be some justification to the claim of the Shawinigan Power Company that the meter readings of the Stove and Electric Lights at the Teachers' Residence at Caughnawaga were switched as will be seen from the following tables of energy used during past two fiscal years.\n\n| Month | Stove (K.W.H.) | Lights (K.W.H.) |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n|       | Corrected      | As Paid

from the paid accounts on our file and represent the revised figures submitted by the Company.\n\nIt will be noted that the two years average pretty much the same when the revised figures are used excepting the last three months of the lighting account which appear very high.\n\nI would suggest, therefore, that either we or the Schools Branch write the Indian Agent embodying the above tables and ask him to investigate, as far as he may be able, and ascertain why the lighting account suddenly increased by 50% for the last three months. The April account has now been paid and the figure reverts to that for Nov. (approx.)\n\nUpon receipt of Agent's reply we could submit the question to Dr. McGill and if he approves of payment being made then we should obtain new accounts from the Shawinigan Company as the ones we have contain errors.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Did you make any enquiry as to the reason for this?\n\ne) The \"corrected\" accounts for Light also show a sharp rise, particularly for the last three months. Please ascertain the reason for this.\n\nAs it is desired to dispose of this claim as soon as possible, will you please give the matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in connection with the claim of $102.16 from The Shawinigan Water and Power Company, Valleyfield, and to reply as follows to your five questions:\n\na) - The two meters are placed into the basement of the teachers' residence, near one another, there is a slight difference between the two meters. From the appearance of these two iron boxes, and apart from the Company's officers, it was impossible to tell which was for the stove, or the lights.\n\nb) - Yes, since the mistake is discovered, the meter reader has made a special mark to one of them.\n\nc) - I am told by the Rev. Sister Superior that she and the other teachers are not used to such readings. I occasionally read the meters.\n\nd) - I admit that in this particular case I have not made an enquiry as to the reason for this.\n\ne) - I may say that the fuel oil blower and the water system being connected on to the Light meter, together with the very severe weather during these mentioned months, this was the reason for such a rise to the accounts.\n\nI wish to add that the mistake of the meter readings was made when a newly appointed meter reader first noticed an almost equal amount of K.W.H. on both meters, and he kept on the same readings during a few months until he happen to turn on one of the switches that he then found his mistake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER COMPANY,\nValleyfield, Que.\nMarch 23, 1934.\n\nMr. Lorenzo Letourneau,\nAgent of Indian Affairs,\nSt. Constant,\nCo. Laprairie, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs understood with you when we were in St. Constant the other day, you will find attached statement of account in triplicate for the light and stove accounts at the teacher's residence in Caughnawaga.\n\nYou will notice that, in the month of May 1933, the readings for light and stove were about the same, as the difference was only 2 kilowatt-hours. The reading for light was 4250 and the one for stove was 4252. Our collector has mixed the readings in June; the reading shown for the light account was the reading of the stove meter, and the reading shown for the stove account was the reading of the light meter. The error has happened due to the meters looking exactly the same, and our collector did not follow the circuits to know which was the stove and which was the light.\n\nThis error has been running up the month of March, and the reason for finding it was that we checked up the readings and found that there was quite a difference in the consumption with the previous years. This can be verified with your Department in Ottawa.\n\nThe difference between what has been paid and what should have been paid is $102.16 net, as we have figured the discount every month on both statements. We would ask you to kindly take the matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs and ask them to let us have a cheque to cover at their earliest convenience.\n\nWe hope this will not cause you too much trouble in any way.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER COMPANY,\nCommercial & Distribution Department\n(SGD.) J. D. BARON\nOttawa, May 21st, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 23rd March last addressed to Mr. Lorenzo Letourneau, Indian Agent, St. Constant, in connection with stove and light meter readings at the teachers' residence, Caughnawaga, I enclose herewith the accounts for these meters which you sent him.\n\nYou will observe that the accounts as originally rendered show various inaccuracies and I shall be pleased if you will kindly forward corrected accounts in triplicate when the question of adjustment will be given further consideration.\n\nI trust you will pardon the delay in this matter but due to pressure of work occasioned by the close of the fiscal year and vacancies caused by sickness it was unavoidable.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C.

Sister Superior also requested that the building, which was formerly occupied as the fire pump station, be repaired in order to be used as a heated garage for the winter.\n\nThe repairs needed at this building will cost about $35.00; the repairs are consisting in the widening of the door (which is too narrow) the repairing of the roof and the addition of a ceiling. These repairs will amount to the sum above mentioned, as the widening of the door will require more labour than it would with an ordinary building, as the walls are about one and a half foot thick and made of brick and stone.\n\nI would kindly ask you to let me know if the Department is willing to pay for the gasoline for use of this car on the Reserve and on Government business and also if you will authorize the necessary repairs to the garage, so as they can use the car all winter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Frs. Brisebois]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you advise that the Sisters in charge of the Catholic Schools at Caughnawaga have recently been presented with an automobile and that they request the Department to supply gasoline to operate the car.\n\nThis is the first application of its kind that the Department has received and, before deciding whether or not we can comply with the Sisters' request, it is necessary to have some additional information.\n\nPlease let me know the approximate number of gallons of gasoline that would be required each month and also its cost. For some years' past, we have been allowing $2 a week for a messenger boy's services and also a certain amount for the transportation of the teachers on rainy days. In the event of the Department authorizing gasoline for the car, is it to be understood that the charges for a messenger boy and driving the Sisters will be discontinued?\n\nPlease consult the Reverend Sisters and advise the Department further in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q., Nov 8, 1934\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, our Agent has just given me communication of his letter (5-1-8) from the Department concerning the request to supply gasoline for the Sisters' transportation to the schools by auto.\n\nThe request was made because the allowance already received for the Messenger Boy and for transportation from November to April would hardly cover the expense of gasoline and oil necessary to operate the car which is being donated by a kind friend of the Sisters.\n\nAlthough I have no idea of the amount of gasoline it would take for the trips to schools daily and our shopping in Lachine and Montreal occasionally, I can sincerely assure you, Mr. MacKenzie, that there would be neither waste nor extravagance in the matter.\n\nTrusting that you will kindly take our request into consideration and assuring you of the heartfelt gratitude of all the staff,\n\nI am, dear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6083, file 305-8, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPoor copy\nOttawa, November 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to official letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the supplying of gasoline for the automobile presented to the Sisters of the Caughnawaga R. C. School, the Department is in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal.\n\nApparently you discussed the matter with the Reverend Sister and allowed her to send a reply. For your guidance, I would point out that when you are written on any matters in connection with the reserve, you should consult the parties interested, but you should not depend on them to reply. You should take such action yourself, making any comments that you consider necessary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas states in her letter that the allowance made by the Department for messenger boy and teachers' transportation would hardly cover the expenses of gas and oil. During the academic year - September 1, 1933, to June 30, 1934 - the Department has paid accounts amounting to over $300 for messenger boy and transportation of the teachers. We are, therefore, inclined to feel that the operation of the car for an academic year should not exceed this amount. Please let me have your views in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the supplying of gasoline for the automobile presented to the Reverend Sisters of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department is prepared to allow an amount of $30.00 a month for the period December 1st, 1934, to June 30th, 1935, in order to cover the cost of gasoline and maintenance of the automobile.\n\nIn the event of this offer being acceptable, the Reverend Sister Superior should include the charge in her statement of expenses which she forwards at the end of each quarter. On her statement, the amount allowed for the purpose should read, as follows:\n\n\"Transportation of teachers for months of ------------------ @ $30.00 a month\"\n\nIn view of this allowance, no amount should be charged for messenger service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nCaughnawaga, November 21, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with regard to the request made by the Sisters of Caughnawaga for the supplying of oil and gas for use of the automobile, which has recently been presented to them by one of their friends. You mentioned in your communication that the Department paid accounts amounting to over $300 for messenger boy and transportation of the teachers during the academic year 1933-1934.\n\nIn reply I beg to transmit you the following report and recommendation in the case.\n\nThe Sisters would be willing to accept the amount of $300 or $30 a month for the 10 months of the academic year for the allowance of the car. This allowance would cover the salary of the messenger boy, their transportation etc., it is also understood that this amount would also cover the transportation of the freight and parcels coming to Caughnawaga from the Department or elsewhere for the use of the Schools, Hospital, the Doctor etc.\n\nMy recommendation in this case would be to give a fixed allowance of $25 a month to the Sisters for the use of their car, for 10 months a year, starting in September of each year and ending in June, which would make a total allowance of $250 per academic year. This sum should cover the expenditure for the messenger boy, the transportation of the teacher and would be final, no other allowance should be allowed with regard to the above mentioned services.\n\nIt is presumed that an amount of $25 per month paid to the Sisters would be preferable than the sending of monthly accounts to the Department for gas and oil for the car, and by allowing a definite amount for the car's expenses if the car is used for other trips those pertaining to Government's affairs the Sisters will have to defray the cost of their trips themselves. It would also be preferable to know in advance the amount of money required for the above mentioned services.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Indian Agent)\nOttawa, November 26th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, which reached the Department today, I beg to say that the Department wrote you on the 24th instant advising that we were prepared to allow $30.00 a month for the ten months' period of each academic year for the operation of the automobile owned by the Reverend Sisters at the Caughnawaga R. C. Schools.\n\nThis allowance is expected to cover the salary of the messenger boy, the transportation of the Reverend Sisters and the transportation of freight and parcels coming to Caughnawaga for the use of the schools. It is not the intention of the Department that this car should be used for transporting parcels for the use of the hospital or the medical officer.\n\nOfficial letter of the 24th instant gave you definite instructions regarding the manner in which we desire accounts to be presented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ltd., 302 Craig West, Montreal. These expenses have been necessitated, when I was handed an account amounting to $62., by the Shawinigan Water and Power Co., for electricity used at the teacher's residence only, for January. As this account was thought to be excessive, it was returned to this Company at Valleyfield, Que., with the mention that it would not be considered, owing to its amount. The Shawinigan Water & Power was also requested to send one of their men, to inspect the electrical system at the teacher's residence. This was done and it was found, that there were defective wires,(grounds) which were responsible for the high reading of the meter. In order to repair the electrical system, I requested the Clovis Electric Co., to make the necessary repairs. It is considered that with the repairs made, the cost of the electricity at the residence, will be cut by half. The Company will give us a credit for accounts overcharged for January and February, which accounts have not yet been sent to Ottawa for consideration, but will, in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTeachers' Residence,\nGaugimassaga, March 30, 1935.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nTo Sister Mary Clough\n\nTransportation of teachers for months of January, February, March at $50.00\n\n$50.00\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Sister Mary Cleophas, Directress,\nIndian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nApril 2nd, 1936.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      |         |        |\n\nENCLOSURE.\n\nTo transportation of Caughnawaga schools teachers,\nfor the months of January, February, and March, 1936. $90.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 506\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

You will notice from the above statement that discount at the rate of one cent per kwh. was allowed, or $6.02.\n\nThe date of reading of the meters in connection with the above account was January 8th, and as the amount requested has been paid, the Department cannot understand why they are again including this amount.\n\nPlease arrange with the Shawinigan Company to forward a new account covering the period January 8th to the date of the next reading, which apparently was February 7th.\n\nIt is also noted that discount of only $3.50 is allowed. At the previous rate of one cent per kwh. it would appear that there should be a larger discount. Have the Company changed their discount rate?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The Sister claims that their Residence is too small; that they are 15 persons living there and that some of them have to sleep in parlors, as they have no rooms for them. She also claims that this house is very cold during the winter months; that certain part of the roof will have to be repaired, as it leaks; that the heating system is giving them trouble, and will need considerable repairs. She also reported that the electric wiring is dangerous, and that their Residence is considered as a regular firetrap.\n\nTherefore she is kindly requesting the Department to consider the building of a new Residence for the teachers, which she claims had been decided in the past but postpone owing to uncontrollable circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, regarding the need of increased living accommodation for the Reverend Sisters in the teachers' residence on the Caughnawaga Reserve and the repairs that will be required to the building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we will have no funds for the erection of a new residence at the Caughnawaga R.

The first one shows a credit of $28. allowed the Department, by the Shawinigan Water & Power Co.'s Montreal Office, less $6.02 for discount. Then another one was sent showing a credit of $20.16 less $8.54, including the discount of $6.02 allowed and the $2.52 this being the difference between $6.02 and $3.50 which should have been allowed, the new account being figured on a 350 Kwhrs. basis, thus leaving a credit of $11.62, which credit was taken off the account for the period of Jan.9/35 to Feb.7/35. This account, which you call for in your letter, was sent you under voucher No.324, together with a corrected bill for the period of Dec.9/34 to Jan.9/35 for your references, but those two accounts were returned by you for further explanation.\n\nReferring to electricity discount, I must say that the Company's rate is the same, but, that the difference is caused by the fact that the discount was figured on a 350 Kwhrs. basis, which was fixed for credit, instead of being figured on the amount of 602 Kwhrs.

The account shows that the consumption was 144 kwh. and the rate charged 8 cents. Therefore, the amount due would be $3.52 and not $3.72, as charged by the Company. You should take this matter up with the Company and obtain a new account.

For the same period last year, we paid $2.20, and we are allowing a similar amount this year, which reduces the account you forwarded from $18.22 to $16.76.\n\nAs you are aware, due to the Company's own officials, a mistake was made in reading the meters last year, and, even though we were not responsible, the Department dealt fairly with the Company by paying the amount of arrears which they requested at that time. It is considered that the Company should check their meters and see that they are running properly. You may inform them that we are not prepared to allow any larger amount for the month of June than that mentioned in the first part of this letter.

The question of the erection of a new residence is now under consideration, but I am unable to state, at present, whether funds for the purpose will be available in our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year.

With its return, will you please furnish a report.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\nNov. 27, Raymond.\n\" 25, Sister Leopoldine. (with translation).\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of November 29th, enclosing letters received from the General Superior of the Sisters of Sainte Anne, also from Mr. Maxime Raymond, M.P., requesting the erection of more suitable living quarters for the Reverend Sisters, who are teaching at the Caughnawaga R.C. Day School.\n\nWhen the Reverend Sisters were first placed in charge of the Caughnawaga R.C. School about twenty years ago, the Department purchased from an Indian an old residence on the Reserve. As the attendance increased at the school it was necessary to engage the services of more sisters and from time to time additions have been added to the original building. At the present time there are fifteen sisters engaged at the Caughnawaga School and they utilize the services of two or three additional sisters as housekeepers. As a result, there are approximately seventeen or eighteen sisters residing in the sister's residence. As no additions have been made to the building within the past six years, the accommodation is quite limited. It should also be kept in mind that there is considerable fire hazard in the present building.\n\nTo erect a suitable residence for the sisters would involve an expenditure of $15,000. to $20,000. and no funds for this purpose have been provided in our estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39. This is a request that might receive careful and sympathetic consideration when preparing the estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nDirector.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n10th December, 1937.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nI am returning herewith Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 2nd instant with regard to the suggestion of Mr. Maxime Raymond, M.P., that provision be made for more suitable living quarters for the teachers at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nWhen the matter of including an item in the estimates for 1939-40 is being brought up probably it would be as well to have a statement indicating the size and nature of construction of the present building and the condition it is in. The Minister should also know how the present salary range, plus the value of living quarters, compares with salaries paid to other teachers in the Montreal area. Also how the number of pupils in each class compares with the number in the average school room in the vicinity of Montreal.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nTo note.\n\nJ.M.

School.\n\nDo the number of pupils in each class in the Caughnawaga R.C.

My delay in answering has been caused by my desire to consult my colleagues of the Metropolitan Area with regard to conditions in the various urban municipalities of the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe Montreal Catholic School Commission pays $600.00 for the services of each female religious engaged in its schools. This is the general rate for all female religious under the jurisdiction of the Montreal Commission, including supervising principals and their assistants, as well as special teachers, such as domestic science instructors etc. An exception has been made in the case of the central high school for girls (Thomas D'Arcy McGee H.S., Girls' Section). In this school, the Principal receives $900.00 and each of the teachers, $700.00.\n\nIn most of the schools under the direction of religious orders, there are also a few lay teachers. The latter receive salaries according to the same scale which obtains in schools under lay direction. Boys' schools are directed by male religious or by lay teachers. Male religious principals receive $850.00, assistants and teachers, $650.00.\n\nThe Catholic School Commission of Westmount (School Municipality of St-L\u00e9on de Westmount) pays $575.00 to each female religious teacher and $675.00 to the Principal and her Assistant. In most of the other municipalities in the vicinity of Montreal, the rate is the same as in Montreal proper. In a few of the towns, the salary of the principal is $100.00 to $200.00 higher.\nIn all cases, the Commission provides a residence for the religious, with the number of rooms usually required in such houses, including chapel, common room, library etc. The School Commission pays for heat and light. Sometimes the religious are housed in a building belonging to their community. In such an event, the Commission pays rent to the religious congregation. If the residence is at some distance from the school, the school corporation assumes the cost of transportation.\n\nThese conditions are substantially the same in all the towns of the Montreal area, with very slight differences. Some local corporations assume the cost of certain other expenses, such as the wages of a cook, while others do not.\n\nIn Montreal (1935-36), the average number of pupils per classroom was 35.43. This information was derived from the printed Financial Report of the Montreal Catholic School Commission for the year 1935-36, the last available general record.\n\nThe average number of pupils per room in the Catholic schools of Verdun during the school year 1936-37 was 30.8 in the English classes and 35.7 in the French classes. This information was obtained from the local inspector.\n\nThe average number of pupils per room in the Catholic schools of Westmount during the school year 1936-37 was 21.3, or 26.4 in the English classes and 16.0 in the French classes. The small number of pupils per room in the French section, is due to the fact that the Commission provides a classroom for every grade and that the French-speaking pupils are in the minority. This information is from my own records.\n\nThe average number of pupils per classroom in your graded schools of Caughnawaga during 1936-37 was 30.3. However, at the time of my inspection visit to these schools, several pupils had left on account of illness or through moving away from the Reserve. The actual number of pupils per room, in attendance, was 27.0.\n\nAs a general rule, the Montreal Catholic School Commission requires the following numbers for the opening of new classrooms: 48 pupils for a Preparatory Class or 1st Grade, 40 for a 2nd or 3rd Grade, 35 for a 4th Grade, 30 for a 5th or 6th Grade, 25 for a 7th or 8th Grade or for a High School class. Of course, this rule cannot be applied to the letter; it must be adapted to local conditions, including the size of the rooms available. A new class is not opened unless the division of a class or classes will give a reasonable number of pupils for the new room. Classes, once opened are not closed unless the attendance drops too far below the required number.\nI trust that the foregoing information will be of some use to your Department in the consideration of the request for a new teachers' residence for the Sisters at Caughnawaga. Their present living quarters are certainly far from adequate for the number of religious teachers engaged in your schools.\n\nYour present scale of salaries for the religious teachers in your Caughnawaga schools is higher than the average paid to religious in the vicinity of Montreal. However, teachers' salaries are generally too low in Quebec at the present time. If I may be permitted to express a personal opinion, I respectfully suggest that this be borne in mind, as well as the fact that the Sisters in your schools are teaching boys and girls. In most of our boys' schools in the Province of Quebec, the teachers are Brothers or lay teachers, who receive higher remuneration than the Sisters.\n\nShould you or some other representative of your Department be in Montreal, it would be a pleasure for me to confer with you or to obtain any information that you might consider useful in this or in any other matter pertaining to the good of your schools.\n\nWith the Season's Greetings and very best wishes for a Happy New Year,\n\nI remain\n\nyours sincerely,\n\nA. E. Wescott,\nInspector of Schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's memorandum of December 10th in connection with the request for a new residence for the teachers of the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School, the following information has been obtained from Mr. A.E. Wescott, Inspector of Schools, Montreal, Quebec.\n\n\"In all cases, the Commission provides a residence for the religious, with the number of rooms usually required in such houses, including chapel, common room, library etc. The School Commission pays for heat and light.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn the year 1917 when the Reverend Sisters were first placed in charge of the Caughnawaga R. C. School the Department purchased a house from an Indian to serve as a Sisters' residence. Since that time the staff at the R. C. School has increased and as a result we have from time to time constructed additions to the original house.\n\nAt the present time we have 15 Reverend Sisters employed in the Caughnawaga R. C. School and there are also two or three Sisters to do the necessary house work. This means that approximately 18 persons are occupying this residence. For the last few years frequent complaints have been received from the Reverend Sisters regarding this building. I would appreciate it if you would arrange to have one of your architects visit Caughnawaga in the near future and inspect this building very carefully with a view to determining if the present residence could be remodelled in order to make the Reverend Sisters more comfortable or if a new teachers' residence should be erected on a different site. In either case the architect should let me have an estimate of the amount of expenditure that would be involved as we are considering providing funds for the purpose in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40. It is for this reason that I requested above that you arrange to have your architect visit Caughnawaga as soon as possible.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Teachers' residence,\nCaughnawaga R.C. Indian\nDay School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 16th instant, I may say that arrangements are being made for Mr. Harris to visit Caughnawaga Indian Reserve and make the inspection you request, with a view to preparing a report and estimate of cost, when he is returning from Nova Scotia in the near future.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sister Cleophas:\n\nMr. Harris, the architect of the Surveys & Engineering Branch who visited Caughnawaga recently, phoned me this morning and stated that you advised him that when you visited the Department a couple of years ago in connection with the proposed new teachers' residence you left some plans.\n\nThis morning I have reviewed our files very carefully and while I can find correspondence with reference to your visit I cannot find a trace of any plans or any statement of your requirements. I feel certain that if you left this with us at the time you came to Ottawa it would have been placed on file. If the plans were left loose in the office it would be impossible to locate them at the present time due to the fact that all the offices have been changed since that time and most of us are in new locations.\n\nWhile we are by no means certain that we can secure a new residence for you during the coming fiscal year at the same time we are going to make another determined effort to secure the necessary funds.\n\nI am sorry to trouble you but, as noted in the first part of this letter, if the plans that you mention were mislaid by us there is nothing that can be done about it now.\n\nRev. Sister Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nR. C. Indian School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nIf you will let me have a statement indicating the rooms that you require it will be all that will be necessary. For instance you should state:\n\n(a) Number of bedrooms\n(b) Dining room\n(c) Kitchen\n(d) Staff room\n(e) Chapel\n(f) Any other rooms that you consider necessary\n\nWith this information the architects can prepare their own plans and estimate the cost.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nOct. 7, 1938.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nTO Sister Mary Cleophas,\nPrincipal.\n\nTransportation of Teachers for the month of\nSeptember at $30.00\n\n$30.00\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO Reverend Sister Mary Cleophas,\n\nADDRESS Principal,\n\nRe: Indian Day Schools,\n\nCaukhnawaga, Que.\n\nDATE SERVICE AMOUNT\n\n08/7 ENCLOSURE.\n\nTo transportation of R.C. teachers from the residence and back from the schools at Caukhnawaga Indian Reserve during the month of September, 1956, at $20.00 per month.\n\nAuth.

It would be much appreciated if a new stove could be purchased to replace this old one and this, at your earliest convenience.\n\nThe stove has six lids and is of the ordinary type used only for cooking purposes. No waterfront is needed.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the cooking stove in the Sisters' residence at Caughnawaga. At the present time our funds are practically exhausted and it is, therefore, extremely doubtful if we can consider purchasing a new cook stove before the first of April.\n\nHowever, you might let me have more detailed information regarding the stove required stating, if possible, a catalogue number. We require this information for the Purchasing Branch. When your reply is received further consideration will be given to the matter.\n\nRegarding your letter of the 20th instant in which you state that the Rev. Sister Superior has requested 6 blankets I would point out that while formerly we did so the Department does not now supply such equipment. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Rev. Sisters to purchase these blankets from their own funds and, of course, in that event, the blankets will be their property.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

The roof on the teachers' residence has been more or less defective for the past few years. Mr. Robert has repaired it time and again with tar, etc., but it has reached such a point that he claims he can do nothing more.\n\nWhenever we have a rainstorm, one sister is obliged to pick up her blankets and mattress and put up in the corridor. There is always a regiment of pallets and cots ready to be laid out in the said bedroom. For the same reason, the toilet room on the second floor cannot be used during bad weather.\n\nBefore snow comes in for the winter, we would ask you to approve the repairing of the roof. We would have just the absolutely necessary work done.\n\nWe are anxious for you to see our parlor and community room. What an improvement two coats of paint have done to this part of the house.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for all your kindness to us and we beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Caughnawaga R.C.

Sister Superior of Caughnawaga complained of the bad condition of the roof of their residence.\n\nAs requested I obtained an estimate for its repairing, from Mr. I.

Garand, Roofing Contractor, Chateauguay Basin, Que., and J. Bte. Mathieu, Roofing Contractor, Beauharnois, Que.\n\n(b) That tenders do not appear to be based on any particular type of workmanship or materials.\n\n(c) That tenders differ with regard to the amount and character of work included.\n\n(d) That totals of various items cannot be compared, and thus have no significance.\n\nUnder the circumstances, neither tender should be given consideration.\n\nIn this connection, I may say that if Indian Agents, when obtaining tenders on Departmental work, would advise your officers in detail regarding items upon which tradespeople are instructed to tender and also assure themselves that the work considered necessary is neither exceeded nor omitted by any tenderer, such action would establish a proper basis for comparison of tenders.\n\nPlans with specifications or bills of material, prepared by this Service, as a basis for tendering would ensure uniformity of tenders, and can always be furnished within a reasonable time after complete information on the work is available.\n\nIn the present instance, it is recommended that action be deferred until a careful examination of the roof can be made by officers of this Service, and a specification of the work prepared.\n\nYour file 5-1-8, Vol. 6, is returned herewith.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.A.

Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Residence for Rev. Sisters of Ste. Anne, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nWith reference to the above, you are advised that on the 20th ultimo, this Service was requested verbally by officers of the Indian Affairs Branch to analyze two tenders which had been obtained by the Indian Agent at Caughnawaga for work on the roof of the building, which is the residence of the Reverend Sisters who teach school on the Reserve.\n\nUpon examination, the tenders were found to have no basis for comparison as either the work included or its cost, and Mr. Hoey was advised that in our opinion further action on the matter should be deferred until our Architect was able to examine the roof and establish what work was required, and the best means of carrying it out.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Buck visited Caughnawaga on the 27th ultimo, and examined the roof in company with the Indian Agent.\n\nMr. Buck now reports as follows:\n\nThe teachers' residence is a building purchased by the Department about twenty-five years ago, to which it appears a rear wing has at some time been added.\n\nAn interior examination of ceilings and upper walls confirmed complaints that roof leakages exist in numerous places, and plaster and decorating show damage.\n\nThe flat roof over the original portion of the building is of built-up felt and gravel, while the flat roof of the rear wing is metal covered. Points in the vicinity of the leaks have been repaired, but the felt and gravel roof is decomposing, and the metal covered area is corroding through at many points. The perished condition of all roof covering is of long standing, since moisture discharges from broken roofing blisters and rust spots can be produced by foot pressure. It is evident that considerable roof boarding is decayed, and it will likely be found that some of the structural members are in the same condition.\n\nIt is apparent that general maintenance on the building has been neglected, and a considerable amount of repair and replacement work could be carried out to advantage, particularly to the exterior; but it is understood the Indian Affairs Branch wish to restrict consideration of immediate expense to the roof, consequently detailed information on other items was not prepared.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nUnder the circumstances outlined, therefore, it is recommended that all the existing roofing material should be removed and replaced by a new five-ply bonded roof covering, the cost of which would be based on a specification prepared by this Service covering the necessary labour and materials, and upon which competitive tenders could be invited.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of the work, including supervision expenses, would be in the neighbourhood of $800.00.\n\nUnless advised to the contrary, it is proposed to prepare a specification and call for tenders on the work as soon as possible.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nApril 23rd, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Residence for Rev. Sisters of Ste. Anne, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nOn March 20th our Engineering and Construction Service was requested by officers of your Branch, to analyze two tenders which had been obtained by the Indian Agent at Caughnawaga, covering repairs to the roof of the above building.\n\nI am attaching herewith, for your information, a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, dated April 16th, and which appears to cover this matter.\n\nYou will note that the estimated cost of the work is $800.00, and that the Engineering and Construction Service are preparing a specification and tender call.\n\nPlease advise if the latter action is satisfactory from your viewpoint.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of March 13 last in which you enclosed quotations received from J.B.

The quotations were submitted to the Surveys & Engineering Branch but they decided to have Mr. Buck visit the building before deciding on the tenders. As you are aware, he was at Caughnawaga on March 20 and it has now been decided to call for new tenders.

She stated that they did not intend to use it as it is not what was supposed to have been supplied, as this one has to be emptied every other month by the janitors.\n\nRelative to this chemical toilet I wish to say that the salesman of Thomas Robertson was requested to call at the school, through the Raymond Hardware Co., before the purchase was made in order to advise as to the suitable type of toilet to be supplied, taking into consideration the number of persons who would use it etc.,. When it was explained that there are only six teachers who are there during the school hours, he recommended the purchase of the one delivered, stating that this type would amply meet the need; hence its purchase.\n\nThe Superior is and was under the impression that the toilet to be supplied would cost about $200.00 and would be of the regular type which empties in a septic tank.\n\nRelative to the roof the Sisters would appreciate if that work could be started on or about the 28th instant, as they leave on that date for ten days, going for their annual retreat.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This work is in addition to what was covered in my memorandum of April 23rd and together with certain repairs, the full extent of which cannot be determined until the work is actually being done, will increase the cost by possibly some $500 in addition to the $800 mentioned in my memorandum.\n\nAs this additional work has been discussed and tentatively agreed upon with officers of your Branch, unless you advise us to the contrary we will proceed to accept a bid of $1,235.50 submitted by Isaie Garand, of Chateauquay, P.Q., with the further understanding that -\n\n1.

We still have a sufficient quantity of oil to last about two months. It is the intention to have this oil used at heating the residence or should it be turned over to a dealer.\n\nIf the changing of the furnace from oil heating to coal heating takes place at the beginning of the winter it may be that the residence will not be heated for one or one and a half day, pending the installation of the grates etc.,.

The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could have Mr. Buck measure the coal bins at the Eastern and Kateri Indian Day Schools at the time of his next visit to Caughnawaga.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, September 1, 1942.\n\nRe: Heating facilities,\nTeacher's Residence, Caughnawaga\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you seek departmental instructions in respect to the heating equipment that should be installed in the teacher's residence.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Chief Executive Assistant communicated with the Oil Controller a few weeks ago with respect to this matter. I regret to state, however, that at this date no reply has been received. In view of announcements that have recently appeared in the Press, I am hopeful that we shall be permitted to continue with the consumption of fuel oil. I shall communicate with you again in respect to this matter, just as soon as a definite ruling has been received by this Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, September 5, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Morgan:\n\nI must express regret that I did not discuss with you, at the time of my visit to your office a few days ago, a number of urgent requests that have reached this Branch in respect to the consumption of fuel oil at the Caughnawaga teachers' residence on the Caughnawaga Reserve, Que.\n\nI note from the files that this matter was brought to your attention by the Deputy Minister in letters dated July 18 and August 15, 1942.\n\nThe Caughnawaga teachers' residence is an old stone building which, had it not been for the years of depression and the outbreak of war, would have been replaced by a new building. At present it provides accommodation for 16 teachers. These teachers belong to the religious Order of St. Ann and the building is, in many respects, convenient. We have at present in the small basement an oil tank and an oil burning furnace. It will be necessary to remove this tank in order to secure space for coal and it will be necessary, also, to reconstruct the furnace. No provision has been made in our estimates of this year for the money necessary for these alterations. In addition to this, the Nuns will no doubt resent the presence of a caretaker in the building, whose presence will be necessary to look after the coal burning furnace. In view of this fact, I am convinced that should we decide to burn coal this year we will be compelled to revert again to the burning of oil just as soon as the supply of oil for this purpose is available. I naturally hesitate to undertake these alterations and incur this expense, to meet a condition that appears to be temporary. Would it be possible for you to review this request and let us have a decision at an early date?\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very sincerely for the permission granted us for the use of fuel oil at the Indian hospital, Morley, Alberta?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) H. W. McGill,\nDirector.\n\nA. S. Morgan, Esq.,\nOffice of the Oil Controller,\nDepartment of Munitions and Supply,\n15 King Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, September 24, 1942.\n\nRe: Heating of Sisters' Residence,\nCaughnawaga R. C. Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of August 28, in which you sought information in respect to the marginally-noted subject.\n\nAlthough we have been in constant communication with the Oil Controller, the chances of securing the oil sufficient for this purpose appear to be exceedingly remote. I am disposed to think that you should allow the Sisters to consume the oil now on hand and make provision for the adjustments necessary to start heating the residence with coal at a later date. It is just possible that a little inconvenience may be caused to the Sisters while these adjustments are being made. However, I cannot see how this can be avoided. You might let us know in due course the amount of coal that will be necessary for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of September 5th dealing with Caughnawaga Teachers' Residence.\n\nHere again we are placed in a most difficult position since we have prohibited the use of fuel oil for the heating of all convents and institutions etc., and while it may be a difficult matter for you to obtain the necessary funds, I am sure you will readily appreciate that if we granted an exemption in this case we would be asked to afford the same treatment in many other instances where the conversion is a very difficult and costly matter.\n\nWe would urge you, therefore, to investigate this matter and see if it is not possible for you to convert to some alternative means of firing.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nA.

Repairs to the electric refrigerator -- this machine apparently is not working properly, as the Sisters have had considerable food spoiled. Please arrange to have it repaired immediately.\n\n2. Please obtain prices for painting the verandah in front of the teachers' residence.\n\n3. Painting, or papering, or possibly both, is required in two of the bedrooms in this building.

Please have the contractor who put the new roof on the building examine the roof immediately with a view to ascertaining what additional work is required.\n\nDirector.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nJune 12, 1943.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq., Supp., of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant dealing with the recent visit of Mr. Phelan at Caughnawaga when the Sister Superior made certain requests:\n\n1. Relative to the repairs to the electric refrigerator, I wish to say that about a month ago the McFarland Refrigerator Co., of Montreal were requested to come and repair the refrigerator. A service man came and repaired same but apparently the machine went out of order a few days later as only half of the coils are giving enough cold. Arrangements have been made to have the above repaired immediately.\n\n2. You will find herewith a price for the painting of the verandah etc., and also for the painting or papering of two of the bedrooms in the teacher's residence. Price obtained from Mr. Louis Saylor who is the only painter here. Note; all cracks in walls of bedrooms will have to be filled for either painting or papering.\n\nENCL.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 14, 1943.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, you may arrange with Louis Saylor to paint the verandah of the teachers' residence and also for the painting of the two bedrooms in the same residence. It is noted that he will supply all materials and labour for an amount of $115.00.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nJuly 22, 1943.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq., Supt., of Welfare & Education, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 14th ultimo in which authority was granted for the teacher's residence and also of two bedrooms in the same building and to advise that the work is almost all completed.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Sister Superior has requested me to further communicate with you in order to request that the roof of the verandah, which was not included in the original estimate of the painter amounting to $115.00, be painted as it is all rusted which is badly showing especially as the wood work has now been done. This would also protect the roof from further damage.\n\nI am therefore enclosing an estimate in writing from Mr. Louis Sayler who did the painting as authorized.\n\nKindly let me know if this request will be granted.\n\n(Frs.

Indian Agent Brisebois further reports that inspection after heavy rains shows that no further leakage has occurred.\"\n\nIn view of the above, it is presumed that this roof is now in good condition.\n\nR.A.

Brisebois,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wrote you on October 18th, 1943 re the refrigeration at the convent of the Sisters of Ste Anne, Caughnawaga.\n\nAs mentioned in our letter we have installed one of our old units on this refrigerator, temporarily. We would like to get possession of this unit before Spring so that we can put it in better condition than it now is.\n\nWe do not wish to put the Sisters to any inconvenience but would like to secure our unit within the next two months, if possible.\n\nYour remarks on this matter will be appreciated as soon as convenient.\n\nYours very truly\nMcParland Refrigeration Reg'd.\n\nTGM/mm\n\nManager.\nCaughnawaga, January 20th, 1944.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Can.\n\nI wish to refer to my voucher No. 466, dated October 22nd, in favour of Messrs. McFarland Refrigeration Reg'd., of Westmount, for repairs made to the refrigerator at the Caughnawaga R.C. Teachers' residence, and more particularly to a communication from the above Company, which was attached to this voucher, concerning the repairs necessitated by this unit, together with their recommendations.\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith a further communication from this Company, which is self-explanatory, and I would kindly ask you to let me have your views on the matter so that I can advise them accordingly.\n\nFr. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the refrigerator at the Caughnawaga R.C. teachers' residence. While neither the company's letter of October 18 nor their letter of January 18 is exactly clear, we are now under the impression that the unit which the company installed was only intended to remain at the Caughnawaga School temporarily and that, if they remove it now, the refrigeration equipment will be useless. On the other hand it might be inferred from the company's letter of the 18th instant that they only wish to recondition the unit and would be prepared to install it again in the refrigerator.\n\nThe first alternative would require the purchase of a new coil at an approximate cost of $355.00. Neither at the present time nor in the immediate future can the Department hold out any hope that authority can be obtained for the purchase of this.\n\nIf the second alternative is correct, it would only be a matter of your interviewing the Principal of the school, as it would simply mean that the Sisters would be without the use of the refrigerator for a few weeks and possibly this is the best time of the year to have this happen.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nFebruary 9, 1944.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq., Supt., of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo dealing with the refrigerator at the Caughnawaga R.C. teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I wish to say that the Company after examination of the unit found out that it could not be repaired economically. Pending the decision of the Department they installed one of their unit which is presently in use but these people now would like to get their unit back so that they can place it elsewhere.\n\nApparently only the refrigerator box could now be used.\n\n(Fr.

Agent\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, April 24, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe wish to tell you all our gratitude for obtaining relief from the condition brought about by the burning of the heating unit in the teachers' residence. The new unit is now installed and the house is comfortable.\n\nIt seems that everything collapses at the same time. May I call your attention again to the condition of our ice-box? This morning, I was called to the kitchen and sister showed me all she was obliged to throw away because of lack of refrigeration. Much of the $12.00 order of meat brought in on Saturday, was unfit for use and so many other things. This has happened so often of late. It seems a shame that food goes to waste when so many are suffering from hunger in the world today.\n\nYou promised that you would see to it last October and again in January, you wrote Mr. Brisebois that Mr. Doucet would take the necessary steps on his next visit. Mr. Doucet has been here twice since then. He has examined the box and has admitted that it is useless to expect any more service from it. It was installed some twenty years ago. Are we too exacting?\n\nWe feel certain that you are going to do all you can for us and we thank you for it and for so many other kindnesses of which we have benefited in the past.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had this machine examined on several occasions and last October we secured the attached quotation from Maryland Refrigeration Reg'd. A representative of this firm visited the residence and examined the frigidaire and considers that the unit mentioned will be satisfactory. We have 14 Sisters teaching in the Caughnawaga School who occupy the teachers' residence and in addition we have two or three other Sisters to do the household work. Just recently they complained that owing to lack of refrigeration they lost a great deal of food. In view of the near approach of warmer weather we feel it is absolutely essential to install this new unit at the earliest possible date.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

The structural frame would be of reinforced concrete, with exterior walls of brick and tile. Interior partitions are intended to be of gypsum or terra cotta tile construction, and the whole interior finished in painted plaster.\n\nAs will be seen on examination, accommodation has been provided for a staff of 20, with necessary kitchen and dining room space, and toilet facilities. A large common room and two reception rooms on the lower floor provide space for off-duty activities. A one storey wing at the rear of the building houses the chapel.\n\nThe building is intended to be heated by steam from a central plant which could also serve the new school. It is estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $60,000.00\n\nThe sketches are submitted for examination by the interested officers of the Indian Affairs Branch, and doubtless a number of changes will be required before working drawings are undertaken.\n\nEncls.\n\nJ.

Our teachers are much pleased with it and wish to convey their appreciation for this useful object which will be at their disposal now. We are pleased to note also that the Department has begun to fill out our requisition for we have already received several articles.\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of our programme for our Commencement Exercises. Mr. Hoey's letter held a promise of a visit from you or Mr. Phelan on June nineteenth. We were disappointed not to see you then. No doubt some pressing work must have prevented you from coming.\n\nWe thank you also for authorizing the painting of the second floor of our residence. May we draw your attention to the fact that many of our teachers are away during the month of July and therefore this would be the most appropriate time to have the work done. Would it be possible to hasten the Purchasing Department about the paint required for this work? We have just sent the required quotations for the library, the phonograph and the mixer which we requisitioned in May. We trust the prices will be accepted or that at least something equivalent will be sent to us.\n\nWe hope that the summer months will bring you a pleasant and restful vacation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Bernard F.

He claims that his own washing machine is now out of order and beyond repairs.\n\nElectric heaters are always a costly proposition and it might be preferable to supply the teacher with a small oil heater as this will only be used to supplement the downstairs heater. Small size heaters could be obtained locally at the following prices, Coleman $72.95, Silent Glow $49.50 and a Portable heater for $39.50.\n\nPlease let me have your views in the above.\n\n(Frs.

This heater is in first class condition and gives entire satisfaction. Price paid $40.00 instead of $72.95.\n\nMay I say that the difficulty encountered to heat Mr. Visu's residence properly is due to the fact that the circulation of the heat is poor.\n\nIn order to boost the circulation of the air it is suggested that an electric fan be obtained. This it is believed would improve the situation, as it has done at the Agency office.\n\nA fan could be obtained for approximately $15.00, locally. In view of the fact that there has been a saving effected in the purchase of the oil heater, it is recommended that a fan be purchased, as it will no doubt give satisfaction.\n\n(Fr.

Brousseau, Esq:\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nAt a meeting of the Caughnawaga Council held on June 8, 1906, in the Council hall, \n\nIt was unanimously resolved that a fence of spruce plank six feet high be built on the street passing the boys' school, the cost of which will be about $65.00, namely; $50.00 for material and $15.00 for labour; and also that privies be built for the use of the said school, the cost of which will be about $25.00; this is an urgent necessity as has already been seen by Mr. Benson and Inspector Macrae.\n\nJ. B. Daillebout, Chief Councillor,\n\nAttested J. Blain, Agent.\n\nCopy J. Blain, I. A.\n\nAgents covering letter dated 15th June\nOttawa, February 25th, 1910.\n\nChief,\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Benson of this Department will be in Caughnawaga on Tuesday morning, next, the 1st proximo, with plans of the new school house it is proposed to erect in the village.\n\nThe Department would like you and the Councillors to meet Mr. Benson at the Council House, say at 11 A.M., to discuss the proposition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Michael Daillebont,\nChief Councillor,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nAs instructed I went over to Caughnawaga on the morning of the 1st instant in company with Mr. Agent Blain. We drove to the office, where a number of Indians were waiting for Mr. Blain. Chief Councillor Dailabont was there and I suggested that we should meet at 1 P.M. and discuss the plans of the new school it is proposed to erect in the Village. In the interval I called on Father Granger. He was in Montreal on Business, but his assistant promised to attend the meeting, which was held in the Boy's School, the office being too small and the Council Chamber too cold.\n\nAt 1 P.M. the Agent, Priest, Councillors and 75 members of the Band were present, J. W. Josks acting as interpreter. I showed and explained to them the plans and we discussed them and the site. The majority of the Indians were against a graded school, while Father Granger and some of the most intelligent members of the Band advocated having two schools, one for the girls and one for the boys, as at present. Miss Howlett is also in favour of this arrangement. She has lived on the Reserve for the past six years and is competent to express an opinion as she has been in charge of the Girl's School and knows the feeling of the Indians as regards the co-education of the sexes. While the graded school at Pierreville is a great success under the Grey Nuns I doubt if it would be suited to Caughnawaga even if the objections I have mentioned were overcome. The Indians as a whole are not so far advanced and not so anxious for the education of their children.\n\nFather Granger told me that the co-education of\nthe sexes is contrary to the rules of his Order, and it would not be politic to go counter to the rules of the Jesuits, who have charge of the Mission of Caughnawaga.\n\nThe plans I had with me provided for separate rooms for the boys and girls, with separate entrances, but this was objected to for much the same reason by the Priest, who wished the sexes to be kept apart. There would also be the question of the teacher's priority and authority, which would likely lead to trouble.\n\nAfter carefully considering the question I am of opinion that separate schools for the boys and girls of the Village should be continued.\n\nThe site of the present school would allow of no provision for play grounds, as it is only 175 feet by 100 feet, with the Lock-up in the middle of the lot at the rear.\n\nThe Indians were in favour of a site which would give room for a large play ground and suggested that a portion of the common near the new cemetery should be chosen. I walked out there with Mr. DeLisle, the head teacher of the Boys' School, and Constable Twoaxe. There is plenty of room and the ground is high and dry and could be easily drained. It is at the back of the Village, about half a mile in rear of the Main street. It was raining hard and the road was breaking up and could not be worse at any season of the year, but I did not find any of the streets in the Village in a better condition, and I think that, if it is decided to build two schools, it would be well suited for the Boys' School. The Girls' School would then be put up on the present school site, which is the best that could be found, being in the centre of the Village opposite the Church and roomy enough.\n\nThe adoption of the proposal to have two schools\non the sites referred to, which are indicated on the accompanying blue prints of the Village, would in my opinion satisfy all concerned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Granger our parish priest.\n\nWe would like to ask the Department's enlightenment on the matter. On March 1st, ult., the question of site was suggested to us and we then decided the same to be near the cemetery, it being the most central at the present time and within the vicinity of the inevitable future expansion of the village; hence the proposed change coming as it does without our consultation, it does not meet with our approbation. We extremely regret that we must feel that this question has been co-opted by the influence of the ecclesiastical authorities to whom notwithstanding the deference due them, we cannot allow\nallow participation nor influence in our public affairs.\n\nWe do not consider it necessary to refer you to article \"f\" of Sub-section 2 of Section 194 Indian Act, for our stand and action.\n\nTrusting to be favored with an early reply:\n\nWe pray to remain\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nthe Council of Caughnawaga.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Dailleboust,\nChief Councillor,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nschools, and, even if such regulations had been passed, they would only apply to the expenditure of Band funds.

Agent Letourneau suggested the choice of numbers 648, 649 and 750 of the village of Caughnawaga, or some other neighbouring vacant lots; but on account of the nearness of the cemetery, the too great distance of the habitations, and the very probable difficulty, on account of the nature of the soil, of making solid foundations, the council is of opinion that it would be better for the Department to purchase lot 460, belonging to L.F. Jackson, of the Caughnawaga village; this lot measures 193 feet in depth by 211 feet in length.\n\nL. Letourneau\nAsst.

Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nCAUGHNAWAGA.\n\nSt. CONSTANT, 31st April, 1911\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No 153652/1, dated 19th inst., I beg to inform you in regard to the site for the proposed new Boys' School, that Mr L. F. Jackson is asking four hundred ($400.00) dollars on his Lot No 460 of the Village of Caughnawaga.\n\nI certainly feel uneasy about a definite recommendation which is to be made to your Department as to the site for the proposed Boys' School in the Village of Caughnawaga, but, I cannot recommend to build this school near the cemetery, because it is too far out of the village, and I think it will be almost impossible for the children to attend school during part of the winter, specially for the little ones on stormy days, while Lot No 460 is centrally situated, high enough and dry.\n\nHowever, I wish that an Officer from your Department comes to Caughnawaga for a final decision, before you give your approval to either one of these Lots.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst-Indian Agent\nOttawa, April 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant regarding the site for the proposed new Boys' School, in which you state that you cannot recommend the site near the cemetery on account of the distance from the village, while the Jackson lot recommended by the Council is centrally situated and can be had for $400.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department wishes to have the new school building erected on a high, dry site where there would be good drainage and ample room for play grounds. The new building will be an ornament to the village and should be placed where it can be seen to advantage and not on a flat surrounded by the back yards of houses.\n\nAs regards the question of distance, the site on the hill near the cemetery is less than three quarters of a mile from any home at either end of the village and the road leading to it could at very small outlay be made passable at all seasons of the year. In bad weather children would not have to go home at the noon hour as there is provision in the upper story of the new building for a play room and a place where they can take their lunch. The Department will not pay the price asked by Mr. Jackson for his lot while there is ample unoccupied ground suitable for the purpose available.\n\nAs the tenders are called for by the 8th proximo the site will\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nwill have to be settled before that date. The Department approved of the site near the cemetery and unless some stronger objections than those you mention can be furnished it will adhere to its selection.\n\nNo one can be spared from the Department at present to go to Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

There are three lots in view, one near the cemetery and two in the village. In order that work may be commenced with as little delay as possible I have to ask you to proceed tomorrow to Caughnawaga and carefully look into the merits of each of the lots as sites for the school building and report to the Department, making such recommendations as you see fit. Should you think it advisable you are authorized to request Mr. Jacobs to withhold from auction on the 3rd prox. Lot 657, one of the proposed sites, until such time as a final decision is reached by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn compliance with instructions I visited Caughnawaga on Wednesday and Thursday, last, for the purpose of inspecting the sites suggested for the new Boys' School, the contract for which has been let. Three different sites were suggested, one near the cemetery, one No. 460, the property of Mr. Jackson, on the cemetery road, and one on the main road in the village, lot No. 687.\n\nA great many of the Indians object to the cemetery site on account of the distance from the main part of the village and I think myself that their objection is well founded. The distance, especially in winter, would be objectionable and the road leading to this site is in very bad condition; in fact the Department would have to spend considerable money in providing a culvert and filling in for a considerable distance where the road at present is very low and subject to floods in the spring time.\n\nLot No. 687 on the main road has good frontage, but some fifty feet from the street there is a sudden slope and\nthe back part of the lot is quite low, the level being perhaps some eight feet below that of the front of the lot.\n\nThe portion of the common at the rear which, it was suggested, could be used in conjunction with this lot for a play ground, etc., is very low and stony. Moreover, this lot is at present in liquidation, it being one of the parcels of land which are being sold by Mr. Jacobs, Curator of the Estate of Mr. Montour, insolvent. The sale has, I understand, been postponed by order of the Department for a week and I anticipate that there will be considerable delay before the title of Mr. Montour to all of this property, which is to be sold by the order of the Superior Court, is established.\n\nMr. Jackson's lot is situated on the cemetery road, 185 feet from the main street. It contains approximately an acre and is, in my opinion, a very favourable site. I should have preferred a site on the main street had a suitable one been available, but this is so close to the street that, except in so far as the view is concerned, there could be no serious objection. This piece of land will provide ample play grounds, something that is wanting at the other two schools in the village.\n\nI was very much pleased with the two new buildings which were erected last year. It seems too bad that buildings\nof this class should be erected where there is hardly even a piece of ground for a blade of grass to grow. The surroundings detract very much from the general appearance of the buildings.\n\nMr. Jackson places a value of $300.00 upon this lot and Dr. Patton, the Mayor, informed me that the Council would be willing to pay that amount from the Band Funds for the site. The Council meets today and it may be that a resolution to that effect will be passed. In any event I think that it is advisable for the Department to purchase this lot rather than to take the free site at the cemetery.\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| 1911 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. **** dated ***** |        |\n| June 10 | To one acre of land cleared from trees stumps and underbrush, cut to the ground and burnt, this being for the site of the new St. Isidore Road School. | $30.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is a practice the Department wishes to have stopped at once and you will be good enough to notify the Mayor and Council to this effect.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nWhen the choice for the Caughnawaga Boys' School site was made there was, to my mind, one objection. It is this; on the corner adjoining the lot there is a stable which greatly blocks the view of the school from the main street. It would be an improvement if this stable could be moved to the other side of the lot upon which it is situated. The owner is a widow who keeps a small grocery store and while there would be some disadvantage to her, as she would have to make a driveway through her lot and thus lose some of her garden space, I think if she would agree to a reasonable sum the Department should negotiate with her to have the building removed.

Continuing from which point obliquely for 82 ft. 4\" to an angle to measure 15 ft. 10\" from the North east corner of said school, hence due south to a point found at 11 ft. 9\" and running parallel of the Eastern end of said building, so as to have an\nintervening space of not more or less than 42 ft. and the line to run diagonally for 42 ft. to the centre of the Eastern extremity of the old fortification wall just in front of the Iroquois house.\n\nMitchell, the proprietor of the said Iroquois house has been consulted by the members of the Council, and agreed to this arrangement provided however that neither the Council nor the Department will not encroach any further than the line now given as per sketch attached adopted.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed copy of a resolution adopted unanimously by the Councilors of Caughnawaga at a meeting held the 27th instant. I can't approve this resolution because this question was studied by the representative of the Department and I find he was right in declining to fix the fence around the Girls School grounds where it is constructed now. All the posts of that fence are fixed in cement and it will cause much work to draw them out. The reason that the Councilors give for such a resolution is that there is encroachment on the common. In consulting Indian Treaties & Surrenders, Vol. 1-2 Page 206, Vol. 3, I find the agreement between a named Jacques Philib & the Government in which the bounds of the ground in question are given. Those limits have been observed in fixing the fence, and there is no reason for complaint by the Band.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.M. Brosseau\nInd. Agent\n\nJ. D.

Before the Department comes to a final decision in this question, I should like to make known my manner of looking at it. When the fence was placed where it is at present, the boundary marks of the Government land were observed, and no one is suffering from it. If by your decision this fence is removed, it will give to these recalcitrant Indians an importance that they have not, and it will create a precedence that will always cause much annoyance to the agent.

Avant que le D\u00e9partement prenne une d\u00e9cision finale sur cette question, je tiens \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre ma mani\u00e8re de voir sur ce sujet : En plantant la cl\u00f4ture ou elle est pr\u00e9sentement, les bornes du terrain du Gouvernement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es et personne n'en souffre. Si, par votre d\u00e9cision, cette cl\u00f4ture est d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, cela donnera \u00e0 ces Indiens sp\u00e9cialement une importance qu'ils n'ont pas et ce serait un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui causerait tous les malentendus entre nous et l'Agent. Je ne peux pas \u00eatre en mesure de faire une d\u00e9cision et donc je vous prie de choisir un organiser une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 Ottawa.

He will supply the material and do the work as indicated in your letter for the sum of $72.00. He asks $36.00 for the work. When they took down the fence of the girls' school, John Sky told me that there were four posts left which he had sent to Michel Delisle's place. These posts could be utilized by having the work done by the day by Viau and Sky, and I believe that it could be managed for from $25.00 to $30.00.\n\nYour, J.-H. Brousseau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.

You may, therefore, arrange with the above Company for the delivery at Adirondack Junction of 1 carload of cinders, and when this arrives you should arrange to have it hauled and spread in the yard around the school building. It is expected that you will see that the hauling and spreading is done at the lowest possible expense, and this work should be done as soon as you are able to obtain the cinders and have them hauled to the school.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.

The Department is not interested in any buildings thereon and the locates could sell or remove them. It might also be well to consider the advisability of securing Lot No. 619. You might also approach the locatee there with a view to learning what compensation he would request.

Q.\nSir,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous accuser r\u00e9ception d'une lettre r\u00e9cente du D\u00e9partement, relativement \u00e0 l'emplacement projet\u00e9 pour la nouvelle \u00e9cole qui sera construite dans le village de Caughnawaga.\n\nJe regrette que dans le cours des d\u00e9marches pour localiser ce terrain j'aie malheureusement perdu cette lettre du D\u00e9partement.\n\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 vos instructions, j'ai soigneusement examin\u00e9 toutes choses, pour ou \u00e0 l'encontre du site projet\u00e9. Finalement, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les num\u00e9ros 85, 91, 92, 93, 94 et 95 du plan du village de Caughnawaga pr\u00e9sentaient le plus d'avantages. Ces lots sont vacants, \u00e0 l'exception du num\u00e9ro 91 o\u00f9 une vieille grange s'y trouve et valant tout au plus $25.00. Ces lots occupent \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s le centre du village et sont situ\u00e9s \u00e0 une distance convenable des chemins publics qui sont toujours une cause de danger dans le voisinage des \u00e9coles. C'est aussi le site le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 en ayant la vue et l'air du lac St-Louis. Le seul inconv\u00e9nient que j'y trouve sont quelques bancs de roc solide un peu \u00e9parpill\u00e9s ici et l\u00e0, ainsi que quelques cha\u00eenes ou cl\u00f4tures de roches de champ. Il y a aussi une l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u00e9pression sur le lot num\u00e9ro 85 mais qui pourrait \u00eatre facilement combl\u00e9e avec la pierre d'alentour. Cette pierre qui semble quelque peu encombrante sur ces six lots pourrait il me semble facilement servir pour les fondations de la\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des sauvages,\nOTTAWA.\nconstruction projet\u00e9e, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la construction de la cl\u00f4ture qui devra \u00eatre construite autour du terrain de l'\u00e9cole.\n\nIl pourrait peut-\u00eatre para\u00eetre exag\u00e9r\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir une telle superficie de terrain que comprend ces six lots, mais je crois que le site que je sugg\u00e8re au D\u00e9partement d'acqu\u00e9rir \u00e9tant tout-\u00e0-fait convenable, il serait aussi bien recommandable d'isoler cette nouvelle construction, d'autant plus qu'un grand terrain de jeux est l'id\u00e9al aux \u00e9bats des enfants.\n\nSi ce projet rencontre vos vues, je serais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 entrer en pourparlers avec les d\u00e9tenteurs de ces terrains.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens,\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of a recent letter from the agent, concerning the future location of the new school to be erected in the Village of Campbell's Bay.\n\nI regret that in my travels to locate the ground I lost the department's letter.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I carefully examined everything, for and against the location of a site. Finally, I came to the conclusion that lots No. 85, 91, 92, 93, 94 and 95 of the plan of the Village of Campbell's Bay were the most convenient. These lots are vacant with the exception of 91 where stands an old barn worth at the most $25.00. These lots occupy the center of the village and are situated at a convenient distance of the public roads which are always a source of danger in the neighborhood of schools. It is also the highest site, looking towards Lake St. Louis, which it receives the first breeze.\n\nThe only disadvantage is a few beds of solid rock scattered here and there, also a few stones or boulders present. There is also a slight depression on lot 85 which could easily be filled with the surrounding stone. This stone which seems to be common on the site could easily be used for the foundations of the new building, as well as to build the fence which will need to be erected around the school grounds. It might appear expensive to acquire such a quantity of ground, costing close to $60, but I believe the suggested ground is the most appropriate, being a good place with a large play ground for the children, if the land is suitable to the purpose.\n\nI respectfully refer to the respective proprietors about it.\n\n(Signed) [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would recommend, however, that part of lot 85 and 84 be acquired, in order to provide a suitable entrance to the school grounds from the main street. The actual condition of the above mentioned property is described in the Indian Agent's report. As I am aware that the value of the land on this reserve has not increased to any extent since the purchase of the lot for the boys' school in 1911, the cost of the above mentioned land should not be excessively high.\n\nShould the Department be contemplating purchasing this land in the near future, I would suggest that an accurate survey be made of it as early as possible. I may add for your information that some of the owners of this property have expressed their intention of erecting some buildings on their lots next spring.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nDec. 24, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you are aware the Department is contemplating the purchase of a property in the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve for the proposed erection of a new school. After making an inspection of various pieces of land on this reserve it is considered that lots 85, 92, 93, 94, 95 and parts of 85 and 94 would be the most suitable on account of their nearness to the girls' school. I am enclosing herewith a blue print showing the above mentioned property, and I would ask you to interview the owners, in order to find out the price which will have to be paid for each of the lots. It will be necessary that you give your personal estimate of each of the above mentioned pieces of land. You may advise the owners that should their price be exorbitant the Department will be compelled to have recourse to the provisions of the Indian Act concerning the acquisition of land on Indian Reserves for school purposes. However, it is desired that you endeavour to secure the required information without unnecessary friction with the owners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D.

However, I am not positively certain as to the ownership of the remaining lots Nos 93 and 94 who seems the properties of Louise Pinsonnault and Mary Jacco with their children. It was for this reason that on the 12th ultimo I had written to the Department asking to refer to Official File No.9005-3 in order to ascertain whether these two lots were included into the will of the late Mary Jacco in favour of her daughters Mary and Louise with their children.\n\nUntil the question of ownership of Village Holdings be more clearly understood, I beg to ask you to send me the necessary blank forms of quit claim deeds that are to be signed in duplicate by the three first mentioned holders.\n\nIt appears to be clearly understood that Mrs Louise Bellefleur will accept an offer of $250.00 for lot No. 92, while I am awaiting for a reply from Louis Bourdeau, presently living at Detroit, whom I expect to be willing to accept an offer of $200.00 or, at the most $250.00.\n\nAs to the case of Mrs Ross who seems to be an old\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nhard nut to crack, I do not know exactly how I have to arrange in order to approach her, because she appears to be quite wild and at the same time she seems to be quite poor as to her mind and ordinary living.

You should then fill in and sign the affidavit of the witness to the signature. It is necessary that the Certificate of Title be also signed by Mrs. Bellefleur, in duplicate, and declared before you. When this has been returned to the Department, a cheque for the amount of the purchase price will be sent.\n\nAs soon as you hear from Louis Bourdeau, the owner of Lot No. 95, as to the amount he will accept, a Quit Claim Deed, in duplicate, will be sent you for his signature.\n\nRelative to Mrs. Ross, owner of Lot No. 85, as soon as we are assured as to the lowest price she will accept and also whether she will sign the Deed, the necessary documents will be sent.\n\nWe are not definitely aware as to the ownership of Lots 93 and 94, the properties of Louise Pinsomseu and Mary Jocko.

As it may be necessary to expropriate some or all of these lots, a survey will have to be made. I should be grateful if you would make the necessary arrangements.

I wish to inform you that the Department is taking over Lots 85 and 92 to 95, inclusive, for school purposes and we are compensating the Indian occupants for their interest. The intention is to erect a large day school building on Lots 85 and 93 and to use the remainder of the property for playground purposes. The top floor of the new building is to be an auditorium and will be used for general meetings, as well as for school concerts, closing exercises, etc. Further, the playground will be open to the Caughnawaga Indians for organized sport.\n\nI am sure that, when you understand the nature of the Department's plans and wishes, you will be glad to dispose of your interest in Lot 95. I am prepared to make a fair offer and, in view of the price that we have paid for Lots 92 and 93, I shall be glad to arrange a payment of $275 for your equity in Lot 95 if you will take the necessary affidavit that you are the holder of the lot and sign a Quit Claim.\n\nMay I point out that it is advisable for you to accept this fair offer for your interest, as Section 11A of the Indian Act gives the Governor-in-Council power to take the land of an Indian, held under location ticket or otherwise, for school purposes.

I have offered her $300 for this land. She is obstinate but I have heard she said she will sell if Mrs Mary Jacco sells.\n\nThe department will require all 4 village lots from Mrs Mary Jacco. I have offered her $300 she asks $600. But $300 is a fair price and in fact is more than the lot would be worth for any other purpose.\n\nMrs Jacco's husband was killed when the Quebec bridge fell in 1907. She has two children a boy Joseph aged 24 and a daughter Mary Ross aged 20. Mrs Jacco has cared for them all these years and requests that all the payment be made to her as she needs it to keep her house. The son is in Detroit.\nand does not help to support his mother. The daughter is living with her mother. I would recommend that Mrs. Jacobs receive the whole amount of $300, and that the department notify each of these women that you are prospecting their respective lands and that each will be paid $300 and if they wish to have their money at once they may receive it by signing the papers which are in my possession.\n\nYou might notify them at the same time that they must not interfere with the survey to be made nor with construction when it commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. White\nOttawa, May 5th, 1927.\n\nMadam:-\n\nThe Department desires to obtain for school purposes on the Caughnawaga Reserve the whole of village Lot No. 94. I understand that you are the recognized holder of this lot. It is intended, if necessary, to expropriate this lot, for which we will pay you the sum of $300. You may have this money at once if you sign the necessary documents for the transfer of this lot to the Department. The papers and money are in the hands of Mr. W.R. White, who is at present in Caughnawaga and who has the authority of the Department to pay over to you the entire amount of $300 when you sign the papers.\n\nYou should not interfere in any manner with the present survey that Mr. White is making, nor with the construction of the school building, when the work is being performed.\n\nIt is in your interest to accept the offer hereby made for Lot No. 94 and sign the papers and obtain the money at once as, if the Department is forced to take steps to secure this lot under authority of Section II A of the Indian Act, it would be some time before the money would be placed in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is intended, if necessary, to expropriate Lot No. 85 and the part required of Lots Nos. 83 and 84, for which we will pay you the sum of $500. You may have this money at once, upon your signing the necessary documents for the transfer of these lots to the Department. The papers and money are in the hands of Mr. W.R. White, who is at present in Caughnawaga and who has the Department's authority to pay over the entire amount of $500 to you when you sign the papers.\n\nYou should not interfere in any manner with the present survey that Mr. White is making, nor with the construction of the school building, when the work is being performed.\n\nIt is in your interest to accept the offer hereby made for Lot 85 and the part required of Lots 83 and 84 and sign the papers and obtain the money at once as, if the Department is forced to take steps to secure these lots under authority of Section 11A of the Indian Act, it would be some time before the money would be placed in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Approval is also granted for the payment to Mrs. Mary Jocko of the sum of $300 for lot No. 94, and you may hand this amount to each upon their signing the necessary documents. As requested by you, the Department is writing both these women, and I enclose herewith copies of our communications to them. It will be necessary for you to fill in a new form of quit claim deed for Mrs. Ross covering the whole of lot No. 85 and the parts required of lots Nos. 83 and 84. It is hoped that both these women will accept the offer made and sign the necessary papers without trouble.\n\nA communication has been directed to Louis Beauvais, Chief Councillor, requesting him to use his influence with the two above named women to have them accept the price offered and sign the necessary documents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMay 5th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Beauvais:\n\nPursuant to my letter of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the new school building to be erected at Caughnawaga, I have learned that Mrs. Ross and Mrs. Jocko seem unwilling to give quit claim deeds for their respective lots. I am taking the liberty of sending in your care letters addressed to them in this connection, and I should be very grateful if you would deliver them personally and use your influence in the matter.\n\nMr. W. R. White, of our Survey Branch, is at present in Caughnawaga, and he has the necessary documents for signature, as well as funds to pay these two women. They would receive no more than $300 each if we had to expropriate under authority of Section II A of the Indian Act. Further, in view of the legal steps that would have to be taken, there would be considerable delay before this money could be paid to them. It is certainly to their advantage to accept the offers in the letters which you will hand them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the Department fences the school property, a roadway 25 ft. wide will be left where necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 13th instant, in connection with the purchase of lot No. 95, for school purposes, I beg to re-enclose herewith certificate of title and quit claim, both in duplicate, duly signed by Louis Bourdeau.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\n(with enclosures)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nApril 22, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Beauvais:\n\nI am desirous that you should know something of the Department's plans in connection with the new school building to be erected this year at Caughnawaga. An item for the purpose in the Appropriation for Indian Education has been allowed by Parliament and I am hopeful that building activity will commence in a few weeks. It is the intention to erect a two-story school building. In the basement, there will be domestic science and manual training rooms as well as the ordinary facilities. On the first floor, there will be five classrooms and on the top floor, a large auditorium. I intend that this auditorium shall be used as a community hall whenever the requirements call for its use for such purpose.\n\nThe site selected is Lots 85 and 93 and I am also arranging for a large playground on Lots 92, 94 and 95. I intend to have this playground available for general athletic purposes in the evenings and on holidays, whenever it is not required for school children.\n\nIt is my wish that these facts become generally known on the reserve. I understand there has been a rumor that the building was a convent with residential quarters; but, of course, this is not the case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMr. Louis Beauvais,\nChief Councillor,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nReferring to the last part of your letter of the 5th instant, in connection with the purchase of five village lots of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, for school purposes, I beg to inform you that I have made all possible efforts for the purchase of the remaining two lots Nos. 85 and 94, and I regret to say, without success. Mrs. Ross, holder of Lot No. 85, is becoming a fury simply with the least step towards a talk for purchase. I believe that this woman is unsound of mind and I believe it my duty to warn the Department to be careful in case that Officials have to enter upon her property with a view to expropriate. Mrs. Jacco, holder of Lot No. 94, is not as wild as Mrs. Ross, however, she absolutely refuses to sell for school purposes, her reason is that she claims to be backed up by the majority of the Indians of the Reserve.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is impossible for me to come to the least possible arrangement with these two Indian women, I beg to recommend that the Department make the necessary acquisition by expropriation with the least possible delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent;\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 26, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department desires to acquire title to Lots Nos. 85 and 94 in the village of Caughnawaga, to be used in connection with a new school building which it is proposed to erect this coming summer. Our local Indian Agent reports that he is unable to have the owners complete the Quit Claim Deeds and Certificates of Title. I have therefore requested that during your visit you will use your best endeavours to have the Indian holders of these lots sign the Quit Claim Deeds and Certificates of Title, in duplicate. Mrs. Ross is the owner of Lot No. 85 and Mrs. Mary Jocko, the owner of Lot No. 94.\n\nI attach hereto the necessary documents for signature and also an accountable cheque to the amount of $600. You will endeavour to obtain these lots at the lowest possible price. The total amount in each case should not exceed $300. Please have any blanks in the documents properly filled in and they should be signed in the presence of a subscribing witness, who should make a proper declaration on the back of the Quit Claim Deeds. The Certificates of Title should also be signed, in duplicate, before the Indian Agent, who should certify same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW.

A physical drill instructor has been appointed, who will no doubt instill manly habits into the older boys.\n\nThe question of vocational training under a qualified male instructor or instructors grew out of this discussion, and I am satisfied that something along this line should be done as soon as funds could be found for the purpose. I believe we should arrange classes in manual training and work preparatory to the structural steel vocation. I am of the opinion that a building should be rented and one instructor secured, so that the activity could be given a trial.\n\nThose older boys who can no longer be benefitted by the regular academic work and all those that have left our regular schools should be eligible for enrolment in this vocational training work. If the work develops, still older boys might be taken in when they were without work and night classes might be given, so that those who were working could benefit. If the scheme proved a success it might be necessary in a few years to erect a small building for this purpose.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nM. Hardie\n736 Second Ave.\nLachine V.A.\n\nfor the Dept.\nSir:\n\nI am requested by Michel Lefebvre, an Indian of the Caughnawaga Reserve, to send to the Department for your information, that the name of their proposed draughtsman at the Senior School is Mr. R. Hardie, of No. 73-6 Second Ave., Lachine, P.Q.; Mr. Lefebvre's note is enclosed herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWith enclosure\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to Resolution No. 273 of the Caughnawaga Council meeting of February 7th, last. You will remember that the Department has given favourable consideration to the establishment of a class in vocational training. I should be grateful if you would make a recommendation as to the best method of securing a suitable instructor, who would conduct a night class twice a week. Someone qualified along structural steel lines would be advisable. Perhaps one of the Indian Council could make arrangements with the Dominion Bridge Company for the instructor. Please let me have an early reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, September 18, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to a vocational training instructor for the proposed night classes at Caughnawaga. Your letter has crossed mine in this connection of yesterday's date. Please get in touch with Mr. R. Hardie, 736 Second Ave., Lachine, with a view to learning what fee he would charge for 2 - 2 hour lessons per week.\n\nYou should make a recommendation concerning what building would be suitable for these night classes. You might discuss this with Sister Mary Rose Alma with a view to determining if it would be advisable to use any of the school buildings.\n\nAt a later date, when the instructor has been engaged, I will expect a report from you concerning what equipment would be required and its cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSeptember 18th, 1928\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday's date in reference to Resolution No.373 of the Caughnawaga Indian Council in regard to the establishment of a class in vocational training and to say that under cover of my letter of the 15th instant I had submitted to the Department the name of Mr. R. Hardie, No.73-6 Second Avenue, Lachine, P.Q., who, having been recommended by a few of the Indian Councillors of Caughnawaga, appears to be a suitable instructor for that purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to a vocational training instructor for the proposed night classes at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Robert Hardie, of Lachine, would be pleased to accept the position as instructor with a monthly fee of $75 and expenses for 2 - 2 hour lessons per week.\n\nI am quite certain that the Council hall would be suitable for these night classes. However, I presume that the Indians, as usual, will not be satisfied to use this building which would certainly meet the requirements. In such case, after having discussed this with Reverend Sister Superior of the Indian Day Schools we came to the conclusion that it might be advisable to use the upper floor and the old concert-hall stand of Kateri School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 1, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to vocational training classes at Caughnawaga. I doubt the advisability of suggesting that the council hall be used for this purpose. In conversation with the Sister Superior of the R. C. Day School, I understood that not all of the upper floor of the Kateri School was available for manual training purposes. Please discuss this again with Sister Mary Rose Alma and let me know at your earliest convenience if the whole of the top floor of this school building could be spared. If you find that it could not, you should see what arrangement you could make for the rental of a suitable hall for the manual training instruction.\n\nAt a later date, I shall correspond with you with reference to the offer of Mr. Robert Hardie, of Lachine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nMeeting of the Council of the Caughnawaga Band, held at the Council House, on the nineteenth day of October, 1928, in the Village of Caughnawaga, under the presidency of Mr. Lorenzo Letourneau, Indian Agent, with the following members of the Council in attendance: Mr. Andrew Delisle, Peter Jacobs, P.J. Delisle, Joseph Lefebvre and John Lacombe.\n\nResolution #40B.\nMoved by Mr. John Lacombe seconded by Joseph Lefebvre, that Councillor Mr. P.J. Delisle act as Secretary and interpreter for this council meeting. Unanimously carried.\n\nResolution #40C.\nWhereas it is decided that vocational training classes be inaugurated at Caughnawaga, and whereas it is desirable to have a suitable place for such classes, it is hereby resolved that the eastern part of the top floor of the \"Kateri School\" be utilized for such purpose as the same has been found to be most suitable and without interference to daily School classes for the children; the offer of Mr. Robert Hardie of Lachine should be accepted and moreover it is resolved that an initial outlay of about eighty dollars be granted to provide tables and other items necessary for the purpose.\n\nCarried unanimously.\n\nI firmly believe that the above mentioned hall could not meet the purpose for the reason of its exiguity. The old concert stand being the only space available into that hall. The desks presently used by the children would certainly not stand the effort of the several inscribed men of Caughnawaga who would have to use them as seats. I will report later for the rental of a suitable hall.\nSt. Ann's Convent\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOctober 27, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty in writing you today to make known to the Department the conditions of the upper class room at Kateri School that has been chosen by the Councillors, I believe, for Manual Training.\n\nYou are aware that owing to the half windows, the light is very poor and when art tables are placed on the stage it will be quite dark; the pupils who sit below the stage will be obliged to work by the electric light all day.\n\nThe Agent has left it to the Councillors to find a suitable place to carry on that activity, but they want one of the schools and their intention is to overcrowd the upper class of Kateri school so as to obtain the Auditorium of the Senior School.\n\nWhy not rent Delormier's dance hall that is closed? It is a spacious room that could be used with advantage, I think, for night school. Mr. Cloud's house, formerly our school, is not rented, and others also could be had.\n\nI wish to impress upon the Department that I would be only too glad to co-operate in every way possible to encourage those who want to follow the evening courses and open wide the doors of Kateri and Eastern Schools if we had sufficient room for the equipment required.\n\nI can hardly believe that the new Auditorium will ever be used for that purpose. I am, my dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Rose Anna\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to resolution of the Caughnawaga Council of the 19th ultimo, which has to do with vocational training classes. The Department does not consider the top floor of the Kateri School suitable for this purpose. I should be glad to receive your report concerning the rental of a suitable hall as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL.

Q.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to a suitable hall for the vocational training classes, which are to be commenced at Caughnawaga. Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau is informed of the Department's opinion that the top floor of the Kateri School is unsuitable. You may rest assured that the auditorium of the Senior School will not be used for that purpose. Mr. Letourneau has been asked to make a report at his earliest convenience concerning a suitable hall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant relative to vocational training classes in Caughnawaga and to inform you that the most suitable place for this purpose at the present time would be the Council hall which I believe is large enough and is vacant almost all the time. It is also the opinion of the Indian Councilors that their hall will meet the requirements.\n\nI, therefore, beg to recommend this place for your approval. After examination, I have found that it is necessary to make a few repairs to the stairway, the doors and windows, to the approximate cost of $20. before this hall could be used as classroom. I beg to ask your authorization for this expenditure, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, recommending that the council hall be used for vocational training classes at Caughnawaga. I note the Indian council recommends that this action be taken. Approval is granted for this proposal and you may expend the sum of $20, making repairs to the stairway, the doors and the windows. You may also get in touch, immediately, with Mr. Robert Hardie, of Lachine, and offer him $3.00 per two hour lesson - lessons to be twice a week and Mr. Hardie to be responsible for his own expenses. Ask Mr. Hardie to cooperate with you in the preparation of a list of equipment that will be necessary to start the classes and submit this to the Department with an estimate of the cost. The Department wishes you to give this early attention, as it is now timely to have the classes commence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant relative to the proposed vocational training classes at Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that for the reason that Mr. Robert Hardie is working every day, I have been unable to reach him personally, but I have deputed Mr. Andrew Delisle, Indian Councillor, who have interviewed at night at his residence.\n\nIt appears from this interview that Mr. Hardie is satisfied with your offer of $8.00 per two hour lesson, twice a week, but he refuses to be responsible for his own expenses.\n\nMr. Hardie has prepared a list of the articles and equipment that will be necessary to start the classes, which list I enclose herewith, but I regret to say that I am unable to furnish the Department with an estimate of its cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n(WITH ENCLOSURE)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with enclosure, with reference to the vocational training classes at Caughnawaga. I note that Mr. Hardie is satisfied with the fee of $8.00 per two hour lesson twice a week; but he wants the Department to be responsible for his expenses. Please ask Mr. Hardie to estimate his expenses. You should also secure from a competent carpenter a price for 10 tables, as requested by Mr. Hardie. I am returning his rough sketch for your guidance.

Meanwhile the epidemic survived in the Indian Reserve with all the work this epidemic gave me I forgot the matter till this morning when I received your letter. Immediately I phoned Mr. Hardie and spoke to him personally about this manual training. He told me that it was impossible for him to undertake this work, said that he was going to suggest another man to replace him to the Indians working with him.

I note that there has been an average attendance of 11.5 and that the progress has been satisfactory.

The Department is very grateful for your assistance. You ask for advance advice, so that an order can be placed at Chateauguay.

A.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 26th instant I beg to say that on the evening of the 28th I have visited the vocational training class at Caughnawaga. Four pupils were present at the beginning and four others arrived about half an hour later. Their age appears to average 17 years.\n\nAs to the question whether the instruction were more practical and less theoretical, is I believe, one that might be differently appreciated. I have no doubt that there may be a large number of young Indians that do not know how to read a plan while they could be a better steel worker than another who, with a plan into his hand, succeeds in the framing up of a steel work. In such case, it would require the equipment of a steel structure contractor for the teaching, in a practical way, to that class of pupils.\n\nI believe in theoretical way of teaching to the young Indians for the reason that if they intend to manage the construction of a steel work they must understand the plan which is submitted for this purpose, otherwise, they would have to work under the supervision of others, in a practical way.\n\nI would recommend that not more than eight, or ten at the most, young Indians be selected by the instructor for the study and drawing of plans, such study being to be made clear and the least possible complicated.\n\nOut of a number of thirty pupils, for instance, we would probably find two or three among them who may have some good disposition as draftmen; a few others might understand a plan while they have no aptitude as draftmen; the remaining number could be more or less practical providing that they be working under the supervision of a \"tenderfoot\" who, in a theoretical way, is standing alongside the proposed steel structure with a plan into his hand.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 5, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to the vocational training class at Caughnawaga. I note your remarks, and I have to state that the Department would be grateful if you would discuss this with the Indian Council at their next meeting. It is the aim to make this instruction as useful as possible, and the wishes and needs of the members of the Band should guide us in the determination of the nature of the course.\n\nI may say that the Department has been in correspondence with the authorities of the New York Central Railway, and I hope to write you in a day or two, concerning the arrangements for stepping No. 3 train at Adirondack Junction on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As the Don Bridge Company used these for their night school, and I believe found them very satisfactory for this work.\n\nThat I be authorized to purchase the necessary supplies before the 1st of Sept., so that we shall be ready on time.\n\nAlso order 2 dozen 3\" scales 3' long.

Mullins be encouraged to continue that teaching during the next school year.\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Mullins makes a few suggestions which, if the finances of the Department permits, should I believe be adopted.\n\nI recommend also that Mr. Mullins be authorized to make in purchase of the various articles mentioned in his letter.\n\n(Signed) Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Mullins, instructor of vocational training in the night school conducted for the young people of the Caughnawaga Reserve. In reply I have to say that the Department will approve of the re-engagement of Mr. G. A. Mullins for the next school year, with salary at the same rate as was previously allowed him. We are not prepared, however, to authorize the appointment of an assistant teacher.\n\nApproval is granted to Mr. Mullins to arrange for the purchase of the necessary supplies as mentioned in his letter. He should obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the various articles purchased by him. This account he should hand to you to be certified in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Mullins of his re-engagement and arrange with him to resume duties when the school re-opens after the present holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P. Q.\nMinutes of Council Meeting.\n\nIt is proposed by Councillor P. Williams seconded by Councillor P. Jacobs and with the approval of the Chief Councillor P.J. Delisle that some means should be found whereby the night school teacher Mr. Mullins would not be handicapped in his excellent work for the benefit of our younger boys in regards to mathematics.\n\nIt seems that the boys attending schools are not being taught the full course of arithmetic in order to compete with boys who have been attending night classes for the last year.\n\nSaid Mr. Mullins is obliged to postpone any further studies for the older class, in order for the fresh classes to be taught further arithmetic.\n\nThe system the Dominion Bridge Co. night schools are following could be adapted here also, that is the system of the several correspondence schools.\n\nSt. Constant, Que.,\nAugust 25, 1931.\n\nRecommended for approval.\n\nL.

She was at first quite amazed to hear by that motion of the Council of the Reserve that the children frequenting the schools have not received sufficient tuition in arithmetic, but, after further information was obtained from one party or others she made the attached report, dated the 7th instant and which I submit with pleasure and also corroborate entirely.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) L. Letourneau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Constant, Que.,\n9 septembre 1931\n\nMonsieur,\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'accuser r\u00e9ception de votre lettre du 3 courant et en r\u00e9ponse de vous informer que j'en ai imm\u00e9diatement fait part \u00e0 la Reverende Soeur Sup\u00e9rieure des Ecoles \u00e0 Caughnawaga; elle a d'abord parue \u00e9tonn\u00e9e d'apprendre par cette Resolution du Conseil de la Reserve que les enfants qui fr\u00e9quentaient les \u00e9coles n'ont pas suffisamment re\u00e7u l'enseignement de l'arithm\u00e9tique, mais, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu plus de renseignements de part et d'autre elle en est venue \u00e0 r\u00e9diger le rapport ci-joint, en date du 7 courant, et que je vous soumets avec plaisir et que je corrobore enti\u00e8rement.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nAgent des Indiens.\n\nLettre annexe.\n\nLe Secr\u00e9taire,\nD\u00e9partement des Affaires des Indiens,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Mr. Letourneau,\n\nI have carefully looked over the papers forwarded on the 4th inst. and trust I have correctly grasped the meaning of their contents, namely:\n\n1st. that Mr. Mullins is teaching night school to young boys still attending our schools.\n\n2nd. that we are indirectly asked to set aside our established program (based on the plan of the Montreal School Board) to suit the needs of Mr. Mullins' night school.\n\nAfter having read your communication, my first step was to procure the names of those attending the night-classes and from the register kept for that purpose, I extracted the enclosed roll. It was quite a revelation to find that the names of boys even in the 3rd. and 4th. Year figure on this list. If the grievance made by the Caughnawaga Council concerned pupils who had left our Graduating Class, we would find the complaint legitimate, but when boys, regardless of age and grade are freely admitted, even dullards and hopeless cases, we think the attack made on our Arithmetic program lacks justice as well as logic.\n\nNight-schools are generally opened for the working boy, and not for the boy who is attending school and who has plenty of homework to do without seeking for more elsewhere.\n\nNo person of common sense will expect boys in the 3rd. 4th. or 5th. grades, etc., who put in application to be-\nmembers of the night school, to possess the same amount of knowledge as the 8th Year Graduate. Hence, if our school children are accepted at the night classes, let them be taken as they are; a child is a child and, with few exceptions, must not, and cannot go beyond the program laid out for its age and grade, by wise and experienced people.\n\nPerhaps instead of our Arithmetic program handicapping Mr. Mullins, it may be that the presence of our school boys is handicapping the progress of those who left school some years back and who now desire to continue their studies. If so, why allow the presence of school children to impede their progress? Still, Mr. Mullins seems to favor the younger ones since the tables in the Council Room were all lowered in order to give them more comfort and convenience.\n\nAnd again, perhaps our Arithmetic program is not totally to blame for lack of progress. As you are already aware, discipline is a powerful factor in a classroom. Now, is discipline always at par in the above mentioned night school? Unless I have been misinformed, I believe there is space not only for improvement in that line, but reformation as well.\n\nTrusting you will feel that we are doing justice to our pupils with regard to Arithmetic, I remain,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L. Letourneau,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nPupils who attended Night School.\n\n| Name                | Standard |\n|---------------------|----------|\n| Woodrow Canadian    | 6        |\n| James McComber      | 5        |\n| Raymond Montour     | 3        |\n| Harry Smallfence    | 4        |\n| Peter Paul          | 4        |\n| Alexander McComber  | 5        |\n| Michael Diabo       | 5        |\n| Michael Deere       | 6        |\n| Peter Lawrence      | 4        |\n| Louis K.

Would you make careful enquiries with a view to determining whether other accommodation can be secured for this work? The Department is not prepared to allow the auditorium in the senior school to be used for this activity, but I do believe we should seriously consider setting aside one of the rooms in the basement of this building. It could be locked off from the rest of the building and a separate entrance could be arranged. Does this proposal commend itself to you?\n\nIt has also been brought to my attention that the attendance at these evening classes during the month of May has materially decreased. You will please inform the members of the Band at the next council meeting that, unless the parents and young men show more interest in this special and rather costly activity, the Department will have to seriously consider discontinuing it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J'en ai caus\u00e9 avec la Reverend Soeur Sup\u00e9rieure qui, quoiqu'h\u00e9sitante, semblerait cependant vouloir en faire le sacrifice.\n\nJ'ai aussi parl\u00e9 de ce projet \u00e0 l'instituteur M. J.G. Mullins, qui sugg\u00e8re que ce changement ne soit pas fait avant le mois de septembre prochain pour la raison qu'il ne lui reste plus que quatre s\u00e9ances de dessin pour compl\u00e9ter la pr\u00e9sente ann\u00e9e scolaire. Subsequently, les institutrices de l'\u00e9cole Senior m'ont inform\u00e9 que ces salles leur sont particuli\u00e8rement utiles en fin d'ann\u00e9e scolaire.\n\nFinalement, \u00e0 leur assembl\u00e9e d'hier soir j'ai soumis le cas aux membres du Conseil de Caughnawaga qui conviennent bien que ce changement ne peut pas facilement se faire avant l'ouverture de la prochaine ann\u00e9e scolaire.

I spoke of it with the Reverend Father Superior who, although hesitating seems willing to make the sacrifice.\n\nI have also spoken of that project to Mr. C. Mather, the teacher who suggested that the change should not be done before the month of September next for the reason that there is only four drawing classes to complete the present scholastic year. Consequently, the lady teachers of the Senior school informed me that these rooms were particularly useful to them at the end of the scholastic year.\n\nFinally, at their meeting last night, I submitted the matter to the members of the Otagoawage Council who understand that that change can not easily be made before the opening of the next scholastic year. Consequently, I would advise to postpone this question until September next.\n\nI am obediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, this request was firmly refused by the young Indians for the reason that they want to be paid for the transportation of the material used for their education.\n\nAs the council hall should be vacated in the course of the current month, or at least before the end of August, I beg you to kindly inform me if I should have this material mentioned on the attached list removed at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the removal of the vocational training class equipment from the council hall to the basement of the senior school where classes are to be resumed next September.

P. Mullins to continue the teaching of drawing etc. to young Indians of Caughnawaga during the next school term.\n\nOn account of the difficulty to secure the necessary local to continue that course, I do not feel able recommending its approval; however, I have taken steps in accordance with your letter of the 17th June last.\n\nI wish to add that in case that class wants be continued, I do not see the necessity of retaining the services of a journeyman teacher, as in the case of Mitchell Hill last year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, August 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the continuing of the vocational training class at the high school conducted for the young people of the Caughnawaga Reserve, and the re-engagement of Mr. G. A. Mullins as instructor.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. Phelan, of this Department, will be in Caughnawaga on the 1st and 2nd of September, and I would request that you arrange to meet him on one of these days, when the question of continuing this class will be decided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nWith reference to the vocational training class on the Caughnawaga reserve, I discussed this with Agent Letourneau when I was on the reserve on September 2nd.\n\nThis class has been conducted for the past four years, but I found, after making enquiry, that very few adults have been attending it. The majority were boys who were not sufficiently advanced to profit by the instruction given.\n\nThe supplies for this class had recently been placed in the girls' playroom in the senior school. (This action was authorized by official letter of June 11th). This arrangement would not be satisfactory, as it would mean that there would be no playroom available for the girls.\n\nThe Department has been allowing the instructor the sum of $85 a month.\n\nIn view of the only room available for this class being the girls' playroom\u2014which, as pointed out above, will seriously inconvenience the girls in the Senior School\u2014the small number of adult Indians that have been taking advantage of the class and the lack of funds during the current year to meet the salary of the instructor, I recommend that the class be discontinued.\n\nThe supplies used by the class\u2014a list of which was forwarded to the Department with Agent Letourneau's letter of July 2nd, last\u2014can be stored in a small vacant room in the basement of the Kateri School.\nOttawa, September 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the vocational training class that has been conducted on the Caughnawaga reserve, I beg to say that the Department has given this matter very careful consideration. For a number of reasons, it has been decided to discontinue this activity.\n\nPlease have the supplies, a list of which was forwarded with your letter of July 2nd, last, stored in the small room which is available in the basement of the Kateri School. You should arrange to have this done at once, in order that the playroom in the Senior School may be available for the girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. R. L.

On an average, about 90% were present at the lessons, 75% of whom did excellent work and derived splendid benefits therefrom. The general deportment showed marked improvement, the attention was sustained far better than in the past, and the sense of rhythm more developed.\n\nAmong the girls, I endeavored to cultivate elegance and ease of movement.\n\nA certain number of pupils following my instructions, were not able to keep up with the others owing to slowness in grasping explanations.\n\nIf you grant me the favor of renewing my contract for September next, I shall organize a special class for these subnormals and see what can be done with them.\n\nMr. Phelan, whom I had the honor of meeting at the Closing Exercises at Senior School, seemed pleased with our Physical Culture demonstration. In spite of the intense heat\nthat night, the pupils performed their exercises ably, except perhaps the minims from whom however, one does not expect as much perfection as with the more advanced classes.\n\nI close with sincere thanks and with the hope that I may continue to give the Caughnawaga children, lessons in Physical Training this coming September.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMr. A.F.

Superior at Caughnawaga agrees with me that weaving & other handicraft instruction is of more practical value than typewriting for the Indians. I have taken the numbers of machines, some of which makes up the 20 machines, others in storage would be useful in Ottawa & others in storage as they are not really used more than 1 hour a day. If you approve - I could be left for the School Office & 19 turned in. I tried each one & will give a list when I return. There are also 18 small desks & 6 typewriting chairs. The large room would also be available for weaving.\n\nI suggested that the Dealers find out the cost of having instruction for the boys once a week by an instructor from the Montreal Technical School who...\nMount Royal Hotel\nMontreal\n\nA course in Manual Training in Lacrosse\nThe girls who are now being taught weaving are anxious to continue at home\nI could give some instruction during the summer if we have looms. These can be bought from Romeo Savoie\n51 Richard St.\nSt. Joliet, Que.\n\nI would urge immediate purchase of:\n\nfor Caughnawaga:\nSenior School\n1 loom, 90\" for blankets $100.00\n4 looms, 48\" at $2 each $16.00\n2 spinning wheels @ $6 each $12.00\nProtestant School\n2 looms, 45\" $58.00\n1 spinning wheel $6.00\nfor St. Regis\n1 loom, 90\" $100.00\n3 looms, 45\" $77.00\n2 spinning wheels $12.00\nalso permanent storage tent $189.00\nTotal $481.00\n\nThese prices were given me by the\nSister, if we might have to pay more,\nthere will also be needed carding equipment of which I can get particulars\nlater. Probably $600 worth of equip-\nment will go a long way.\n\nWe can rent a cottage at St. Regis,\nor use the School in the summer. We\ncan rent a large room cheaply from\nRev. Mr. Dear at Caughnawaga, as there\nis no room in the Protestant School.\nEveryone seems quite enthusiastic.\nWill make enquiries re Pierreville also.\n\nKeller Moodie\nOttawa,\nFebruary 16, 1938.\n\nReverend Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Miss Moodie in which she states that she recently discussed with you the advisability of giving instruction in weaving and other handicraft work at the Caughnawaga Roman Catholic School rather than in typewriting etc. Miss Moodie states that such action would meet with your approval.\n\nPlease let me have a definite statement from you in connection with Miss Moodie's suggestion. While I favour the teaching of the handicrafts mentioned in Miss Moodie's report, at the same time I do not want to create any ill feeling on the Reserve.\n\nDo you feel that the majority of the children and their parents would favour this instruction rather than what is being given at the present time? Would it be possible to keep about 10 of the typewriters and use the rest of the room for handicrafts? In this way the commercial work could be taught to those especially desiring it and at the same time the handicraft instruction would be available.\n\nI trust that you will give me the benefit of your experience on the Caughnawaga Reserve and let me know exactly how you feel in regard to the matter. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Sister Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Roman Catholic School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 16, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of a letter which is being directed to Reverend Sister Cleophas. This letter refers, of course, to the Caughnawaga Roman Catholic School. Miss Moodie has also suggested that somewhat similar arrangements be made for teaching handicrafts in connection with the Caughnawaga United Church School. In order to do this she states that two large rooms can be rented cheaply from Reverend Mr. Dean.\n\nI would appreciate receiving from you any comments that you wish to make in regard to this proposal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, February 23, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, I wish to say that I think Miss Moodie's suggestion might be more practical for our Caughnawaga pupils than Commercial Subjects.\n\nDomestic arts are in demand in all our residential schools in Canada. No doubt but the majority of our girls would like the novelty. What reaction this change would have on the parents and the \"Fathers of the Town\" is hard to tell. They are generally so contrary.\n\nAt all events, it might be wise to keep up the Commercial Department, for a time at least. If we begin weaving in the early spring, it would probably start the parents thinking and talking on the matter and give us an inkling as to what should definitely be done at the opening of schools in September.\n\nI also intend to start Manual Training with the boys about the 15th of March if you indorse the plan. One of the Jesuit Brothers, a skilled cabinet maker, would give the boys about six hours a week, until the middle of June. Kindly let me know what compensation the Department would allow for his services. He is residing here at the rectory.\n\nWith kind regards from all the staff at the R.C. Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. B. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 25, 1938.\n\nReverend Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant I agree with you that it would be advisable to change gradually from the teaching of commercial subjects to the teaching of domestic arts.\n\nArrangements will be made in the near future to purchase a few looms and, as you suggest in the third paragraph of your letter, teaching of weaving can be commenced in the early spring.\n\nI am very favourably inclined to your suggestion regarding the employment of a manual training teacher for six hours a week from March 15 to the middle of June. Please ascertain from the Brother to whom you refer what compensation he would expect for his services.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R. C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nCaughnawaga, February 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant enclosing copy of letter sent to Reverend Sister Cleophas, Principal of the R.C. schools, dealing with the possibility of teaching weaving and other handicraft work at Caughnawaga.\n\nRelative to the proposed arrangements for the teaching of handicraft to the Caughnawaga U.C. Church members, I wish to say that the suggestion made by Miss Moodie to rent two rooms from Rev. Mr. Dean, seems to be in order. If however, it had been possible to centralize the equipment which will be needed for the course, at the Senior School where all those interested would have been taking the course, it would have avoided to duplicate the equipment, etc.; as if two different classes are started, both will have to be supplied with the same equipment and teaching as otherwise some friction will result.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nDear Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant and official letter approving the appointment of Sister M. Lucie is going forward under separate cover. I was interested in the newspaper clipping which you forwarded. We also had a visit from the Chiefs and in order to get rid of them we had to provide their railway fare home. However, they do not give any publicity to such assistance on the part of the Department.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether $50.00 a month is or is not too much for the services mentioned in the fourth paragraph of your letter. Would it be possible for you to let me know the number of hours a week the Brother would devote to teaching the boys. With this information we will be in a better position to decide whether or not the amount mentioned is satisfactory.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire for Sister M. Lucie which I would appreciate having completed and returned to us.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, March 14, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th instant, I wish to say that the Brother in question intends to give six hours a week. He thinks it would really take that much time to accomplish anything worth while from now till the end of the school year.\n\nNow, as it is rather late, I leave everything with you to decide definitely whether it would be better to wait till September or start now and do what we can in that training.\n\nThe Brother will be satisfied with whatever compensation he is allowed. May the department would rather pay by the hour instead of giving a fixed salary!...........We will expect word from you before opening shop.\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant it has been decided to offer the Brother an amount of $1.00 a lesson for his services teaching the boys manual training. You may arrange to have him start at once and payment at the rate mentioned will be allowed until the end of the present academic year. At that time you will be in a position to report whether or not the boys have shown interest in this branch of the work and, if so, new arrangements can be made for the academic year 1938-39.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R. C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMEMORANDUM: Dr. McGill\n\nThere are several typewriters in the Senior school at Caughnawaga which are not required for use there at present.\n\nMay I have your approval of having them transferred to headquarters:\n\nUnderwood typewriters No. 4240192-10\n\" 4293488-10\n\nRemington typewriter \" Z496779-Model 16,\n\nOne of these would be used for Miss Pattie in this branch, one could be assigned to Miss Walker in the Medical Branch, and one to Miss Moodie for use in Room 707.\n\nIf Miss Moodie drives to Montreal to attend the annual meeting of the Handicraft Association, she will also be visiting Caughnawaga, and could bring the typewriters back with her.\n\nA.A. Eddy,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, March 27, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nTime flies so rapidly in Caughnawaga. The first of April will soon be here and still no word concerning our manual training for the boys. My letter of the 15th instant is still unanswered. I trust that you have not been ill. May I expect word soon even if we are not to start anything before the Fall Term?\n\nWe expect Mr. Wescott sometime soon for the yearly visitation of our classes. Both pupils and teachers are preparing accordingly. The attendance in our classes on the Reserve is very good. But the outside schools are not so fortunate. Their roads are flooded. Miss Jocks especially has had very poor attendance these past weeks.\n\nI am enclosing the itemized bill of material bought for our sewing classes during the current year. The girls did very well and are still working to complete their work for exhibition.\n\nHope to be favored with your usual spring visit. Please remember us all to Mr. Hoey.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Department,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sister:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th instant I presume you have now received Mr. Hoey's letter of March 25 regarding the manual training.\n\nIn the third paragraph of your letter you state that you are enclosing itemized bill or material bought for the sewing classes. This bill was not forwarded with your letter and no doubt you neglected to send it at that time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe attached accounts have just been received. The articles for which payment is requested have been placed in the Caughnawaga R. C.

HOEY:-\n\nRe: Vocational Training, Caughnawaga R.C.\nIndian Day School.\n\n(a) Sewing:\nWe allowed an amount of $75.00 during the academic year 1937-38 for the purchase of sewing material. Four hundred (400) articles were made and, for your information, I enclose a detailed statement indicating the number made in each grade. There is no question that the pupils are receiving a splendid training in sewing, crochet work, knitting and embroidery. The dresses worn by the seven girls who had completed their course were made by themselves from some of the material supplied by the Department. They were extremely well done.\n\n(b) Cooking:\nThere was an excellent display of preserves, etc., which had been made by the pupils, under the direction of one of the Sisters.\n\n(c) Manual Training:\nYou will remember that, last March, we authorized the Sister to expend a small amount of money in order to commence manual training work for the boys, and I also authorized at that time the employment of Brother who is residing at the Priest's House on the reserve. This man - Brother Gauthier - is a practical carpenter and cabinet maker. He has had some previous experience with Indian children, having been attached to some Indian residential school in western Canada. The Principal reports that he handles the boys very well.\n\nOne large work table was purchased but the five smaller work tables used by the boys were made by them under the direction of Brother Gauthier. While this branch has only been in operation for a few months, it is reported to me that the boys are extremely interested. Some very creditable work has been done and several samples of their work were on display.\n\nBrother Gauthier is extremely interested and has given a great deal of time. He is prepared to continue for the next academic year and Reverend Sister Cleophas suggests that we allow him $50.00 a month. From what I have seen, I consider this would be reasonable and I would recommend this allowance for your favourable consideration.\n\n(d) Spinning and\n(d) Spinning and Weaving:\n\nYou will remember that, last March, authority was given for the removal of some of the typewriters from the typewriting room. About the same time one 30\" loom and four 45\" looms were purchased from the Welfare Vote. My memory is that it was understood, as soon as the typewriters were removed, one or two looms at least would be placed in the space formerly occupied by them and this work commenced immediately, in order to ascertain if the pupils were more interested in it than in the commercial work.\n\nI was much surprised to learn that, on the instructions of Miss Moodie, the five looms have been stored in the basement of the Kateri School and instructions were given by Miss Moodie that they were not to be used. I understand, also, that Miss Moodie has purchased a great deal of material which is stored in the basement of the Kateri School.\n\nAs Miss Moodie is away from the office today, I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with her, but I can see no reason why the looms were bought and placed in the basement of one of the schools, when there are at least two of the Reverend Sisters at present on the staff of the Caughnawaga R. C. School who, Rev. Sister Cleophas states, are able to teach weaving, etc.\n\nSister Cleophas has no objection to abandoning the commercial course and substituting the weaving, etc., as she considers that at the present time the latter would be much more practical.\n\nI, therefore, recommend that this action be taken for the academic year 1938-39. I feel, however, that before any more typewriters are distributed, I should be consulted, as we have received several requests from residential schools for typewriters, which have been unable to supply. The typewriters now present in the Caughnawaga school were bought from the appropriation for Indian Education, and, if we are abandoning this work, the logical course to take is to distribute the typewriters to different schools. I think that six or seven typewriters should be left at Caughnawaga. Some of them will be required by the teachers to prepare their work, returns, etc., while it might be that a few of the pupils would like to learn typewriting and, in that event, the machines would be available. There is no doubt that any machines left at Caughnawaga will receive the very best of care.\n\nIn the event of our discontinuing the commercial class, Sister Cleophas states, as mentioned above, that there are two Sisters on the staff at the present time who are qualified to teach weaving, etc., and this will mean that there will be no increase in the paylist, as the salary now paid the commercial teacher can be transferred to one of the teachers who is in charge of the weaving, etc.\n\nWhile the girls who have attended Ste. Martine or St. Jacques have done very good work and have received\n\na fair knowledge -\na fair knowledge of weaving, at the same time I would not consider that they are as yet sufficiently qualified to teach others with the hope of being very successful.\n\nIn the event of making a change in the course suggested in this memorandum, I recommend that the present commercial room be used for the sewing room. This will mean that the sewing room and domestic science room will be beside each other.\n\nThe looms should be installed in the room at present used for sewing. This is a large room and I consider is the most suitable in which to have the looms.\n\nChief, Training Division.\nGRADE 5\n\n23 Knitted Ankle Socks\n22 Perky Aprons\n4 Jar-Ring Doilies\n\nTotal 49 pieces\n\nGRADE 3\n\n27 Knitted Shopping Bags\n4 Knitted Caps\n30 Embroidered Aprons\n20 Hot Pot Holders\n\nTotal 81 pieces\n\nGRADE 2\n\n27 Woven Paper Mats\n23 Embroidered Cards\n20 Knitted Scarfs\n6 Knitted Caps\n22 Fringed Doilies\n\nTotal 98 pieces\n\nGRAL TOTAL 400 pieces\nSEWING-KNITTING-EMBROIDERY\n\nBy the pupils of the different grades.\n\nGRADE 9\n\n7 Dresses (for graduation)\n3 Crocheted Hats\n7 Knitted Hats\n7 Cutwork Doilies\n7 Pair Knitted Cable Stitch Gloves\nTotal 31 pieces\n\nGRADE 8\n\n13 Bargello Embroidered Purses\n10 Knitted Hats\n10 Cutwork Maple Leaf Doilies\n11 Tea Aprons\n9 Crocheted Collar and Cuff Sets\n12 Pen Wipers\nTotal 65 pieces\n\nGRADE 6\n\n19 Crocheted Spiderweb Doilies\n19 Knitted Tab Scarfs\n19 Tea Aprons\n19 House Dresses\nTotal 76 pieces\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Some of them will be required by the teachers to prepare their work, returns, etc., while it might be that a few of the pupils would like to learn typewriting and, in that event, the machines would be available. There is no doubt that any machines left at Caughnawaga will receive the very best of care.\n\nIn the event of our discontinuing the commercial class, Sister Cleophas states, as mentioned above, that there are two Sisters on the staff at the present time who are qualified to teach weaving, etc., and this will mean that there will be no increase in the paylist, as the salary now paid the commercial teacher can be transferred to one of the teachers who is in charge of the weaving, etc.\n\nWhile the girls who have attended Ste. Martine or St. Jacques have done very good work and have received a fair knowledge -\na fair knowledge of weaving, at the same time I would not consider that they are as yet sufficiently qualified to teach others with the hope of being very successful.\n\nIn the event of making a change in the course suggested in this memorandum, I recommend that the present commercial room be used for the sewing room. This will mean that the sewing room and domestic science room will be beside each other.\n\nThe looms should be installed in the room at present used for sewing. This is a large room and I consider is the most suitable in which to have the looms.\n\nChief, Training Division.\nSt-Francis-Xavier Mission\nCaughnawaga, June 30, 1938\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nTo Reverend Father Lalonde, s. j.\nSuperior.\n\nBrother Gauthier's Services for Manual Training:\n\nApril 14th to April 29th.......30 hours at .75............$22.50\nMay 2nd to May 27th..........66 \" \" .75.............. 49.50\nJune 1st to June 21st.........60 \" \" .75............. 45.00\nTotal $117.00\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Reverend Father Lalonde, S.J., Superior,\n\n**ADDRESS:** St. Francis-Xavier Mission, Caughnawaga, P.

Hoping to be able to be of some assistance to you in the near future.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nCarol Benson\nOttawa,\nApril 13th, 1939.\n\nDear Miss Brinson:\n\nI am sorry that there has been so much delay regarding your account, but on looking up our records I find that the voucher was submitted by Mr. Brisebois of March 10.\n\nIt has been passed for payment but is being held until the appropriation for the new fiscal year is available.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of accounts awaiting payment and I am afraid the cheque will not be issued for several weeks yet.\n\nMr. Smith has sent in several of the dish towels made of the warp you set up at Oka and they are really very nice.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWelfare & Training Service.\n\nMiss Carol Brinson,\n5321 St. Urbain St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa, April 12, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Raymond:\n\nMr. Pratt has suggested that I submit to you a summary of the vocational training programme promoted by this Branch at the Indian day schools on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nThe Sisters in charge of the Roman Catholic Day School on the Caughnawaga reserve have for a number of years provided a certain amount of vocational instruction for girls. This instruction consisted in the main of typewriting, shorthand and domestic science such as dressmaking, fruit preserving, etc. Despite this provision, however, the major portion of the study period was devoted to the regular academic studies, regardless of the ability of the pupils to pursue these studies with any hope of success. The course of study provided, therefore, at the Caughnawaga schools was carefully reviewed by the officials of this Branch about 18 months ago, with the result that provision now is made for a course of study in hand loom weaving for girls. Not only are the girls taught hand loom weaving, but they are taught how to make for sale gentlemen's ties and scarfs, scarfs for ladies, automobile rugs, towels, belts, and in fact everything in woven goods for which a demand may develop from time to time. In addition to the course provided at Caughnawaga, a number of the senior girls have been sent to L'Ecole Menagere Regionale at St. Martine and St. Jacques, Quebec, where they have pursued post graduate studies. It is our hope that when these girls return to the reserve they will be in a position to provide instruction in weaving to members of the adult population on the reserve.\n\nAn agreement has been reached also, whereby a\n\nMaxime Raymond, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLay Brother of the Jesuit Order provides daily instruction in carpentry work, wood carving, metal work or in fact any particular course in which a group of the boys may be interested. You will be interested to learn that we have on display in the Branch here samples of the work accomplished at Caughnawaga. It is scarcely necessary to state that we would be delighted to have you inspect this work any time at your convenience.\n\nMr. Pratt intimated to me during the course of our conversation that a report had reached you regarding the construction of a vocational school in the province of Quebec by the Department. I can only state that the desirability of establishing a vocational school for Indians anywhere in Canada has never been considered by the Department. It is my personal opinion that vocational instruction amongst Indians has not yet advanced to the stage where the erection of a building is in any sense urgent or necessary. It is scarcely necessary to add that, should you desire additional information, I shall be glad to supply it at any time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. H. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n| Ordre | Folio | Conditions | Exp\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0/s R.Sr. Directrice |\n|-------|-------|------------|-----------------------------|\n|       |       |            |                             |\n\n| Description          | Quantit\u00e9 | Unit\u00e9 | Prix unitaire | Total |\n|----------------------|----------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| Serres \u00e0 main 10\"    | 3        | ch    | 2.00          | 6.00  |\n| S\u00e9rie de m\u00e8che       | 1        | ch    | 1.25          | 1.25  |\n| Dz. rondelles 3/8    | 1        | dz    | .05           | .05   |\n|                      |          | dz    | .05           | .05   |\n|                      |          |       |               | 7.35  |\n|                      |          |       | 10%           | 6.62  |\n\nDUPPLICATA\n| Description                        | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Burin pour tuile                   | 1        | .50 ch net | .50         |\n| Meule d'emery                      | 1        | 3.50 ch net| 3.50        |\n| Sets monture pour serre-joints     | 2        | 1.50 set   | 3.00        |\n| Poche \u00e0 bois 1\"                    | 1        | 1.10 ch net| 1.10        |\n| Lime ronde                         | 1        | .25 ch net | .25         |\n| Pot Colle Lepage                   | 1        | 1.50 ch net| 1.50        |\n\nTotal: 9.85\n\nDUPLICATA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Omer DeSerres, Limit\u00e9e,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Corner St. Catherine & St. Denis Sts\n\nMontreal,\n\nP.

This cupboard would be similar to the one built last year, but with the exception that we would appreciate a glass-door top in which different woven articles could be displayed for the benefit of the numerous visitors to the school. As it is now, Sister M. George is obliged to take every article out of different drawers and then place everything back again.\n\nFurthermore, we have decided to transfer the Sewing Room to one of the Weaving Rooms and vice versa in order to facilitate supervision and render the work less fatiguing. We believe in this way, we will obtain still better results.\n\nWould you also approve a display case built on another cupboard which we are already using for the same reasons as above but to be used by the Domestic Science teacher?\n\nWe thank you for your attention to the above matters and we wish to assure you that we are asking for it, only because we believe it would be of great benefit for both the teacher and the pupils.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nAfter conferring with Brother Gauthier regarding the amount of wood needed for the Manual Training Classes, we come to the conclusion that $100.00 to be spent in two instances would suffice for this year.\n\nThis amount would cover the cost of material needed to build supplementary school equipment which the brother is very willing to construct for us.\n\nMay we, therefore, be authorized to spend this amount? We thank you again for all your kindnesses and we beg to remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO Messrs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. Sister Jean de Dieu,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMrs. Moodie has intimated that she would like to have the Commercial Reading Studio in progress during the summer months.\n\nIn fact three obstacles are facing us concerning this affair. First, Mr. George usually must have his holidays and for that purpose she will have for the Mother House about the end of the current month\u2014then Mrs. Moodie understands her main arrangements to have the work carried on by lay women, responsible she says, to which she can assure...\n\nThis fact, Mr. Hoey, is my fear. We are dealing with Indians, and as much as we want to cooperate with the department in this regard, I doubt very much that there will be no great inconveniences to the depart...\nment of the girls if there is no strict supervision...and this is the main reason why the summer school does not entirely appeal to me. As far as the meaning is concerned, the appointed ladies will see to that but our Senior School has free access to the upper stories and I feel quite responsible for the good condition of the building. Our janitor, Mr. Peters, told me, in a very definite manner that he would strictly supervise the building during this working period, but not without being paid extra for it....In fact we'll find he is getting plenty for what he does here, itself. This is his attitude and I am sure these would be no damage done to the buildings while he is in charge...and all will be well.\n\nTrusting that you will make some arrangements for the safety of the entire situation here,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nS.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6084, file 305-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 20, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn official letter of September 18 which was addressed to the Principal of the Caughnawaga R.C. School and a copy of which was sent to you the Department authorized an amount of $50.00 for the purchase of materials for the weaving class. We have now received the following vouchers:\n\nVoucher No. 466 - $22.85\n\" No. 461 - $24.73\n\" No. 462 - $21.50\n\n$ 69.08\n\nThis shows a total expenditure of $69.08 when only $50.00 was authorized. You should inform the Principal immediately that the amounts allowed for materials for the sewing class and the domestic science class must be reduced by the over-expenditure for the weaving class; namely, $19.08. You should also point out to her that when an amount is authorized it should not be over-expended.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCaughnawaga, November 22nd, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20 instant dealing with an amount of $50.00 authorized for the purchase of materials for weaving class, and in which you state that this amount has been over-expended.\n\nIn this connection I wish to inform you that Voucher No. 462, amounting to $21.50 should not be charged against the amount authorized for the weaving class but to either Account No. 470 or to the Caughnawaga Group Loan, Revolving Funds, as this material was used at the Weaving Studio and not at the Weaving Class.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. Doucet:\n\nI am returning your copies of the Manuals of Woodwork, \"Evans\" and \"Justison\", and thank you for their use. I delayed in sending these books, because they are very practical and useful to the boys, and as we have but two other copies of each, we have been using yours.\n\nSome three weeks ago, we received an order of books containing two books by Evans, two by Justison, two by Hamilton and two \"Problems in Farm Woodwork\". As the Job Sheets refer the pupils to reading matter in \"Evans\" and \"Justison\" especially, any additional copies of these texts will be appreciated.\n\nWe are grateful for the interest which you take in our boys, who, in general, are profiting by their new course. Mr. Wescott finds that the majority are doing well.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J. A.

Doucet,\nwelfare and Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou have already received the regular reports from the Reverend Sister Principal concerning the woodworking class of the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day Schools. In addition, I have thought that you would appreciate a brief summary of the general results obtained and the progress made in the workshop.\n\nAs you know, the class commenced operation on October 9th. Twelve boys were enrolled in the class at the beginning. Three others were admitted during the year. Only eight boys remained at the end of the year, the seven others having left school for various reasons: age, moving from the Reserve, general misconduct etc.\n\nDuring the first part of the year, from October to the Christmas recess, all the boys were engaged on the same project at the same time. The work outlined in the first nine projects was performed by all the pupils during this time. All the boys acquired very satisfactory skill in crosscutting, ripping, squaring up stock etc.\n\nThe Christmas holidays and the fire caused a long interruption of the woodworking course. The woodworking classes were resumed in the latter half of January.\n\nAs soon as they returned to the shop, three or four of the older boys took the attitude that it would be of little use for them to do woodworking, as they would be leaving school in February or March, as soon as they would be sixteen years old.\n\nThis attitude of a few boys could not be anything but an obstacle to the general progress of the class. The indifference and the bad example of these boys could naturally not have any good effect on the others.\n\nAfter your visit, when you insisted on the continued attendance of these pupils and gave permission for me to divide the pupils into two groups, much better progress was made.\nDuring the latter part of the year, after the boys had acquired the elementary skills of which I have spoken, more freedom was given in the choice of projects. The pupils were permitted to choose a project and submit it to the instructor. This stimulated interest. Acting upon your instructions, I allowed the pupils to take home the articles which they had made. This also proved to be a great stimulus. Many useful objects were made: tool-chests, plant-stands, fernieres, hat-racks, tables, milk-stools, etc.\n\nI feel very well satisfied with the work of the eight boys who remained until the end of the school year, while I regret that some of the older boys, who had been anxiously awaiting their birthdays to be released from compulsory school attendance, did less work than I should have liked; I feel that even they have acquired much knowledge and skill which should be of service to them. Some of the others who left during the school year had made very satisfactory progress. In general, I believe that those who did not progress were those who did poor work in their other classes. One or two boys who did rather poorly in their other classes, through lack of talent rather than of good will, did satisfactory shopwork.\n\nPupils who completed the year's work:\n\nErnest Montour - Very good\nRobert Jacobs - Do\nErnest Lafleur - Capable, but unstable - Likes to avoid hard work-\nGordon Curotte - Good worker -\nRichard White - Less talented than some - willing - interested -\nshows initiative and imagination -\nHerbert Nice - Very good -\nJohn Latour - These two boys admitted after Christmas did Alex. Jacco very satisfactory work.\n\nPupils who left during year:\n\nHarry Paul - very good worker - left on account of age -\nCarl Bell - Excellent - Moved away from Reserve. -\nThe others, Jos. Diabo, Osler Bush, Dave Norton, Geo. Mayo,\nPeter Jacobs, varied in skill and good will.\n\nI trust that this brief report will be useful.\nI enclose inventory of tools and material.\n\nWith best personal regards,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6054, file 305-11, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAs directed by you, I visited the Caughnawaga Reserve on Friday, February 5. I first discussed with the Indian Agent the case of Mr. Albany Robert, the present caretaker of the school. I advised Mr. Brisebois that Robert's extension would expire on July 1, 1943. Mr. Brisebois mentioned that there was an Indian named Bush, 41 years of age, who he thought would make a suitable caretaker and Mr. Brisebois will discuss the matter with him again with a view to ascertaining definitely if he is prepared to accept the position. Mr. Brisebois agreed that one capable man should be able to handle the work that is required at the present time.\n\nI also discussed with the Sister Superior her recent letters regarding Robert. It appears that the latter is extremely cranky and apparently will only do what suits himself. He is not sweeping the schools regularly and evidently considers himself the owner of the buildings.\n\nPrevious to the destruction by fire of the Senior School Robert was living in the basement of that building and at the time of the fire he told the then Sister Superior that it was impossible for him to secure a room and she allowed him to live temporarily in a room in the basement of the teachers' residence. He is still living there and expects the Sisters to supply him with his food, which they have been doing for over a year. Besides, he keeps several dogs in the barn on our property. These animals cause the Sisters considerable trouble and, in addition, Robert expects them to provide food for these dogs. Another matter that was brought out was that there are two cars stored for the winter in the barn, one belonging to the Medical Officer and the other to an Indian and Robert is collecting monthly rental reported to be approximately $2.50 for storing these cars although, as you realize, the building belongs to the Department and not to Robert.\n\nWith your approval it is my intention to write to Indian Agent Brisebois and instruct him to advise Robert that he will have to find another boarding house before February 20, as I do not see any reason why he should be allowed to live in the basement of the teachers' residence or why the Sisters should provide him with food as Robert is being paid a reasonable salary and he should provide his own maintenance. I also suggest that Robert be definitely instructed by the Agent to give more attention to his duties for the balance of the current academic year. Needless to add, instructions to the Agent should include directions to Robert to remove his dogs from the barn.\nI also ascertained that the Agent was successful in securing oil and consequently the furnace in the teachers' residence has not been converted to the use of coal. As a matter of fact it was impossible to do this as they have not yet been able to secure the necessary parts, although they have been on order for some months.\n\nI visited all classrooms with the Sister Superior and found a good attendance and both teachers and pupils appeared very happy. Mr. Wescott has a class of 20 boys for manual training and he was very enthusiastic regarding the progress they are making this year which he claims is much improved over last year.\n\nThe Sister Superior suggested that the manual training room be transferred from the Kateri School to the Eastern School. All the boys are in the latter school and, as the basement in this school is in good condition, I can see no reason why the transfer should not be made at all, of course, involve some expense for extra wiring etc., the present manual training room in the basement of the Kateri School can be used for giving sewing and cooking lessons to the girls who are in this building. I have spoken to Mr. Doucet about the proposed change and he can see no objection to it. With your approval it is my intention to write to the Indian Agent giving him the necessary authority to expend whatever is necessary to make the change.\n\nI also visited the Caughnawaga U.C. School and had a half hour's conference with both teachers. Their attendance has been good and the teachers claimed that the children were making very satisfactory progress. Mr. Wescott visits them at regular intervals and assists the teachers in giving some manual training instruction to the boys.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1943.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan was in Caughnawaga on Friday the Sister Superior discussed with him the possibility of transferring the manual training room from the Kateri School to the Eastern School. The room vacated in the Kateri School would then be used for a combined sewing and domestic science room. We have considered this proposal carefully and we feel that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to make this arrangement. It will involve some small amount of extra wiring in the basement of the Eastern School and it will also be necessary to cover the ceiling with Ten-test, or some similar material, in order to deaden the noise.

The sewing machine is not mentioned on the attached list, as we are ordering it direct.\n\nYou have already been authorized to secure the sink but we are including this item on the attached list. It has been decided to allow you to make local purchase, but as many articles as possible should be bought wholesale and not retail. I refer particularly to the electric stove. This should be a small sized one and I suggest that you endeavour to obtain it from the Canadian General Electric Company which is a wholesale firm. The dishes, cutlery and many of the other articles could be obtained from Caverhill & Learmonth, another wholesale firm.\n\nIn purchasing the articles it should be distinctly understood that, while serviceable equipment is desired, the cost must be kept as low as possible.

May we ask you also to issue an official order from the Department covering the following articles, without which we cannot purchase anything from the Canadian General Electric Company:\n\n1 RA 392 Range\n1 TL2 Toaster\n1 F52 Iron\n1-135D25 Hotplate\n5-135D20\n\nThere is practically no choice in the stoves, the Government allowing the sale of only two models. We have chosen the 4-plate range with one oven which retails at $176 but we understand that this stove will carry something like a 35% discount since it is bought directly. This direct purchase is allowed because it is a Government Purchase.\n\nThe four hotplates mentioned above are the only four left in stock. Therefore, may we ask you to send the official order to us here in Caughnawaga and we will take it directly to the General Electric to complete the business with them?\n\nWe spent hours at Caverhill Learmont trying to obtain kitchen utensils but at the end of that time, we found we were still short of seventy eight articles. Caverhill-Learmont personnel were very kind to us and they referred us directly to a manufacturer: The General Steel Wares. We were more fortunate there. We tried to be very reasonable and bought serviceable articles at the best price to be found.\n\nWe have a few more items to get. We are so happy to think that we will have a Domestic Science Department once again.\nWe thank you and all the other members of the Department who helped to make this reorganization a reality. It seems that we will miss Senior School less with that Department functioning once again.\n\nMr. Wescott is giving all his time and his experience to make this project a success. The lumber is to arrive tomorrow and the work will begin immediately.\n\nAwaiting your early reply, we beg to remain\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.

I have them worked out quite thoroughly but I am not quite satisfied with them yet. So many unusual things have happened of late, that I have been unable to give the units the attention they require. However, I promise them within a few days.\n\nMay I profit of this letter to ask you to authorize the additional purchase of approximately $30.00 worth of lumber for the boys of the Woodwork. They are running short of material for their projects.\n\nFurthermore, since the Woodwork has been transferred to the Eastern School, we have noticed that the floor of the cellar is constantly wet. At Mr. Wescott's suggestion, I would ask if it would be possible to build with the boys' help, a rough spruce floor. Mr. Wescott says that the workshop measures 19 ft X 50 ft. and a 2-inch plank would fill the bill.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to these matters, I beg to remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

We hope they will prove satisfactory.\n\nMay we ask if $100.00 is again authorized for the Domestic Science Department and $85.00 for the Sewing Class? We are expecting a very nice group of girls and boys this year and we believe that you will have every reason to be proud of your Caughnawaga Indians at Commencement Exercises next June. We are hoping that many of those who left us during the scholastic year 1942-1943 will return. Will we have a truant officer this year?\n\nOur General Prefect of Studies has offered us many valuable books which could be used by the teachers as reference books as so many of our personal books were destroyed in the Senior School fire. May we be authorized to purchase two sectional bookcases, one for each of the two village schools for these books? We thought we could find some serviceable bookcase in some second-hand shop in Montreal.\n\nWe are also enclosing a picture of our boys taken last June. They are happily displaying their woodwork. Thought it would interest you and Mr. Hoey as well as Mr. Doucet.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Will you kindly advise us if there is to be any change? He seemed to be somewhat worried over the matter.\n\nAlso, if Mr. Wescott is continuing his duties with us, will you kindly authorize him to place his order for the necessary lumber now? We were some three months without material last year and we would like to avoid such an occurrence again.

The Department is pleased to employ Mr. Wescott to teach Manual Training to the boys for the year 1944-45. You may inform him that no change had been anticipated.\n\nAs regards the second paragraph you may purchase the lumber necessary for the year 1944-45.\n\nIt is difficult for us to understand the statement contained in the last two lines of the inclosed letter. We would appreciate your comments on this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\nPhilip Phelan, Esq., Chief, Training Div., Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant enclosing copy of a communication from the Sister Superior dealing with the manual training for the coming school year.\n\nMr. Westcott has been informed that his services will be required in the Fall.\n\nRelative to the statement contained in the last two lines of the Sister's letter I may say that last Spring difficulties were experienced in getting the kind of lumber that Mr. Westcott wanted. Instead of receiving the lumber ordered in a single load the lumber merchant had to deliver same little by little as he could not get the lumber himself. However I am not ready to say that they were without lumber for three months as they used, in the meantime, lumber that was stored at the residence of the Sisters. The delay in obtaining the lumber is regretted but it was unavoidable due to the present conditions.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 12, 1944.\n\nMr. F.

As you will readily remember, the usual allowance was $85 but as the cost of these materials has increased considerably and as some seventy extra girls are to benefit of sewing and knitting classes this year, the extra $50 would be very much appreciated.\n\nAlso, can you tell us whether or not there will be discarded socks to be ripped this year? We have enough wool to be twisted for about two months only.\n\nWe would also appreciate if you could forward discarded service men's clothing\u2014the girls could get started on that in early September and make up their school uniform. As we stated before, the navy blue or the air force color is preferred.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to give us an early reply on these matters, we remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSisters of Saint Ann\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

School for the coming academic year. I presume the purchases will be made in small amounts and accounts will be sent in from time to time during the year.\n\nI am going to Nova Scotia next week and on my return I hope to spend part of the day at Caughnawaga. At that time I will discuss with you your request for discarded military clothing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Sister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR.C.

It is much too fine but with our spinning wheel, we will teach the girls to triple it while twisting and then to use it for their socks or mittens, etc. Wouldn't it be grand if we could find our Senior School in the ruins? Even nuns have wild dreams occasionally.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable answer to this letter, we beg to remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSisters of Saint Ann\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.

He would be an all time man and would also have charge of the physical training and sports for the boys. He is a married man and has four children. The question would arise as to residence. Would it be possible to rent a suitable residence for this man at Caughnawaga. I realize that this might entail some difficulties and possibly some trouble with the Indians.

The attached draft lease, with this in mind, is between the Minister as lessor and His Majesty the King as lessee. I have attempted to set down the conditions of the alterations and lease in this draft document. It is possible that they may need modification or change in some way.\n\nThe form of lease is satisfactory and if you are satisfied that all the conditions are included it may be submitted to the Deputy's Office for execution.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Solicitor.\nAtt., Mr. Doucet.\n\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nOctober 31, 1947.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 21st instant\nand to our reply of the 28th, dealing with the renting of a\nhouse at Caughnawaga for a Manual Training teacher and to\nsay that we have today received the visit of Mr. Arthur Beau-\nvais of this Reserve presently living at the Domaine d'Este-\nrel, Ste. Marguerite, Lake Masson, who is the owner of the\nhouse referred to in my recent communication, and to say that\nthe above named is willing to rent his house under the follow-\ning conditions.\n\nThe owner would put in an electric water pump,\nsinks, bathroom and inside toilets. He would finish the inside\nwith Ten Test or the equivalent. He would rewire his entire\nbuilding and would provide an electric water tank, Double\nwindows and doors. Also a 60 ampere electric panel for a\nstove.\n\nBeauvais would expect at least a two years lease\nat an annual rental of $600.00 per year and would request one\nyear paid in advance in order to proceed with the above work\nimmediately. An early reply is requested by the locatee so\nthat he can come and supervise the repairs before the ski season\nopens as he and his son and daughters are conducting a ski\nschools in the Laurentians, and will be quite busy from the\nlast part of November.\n\nIt might be advisable that an official of the\nTraining Division visits the Reserve in that connection and\nalso with regards with other matters pertaining to Schools\non the Reserve.\n\n(Frs.

Brisebois)\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, January 28, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your communication of the 26th instant, I am pleased to note that you are completely installed in your new home. I hope that you will find it cozy and comfortable.\n\nAs regards the last paragraph of your letter in which you state that you are ready to be initiated in your new duties, I wish to say that it would probably be more advantageous for you to start in and feel your way along in order to find out the difficulties that you will encounter. Then after a couple of weeks of operation, I would drop in and give you the time that you require. However, if you feel that you would prefer that I go right at the beginning let me know and I will arrange to go sooner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.

Any amount spent by Mr. Beauvais in excess of $1,800. will be paid by himself. Our records show that we have paid the amount on which we agreed.\n\nWe promised to pay rent at the rate of $50.00 a month for this house on the understanding that the amount we had spent for repairs would apply against the rent.

Please take the necessary steps to have his salary sent as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Visu would also request the visit of Mr. Doucet in order that detailed instructions be received and a complete program outlined.\n\n(Ps.

However, it was found necessary to send him to another school and, therefore, we will try to send him to Caughnawaga some day next week.\n\nHowever, we carefully considered the account and we are prepared to pay the second item, namely the rooms for the family for the three days during which they had to secure accommodation until the residence was ready for occupancy. We are not prepared to pay for the meals. Under these circumstances you should forward us another voucher for $27.00.\n\nBernard F.

Doucet\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe monthly report blanks for the Manual Training are being forwarded and I trust that they will meet with your approval. However, they need a little explanation since they do not correspond to your printed chart of basic operations.\n\nSister Mary Alma informs me that when these records were to be printed, you had asked her to prepare a complete program. Her multiple duties at that time allowed her to submit only the First Year program, which you accepted without the least change. But the lack of equipment and the local needs have forced her to revise the basic operations for the second and third years of knitting and for the three years of cooking, housekeeping, and sewing.\n\nThe last two will be submitted only in January as the Doctor has ordered Sister to take a complete rest for at least six weeks. (Mr. Neary sanctioned her leave of absence when he visited us on November 24.) Though this revision has not been approved by you, Sister has taken the liberty of preparing her monthly report according to her schedule, presuming that you would accept it \"tel que\". The report for the preparatory classes - Grades IV, V, VI - was made on the same basis as that of the previous months.\n\nWould you please send us more Record Sheets for the four basic operations of Domestic Science and for the Woodwork. I believe that Mr. Viau made the request when you came in November. Sister Mary Alma also solicits the permission to use her December allowance to purchase necessary utensils for her Culinary Department.\n\nOur new school is progressing rapidly since you sent Mr. Bock and Mr. Neary for inspection--such visits are real \"pep-builders\". May they be renewed often....\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are five schools on this reserve, two of them being in charge of Indian teachers, and the results obtained at these two schools are in marked contrast to the other three. The Indian teachers have no qualifications or training and, while they are doing their best, they are handicapped by their lack of education. Both these teachers have been in the service of the Department for some years, Mrs. Back, who is in charge of the Chenail School, was appointed six years ago, and Miss Roundpint, now Mrs. Armstrong, who has the Cornwall Island School, has been there seven years.\n\nI think it would be well to make a change after the summer holidays, as there would be no difficulty in getting duly qualified teachers to take charge of both these schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I explained to them that any teacher who could not work and live in harmony with the others on the reserve had a disturbing influence which would interfere with success in the classrooms. Miss E. Frudhomme, of Chetlain, handed in her resignation to take effect as soon as she could be relieved. I definitely placed Miss Macduffy in charge of the girls, both as far as their classroom activity was concerned and in their residence. I laid down the rule that the village residence was to be used by the Chetlain and Chenail teachers from Saturday until Sunday only and that they upon those occasions were to meet a fair share of the cost and to assist in the work. I arranged for the installation of Miss Carmel Dunnigan, the new teacher at St. Regis Island, who is to live with the two village teachers in the village residence. Mr. MacGibbon, the new Indian agent, is quite sincere and eager to do his best and I believe in time will be a good representative.\nDalhousie, Alta., Can.\n\nMarch 8, 1927\n\nI'm looking for information regarding the \"St. Regis Island Schools,\" and I imagine that this Department may be able to furnish it.\n\nI've been told that it's an Indian reserve and that the teachers there are appointed and paid by the Government.

WILLIAMS\n\nRE: ST. REGIS SCHOOL\n\nThe applicant, Frances Ursula Billings, is twenty-six years of age.\n\nShe attended Normal for one year and three years later, under the system then in Vogue in Ontario, returned to Normal for a further year's course. She holds a permanent second class certificate, together with an Elementary Agriculture certificate, Grade B Physical Training certificate, and Parts One of Elementary Art and Household Science.\n\nShe has taught for six years, all of this time in rural schools, where she taught the ordinary classes, and in addition for two years has been teaching in a rural school a class corresponding to the First Form of Collegiate as well as the other classes to be found in the ordinary rural school. From enquiries, she is highly regarded at her present school, where she is free to return next year, the present application not being made on account of any dismissal.\nDuring her six years' teaching experience, she has been located in a district comprised largely of Polish people, where special attention has of necessity been paid to the teaching of the English language and where she has also had considerable experience in developing a course of teaching suitable for the development into useful Canadian citizens of children whose environment and home training has not in every case been conducive to such a development.\n\nMrs. Belling is a Roman Catholic.\nSt. Patrick's Rectory,\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 11th, 1935.\n\nTo His Excellency Archbishop Forbes,D.D.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nYour Excellency,-\n\nThis is to recommend Miss Ursula Billings,\na parishioner of St. Patrick's, living at 151 Gloucester\nStreet.

Her experience and record justify this request on my\npart, and I therefore have no hesitation on that score in\nasking your Excellency to add still another favour to those\ngranted to me in the past.\n\nYour very humble and obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSt. Patrick's Rectory,\n281 Nepean Street,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAugust 11th, 1935\n\nMr. McGill, M.D.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have much pleasure in endorsing the accompanying letter of the Right Reverend Msgr.

Miss Ursula Billings has had an experience of six years in teaching to foreigners. I am sure that her work with the children of the Iroquois Reserve of St. Regis will be a success.\n\nVery respectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nArchb. of Ottawa.\nMiss Ursula Billings,\n151 Gloucester St., Apt.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nQueen 7326 W.\nOttawa, August 17, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has approved of your appointment as teacher of the Chenail Indian Day School, on the St. Regis Indian Reserve, for the coming academic year.

McNaughton, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSt. Regis, Quebec,\nFebruary 2nd, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to advise that on account of an influenza epidemic now current on the Reserve, it has, with the recommendation of Br. Gardiner, been considered advisable to close the schools of the Agency.\n\nDuring the last half of January there has been an increasing number of influenza cases, with some of pneumonia, both the Teachers and the school children being effected, the attendance at the schools dropping to a low percentage. Today's attendance at the Chemail school was 2 out of 22 enrolled, the other schools in proportion.\n\nThe schools will be closed for the remainder of the week, further action subject to the progress of the flu.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nThe matter of the schools of the reserve going on Daylight Saving or staying on Standard time was discussed.\n\nMoved by Peter J. Day sec. by Angus Oake that the schools adhere to Standard time.\n\nCarried.\n\nThere was considerable of a discussion developed regarding the time on which the schools should operate. A number of the residents of Cornwall Island find employment in Cornwall, which operated on advanced time. It did not seem to make much difference to the parents but it was considered it was best for the younger children if the schools operated on slow time.\n\nD. P. McNaughton,\nAgent.\nSt Regis, Que., October 5th, 1937.\n\nSeptember Report.\n\nThe schools of the reserve have opened for the fall term. The pupils were slow in returning to school, it being necessary to make several calls on parents in regard to their children's absence from school. The attendance has now reached approximately normal proportions. Manual training and domestic science classes have been started at the St Regis village Indian day school. Manual training has been taught during the last term in the Cornwall Island East, Indian day school.\n\nD. P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMiss Ursula Billings, of the Chenaill Day School, has made a request for an increase in her salary.\n\nAt the present time she is being allowed a salary of $70.00 a teaching month, which is $10.00 a month less than any of the other teachers on the St. Regis Reserve. Miss Billings is a fully qualified teacher and the Inspector's reports show that she is doing good work.\n\nI would therefore appreciate your concurrence in increasing her salary from $70.00 to $80.00 a teaching month from September 1st, 1937.\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 21, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMiss Ursula Billings, of the Chenail Day School, has made a request for an increase in her salary.\n\nAt the present time she is being allowed a salary of $70.00 a teaching month, which is $10.00 a month less than any of the other teachers on the St. Regis Reserve.

Boey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nMiss Ursula Billings, of the Chenail Day School, has made a request for an increase in her salary.\n\nAt the present time she is being allowed a salary of $70.00 a teaching month, which is $10.00 a month less than any of the other teachers on the St. Regis Reserve. Miss Billings is a fully qualified teacher and the Inspector's reports show that she is doing good work.\n\nI would therefore appreciate your concurrence in increasing her salary from $70.00 to $80.00 a teaching month from September 1st, 1937.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention,\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. Welfare & Training.\n\nSt. Regis Quebec,\nOctober 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs instructed via telegram, I got in touch with Miss Laura Leahy, Huntington Quebec, to secure her services as temporary teacher. Miss Leahy advised me that she could not consider a temporary position, but would be available for a position as a permanent teacher.\n\nThe Dr. has advised Miss Billings to take a week for convalescence. It is expected she will resume her duties on the 2nd of November.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYesterday afternoon I found a car load of people waiting in the pouring rain for the Indian Agent, who was down Chenaill. They wanted immediate attention as the Member of Parliament had sent them up to see about \"a vacancy for a teacher from Huntingdon\".\n\nI told them one teacher had been ill, that the diagnosis at the beginning of the week had been diphtheria and a call sent to Ottawa for a relief teacher, but that Friday's laboratory report on the swab sent in had been negative, and that the teacher would be ready for work again in a few days.\n\nThe teacher who had received the message from Mr. Black is a smartly dressed, white-haired lady, who said she would not for a minute consider any school to which she would have to go in a boat, to say nothing of the additional tramp of a mile through the mud. She also said she would not consider a short assignment of a week or two. When I left the reserve about 4:30 they were still waiting for the Agent, and planning to telephone the member when they returned to Huntingdon.\n\nMiss Billings had had rather a hard time. Dr. Gardiner, the reserve doctor, first landed her throat for quinsy, and then thought she had diphtheria and gave her a big shot of antitoxine. I think the cure has been worse than the disease, and she is anxious to see her own Doctor. I think she will have to go home for a few days to recuperate, and if so will see you in Ottawa this week. She is quite sure she will be ready for work a week from now. I think Mr. McNaughton will be anxious to know whether the school will be open at all this week or not, and by the time he could get mail now there will be only two days left in the week, so if you want to get him, phoning is about all that's left. The number is 35 F 21 (St. Regis, Que., through Fort Covington, N.Y.)\n\nIt has rained steadily ever since I left home, and I'm mud to the neck. I expect two of the shops will be sort of \"leak open\" tomorrow, but it's hard to get the men to pound logs in the rain.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Wotta typewriter!\nSt. Regis Quebec,\nOctober 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the illness of Miss Ursula Billings, reservation teacher, the clinical symptoms resembling diphtheria.\n\nDepartmental instructions, via telegram, was followed. Provincial Health Officer visited St. Regis and met Dr. Gardiner. The teachers of the Village and St. Regis island schools, following antidote treatment, was allowed to resume teaching.\n\nDr. Gardiner forwarded swabs for laboratory tests. Laboratory report received shows absence of diphtheria bacilli.\n\nThe Doctor has recommended a weeks convalescence for Miss Billings. It is expected that she will be able to return to her duties on the 2nd of November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs instructed, via telephone, I got in touch with Mrs Henry Daust of Huntington Quebec, giving necessary information regarding temporary position as teacher during convalescence of Miss Billings.

However, if any vacancy occurs the matter will be brought to your attention.\n\nI consider that the teachers at present employed are fully qualified. The Inspector has not yet made his spring inspection but if he reports unfavourably on the work of any teacher you will be advised.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 2, 1938.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nAt the request of Mr. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Miss Moodie has discussed with the Superior of the school at Ste. Martine the possibility of providing a short course in weaving for adults only.\n\nMiss Moodie has recently visited Ste. Martine, and the Superior is willing to arrange a two weeks' course from June 27th to July 9th for a group of not less than eight. This group would have the cottage across from the convent at Ste. Martine, and, as Ste. Martine is on the Chateauguay river, it is very pleasantly located. The cost of board, lodging and tuition for the two weeks would be $15.00 plus a small extra amount for materials used.\n\nI understand that Miss Moodie has already discussed the matter with some of the teachers in the St. Regis agency, and I am, therefore, bringing the matter to your attention, in the hope that you will find it possible to take advantage of the offer mentioned in this letter. If so, you should at once advise Miss McDonald, teacher of the St. Regis Village School.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit the Department paying the cost of the course. This will have to be paid by each one who takes it. However, in the event of your deciding to avail yourself of this opportunity, we will advise the Indian Agent that if final arrangements are made any teacher taking the course may close her school on Friday June 24th, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss U.

Thus a certain savings could be achieved on total expenditure.\n\nDepartmental observations regarding the above would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nSt.Regis Quebec,\nMay 27,1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nNew Building, School.\n\nI have reference to my letter of August 31,1938 in which I recommended provision for expenditure in construction of a new school building to replace the one now in use at the Chenail school, St.Regis Reserve.\n\nThe present building provides too small a space for the number of children 27 enrolled at the school. There is no room for the teaching of vocational training, no provision for wash room or cloak room. One large room about 20' by 16'. Children packed in such small space have not sufficient air circulation, especially in winter months.\n\nA building approximately the size and style of the one constructed for the Cornwall Island, east, school would prove suitable. In lieu of using space allowed for teacher quarters, as provided in said building, these could be used for vocational training, Domestic science and manual training. At any time when the rooms would be required as a teachers living quarters, the basement could be used for manual training.\n\nMay I be advised if provision has been made for construction of proposed building and if plans for said building would be provided by the Department or if I may submit plans and tenders for the construction complete, providing for the employment of Indian labour where possible.\n\nIf It Is\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nJune 1, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to providing a new school to replace the present Chensil school.

One at the Chenail (Miss Rita Caza) and at the St Regis Island School (Miss Fernande LaVallee). Both appear to be managing very well, although it will take some time to become familiar with the children and their varied duties.\n\nD.P. McNaughton,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nAt this time I wish to refer you to your letter of June 1st, 1939 under File 33-1-1 and relative correspondence pertaining to the present Chenail Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware the matter of keeping the above school in fit condition to accommodate pupils has been quite a problem for some time past. At the present time, if this school is to continue in operation, the foundation must of necessity be replaced and the roof shingled. It is doubtful if the building in itself would warrant such an expenditure.\n\nWith respect to enlarging the capacity of the present Village School to take care of the children from the Chenail district, instead of building a school at the latter place, this would appear to be a step in the right direction as it is doubtful if any of the children attending would have more than a mile to walk. Of course transportation would have to be afforded during the navigable season so that there would be no danger of any pupils losing their lives while crossing the St. Regis River.\n\nWe would appreciate being advised if this matter has been given any further consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A.

Cornwall Island West school led the field this month with a percentage attendance of 99.1%.\n\nD.P.

Attendance during the month for all schools is considered good. In some cases however families have moved off the Reserve to centres where employment was found. On the 27th., and 28th Inspector A.E. Wescott made his annual visit to the Quebec schools in this Agency. His voiced opinion was that the teachers in general had made progress over last year. He appeared to be particularly interested in the displays exhibited as the result of the manual training and home economics classes at the various schools. Some very good work was done by the students in woodwork and sewing and knitting.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa.\n\nT.L.

However, lately Miss Terrance has been con-\ntacted and she advised she would return to the Chenail\nSchool. You are aware that Miss Terrance lives on the\nAmerican side about six miles distant from the Chenail\nSchool and experiences great difficulty in getting to\nher school during the winter especially.\n\nConcerning Mrs. White, (nee Emily Peters) she\nis now married to an American Indian who is serving in\nthe U.S. Forces. She intimated she would return to duty\nthis Fall but would like to have a residence built for\nher on Cornwall Island. She is now with her husband in\nSt. Louis Mo.\n\nWhile many things could happen between now\nand September the above is all the information that\ncan be furnished at this writing. Perhaps at a\nlater date more definite information can be obtained\nfrom Mrs. White and in the meantime you might advise\nwhether or not her marital status would disqualify\nher from teaching on the reserve as apart from being\nmarried she has lost her status as a member of the\nSt. Regis Band.\n\nD.P.

REGIS INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OCTOBER, 1944.\n\n3.\nThe attendance in the Junior Room of the Village School shows a small increase over the previous month. The attendance in the Senior Room, however, has not been so good, this being due to the fact that in previous years many of the children from the Senior Room were in the habit of going to Malone to work during the vegetable harvest. While this office is definitely not in favor of such a practice in any of our schools, I have found it very difficult to effect a reversal of previous policy in this matter. Conditions with this respect in regard to the Chenail schools is especially bad. Due to the organizational work being instituted for the children of the Village, we expect an improvement in the attendance record for this school in the near future.\n\nW.L.

REGIS AGENCY\n\nSchools:\nOf the five classrooms in our four schools which were opened on Sept. there was an average attendance of 85% for this quarter. Attendance is improving, especially at the Village School, and it is felt that among other factors the family Allowance regulations regarding schooling are having some effect. The Chenail and Chetlain schools were not opened this quarter due to the fact that there were no teachers available. However, these schools were scheduled to open on October 1.\n\nT.L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nWould you be kind enough in the future to send all cheques designated for Miss Rita Caza, teacher at the St. Regis Island school, Miss Margaret Terrance of the Cornwall school, and Mrs. Katie Armstrong of the Chetlain school, of this Agency, addressed in care of this office?\n\nP.

Bonnah in his letter of the 21st instant, requests that all cheques designated for Miss Rita Caza, teacher of St. Regis Island School, Miss Margaret Terrance teacher of the Chetlain School and Mrs. Katie Armstrong of the Chetlain School be addressed in care of the St. Regis Agency Office.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nQuarterly Report\nSt. Regis Indian Agency\n\nSchools\n\nBelow is the percentage of attendance of our schools during the quarter under review:\n\n| School                  | December | November | October |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Cornwall Ild. E. School | 59.7     | 61.8     | 77.8    |\n| Cornwall \" W. \"         | 61       | 68       | 88      |\n| Village School - Senior | 71.6     | 88.1     | 87.8    |\n| \" \" - Junior            | 67.3     | 94.2     | 91      |\n| Chetlain School         | 80       | 94       | 90.9    |\n| Chetlain                | 93       | 94.2     | 92      |\n| St. Regis Island        | 76.6     | 67.5     | 77.09   |\n\nIt will be noted in some cases very low average for December. This is due to the flu epidemic mostly. In general it can be said that attendance at the various schools has maintained a high level. Such a high percentage is particularly noteworthy at the Chetlain school where it was difficult to get the boys to school. The reverse is now the case as far as the boys are concerned, with the exception of the Cornwall Ild. E. School no unusual difficulty is caused. The Village boys get the benefit of some training along this line when such is possible with the time at the disposal of the local constable, with only one man now stationed here less time can be devoted to such work amongst the boys. Due to the poor freezing of the St. Lawrence this winter it has not been possible during December to get to St. Regis Island school. The conditions are such that it is not safe to walk nor can a boat be used. Only emergency trips are made by the Indian residents of the island.\n\nIn general the children on the whole appear to be well-behaved and industrious. There is very little incentive for those children in our Quebec schools to devote much energy to studies after they reach the age of 15 as the prospect of being able to attend a high school is no better than in past years. The period of maximum attendance at school is between the ages of 15 and 16. The boys in particular just wont exert themselves too much after 15. This situation is most unfortunate as they have just reached a point in life when they should be capable of absorbing some knowledge. I feel though that if we could give them the kind of training they would like at this period we would be well repaid and would not have any attendance problem on our hands to contend with.\n\nT.L.

At that time, due to absence of Agency Office Staff, all teachers were invited to sit in and discuss ways of improving general conditions amongst the Indian population of the reserve and, in particular, to find ways of becoming more proficient in our respective positions. Opposition was expected and received. Some teachers had been so long in one place it was hard for them to realize there was any relation between the individual school and the remainder of the community. After the barriers were torn down, much good came of these discussions.\n\nOn account of the heavy field programme to date for the current year, only the immediate office staff has been brought into consultation. It is hoped that, with the approval of senior officials concerned, it might be possible to have the teachers take part in these discussions again in the near future.\n\nT.L.

So far I have read \"The Seasons Pass\" and I have enjoyed it very much. It tells us a lot about nature in an interesting way.\n\nYou may be glad to hear that we took\nadvantage of the Food Contest. All the pupils of Senior Room entered it. We were honored in having our Reverend Pastor Father M. Jacobs S.J., our kind and devoted Agent Mr. T.L. Connah and Chief Ernest Benedict as judges. The lucky winners were Thomas Swamp of Grade 7, 1st prize; Ronald Thomas of Grade 5, 3rd prize. I was fortunate enough to take 2nd prize.\n\nOnce again I wish to express the gratitude of the Sisters and pupils of our school for your kindness to us.

After perusing the attached list, you will observe that six out of seven have an attendance of over 90%. I might mention that the month of April was by no means the nicest month, insofar as weather is concerned, that we have had since school opened last September.\n\nI realize that such a request means additional work for you but under the circumstances it would help our programme out if the schools concerned received some acknowledgment of their achievement from your office. If this is not possible you may rest assured that we will continue our efforts to improve the attendance at the various schools.

I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating everyone for the splendid success achieved.

I appreciate your kindness all the more, because I know that you are a very busy man, still in all, you found time to write to show the interest you take in our school.\n\nWe should be proud of and grateful to our Agent, Mr. T. L. Bonnah, who does so much to help the teachers and also for the betterment of the Indians.\n\nThe Attendance, this year, I am happy to say, is very much better than last year. From May 26th to 30th, I had only one half day absence.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that most of the pupils, especially those of Senior Room, have come into school every morning, since September, at 8:15 to prepare their lessons for the day. We have a very ambitious Seventh Grade who will write Entrance next year, so, we hope they will continue the good work.\n\nWe are anxious for you, dear Mr. Neary, to pay us a visit, if time permits, so that you will see for yourself, \"What nice little Indians we have\".\n\nI remain,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSister Mary Zita, S.S.C.\n\nColonel Bernard F.

R. F. Henry\n\nDear Mr. Henry:\n\nFollowing our discussion recently concerning the appointment of qualified teachers for the new school in the Chenaill, I might say that the matter was discussed with the local authorities of the St. Regis Mission. Father Jacobs is very enthusiastic over the possibility of obtaining two or three sisters from the Sisters of Service Order who, I understand, are not only highly qualified teachers but trained social workers as well. It will not be possible for several days to take the matter up with the Bishop concerned as, at present, he is away on retreat. However, Father Jacobs advises that there is very little possibility of any refusal on the part of the Bishop to co-operate with us.\n\nIt is suggested that you contact the above Order and ascertain if they are in a position to supply us with two qualified teaching sisters with welfare training and possibly a third, as suggested by you, who could be put on a part time basis to take care of the Domestic Science teaching. It is just possible that by the time the new school is all equipped, we will find it more convenient not to open until the fall term. Such being the case, the situation at the Cornwall Island post can be remedied by the transfer to that school of Miss Francis (at present in Chenaill school).\n\nT. L. Graham,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 4, 1947.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nThe Department is keenly aware of the valuable work being done by Sisters of your Order at the Christian Island N.C. Indian Day School. Therefore, when Mr. Indian Agent Bonnah of Cornwall was in our office recently, discussing the teacher situation at the new Indian Day School on the Chenaill Reserve near St. Regis, it was suggested that we approach the Reverend Father Jacobs, S.J., the local Missionary, concerning the Sisters of Service.\n\nAt the present time the Sisters of Saint Ann are teaching in the village school, where it is possible for them to attend Mass every day. At Chenaill, this would not be the case and therefore your Order came to mind.\n\nI have now received a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Bonnah reading in part as follows:\n\n\"Following our discussion recently concerning the appointment of qualified teachers for the new school in the Chenaill, I might say that the matter was discussed with the local authorities of the St. Regis Mission. Father Jacobs is very enthusiastic over the possibility of obtaining two or three Sisters from the Sisters of Service Order who, I understand, are not only highly qualified teachers but trained social workers as well.

It is possible they might consider the appointment of one teaching sister and one part-time to take over domestic science. We would then use the services of Miss Helen Francis at present in Chenail School for the other classroom. It might be advisable to draw this alternative to their attention. We would have to find a boarding place for Miss Francis but this could, I believe, be arranged next door to the school.\n\nThe other possibility is to approach the Sisters of St. Martha at Antigonish and see if they are in a position to assist us and it would be agreeable to the local Mission Fathers if you would consider this angle. I think these sisters have similar rules to the above Order.\n\nShould we receive a negative answer in both cases we will, with your permission, endeavour to revive the matter through other channels. I think, however, it should be brought to the attention of the sisters concerned that this is an English speaking community.\n\nYou might let me know the results of your further efforts.\n\nT.L.

However, when the Cardinal had a discussion with the Mother General at the Marian Congress, nominations for teachers appeared in a very short time. Therefore, it is suggested that Father Jacobs approach his Bishop to see whether he would make representations to the Sisters of Service regarding this school. Father Jacobs could point out the alternative mentioned in your letter. In the meantime, we will write to the Sisters of St. Martha at Antigonish with regard to this school.\n\nBernard F.

This school is now under construction and we hope to have it finished within the next three or four months. To date Mr. Bonnah and I have been unable to interest any Order of teachers in this school as they would be unable to attend daily Mass because of the distance from the nearest Church.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss M. B. Searson,\nHyndford, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Chenail Indian Day School\n\nReferring to your file 33-1-1 (WT) of the 22nd ultimo, I have just been advised by Father Jacobs that Bishop Langelois of Valleyfield Diocese is making strong representations to have the Sisters of Service made available when our new school opens. I will keep you informed as soon as further developments come to light.\n\nI would be interested in knowing the results of your correspondence in regards to the Sisters of St. Martha.\n\nT. L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 15, 1948.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nThe news of the success of your Sisters at our Day School at Eskasoni has travelled far and I have now a request from Mr. Indian Agent Borneh at Cornwall, Ontario, that we ascertain if your Order is interested in a school on the St. Regis Reserve.\n\nThe Reverend Father Jacobs, S.J., the local Missionary, has also concurred in this request and he will await a reply before approaching Bishop Langlois.\n\nWe would require two teaching Sisters and possibly a third who could be put on a part-time basis to take care of domestic science teaching. The new school will not be ready for occupancy until the Easter term or possibly until September. There is a teacher's residence attached. We already have the Sisters of Saint Ann teaching in the village school, where it is possible for them to attend Mass every day. At Cheneil, where the new school is located, this would not be possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Sister M. Ignatius,\nSuperior General,\nSisters of St. Martha,\nMother House of the Sisters of St. Martha,\nAntigonish, Nova Scotia.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06",
