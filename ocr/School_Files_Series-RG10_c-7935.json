One was submitted by the Savory Electric on a cost plus 15% basis, the other was submitted by J.H. Turvey Electrical Co., and was a firm bid in the amount of $7,331.00. Major Mackay pointed out in his memorandum, that he was advised by Indian Superintendent Randle, that the United Electrical Co., Ltd., would forward their tender within a few days. Since that time, we have contacted officers of the Indian Affairs Branch by telephone on numerous occasions concerning this matter, requesting that action be taken to procure this tender so that we could make our comments and remove this job from our list of work on hand. We were advised that Mr. Randle would be requested to investigate the situation at an early date.\n\nThe last paragraph of Major Mackay's memorandum to you of the first instant, to which was attached the tender of the United Electrical Co., Ltd., in the amount of $6,620.24 together with their deposit cheque in the amount of $662.02, is not clear in that no mention is made of the two firms whose tenders, referred to in the foregoing, were forwarded to this Division.\n\nCommenting on the three tenders received, that of the J.H. Turvey Electrical Co., is the lowest lump sum bid and we believe it would be in the best interest of the Department to have the Indian Affairs Branch award a contract to this firm; however in view of the fact that no reference is made to the tender submitted by this firm, in Major Mackay's memorandum of April 1st, we suggest that Mr. Randle be requested to contact the J.H. Turvey Electrical Co., and ascertain if they are prepared to undertake the work at the price quoted in their tender dated October 13, 1948, and if a price change is indicated they should be requested to submit a revised quotation for consideration before awarding the contract.\n\nIn connection with Major Mackay's memorandum to you of March 22nd last, in which he points out that it is the intention of the Indian Affairs Branch to utilize present unused space on the top floor of the building to provide adequate accommodation for the pupils at the institute, we would point out that electrical work, in addition to that shown on our plans, will be necessary when it is decided what architectural changes are necessary in this area.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn order that the electrical work may be started as soon as possible, we would suggest that the contract be awarded and the costs for the electrical work, in connection with the architectural changes to the top floor, be covered by an Extra Work Order which will be issued when we know the extent of the work involved. We estimate that the cost of additional electrical work in this area will not exceed $700.00.\n\nWe will retain the deposit cheque of the United Electrical Co., Ltd., until the Indian Affairs Branch receives further advice from Mr. Randle in connection with the tender of the J.H.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRef Mohawk Institute\n\nYour letters 466-5 (E.1) of the 20th and 25th instant are acknowledged re the above and though your letter of the 20th was not quite clear, it was assumed your reference to a tender for labour was with regard to the top floor alterations and your letter of the 25th means us to disregard this, in view of the Examination by the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nAs you state, we have the paint on hand for the exterior painting and it is assumed the tender of Robert Styres to do the work for $1100.00 which was accepted last year, is still good.\n\nMr. Styres is prepared to start as soon as the children go on holidays, which is felt wiser, as with ladders and paint supplies around, with the children there, they could get up to a good deal of mischief.\n\nWith regard to moving the former Chapel Building at the Army Camp, which Mr. Zimmerman requires for additional staff quarters, Mr. Rispin says he would have to charge $1000.00 for the operation.\n\nRispin states the building will, owing to its length and shape, have to be cut and moved in two sections and maybe three. You will realize, that the time taken in movement from point to point is not the expensive part of such operations, it is the time taken to cut, jack up, brace up open ends and get ready for movement, followed by the time taken to lower the portions on their new site, line them up and repair roof where cut.\n\nConsequently, the price quoted is reasonable, somewhat higher than previously, but wages and other costs have moved up since the quotations of two years ago.\nRispin can only move it and place it for the $1000.00 stated, he cannot take the time to finish it off for occupation, as he states he has too much private work ahead to do so, which he has neglected somewhat for two years, moving our many buildings.\n\nIt is suggested, therefore, that you approve of his offer, so he can proceed at once, as he is almost through with the hospital and Council buildings, then this office will submit a further recommendation concerning what is necessary and the costs of making it into two apartments, so we can get the work done ready for occupation in September.\n\nMay we also receive the authority to go ahead on the Domestic Science Building, so we can get it in operating order now, rather than wait to the summer holidays when so much other school work is done.\n\nYou have already approved of the installing of kitchen cabinets, etc., at a cost of $496.08, but there is the siding, painting and building of partitions.\n\nWe have the insul brick siding on hand, but it will cost about $60.00 to have it put on by an Indian carpenter.\n\nWhile we did not reline the floors of the other army buildings used as schools, in this case, in view of the nature it is to be used for, it is felt a new floor should be placed in to give a first rate appearance and some cupboards, also a partition around the kitchen part.\n\nLabour and material for this will cost approximately $400.00. The cost of paint and labour for painting will cost approximately $200.00.\n\nIf the work painting, siding and carpentering can now be authorized, please send an accountable cheque for $300.00, then it will be possible to proceed at once and we can employ workmen who will then carry on with other school repairs after the holidays commence.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent\n4th May, 1949.\n\nMr. E.P. Randle,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of April 29th with reference to the Mohawk Institute. As stated in official letter of April 20th, the electrical alterations and changes in the top floor of the building will be carried out under the direction of the Lands & Development Services Branch.\n\nWith reference to the painting of the exterior of the building, this work may be done by Mr. Robert Styres on the understanding that the total amount to be paid for labour will be $1,100.00.\n\nWe are requesting the Minister's approval for the tender of $1,000.00 from Mr. Rispin to move the former chapel building at the Army Camp to the site of the Mohawk Residential School. As soon as we receive approval, you will be advised.\n\nFrom the last four paragraphs of your letter, we understand that material and labour for repairing the Domestic Science building will amount to $660.00. You should forward a requisition immediately for the material.\nrequired so that purchase can be made through our Purchasing Branch. Under separate cover we will forward you an accountable cheque for $300.00 for labour.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, May 4th, 1949.\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Mohawk Indian Residential School\n\nAdditional accommodation is required at the above mentioned school for staff quarters.\n\nThe chapel building at the former Army Camp is our property, and it can be moved to the Mohawk Residential School. Owing to its length and shape, the building will have to be cut and moved in two sections. It requires considerable time to cut, jack up, and brace upon ends, and also get ready for movement. It also takes considerable time to lower the portions on their new site, line them up and repair the roof where cut.\n\nMr. T.J. Rispin of Brantford, Ontario, who has moved several other buildings from the former camp site to different locations on the Six Nations Reserve, offers to move the chapel building to the site of the Mohawk Residential School for an amount of $1,000.00. Indian Superintendent Randle states that this price is reasonable.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the Minister would approve acceptance of Mr. Rispin's quotation, in order that the building can be moved at an early date.\n\nPP/ST Director.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nLand and Development Services Branch,\nEngineering and Construction Division.\n\nSUBJ.: Revisions, Alterations & Additions to Electrical System, Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nEnclosed please find plans and specification papers for Electrical work to be done at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont.\n\nWe have followed the specifications and plans in arriving at the sum of ($6,620.24) Six thousand six hundred and twenty dollars and twenty four cents, which covers all revision, alterations and additions required in your Specifications.\n\nWe are enclosing a Certified cheque for the sum of Six hundred and sixty two dollars and two cents ($662.02) as laid down in your specification papers.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSacy-Treas.,\nUnited Electric Co Ltd\nSAVORY ELECTRIC\n18 HEAD STREET\nBRANTFORD, ONTARIO\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Lands & Development\nEngineering & Construction Division, Ottawa, Canada\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have studied the plans & specifications for the above buildings, and being well acquainted with them, as I have kept the old system going for the last four years, I find with shortages & substitutions & price increases, that under existing conditions I could not give a definite quotation.\n\nUp to the present I have had no labour troubles & do not anticipate any as my men have been with me for a considerable time and are good men.

F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nMy dear Colonel:\n\nYou will find enclosed descriptions of milk cooler units. There is no doubt in my mind about the wisdom and necessity of such a unit.\n\nMr. Hawarth and I feel that the portable unit is the most desirable. If ever for one reason or another one wishes to move the unit it would not be necessary to build another tank. The cost of building a tank is rather considerable and tricky. There is an inside layer of cement, cork and another layer of cement. The portable units have insulated tops. The Victor or the Champion would be most acceptable. The Wood machine is very well known but more costly. Many farmers around Brantford are using these machines and in fact if one sends to a dairy they are compulsory.\n\nThe Champion unit costs $75.00 as I told you in Toronto. There would be the extra cost of building the tank. We can build a tank but I question whether it will be as satisfactory as the ready made.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. W. J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. The Champion has one advantage since it is longer and narrower. It would fit better into our milk house.\n\nTo Mr. Philan:\n\nTechnical advice approve all makes.\n\nMr. Zimmerman practically narrows the ultimate selection to the Champion 4-can self-contained \"portable\" (500lt.) offered by Ballantine for $400.00 plus something for wiring.\n\nMr. Z should supply figures as follows:\nCow milked: Milkings per day: Gallons produced: Gallons used; Gallons added daily.\n\nC.A.I.C.\n10 May\n11th May, 1949.\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Indian Residential School,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Zimmerman:\n\nWe received your letter of April 30th with reference to a milk cooler unit.\n\nIt is our intention to submit the matter to the officials of the Agricultural Department, but before doing so we require the following information:\n\n(1) Number of cows milking.\n(2) Number of gallons of milk produced daily.\n(3) Number of gallons of milk used at the school daily.\n(4) Number of gallons of milk sold daily.\n\nAs soon as we receive this information, your request will receive further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

May 12/49... 23.\n\n(2) Number of Gallons of milk... May 12/49... 966 lbs. produced daily.\n\n(3) Milk supplied to school... May 12/49... 375 lbs.\n\n(4) Number of gallons sold... No milk sold... During Month of April sold 448.9 lbs of butter fat.\n\nOne gallon of milk weighs roughly 10 lbs.\n\nThe custom at the Institute has been to use skim milk at the school. Besides the skim milk there is sent to the Institute 2 qts. of cream and 6 qts. of milk each day. Six qts. of milk is supplied to the families employed by Institute but living out.\n\nI do hope that these figures will help to clarify the situation. Once again may I say with all sincerity that we do need very badly a milk cooler or some method of controlling the bacterial count. The health authorities will not permit us to use ice off the river. City water which has a temperature of roughly 70 degrees in the Summer is useless.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo Mr. Phelan:\n\nMilk supplied to school 375 lbs. and skim milk at that! This would fill the 4-can cooler (48 gal.) The other 600 gal. produced on May 12 were shipped to... But the amount of butterfat sold is not stated. This is a problem for experts.

Turvey Electric Company of Brantford is in the amount of $5,331.00, and we recommend that the Indian Affairs Branch pay the Contractor the value of his work done to date, which amounts to $4,790.90.\n\nChanges to our plans, requested by the Indian Affairs Branch to suit specific applications of certain areas, involved re-arrangement of the distribution system, type of lighting, and extra electrical work was required which was authorized on the job by our electrical engineer. The cost of this extra work amounted to $975.87, which, along with the Contractor's invoice for wiring new dormitory space, will be treated as extra work to be paid from funds made available by the Indian Affairs Branch. The Contractor will submit his claim for the balance of the Contract price, plus the value of the extra work mentioned above, for payment after final inspection is made upon completion of the work.\n\nPlans are now in the process of preparation for the alteration of the attic storage space into dormitory areas and will be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch in the near future.\n\nWe are writing the J.H. Turvey Electric Company advising them to present a Progress Estimate in triplicate to Col. E.P. Randle, Indian Superintendent at Brantford, for payment of ninety per cent (90%) of their Contract price.\n\nFor your information and necessary attention, please,\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A.

You will be good enough to see that the matter is attended to by the forest bailiff or by someone deputed by you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nGordon J.

The latter portion of the work so described being in the Township of Brantford.\n\nAlso the construction of a sewerage system for the subdivisions of Bellview, Parkdale and Hyde Park, all in accordance with the plans filed with the Board and also with the Department of Indian Affairs and with the Corporation of the Township of Brantford, a portion of the sewer system extending along Fifth Avenue which forms the boundary between the Township...\nof Brantford and the City of Brantford at this point.\n\nThe reasons for the construction of the proposed works are, as to the work first mentioned, the necessity of providing additional outlet for the present general sewerage system of the City of Brantford and also for the increased sewerage which will require to be taken care of on account of the construction of the works secondly mentioned, and the reason for the construction of the works secondly mentioned is the necessity for the provision of a sewerage system for the subdivisions mentioned.\n\nA general reason for the construction of these works in addition is the extreme desirability during this present season of affording relief work for the unemployed in the City of Brantford.\n\nIn the construction of the works mentioned it is not necessary that any highways should be closed except that it is desirable to have permission, if necessary in the construction of the work and for a temporary period only, to close a portion of the Mohawk Road approximately five hundred feet in length in front of the Mohawk Church and another section of the said Road approximately five hundred feet in length commencing at a point where this Road is crossed by the Mohawk Creek and extending Westerly along Mohawk Road.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to close these portions of the Mohawk Road a period of approximately ten days will be sufficient for the closing of each section.\n\nIn the opinion of the applicant the Township is not affected except by the temporary closing of Mohawk Road.\nas above set forth, and the only land owner effected is the Department of Indian Affairs across whose lands it is proposed to construct the sewer and who have consented to the construction upon terms that they are to be protected from being called upon for any damages in consequence of its construction.\n\nApplication for the approval of the Provincial Board of Health of the said works has been already made and an Order of the Board approving of same has been received.\n\nDATED at the City of Brantford this 24th day of January, 1922.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSolicitor for the City of Brantford.\n\nNOTICE is hereby given that the above application will be heard by the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board at the Board's Chambers, 47 Queen's Park, in the City of Toronto, on Thursday the Second day of February, 1922, at a quarter of Three o'clock in the afternoon, pursuant to the Board's appointment, a copy of which is hereto attached.\n\nDATED at Brantford this 24th day of January, 1922.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSolicitor for the City of Brantford.\n\nTo-\nThe Corporation of the Township of Brantford, and Gordon J. Smith, Esquire, for the Department of Indian Affairs at Brantford.\nI am pleased to inform you of the City of Toronto's intention to undertake a Municipal Works project to construct a trunk line sewer through the Mohawk Reservation.

It is observed that the amounts received for the various parcels of the Globe Farm, which were assessed by the Company, are set forth in red ink on the said plan.\n\nYou are aware that judgment was given against the Company by the Exchequer Court of Canada in respect of the Manual Labour Farm. The formal judgment has not yet been settled, but the draft of the formal judgment, which has been submitted to the Company's solicitor, Mr. H....Sawyer, L.C., of Brantford, Ontario, provides as follows:\n\n\"And this court doth further order and adjudge that the Defendant the Company for the preparation of the Gospel in New England and the parts adjacent in America, commonly called the New England Co. may be account to the plaintiff for all moneys received by said Company as the proceeds of sales of any portions of the lands described in the Information filed herein.\"\n\nI would be glad accordingly if you could state what amount was received by the Company in respect of each of the\n\nP.S. - Please sign.\n\nCharter Clerk\nThe New England Company,\n24 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, England.\nfour parcels sold from the Normal Labour Farm as set forth on the plan above referred to and if any other parcels of the said Farm have been, have been sold from this Farm.\n\nI am also owing a copy of a plan of the Normal Labour Farm showing parcels Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 which have been disposed of from this farm according to the records in the Registry Office at Brantford.

I would therefore recommend that if possible the shape of the parcel granted to the New England Company for school purposes be altered so as to include their buildings, which could be done without increasing the area.\n\nSept. 12, 1953.\nOctober 23, 1922.\n\nDear Major Smith,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the manual training farm, and to say in reply that I have arranged to pay into the Six Nations funds for the rental of the property, (163.9 acres) $500.00 a year, as of the 1st of April, next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMajor Gordon J.

It evidently includes the roads to and from the school, the Mohawk Church and cemetery. The plan of Lot 5 shows a 11.07 acre parcel to the west of the school. I believe this is included in the 163.9 acreage. For this property, the Department is giving the Band, who own it - subsequent to litigation in 1921-2 - a rental of $500 per annum. This is known as the manual training farm.\n\nC.

This expenditure has not been authorized and no application has been made for it. This is because nothing was said to me by the Company prior to the building of the fence. I saw the work proceeding but as all repairs had been made by the Company I did not know that we should be expected to bear a share of the cost. Mr. Scaife, the purchasing agent of the Company, told me that he did not know of it either until the payment was brought to his attention.\n\nHad I been consulted I should have been inclined to take the position that an ordinary wire fence would suit our purposes as well as the high board fence that was erected. However, since it is an expenditure that will not likely recur for another thirty-three years and since the Cockshutt Co. have borne the expense of repairs and painting ever since the fence was erected it does not seem unreasonable that the account which I am forwarding should be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W.

In any event, as it has already been demonstrated that oil does not exist in any quantity in that district and the gas production is quite limited, it would be our view that the New England Company would be better advised to refuse the application. The necessary disturbance in connection with such a proposition would be considerable in such a small area and the results by way of royalties or rentals would, no doubt, be insignificant.\n\nIn so far as the financial standing of the applicant is concerned, that is a matter which, of course, the New England Company must investigate themselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.

The Department can perhaps trace a map of this lot prepared by W. R. White in 1922, which gives the position of the school plot.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor E. P.

These last observations, of course, are a little outside of our purview in the matter and, therefore, are made only for your confidential information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L.

The said lands to be leased for the duration of the present war and a period of five years thereafter.\n2. The rental to be $150.00 per acre per annum.\n3. The entire cost of removing, rebuilding and replacement of fences now, and on termination of the lease, to be at the expense of the Cockshutt Plow Company.\n4. At the expiration of the lease, the land leased to be placed in its former condition and suitable for cultivation.\n5. Rental to be paid on the signing of the lease and on the same date thereafter each year.\n6. The rentals received to be used for the benefit of maintenance of the Mohawk Institute.\n7.

H.W. Snell, was present at the Council Meeting, and pointed out that the loss of the particular 6 acres requested by the Company would deprive the Institute of practically all the garden land worked in conjunction with the greenhouses, and make it necessary for the latter to be removed, and that the only suitable place the garden and greenhouses could be relocated was at a considerable distance from the school buildings, creating many disadvantages.\n\nHowever, Mr. Snell said he could manage without the 3.5 acres, so the Council, in order to assist the war effort, informed the Cockshutt Company they would be prepared to lease the designated land under the terms and conditions laid down in the Resolution attached.\n\n-over-\nThe Cockshutt Company advised today that they are prepared to accept the Council's terms and lease the land and a copy of their letter of acceptance is attached.\n\nAs the production of the parts which the Company have to manufacture are of vital importance to the war effort, and all possible speed is necessary, - may this matter be laid before the Director immediately, in order that approval may be obtained to the proposals, so that a lease may be drawn up covering the Council's terms and any necessary additions the Department may consider advisable, and forwarded here for formal approval by the Council and for signature of the Cockshutt Plow Company.\n\nThis office understands that all the Mohawk Institute farm land is under lease to the New England Company, and if this is so the Department will know what action, if any, is necessary to inform them of this proposal.\n\nA map is attached showing the land it is proposed to lease, and it might be advisable to state that no permanent buildings will be erected on it by the Company, but it will be used mostly for yard space and storage.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, June 24, 1942.\n\nI have received your letter of June 19th, your file 1864/43, in which you report the application of the Cockshutt Plow Company for permission to occupy three and one-half acres of land of the property now occupied and used by the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAs your records will indicate, this Mohawk Institute property is held by the Superintendent General under lease from the New England Company and the lease now in effect contains a very specific condition to the effect that no part of this property shall be occupied without the consent of the New England Company. We have, therefore, sent the New England Company requesting such consent and when reply is received you will be further advised, but in the meantime it will not be possible to approve the application of the Cockshutt Plow Company, although we do not anticipate any difficulty or avoidable delay in bringing the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.

Never was it contemplated for one instant that your Company would be negligent and go beyond their just rights in using the land leased.\n\nThe Indian people generally are particularly sensitive over their title to land, as experience over the past two hundred years with the \"white man\" has not been conducive to a belief in the sincerity of our purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLt.-Col.

I have been authorized on behalf of the Board to express to the Council their sincere regret at this unfortunate occurrence, which is only explainable by the urgency and haste that was necessary, at the time, to get the plant into production of essential materials and equipment for the war effort.\n\nI would appreciate your bringing this matter to the attention of the Council at the earliest opportunity and convey to them the earnest desire of the Board to make a generous settlement of this most unfortunate affair in whatever manner might mutually be agreed upon.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a plan showing this encroachment.\n\nLet me once again express through you to the Council our sincere apologies and grave concern in this matter, and trust that the very cordial relationship existing between the Company and the Council will not be disturbed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(signed) J.A.D.

Randle,\nSuperintendent, Six Nations Indian Reserve,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Cockshutt Plow Company Limited\nand Indian Lands. (3.05 Acres)\n\nThe offer to sell to the Cockshutt Plow Company Limited, as set forth in a resolution passed by the Council of the Six Nation Indians at their recent meeting for the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000), a parcel of land consisting of 3.05 acres more or less, has now been considered by the directors of the Company.\n\nAlthough, the Company had felt that the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5000.) was a generous offer for the lands in question, and also more than the lands were really worth, they, nevertheless, desire to arrive at a price which is satisfactory to the Council. Accordingly, I have been authorized on behalf of the Company to accept the proposal made by Chief Miller, and confirmed by resolution of the Council, wherein, the Company agrees to pay the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000) for the said lands now under lease by the Company from the Council of the Six Nation Indians being 3.05 acres more or less, and which lands are more particularly described in a Blue Print made at the time the said lands were leased by the Company.\n\nIn consideration, and upon delivery of a good sufficient Deed conveying the said lands clear of encumbrance, the Company agrees to pay the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000).\n\nWould you, therefore, advise the Council that their offer has been accepted by the Company, and just as soon as the Deeds of the said land have been properly executed, I shall obtain a cheque of payment of same in the above sum.\n\nMay I express through you to the Council, the sincere appreciation of the Directors, Mr. Lee, and the writer for the friendly and courteous treatment accorded in these negotiations.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(signed) J.A.D. Slemin\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nIn 1835 the Indians gave a surrender and in 1859 the Governor General granted lands to the New England Company.\n\nIn 1922, in the Crown vs. New England the Exchequer Court adjudged that the Crown recover possession of Lot 5, Eagles Nest excepting the Mohawk school lot of 9.93 acres and five other parcels patented to different parties. The judgment makes no reference to the Six Nations Indians. It was registered in Brantford Registry Office in 1924 and appears to affect title in the crown as Dominion lands.\n\nFollowing the judgment in 1922, the New England Company gave a lease to the Superintendent General of 10 acres, (the school lot) for 21 years, which lease expired January 1st, 1943.\n\nIn 1942 when Cockshutt proposed to lease three acres at $150.00 per acre per year, it was considered that this was part of the school lot, and a cablegram was sent to the New England Company requesting them to consent to the sublease and reporting that rental of $500.00 would be available for their purposes. The Company consented. Preparing of the lease to Cockshutt was held up apparently until after the renewal of the New England lease.\n\nIn December, 1944 Cockshutt advised that they had built on the three acres, and following negotiations\nbetween the Company and the Band Council the latter resolved in April, 1945 that Cockshutt's offer of $7000.00 be accepted subject to the approval of the Six Nations people. Cockshutt's solicitors now write to Colonel Randle that on delivery of a good and sufficient deed they will pay $7000.00.\n\nOne way of giving title would be to take surrender, but in view of the voting membership of more than 1200, it would be difficult to obtain a favourable vote.\n\nAnother way of conveying title would be by submission to council to authorize sale under the Dominion Lands Act. Such a submission would have to recite sufficient of the history to satisfy the purchase price being paid into the Band's fund.\n\nThough I discussed with Mr. Cory making title by surrender, in view of the difficulty of obtaining a surrender I would now suggest the latter method of giving title.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: Poor Copy]\nOttawa, 22nd May, 1945.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report\u2014\n\nTHAT by judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada in 1922 the hereinafter described lands were declared the property of His Majesty in right of Canada;\n\nTHAT following the said judgment the land has been held by His said Majesty for the benefit of the Six Nations Band of Indians as public lands of the Dominion and not as Indian Reserve lands;\n\nTHAT Cockshutt Moulded Aircraft Limited has occupied a portion, approximately three acres, of the said land and has offered to purchase the said portion for the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000.00);\n\nTHAT as the Six Nations Band of Indians have received all benefits and profits from this land since the aforesaid judgment a resolution from the said Indians was requested and received recommending the proposed sale for the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000.00).\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that he be and is hereby authorized to sell the lands hereinafter described for the sum of Seven Thousand Dollars ($7000.00), and that letters patent granting the said land may be issued under the Public Lands Grants Act, Chapter 114, R.S.C., 1927.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nRespectively submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1948.\n\nLt.-Col.

Following these, the land might be considered as Indians lands rather than part of the Six Nations Reserve, and Letters Patent might be granted to Cockshutt Moulded Aircraft Limited for the 8,08 acres which they wish to purchase.\n\nHowever, the Indians consider the land as part of the Reserve and we would rather not rely on the surrender given 110 years ago.\n\nThe price of $7000.00 is acceptable. However, there does not seem to be any need on the part of the Indians or the Department to rush completion of the deal until it can be put through in the regular manner. The Band Council resolution of April 5th accepted the Cockshutt offer of $7000.00 \"subject to the approval of the Six Nations people\". It might be inadvisable to proceed to issue a grant under the old surrender and judgment if it would give the Indians the impression that we would be usurping...\ntheir authority to give surrenders. The same situation might arise again in connection with other land in the Eagle's Nest tract and it is considered advisable to retain the good will and confidence of the Indians by asking for a surrender of the Band, as the Council considers that necessary.\n\nThe mistake of building on the land was made by Cockshutt and they should be content to wait until a regular surrender can be obtained. In the meantime, they should pay rent at the rate of $457.60 per year from the date of occupation until the purchase can be completed.\n\nCould not a surrender be submitted to the Band at the next election of councillors? If you agree, please advise and the surrender will be drawn and forwarded to you. When will the next meetings for nomination and election be held?\n\nD. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nAttended, with Mr. Cory, to discuss the draft submission with Mr. Jackson. He does not like using the authority of the old surrender of 1835 unless it is necessary. He suggested that a vote on a surrender could be obtained at the next election of Band Councillors. In the meantime the Cockshutt Company should pay rent. The Indians might criticize the use of the old surrender, and it would be better to try to get a new surrender, keeping the old surrender in reserve; it might be necessary to invoke the authority of the old surrender, to make title.\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Surveyor General,\n\nWill you please supply a map showing the area of 43,000 acres surrendered in surrender no. 40, dated 2nd April, 1935, \"Indian Treaties and Surrenders\", vol. 1, pg. 98, and showing also the lands surrendered in surrender no. 50, dated January, 1841, \"Indian Treaties and Surrenders\", vol. 1, pg. 119.\n\nWould you also indicate on the map the location of parcel 4, 11.07 acres shown on plan Tr. 1978, and the adjoining 5,05 acres shown in plan N. 2966.\n\nD.

Brantford, Hamilton, and Simcoe are all near, where many members of the Six Nations reside, but none of these places are as near as Hagersville, Caledonia, or Hartford. So it would appear best to be reasonably certain as to the bounds of the word \"near\".\n\nAll members of the Six Nations living off the Reserve can be said to be \"interested\" in the Reserve, as they have a common interest in their capital funds, apart from land. An Indian may have lived in Brantford ten years or so, and while not registered on any land, may on the death of his parents inherit theirs, and thus have a definite interest in the Reserve.\n\nAny comments the Department care to forward to simplify this wording of sub-section 2, will be appreciated.\n\nLt.-Col.

J. Allen,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D. J. Allan,\n\nPlease see your memorandum of the 29th ultimo immediately hereunder on file 32-0-9, directing my attention to Superintendent Randle's letter of June 27th, in which he asked for assistance in interpreting Section 51, Subsection 2, of the Indian Act, wherein the words 'habitually resides on, or near,' appear.\n\nThe interpretation of the words 'habitually resides on, or near' is, as Superintendent Randle points out, difficult of interpretation. The word 'near' has been held by the courts to mean 'close or at no great distance'. 'Near' is a relative term and its precise meaning depends upon circumstances. In various authorities reference to distances from two to ten to fifteen miles have been held to be 'near'.\n\nAs this word has no precise meaning, and all circumstances must be considered, I would suggest that the word 'near' as used in Section 51, Subsection 2, of the Indian Act, would be any point within a radius of ten or fifteen miles from the outer boundaries of the Indian Reserve in question. Ten or fifteen miles under present day circumstances - that is, car transportation, etc., - would, in my opinion, be considered by the courts as being within the meaning of the said word 'near'. Superintendent Randle might consider the said mileage not 'near', due to certain local conditions. His discretion in the matter, I think, should rule.\n\n(over)\nI trust that the above observations will be of some assistance in Superintendent Randle's difficulty, and I may add that I have made a note of this section so that appropriate wording may be substituted when the new Indian Act is considered.\n\nSolicitor.\nIn the circumstances\n\nIt is suggested that under circumstances of his case every member who qualifies for local membership, who is sufficiently near and sufficiently interested in the cause to be interested in meeting should be permitted to vote, whether or not being made or having nothing to do with the stated organization.

J. Allen,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 32-0-9. Sale of 3.05 acres of Mohawk Farm to Cockshutt Moulded Aircraft Limited.\n\nThis office would advise you that the Public Meeting was held and the vote taken on the above question, on Thursday the 26th instant, after proper notices had been posted for a month in the public buildings throughout the Reserve.\n\nThe attendance at the meeting was disappointingly small, only 26 people voting - 21 in favour of the sale and 5 against.\n\nNaturally at this time of the year everyone, particularly the farmer, is busy, and would find it difficult to get away.\n\nThe Department will appreciate it will be a very serious blow to the prestige of the Six Nations Council if the majority given by those attending is not allowed to stand. Particularly as the Mohawk workers posted notices all over the Reserve asking people not to vote, and their ever increasing activities to influence their people over all matters.\n\nAfter all, everyone qualified to vote had the privilege to do so, and if they failed to use their right that is their own fault, particularly if they were opposed to it. It is commonly said that silence gives consent.\n\nAs is noted from your letter of the 26th of May, the contention is that the Act requires a clear majority assent of the voting members, rather than a clear majority of those attending the meeting.\n\nTo the writer this appears a drastic interpretation of Section 51, as it would be supposed by most people reading that section that it actually means a majority of the male members at the meeting. It would be difficult under any circumstances to ensure the attendance of a majority of the eligible male voters.\n\n--- If such\nIf such a meeting as this had been called suddenly and a snap vote taken, it could be well understood if the protection of the majority vote of all male members be demanded.\n\nBut in this case there was first of all the publicity occasioned by the debate and decision of the Council over the matter - followed by the wider publicity of notices displayed for 30 days prior to the voting in every public building and store available, advising the voter of the time and place where he could assemble and show his approval or disapproval of the contemplated sale of land.\n\nIn the recent Dominion Election, according to the press, less than 50% of the voters exerted their right to vote, and it is doubtful if anyone would suggest that those who did not vote, were against the party elected, for if so, Government could not go on.\n\nPersonally the writer is of the opinion it is far sounder to approve of the sale on the basis of the majority given by the voters who actually were present, as any other way might certainly be considered improper and arbitrary and utterly contrary to the Indian Act - whereas approval of the voting as it was given, is only one way of interpreting Section 51 of the Act.\n\nIt would make the Indian voter aware of his duty in the future so that he would turn out and show definitely one way or other what he really wishes, in the only way possible.\n\nIf the Department finally feel it is impossible to approve of the sale on the basis of the vote taken, it would be appreciated if before any other decision is taken, that the Council be fully informed of the contemplated action so that their viewpoint receives every consideration.\n\nLt.-Col.E.P.Randle,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, August 8, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. W. M. CORY,\nDepartmental Solicitor.\n\nRe: Mohawk Farm, Six Nations Indian Reserve.\n\nIn your memorandum of June 6th to the writer, you advised that this office should proceed in the usual way to attempt to obtain a formal surrender of the 3.05 acres of the Mohawk Farm which it is the wish of the Six Nations Council to sell for $7,000.00 to the Cockshutt Moulded Aircraft, Limited, whose buildings occupy it.\n\nIn accordance with those instructions an attempt was made to obtain the surrender and a special meeting was called for the purpose. Immediately on the posting of the notices certain members of the Band circularized the membership advising them not to attend the meeting, to such good effect that only 24 Band members attended and of that 24, 21 voted in favour of the surrender and 3 against. The surrender was not approved.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of your memorandum of June 6th you suggested that in the event of failure to obtain the surrender further consideration would be given to determine just what action could be taken in the matter. May the matter now be further considered and this office advised as to what the next step is in the process of giving the Company title to the land they have agreed to purchase on terms already approved by the Six Nations Council.\n\nD.

The form of permit recommended in this case is on file 24-109 which was sent to your Branch under cover of my memorandum of the 8th December, 1944.\n\nMr. Jackson, as you will recall when he was discussing this matter on the telephone with you this morning, thinks it would be equitable to charge a rental based on 5% of $7000.00 which was the agreed purchase price, the permit to be from year to year with a provision for immediate cancellation by the Minister.\n\nSolicitor.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: File 32-0-9, Sale of 3.05 acres of Mohawk farm to the Cockshutt Moulded Aircraft Company.\n\nWith reference to this office letter 1428 of the 31st of July, we would appreciate being advised if any decision upon this matter has been reached, as the Company concerned are making enquiries.\n\nLt.-Col. E.P. Randle, Indian Superintendent.\n19th September, 1945.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe - 3.5 acres, Six Nations Indian Reserve.\n\nThe Cookshutt Company inadvertently erected a building on the above land worth approximately $100,000.00. This land is Indian Reserve land within the meaning of Section 2 (j) of the Indian Act which reads as follows -\n\n\"'Reserve' means any tract or tracts of land set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit of or granted to a particular band of Indians, of which the legal title is in the Crown, and which remains so set apart and has not been surrendered to the Crown, and includes all the trees, wood, timber, soil, stone, minerals, metals and other valuables thereon or therein\".\n\nIndian Reserve lands are held in trust for the Indians by the Dominion Government and the Minister of Mines and Resources has, by virtue of the provisions of the Department of Mines and Resources Act, Chapter 33, l, Edward VIII, the control and management of the lands and property of the Indians in Canada.\n\nSection 51 of the Indian Act provides, briefly, that except as in this part otherwise provided, no release or surrender of a reserve or a portion of a reserve held for the use of the Indians........shall be valid or binding unless the release or surrender shall be assented to by a majority of the male members of the band of the full age of twenty-one years, at a meeting, etc.\n\nSection 54 of the said Act provides as follows -\n\n\"All Indian lands which are reserves, or portions of reserves, surrendered, or to be surrendered, to His Majesty, shall be deemed to be held for the same purpose as heretofore; and shall be managed, leased and sold as the Governor in Council directs, subject to the conditions of surrender and the provisions of this Part\".\nIndian lands in this section are defined in the Indian Act as follows -\n\n\"Indian lands\" means any reserve or portion of a reserve which has been surrendered to the Crown.\n\nThe Cockshutt Plow Company have asked for title to the above land which was inadvertently built upon, and all efforts have been made to obtain a surrender of the land in question in accordance with the provisions of Section 51. By reason of the fact that the Indian Band members are not all present on the Reserve it is, therefore, impossible to get a surrender as required by Section 51.\n\nThe Cockshutt Plow Company, upon discovering that the Company's building was built on Reserve lands, offered to purchase from the Indians the land upon which the building stood for the sum of $7,000.00 which is considered a very fair offer and would more than compensate the Indians for the loss of their land, but no sale may be legally made of the land applied for by reason of the fact that a surrender cannot be obtained. The duly elected council of the Indian band have passed a resolution recommending the sale of this land to the Cockshutt Plow Company for the said sum but such resolution cannot be acted upon until the surrender as aforesaid is obtained.\n\nAfter full consideration of the facts and of the present difficulties of obtaining a proper surrender, the officials of the Department of Mines and Resources are willing to place before the Minister for his approval and signature a permit to occupy the land under the provisions of Section 54 aforesaid, the rental to be 6% of the capital sum of $7,000.00, the purchase price offered by the Cockshutt Plow Company. This matter has been discussed with the Minister of Mines and Resources and such permit will issue at an early date.\n\nSolicitor.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Allan,\n\nMr. Slavin, Solicitor for the Cockshutt Plow Company, discussed with Mr. Jackson the problem of his Company's building being on Indian Reserve lands at Brantford. Mr. Jackson has agreed to place before the Minister for his approval and signature a permit to occupy the land under the provisions of Section 34 of the Indian Act, the rental to be 5% of the capital sum of $7,000.00, the purchase price offered by the Cockshutt Plow Company.\n\nMr. Jackson is of the view that the permit should be for one year with a provision for immediate cancellation for non-payment of rentals. At the end of the permit year this matter is to be reviewed and consideration given towards the advisability of placing before Parliament a special act which would authorize the issue of title to the Company for the 32 acres.\n\nWould you, therefore, have prepared such a permit and submit it to Mr. Jackson for his consideration and execution by the Minister. You may also wish to consider the advisability of including in this permit additional conditions preserving the rights of the Indians.\n\nSolicitor.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 4, 1945.\n\nLt. Col. E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ont.\n\nRe: Occupation of 3.05 acres of Indian Reserve land by Cockshutt Plow Co.Ltd.\nYour file 1741/45\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo in connection with the above.\n\nMr. Slavin, of Harley, Sweet & Slavin, Barristers, was in this city on the 19th of September and this matter was discussed. Upon full consideration of the facts and of the present difficulties of obtaining a proper surrender, it has been decided to grant to Cockshutt Plow Company a permit for one year.\n\nIn this connection please see herewith a copy of a memorandum prepared by the Solicitor of the Department dated the 19th of September, a copy of which was given to Mr. Slavin when he was here. Also enclosed is a copy of the Solicitor's memorandum to myself in this connection. It will be noted that the amount of rental is to be 5% of the capital sum of $7,000.00, the purchase price offered by Cockshutt Plow Company. The permit is to be for one year as aforesaid with a provision for immediate cancellation for non-payment of rental. At the end of the permit year this matter should be reviewed and consideration given toward the advisability of placing before Parliament a special bill which, if passed, would authorize the issue of title to the Company for the 3.05 acres.\n\nIt will be noted that the Solicitor has suggested that possibly we should consider the advisability of including additional conditions preserving the rights of\nthe Indians. I would be glad to have your comments with regard to any additional conditions as suggested. Would you also be good enough to let me know at an early date as possible the date upon which Cockshutt Plow Company first occupied this area of the Reserve.\n\nEnclos.\n\nfor D. J. Allen,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Occupation of 3.05 acres of Indian reserve land by the Cockshutt farm.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter 32-0-9 of the 4th instant in connection with the above matter.\n\nThe writer after consideration of the contents of your letter and the memorandums attached, has serious doubts as to the advisability of the contemplated action.\n\nIn the opinion of this office, if the sale as recommended by the Six Nations' Council cannot be legally carried out under the provisions of Section 51 of the Indian Act, through the failure to secure the approval of the majority of the male voting members, the whole question of the sale should be dropped, and the Company permitted to continue their occupation of the land under the leasing terms laid down in the Council resolution of the 17th of June 1942, with the exception of Clause 4, which has been voided by the action of the Company by their building a permanent structure on the land leased. Then prior to the expiration of the lease in 1950 - the matter can be referred back to the Council and the people for re-consideration.\n\nThe Council in recommending the sale by their resolution of the 5th of April last, definitely substitute the sale must receive the approval of their people. The vote was only taken and it has been officially ruled that the results of that vote cannot be accepted as approval of the voting members under the legal interpretation of Section 51 of the Indian Act.\n\nConsequently the Council's right to sell becomes void, and it is certain they would not wish to proceed with the matter if it cannot be carried out legally under the provisions of Section 51.\nTo place a special bill before Parliament to enable\nthe sale to go through, would certainly not meet with the\napproval of the Council, and would undoubtedly raise grave\nconcerns and suspicions among the Indian people.\n\nThe failure to proceed with the sale may of course\ncause some inconvenience to the Cockshutt Company, but this\ntroublesome matter is entirely within their own hands, so\nthey can hardly expect to escape without some a notice.\n\nThis office trusts that on no account will any\narrangement be entered into with the Cockshutt Company, that\nhas not first been referred to the Council for their consider-\nation, and the contents of your letter of the 4th instant will\nbe placed before them at their next regular meeting on the 1st\nof November, as it came too late for their October meeting.\n\nIn regard to your question as to the date upon which\nthe Cockshutt Company first occupied the 2.65 acres, it can be\nassumed they proceeded to make use of the land immediately follow-\ning the passing of the Council resolution on the 17th of June,\n1942, as at that time it was assumed the company would prepare\nand forward at an early date, the leasing agreement under the\nterms set by the Council at that time.\n\nS. R. Kendall,\n\nLt.-Col., Secretary,\nIndian Affairs.\nOctober 29th 1945\nOctober 24, 1945.\n\nMr. Cory, Esq.,\nLegal Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Cory:\n\nRe: 3.5 acres Six Nations Indian Reserve\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of the 19th of September, 1945, I was wondering if the permit referred to therein has as yet been issued. I would also like to be advised if it is in order for the Cookshutt Plow Company Limited to pay the sum of $350.00 being the rent computed at 5% of the capital sum of $7000.00 or should payment be delayed until the permit has been issued. If payment is to be made will you please advise to whom the cheque should be made payable.\n\nOur clients are hopeful that an early solution will be found of the difficulties referred to in the memorandum which will enable them to obtain the title and proper surrender of the land in question.\n\nAnything that can be done to attain this end at an early date will certainly be very much appreciated by the Company. In the meantime may I express to you, on behalf of the Company, sincere appreciation of the courteous treatment and consideration extended in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHARLEY, SWEET AND BLEMIN\n\nJADS:DS\n\nBY [Signature]\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 29, 1945.\n\nLt. Col. E. P. Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brentford, Ont.\n\nRe: Occupation of 3.05 acres of Indian Reserve Land by Cockshutt Plow Company Limited.\nYour file 2144/45\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in reply to my letter of the 4th idem, which advised you that this matter had been given full consideration and it had been decided to grant to Cockshutt Plow Company a permit to occupy this land and you were requested to forward any additional conditions which could be incorporated in this permit that in your opinion would further protect the interest of the Indians. Such recommendations in this connection were not included in your letter just received.\n\nIt is noted that you are of opinion that this land should be leased to Cockshutt Plow Company under the leasing terms laid down in the Council resolution of the 17th June, 1942. This recommendation is not understood, as you are aware that the provisions of the Indian Act preclude any possibility of leasing as suggested without a formal surrender in the same manner as is required in the case of the authority to sell Reserve lands. As undoubtedly a surrender for lease or sale is out of the question in this case, there is no alternative other than to give to the Company a permit, as decided upon, for a short period or periods until this matter can be finally disposed of.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate any suggestions that you might care to make with regard to additional conditions which could be incorporated in this proposed permit, at your earliest convenience, as this matter has been pending for some time.\n\nfor D. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 29, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Slemin:\n\nRe: 3.05 acres Six Nations Indian Reserve\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in connection with the above.\n\nThe permit in question has not yet been issued as it was necessary to communicate with Col. Randle. It is anticipated that the proposed permit will not be further unduly delayed and that you will be hearing from the Department shortly.\n\nWith regard to your request to be advised if it is in order for Cockshutt Plow Company Limited to pay the sum of $350.00, being the rental computed at 5% of the capital sum of $7,000.00, or should payment be delayed until the permit has been issued, I would suggest that it would be advisable to delay payment until the permit issues.\n\nThe date upon which the Cockshutt Company first occupied the 3.05 acres is required so that the permit may be properly dated. Col. Randle is of the view that your occupancy started on or about the 17th June, 1942. I would be glad to be advised if Col.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Occupation of 3.05 acres of Indian Reserve Land by the Cockshutt Plow Company Limited.\n\nThis will acknowledge your 32-0-9 of the 29th of October in connection with the above, and this office fails to understand your observations contained in paragraph two.\n\nAt the present time there are a number of leases in existence effecting land held in the name of the Indian Council, which have been rented on the application signed by the Chief Councillor, after which a formal Government lease between the Crown and the tenant has been issued.\n\nIn none of such cases has a formal surrender been obtained under Section 51, calling for a vote of the male members.\n\nIf it is the Department's contention that under Section 51 Council land can only be leased with the assent of the majority of the male members, this would also be true of the land held by individuals, as Section 51 definitely refers to the latter as well.\n\nActually there are dozens of individual owners' land rented, without a formal surrender as laid down in Section 51.\n\nThis office has always supposed that either the Councils concerned, or an individual could rent land for a period of years upon an application by the parties concerned, and upon approval of the Department and the issuance of a formal lease between the Crown and lessee, and that it was only upon surrender of land for sale, that the assent of the majority of male members had to be obtained.\n\n----- The Department's\nThe Department's attention is directed to your File 32-0-9 of the 24th of June 1942, in reply to this office report on the Council's Resolution of the 17th of June 1942, assenting to leasing the land to the Cockshutt Company. In that letter the Department do not anticipate any difficulty, or mention the necessity of obtaining a formal surrender.\n\nThe essential contents of your letter of the 4th of October were read to the Council at their meeting on the 1st of November, as proposed in my letter of the 25th of October, and they by Resolution No.12 express the opinion that the occupation of the land by the Cockshutt Company should continue under the conditions laid down in 1942 - and though those conditions through no fault of the Council have not been incorporated into an official lease, they have been accepted in principle by the Department and the Company, as the payment and acceptance of annual rental each year since, of $457.50 is proof of.\n\nThe Council cannot see any fairness or justice in permitting the Cockshutt Company to occupy the land at $350.00 per annum, when by their letter of acceptance of the 19th of June 1945 they agreed to lease the land until 1950, under the conditions laid down by the Council Resolution of the 17th of June of that year.\n\nIt is the Cockshutt Company who failed to observe the terms and conditions of that arrangement, and the resentment of the Council and people of the Six Nations will be great if the Department permit them to occupy the land for $350.00 instead of $457.50.\n\nFurther, the Department are reminded that the rentals received from the Company were not to be used to swell Six Nations Funds, but by the generous and kindly consideration of the Council to be handed over to the Department for the benefit of the children of the Mohawk Institute, some of whom come from other Reserves.\n\n------ The writer\nThe writer is still of the opinion that the only satisfactory solution of this matter is contained in the suggestion offered in paragraph two of my letter of the 25th of October; and by past precedent, and with all due respect to the Department it is impossible for me to see this cannot be carried out.\n\nOn the other hand if the Department insist on issuing the Cockshutt Company a permit, against the wishes of the Council, based on a rental of 5% of $7,000.00, there appears little for this office to suggest, as you request, for the further protection of the Indians.\n\nA Company of their standing will undoubtedly pay the rental when due, and it is presumed here that if the land is finally surrendered to them, they will still have to pay in full $7,000.00 - that is the rental or rentals paid from now on would not be considered as payments on the $7,000.00 principal.\n\nThey should also be responsible permanently for the repair or rebuilding of any fences adjoining the Six Nations land used by the Mohawk Institute.\n\nOr, if only the land occupied by the building were finally surrendered, then the balance of the 3.05 acres should be returned to the Indians in its former condition, that is in shape for immediate cultivation.\n\nThis office hopes that whatever is finally decided over this most unfortunate matter, that no permit or leasing arrangement will be entered into, without being submitted first for the Council's consideration.\n\nLt.-Col.

A report to Council has gone forward which, when passed, will authorize the Minister to issue a lease to the Chairman of the Brantford Board of Parks Management.

Since this arrangement, representations were made by Lt. Col. Rendle that Cockshutt Plow Company should pay an amount of $150.00 per acre, which is the amount that this Company has been paying since 1942 for this land.\n\nMr. Cory has discussed this matter with Mr. Slemin in Brantford and with Mr. Stuart Lee, Vice-President of Cockshutt Plow and the Company has agreed to pay at the rate of $150.00 per acre, which amounts to an annual permit fee of $457.50.\n\nUpon reference to the proposed permit it will be noted that this permit is for one year from the 17th day of June, 1945, to the 16th day of June, 1946, and is not assignable.

ALLAN,\nSUPT., RESERVES and TRUSTS,\n\nOn June 17, 1942, the Six Nations Council passed a Resolution which provided that the rentals received from the Cockshutt Plow Company for the 3.05 acres of land which they are using should be used for the benefit of the maintenance of the Mohawk Institute (see Lt.-Col. Randle's letter of June 19, 1942).\n\nAt that time there was an impression that the land being used by the Cockshutt Plow Company was owned by the New England Company and as we had not renewed the lease with that Company it was felt that the money could not be paid to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe portion of land being used by the Cockshutt Plow Company is land owned by the Six Nations Band. The Six Nations band has allowed this land to be used for many years for the purposes of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAt the present time there is an amount of $1,830.00 which has been paid as rent by the Cockshutt Plow Company and which amount should, I feel, be sent to the Principal of the Mohawk Institute, in accordance with the wishes of the Six Nations Council. Owing to present conditions at the Mohawk Institute the Acting Principal, under the guidance of the Indian Superintendent, could spend the amount to good advantage in improving conditions at the school and thereby benefit the children attending the school, the majority of whom come from the Six Nations Reserve.\n\nI would therefore appreciate it if you would issue instructions to have this money sent to Rev. W. J. Zimmerman, Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont.\n\nI discussed the above with Mr. Hoey yesterday and he suggested that I make the recommendation given above to you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 2, 1946.\n\nMr. D.

Randle, Indian Superintendent, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nWe have for acknowledgment your letter of October 28th regarding the Oakeshott Pew Company permit.\n\nThe permit was renewed recently for one year from June 17, 1946. Negotiations were carried on through the office of the Departmental Solicitor and it is for this reason that you have not been previously advised. A copy of the permit is enclosed for your office records.\n\nFor D. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your 32-0-9 (R.l) of the 1st of November last, advising us that the permit to the Cockshutt Plow Company had been renewed for one year from the 17th of June last, for the 3.05 acres, part of the Mohawk Institute farm.\n\nIt is noted that according to the permit the year's rental of $457.50 has been paid, and this office would like confirmation of this, as the Six Nations Council are enquiring about it. Also, as you will remember, the said rental was to be paid to the Principal of the Mohawk Institute, to be used for the general benefit of the Indian children, and he does not appear to have received it.\n\nThis office would also like to point out that in this day and age, we do not consider it fitting for this permit to have been renewed without the Indian Council being advised ahead of time of the intention of the Department to do so - in case the Council had any viewpoint they wished to express.\n\nThe Department's action in this matter only arouses doubt in the minds of the Council and their people, and increases the mistrust that always exists in the Indian mind over their dealings with the powers that be - and it makes it appear at least that the Cockshutt Company receive greater consideration in the matter than those who own the land, and whose particular rights the Department is guardian of.\n\nThe Cockshutt Plow Company's action in this matter cannot be condoned under any consideration, as with any reasonable care or checking, the permanent structure they raised on the property...\nproperty leased from the Six Nations, would never have been built, particularly in view of the fact that, from the very first discussion over the leasing of the ground, it was understood no permanent building should be erected.\n\nFurther, to prove that the Company have little regard for their obligations, you are advised they have recently completed the erection of a further building on the same land.\n\nThe writer contacted their Solicitor over this matter and after some delay received a verbal acknowledgement that this was the case, - with a promise that the matter would be dealt with in a letter to the Council.\n\nTo date, though some time has elapsed, no communication has been received, and so far, in view of this, the Council have not been informed.\n\nIt would appear that this Company, ignoring all decencies or rights in the matter, are determined rightly or wrongly, to acquire that land, - though from the very beginning of negotiations over it, they knew clearly that the Six Nations' Council did not wish to dispose of it, and only reluctantly recommended the sale to their people, after the Company had erected the first permanent building.\n\nYour early reply to this letter would be appreciated, including information as to if the rental has been actually paid direct to the Department.\n\nLt.-Col.E.P.Randle,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1947.\n\nLt.Col.

This will call for an adjustment in favour of the Company of 3\u00bd months' rental, viz. March 1, 1947, to June 16, 1947, paid in advance under the existing permit. This rental will be credited to that payable under the new permit.\n\nBefore this action can be taken it will be necessary for you to forward a letter from the Company requesting such cancellation and the issue of a new permit on the new terms.\n\nfor D.

Unfortunately, because of the peculiarities of Section 51 of the Indian Act the release of the land was not subsequently confirmed by the band.\n\nFrom what I can hear the new Act makes it practically impossible to obtain a confirmatory vote of the band.\n\nIn the circumstances a Special Act seems to be the only solution.\n\nHaving in view the fact that the New Act is not likely to be brought down at this session, but will be introduced at the next session, we plan on deferring any requests for a Special Act until after the New Act is passed.\n\nWith best regards, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCOCKSHUTT PLOW COMPANY LIMITED\n\n(sgd.)

During the above leasehold the New England Company has carried insurance on the building and has paid the premiums. Recently we have been informed by the Treasurer of the Company that it has been decided to allow the fire insurance on the building to lapse. There is no obligation in the lease to insure, consequently if the school should be destroyed by fire during the term the Crown would be liable to replace it.\n\nThe question of the Crown insuring this building, you will recall, was discussed between us on the phone the other day and you advised that in your opinion the Crown should not insure. The Company is being notified to this effect.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nR. B.

School, Brantford, Ont.\n\nEnclosure Officer i/c Criminal Investigation Branch,\n\nper\nThis will acknowledge your file No. 466-1 (E. 1) of the 23rd instant, with regard to the truancy at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn reply you are advised that early Sunday morning, the 23rd of January, it was found that two girls had left the building, all in the teen age group, subsequently it was found they had left their dormitories about 4 A.M. that morning, and by picking a door lock and removing some inside the evening, had made their way into the reserve.\n\nThe principal visited the R.C.M.P. and local police, in charge of the matter, and also telephoned the school committee members in order to have them put the proper pressure on the parents, making sure the students go to bed before midnight so that they may be awake in the morning.\n\nI think it is safe to say as a result of the R.C.M.P. and police efforts, not only the principal and his staff, but the pupils were back except two, one from Canada and one from Ontario.\n\nI am glad to add, of course, principal, contacted the representatives of outside reserves informing them what girls from their respective reserves were missing.\nOn the return of the school, if they were instructed to their duties for the day, and their names not listed under the following:\n\n(1) Avi to school (not late), and a helper (evidently coming by outside influence) that they did not have to obey the order of the principal or his staff.\n\n(2) So many over there in our corner, in an own - like, I'm not sure, to rough.\n\n(3) Home bound.\n\n(4) Wanting for no particular reason - other than one or two other things going.\n\nThe first reason is understandable - as it happens often by everyone - the children dislike for discipline - rules or regulations of any kind, and an inclination to disobey if not kept in check.\n\nThere is some evidence that certain elements on the reserve are anxious in the children in the belief that do not have to obey orders, but to give the time to the \"little kids.\"\n\nMr. Anderson could do something Mr. Anderson has in any way suggested. As powers of punishment, child on, the only question is how much using any form of punishment - whether it looks like force - while not intended to be - Anderson declared he had not done any harm, or hurt anyone.\n\nThere is naturally a lack of some kindness, by none of it to the parent's fault or that of their own could, often he feels, visit them children for we know the time.\n\nThis is a matter the local council, we some attention to - by contacting, in a friendly manner, even if he could and yet cannot visit their children.\nIt rather appears that two or three girls of the \"friendly\" mob group were the ringleaders, who more or less had the bulk of the others on.\n\nThe principal is of the opinion that some, if not all of the summer hall girls often stay late at night. Their parents or relatives allow them unlimited freedom, so they often naturally enough go to the park where there are many young people from the school, and are permitted to roam around or ride there.\n\nAll the summer hall girls were invited on their return, and I have heard that the majority of them would come regularly if they could settle down and get themselves into a fitting manner.\n\nBut it is unfortunate to have to report that ten of the same girls were away again last Saturday, although they are now back.\n\nOne of the members, contrary to my instructions, has let her horse go free, and some of the other girls have been found out. It is a matter of concern to the authorities.\n\nThis is the report on reporting the fact that they are still away, and I am sure that the situation will improve when your attention is called to it. We must do our best to keep them in line.\n\nHowever, the recent outbreak like the letter is a more serious, and it is an intention to follow up the matter when the girls are back for the harvest work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLt.-Col. E. F. Steele, Indian Superintendent.\n9-2-49\n\n1. In the P.M. of this date Col. E.P.

The father is a veteran and has some difficulty controlling his appetite for liquor. I believe the mother tries to get along but at times finds it impossible, so leaves home. The children then lack adequate care. Both parents are agreeable to placing the children in the Institute.\n\nRev.

One of the four Indians mentioned in the earlier report was located by questioning until noon today when the visitor had succeeded in locating Mr. Fred Smith and Mr. John Lee. Both these Indians admitted that they had been in the area over night with two other young girls previously mentioned. They both admitted having slept on the same bed with Louise LeBlanc, knowing that she was a young girl and a truant from the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, Ont. They stated having had intercourse with Louise LeBlanc or with either of the other two girls who had spent the entire month of October at his home.\n\nIt is only mentioned that he had not been willing to do any of the things that were done but admitted having slept on the bed with Louise LeBlanc or another girl on the bed in the house located off a few feet from here.\n\n5. On the basis of the evidence thus far there are no charges to be laid against Mr. Smith or Mr. Lee. It is recommended that each of them be given a warning and that Section 18(1) of the Indian Act be invoked against each of them for their conduct and behavior while residing at the home of Mr. Smith.\n\n6.

[Signature]\nOn the 7th of February last various members of this detachment were out on the Six Nations Reserve endeavouring to locate and apprehend a number of young female truants from the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ontario. Information on hand at this office at that time suggested that six girls had escaped from the Institute on the 5th of February and four more had departed for parts unknown on the 7th of February.\n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that on the night of February 9th three of these female truants had remained overnight in a house on the Six Nations Reserve, occupied by one Leonard Staats. Staats is a single man, aged about twenty-two years. Further enquiries disclosed that three other Indians of this reserve, namely - John Fraser, Mitchell Hill and Emerson Loft, all pals of Leonard Staats had stayed in the Staats' home on the night of the 9th of February and had remained there for the entire night, along with three of the young girl truants.\n\nOn the 11th of February the writer questioned one Minnie George, aged 15 yrs. and a truant from the Mohawk Institute at Brantford, Ont. From the 7th to the 10th of February, this young girl admitted to the writer that she, along with Ramona King and Alfreda Schuyler, also 15 year old truants from the Institute, had stayed all night at the home of Leonard Staats; That they had gone to the Staats' home during the early evening of the 9th of February and had remained there until the afternoon of the 10th when arrested by members of this detachment and returned to the Institute at Brantford, Ontario.\n\nMinnie George stated that she had slept in a bed with Leonard Staats and eventually admitted having had intercourse with him during the night. Further questioning by the writer disclosed that this young girl had first been on the bed with Mitchell Hill but she maintained that she had not had intercourse with Hill. She then stated that at one time during the night she had slept on this bed with Staats and that Hill and Emerson Loft were also asleep on the same bed. This young girl further stated that Ramona King had slept on a cot in the same bedroom and that this girl had slept alone. When questioned as to the whereabouts of the other girl, Alfreda Schuyler, Minnie stated that this girl had slept in the kitchen which adjoins the bedroom and that she had slept on a couch there with John Fraser.\n\n(Continued to page 2.)\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO. 49 D.149 E.3\n\nOTTAWA, 14 March, 1949.\n\nYOUR FILE NO. 105\n\nTo: The Director, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nReport dated Ohsweken, 2-6-49,\nforwarded for your information, re: Leonard STANW, John FRASER,\nMitchell HILL & Emerson LTD., Six Nations I.R.

On the 7th of February, four more young girls left the Institute under similar circumstances. About three weeks prior to this a total of twenty-five young girls left the Institute without permission. Investigation into this matter revealed that a large number of these girls were making their way direct to the home of Hilliard Fraser where they were staying for a few days before leaving for other parts.\n\nOn Feb. 16th, this matter was gone over with the County Crown Attorney, Mr. C. C. Slemin when he instructed that an information be laid, charging Fraser under section 34 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act.\n\nOn the 16th ultimo the writer laid an information against the above named under section 34 of the said Act and he was summoned for trial before Magistrate Gillen at Brantford, Ont. on the 28-2-49.\n\nOn the 28-2-49 Fraser appeared in Brantford Court and entered a plea of \"Not Guilty\" to the charge. He was represented by Counsel, Mr. H. A. Lickers. At the request of the Prosecution, the hearing was adjourned to March 2nd. In the interval, Summons to Witness were obtained for the following persons - Rev. Zimmerman, Principal of the Mohawk Institute - Lois Hess, Alfreda Schuyler, Minnie George and Romana King (All young girls of the Institute and former truants). The writer was successful in serving Rev. Zimmerman and two of the girls with summonses but the other two girls, Alfreda Schuyler and Lois Hess again left the Institute and to date have not been located.\n\nOn this date, March 2nd, Fraser again appeared in Brantford Court when it was necessary for the Prosecution to obtain still another adjournment due to the fact that two of the main Crown witnesses could not be located. The Case was further adjourned to March 9th. Every effort will be put forth to locate and serve these two girls with summonses in time for their attendance at Court in Brantford on the 9th. inst.\n\nA further report in this case will be submitted to comply with the under noted diary date.\n\nSo U.

She agreed to send her youngest daughter, Doris. In a letter dated July 16th, 1948 she informed me of the school's refusal to accept the discharge of Loraine and Marilyn, however I do not believe that the Department can be permitted to allow the above mentioned children to escape their responsibilities.\n\nI am not able to give you any further information regarding the situation. In October, 1948 I wrote to Mrs. Battrelle to explain our position and to request that she return her daughters to the school. We tried to make it clear that we would not tolerate any further attempts to run away, etc. In January, 1949 the situation was still unresolved. The Department has been unable to reach an agreement with the parents regarding the return of the children.\ncharge of all three of this man's children.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited Sarnia Agency about one month ago the matter of truancy of three or four Indian girls from Mohawk Institute was investigated.

I have given this girl temporary permission to attend St. Clair Indian Day School until a Departmental decision has been received regarding her return to Brantford. I do not think it would be advisable to force Marilyn to return to Mohawk School as she would no doubt run away again. I therefore recommend that she be officially discharged.\n\nWhen Marilyn Rogers left Mohawk School two Kettle Point girls, namely Eunice and Helen George, daughters of Simpson George, #301 and Miss Evelyn George, #302, Kettle Point Band, accompanied her.

In due course, please let us have a full report covering this point and at the same time let us have your recommendations as to where the children should be placed and at what cost. It is contemplated that the interest share of the parents and of the children will not now be paid in the usual way but will be deposited in Savings. In the case of the children entering Mohawk Residential School, if such is done, the monies will be retained until they are twenty-one years of age. The share of the parents will be paid out in the normal manner except for her who she is in the hospital.

In July, 1948 this man visited the office and informed me that he did not intend to send Loraine and Marilyn back to residential school in September. He agreed to send his youngest daughter, Dorothy. In a letter dated July 12th, 1948 the Principal of the school, Mr. Zimmerman, agreed to the discharge of Loraine and Marilyn. However I do not believe that the Department has been notified re the above and therefore official discharge has never been obtained.\n\n\"As mentioned above Dorothy Cottrelle was supposed to return to Mohawk Institute in September, 1948. I put considerable pressure on the father to return her at various times throughout the fall. He tried to persuade his girl to go back to Brantford but she refused and would run away, etc. In January, 1949 the father was successful in getting her back to Brantford, but she remained there only one week and ran away. She returned to Sarnia Reserve where she is living at the present time. In my opinion it would be advisable to agree to the discharge of all three of this man's children.\n\n\"When Mr. Doucet visited Sarnia Agency about one\nmonth ago the matter of truancy of three or four Indian girls from Mohawk Institute was investigated. One of the girls is Marilyn Rogers, daughter of #210, William Rogers, Barnia Band. I have given this girl temporary permission to attend St. Clair Indian Day School until a Departmental decision has been received regarding her return to Brantford. I do not think it would be advisable to force Marilyn to return to Mohawk School as she would no doubt run away again. I therefore recommend that she be officially discharged.\n\nWhen Marilyn Rogers left Mohawk School two Kettle Point girls, namely Funica and Helen George, daughters of Simpson George, #301 and Miss Evelyn George, #302, Kettle Point Band, accompanied her. These two girls are running loose on Barnia Reserve at the present time. I see no use in forcing them to return to Brantford but am taking no action on the matter pending instructions which I understood Mr. Doucet was going to send on his return to Ottawa. These girls are about fourteen or fifteen years of age. I recommend that they be officially discharged and allowed to attend Kettle Point Indian Day School if they wish to do so.\n\nAn early reply with regard to the above will be appreciated.\"\n\nI presume that these are the children about whom we talked at Munsey recently and that you do not wish to recommend their dismissal from the Mohawk Institute as recommended by Mr. McCracken.\n\nBernard F.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMohawk Institute - Discharge of Pupils\n\nThis office appreciates your letter 416-10 (E) of the 22nd instant with regard to the above matter.\n\nThe writer hesitates to interfere in the decision of a Superintendent of another Agency, but as Mr. Doucet was informed when here, our policy with regard to the children belonging to the Six Nations Superintendency is that if they play truant by running away they must be found and returned.\n\nOtherwise, we should soon have chaos at the School, as any child with a notion that he or she dislikes the school for some reason or other, could make up their minds to run away, knowing that no action would be taken and it was an easy way to rid themselves of the school and its discipline.\n\nMany parents would also be up in arms over such a lax policy, as it is not unknown for a child to run away to some relative, who is sympathetic and stay there, rather than go home to parents who will send them back to the Institute.\n\nOn the other hand, while hesitating to intervene in the decisions made by another Superintendency, not knowing the local facts as he does, it is a fact that once children arrive at the Mohawk Institute, they become, in a way, my responsibility and under my jurisdiction, for when such outbreaks occur, the Principal phones me and on each occasion it has been necessary to institute energetic action as the Principal is inclined to be lost in a fog.\n\nSo, it is my opinion that all Superintendents sending children to distant schools outside their own Agency, should, unless very special reasons exist, be willing to cooperate and have runaway children immediately returned.\nYou will be glad to know that with regard to the action taken in Court against the young men for contributing to juvenile delinquency of the runaways, that each was convicted and given a $50.00 fine or two months in gaol.\n\nThe case took considerable time, but it is my opinion that both the girl pupils and the young men, learned a mighty good lesson, as they far from enjoyed the stern examination they went through in the witness box from the Crown Attorney and the Principal informs me the girls concerned have been very much subdued since that experience.\n\nThe young men engaged a lawyer and pleaded not guilty, so that the full rotten story was disclosed and they certainly looked shamefaced.\n\nThe case against the married couple who harboured some of the runaways is not yet concluded.\n\nLt.-Col. E. P. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent\n29th March, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant regarding the Mohawk Institute, we have already written to Rev. W.J. Zimmerman, Principal of the school, requesting him to forward us a statement showing the religious affiliations of the children enrolled at the school.\n\nAs soon as we have this information, we will forward it to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Rundle,\nSuperintendent, Indian Affairs,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nTo note the action taken by the court against the young men who contributed to juvenile delinquency in the recent truancy case at the above school. It would be best to consider the girls also among the ring leaders in this truancy case and their case consideration should be given to have them committed for further instruction. The Department can appreciate the work which is done on you as Indian Superintendent and will be grateful for this school when you are faced with a number of truants. We shall the discipline of this school under consideration, so that we may find Indian Superintendent to meet it as a normal institution to be called upon and not to be living true to its charter.\n\nThe Indian parents must also be informed that children cannot be sent to the Indian Residential School and discharged from it to suit their wishes. I have, therefore, asked Mr. Zimmerman to visit Mr. Rundle on an opportune time and to discuss with him the possibility of placing these girls committed to residential institutions or returned to the Mohawk Residential School.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 30th, 1949.\n\nJennie HARBISON, (Indian.) - Mohawk Institute -\nBrantford, Ontario. - Truant.\n\n1. \"With reference to the above, in the A.M. of\nthe 25th instant the above named was located on the\nSix Nations Reserve, Ontario, by Opl.

On the early afternoon of the 9-4-49, Albert OLIVER (Indian), from Barnia Reserve reported that two Indian girls, originally from Kettle Point Indian Reserve, had run away from the Bradford Industrial School and were leading an immoral life in this district.\n\n2. Investigation showed that this was quite true. The girls, Ida GEORGE, age 15 and Helen GEORGE, age 14, came to Barnia Indian Reserve around the beginning of March 1949 and were taken in by Mrs. L. Later these girls began to run away from these homes and stay away for a few days at a time. They were known to spend nights in cabins with any men that would ask them in and tried to get other girls on this reserve to do the same. The parents of other girls on the Reserve began to complain and desired that these girls be sent away from the Reserve.\n\n3. This matter was referred to the Indian Agent who stated that he had informed the Superintendent of the Bradford Industrial School as to the whereabouts of these two girls and directed that they be returned to the Father, Simon GEORGE, at Kettle Point Indian Reserve.\n\n4. On the evening of this date, the writer accompanied by Police Matron, Mrs. Sarah FRUM, located the above mentioned girls and proceeded to Kettle Point Indian Reserve where they were left at the house of Simon GEORGE.

The children have been left in the care of an aged lady for whom the task is too heavy and the children are sometimes left more or less on their own which is a worry on the parents.\n\nThis Office is quite ready to corroborate his statements as Mr. and Mrs. George are an excellent type of Indian and should be encouraged in their worthwhile ambition.\n\nFred Hall,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\nJuly 22, 1949.\n\nMr. Fred Hall,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nRe: Children of William George\nYour File No. 125-9 (7)\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of July 18th, the Department approves the admission of the four children of William George to the Mohawk Residential School.

In most of the cases you showed absence to be caused on account of truancy, but you failed to show the date when the pupils left the residence or returned thereto.\n\nFor checking purposes the Treasury Branch and the Auditors insist that all necessary dates be shown. Therefore, it is requested that this information be provided for this return and all dates be shown on future returns.\n\nFollowing \u00a7 1293 you have shown Winston Seth who is fourteen years of age and was in residence for thirty days. He was also shown on the March quarter for thirty-six days. Would you kindly supply more information on this boy, as we do not appear to have an application for admission for him. He is not shown on the Admission and Discharge form for March.

Her mother states she has been well since that time and apparently she has no symptoms at present. Her appetite and strength are good. She has apparently lost about three pounds in weight.\n\nExamination of the chest was essentially negative.\n\nX-ray report is attached.\n\nDiagnosis: Childhood type tuberculosis, combined, apparently arrested.\n\nConclusion: There appears to be no change in this girl's condition which appears to remain satisfactory. She should probably get some increased rest for the time being, having an hour to an hour and a half rest in the afternoon.\n\nReturn to Clinic: Would recommend further return to the regular clinic in three months' time. It is noted that this girl may be going to school in Brantford next fall. If this is so the Medical Officer of Health in that locality should be notified in order that she may be called to attend clinic there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHB/HB\nQUEEN ALEXANDRA SANATORIUM\n\nName: MILLIKEN, Adrienne\n\nSARNIA GENERAL HOSPITAL film of July 13/49 compared with BECK MEMORIAL SANATORIUM film No.73477b of April 12/49 shows:\n\nNo changes over either lung field.\n\nDR.

There are three children in the family aged ten months, three and five years. Mr. and Mrs. Joseph have never been able to get along together. In the past few years they have had various reconciliations, but none have been permanent. Mrs. Joseph deserts the family quite often and lives with Negroes and Mexicans in Port Huron, Michigan, U.S.A. William Joseph is frequently in jail on intoxication charges. At the present time Mrs. Joseph is in Port Huron and her husband is trying to look after the three children with the aid of his sister-in-law.\n\nIt is obvious that the children are badly neglected and undernourished, etc. After discussing the matter with William Joseph I have decided to recommend that the two oldest children be admitted to Mohawk Residential School. He wishes such action taken, although we both realise that the admittance of the three year old one is exceptional. I have contacted the Principal of the school on the matter and he is quite willing to take the two children if the Department approves. As mentioned above the home conditions are deplorable and in this instance I recommend that an exception be made by admitting the Joseph children to Mohawk Institute. Their names are Shirley, aged five and Eloise, aged three.\nWould you please advise at an early date if it will be in order to send these children to Brantford? The father states that he will pay transportation charges. He also informs me that he can place his youngest child in an Indian home on the Saugeen Reserve if the two eldest are admitted to Mohawk.\n\nM. W.

I took the liberty of phoning the Principal of this school and was advised that he could take all the children, but that he wished to have them not later than the 6th of September.\n\nAs the children were all ready and due to the fact that the Parents and guardians did not have the money to send them at the moment and that it was also felt that separating the children would have been imposing hardship on both the children and the teacher, I arranged with a brother of mine to transport them to Brantford with my light truck, the Indians agreeing to reimburse me and the driver in the near future.\n\nI might add that the children arrived safely and that I received your letter the following day.\n\nI explained this to Mr. Morris on his visit here on the 7th and he concurred with my opinion that the children would be better off all together.\n\nHoping the above receives your approval,\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry Gauthier,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nKenneth Maness, son of Mrs. Gordon (Evelyn) Jacobs, #371, Sarnia Band, was admitted to Mohawk Institute at Brantford in September, 1948. His mother, who was divorced, remarried Gordon Jacobs, an Indian member of Sarnia Band, on July 9th, 1949. She is now able to give her child the proper care in her own home and requests permission to have him discharged from Mohawk Institute.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the Principal of the school and he agreed to the discharge. Kenneth is now attending day school on Sarnia Indian Reserve and I recommend that the Department approve of his permanent release from residential school.\n\nM. W.

Blaker, #167 Alnwick Band, who is 14 years of age was placed in the Mohawk Institute at Brantford under authority of file 32-0-10 dated 23 of January 1946. During 1948 she was admitted to the hospital for sick children, 67 College Street, Toronto and diagnosis was \"investigation re limp\". Accounts were received here for May, June, July, August, September, October, and November, amounting to $1208. Apparently the previous accounts were rendered direct by the Mohawk Institute, as the date of the first account received here was dated May 1, 1948, and she was still in hospital as far as I know on November 30, 1948. Since then no further accounts have been received.\n\nI received a letter from the hospital during October stating that she was being returned to the Mohawk Institute and there were certain directions as to her care and a request to have her report at a further date for re-examination. I forwarded this letter to Rev. W.J. Zimmerman, principal of the Institute. In a letter from Rev. Zimmerman dated November 23rd he states that he does not feel that in Lillian Blaker's present condition that the institute is able to care for her. Dr. Palmer, who has been appointed to care for these children, does not feel that the Institute should accept Lillian as he does not possess the staff to handle patients of this type.\n\nI do not think it possible for her to return home as her mother died several years ago and her father re-married and apparently there is now another family. This family has been the subject of Children's Aid Society investigations from time to time. They are living at Sturgeon Falls from my last information. There are no immediate relations on the Alnwick Reserve, nor do I know of any place she can stay. If she remains at the hospital it will be at a cost of $150.00 a month.\n\nMay I please be advised. I know nothing of the ailment from which the child is suffering or what care she requires.\n\n(sgd) V.M. Eastwood\n\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency\nNovember 30th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR.

This is rather difficult from our files and further complicated by the fact that she appears to have been under the jurisdiction of Mr. Eastwood during 1948 up to November and subsequently her hospital accounts have been certified by Mr. Devlin. We are, therefore, quite confused as to what superintendent is in charge of the group to which Miss Blaker belongs.\n\nIt would appear from our records that Lillian Blaker was discharged from the Sick Children's Hospital on 25 May '49. We do not, therefore, quite understand Mr. Eastwood's reference to a notice from the hospital in October '49 and we are at a loss to know exactly where Miss Lillian Blaker is at the present time.\n\nIf Miss Blaker is now at the Mohawk Institute the most suitable arrangement would be for her to visit Dr. Davis at Chawaken and Dr. Davis from his long experience can assess her disability and recommend the best procedure in her case.\n\nWe regret the delays in dealing with this case but you will see that it is far from clear cut on our files.\n\nP.

(RG 10, Volume 6202, File 466-10, part 6)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Lillian Blaker, daughter of Walter S. Blaker #167 Alhwick Band\n\nOn receipt of your letter file 466-10 (El) dated 29th of December 1949 on the 31st of December, I telephoned Rev. Zimmerman of the Mohawk Institute and wrote the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Not receiving a reply to my letter I wired the Hospital on January 14th and now attach letters received from the Hospital for Sick Children and the Daughters of the Empire Hospital for Convalescent Children at Toronto. These may serve to clear up the records in regard to Miss Blaker. The originals are forwarded; I have retained copies of each.\n\nPart of the confusion as to what band Miss Blaker belonged to possibly originated due to Mr. Samuel Devlin completing final arrangements for Miss Blaker's admission to the Mohawk Institute. Miss Blaker was living with her family at Parry Sound at that time.

If Lillian Blaker's condition has improved to the extent that she will be able to enter the school as a regular student, we might be able to arrange for her accommodation. However, if she requires special attention, I cannot see how the Mohawk Residential School can accept her in view of the full enrollment they have at the present time.\n\nBernard F.

Hospital in Toronto for re-admittance to the Mohawk Institute.\n\nAs according to the medical report she is still a bed patient, except for 2 hours each day, it would not appear the Mohawk Institute is a suitable place for her at the present time for more than one reason.\n\nAlso, with our limited bed accommodation at Lady Willingdon Hospital, it would hardly be fair to the large local Indian population to be served, to take up a bed there, as Miss Blaker is not a member of this Superintendency.\n\nThis office regrets we can offer no solution to keep this unfortunate girl, but we feel it is really up to the Superintendent of her own Reserve.\n\nWould the Shingwauk School, which has not the overcrowded condition of the Mohawk Institute, be a suitable place for this girl?\n\nLt.-Col.

We approve the admission of the following children:\n\nDolores Doxtator\nIrene Riley\nDelbert Riley\nWoodrow Garnet Snake\nGrenville Cyril Snake\n\nIn view of the information which you have supplied regarding the 3 Jamieson children, the Department is not prepared to approve their admission to a residential school at the present time. It is noted that both parents are living, the father is working and the children have a suitable home. Under these circumstances, they should attend the day school on the reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter 466-10 of March 22nd, 1950 approving of the admittance of Herbert, Carol and Ernest Walker, children of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Walker, #319, Sarnia Band, to Mohawk Institute at Brantford.\n\nTwo of these children did not remain at Brantford very long. They ran away twice and as the end of the term was approaching I could not persuade the parents to return them to Brantford. The parents brought the youngest child home for summer vacation and they are now refusing to return any of their children to residential school.\n\nIn view of the truancy of the Walker children and the attitude of their parents, and also the fact that they are attending day school on the Reserve, I recommend that they be permanently discharged from Mohawk Institute.\n\nM.

Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nThese two Rogers boys are entirely out of control, both at home and at Mohawk Institute. I hesitate to recommend their permanent discharge as I know it will be impossible to persuade them to attend day school on the Reserve. I telephoned Mr. Zimmerman, Principal of Mohawk Institute, concerning this and he states that they are a bad influence on the rest of the pupils at the school. He suggests, and I strongly recommend, that Ivan and Emerson Rogers be transferred from Mohawk to Shingwauk Residential School. The boys have heard rumours that they'll be transferred to Shingwauk and apparently threatened to run away from there the same as they have done at Brantford. However, Mr. Zimmerman and I are of the opinion that they should be immediately transferred to Shingwauk Residential School.\n\nThe problem of transportation to Shingwauk will be difficult, but Mr. Zimmerman suggested that possibly I could take the two Rogers boys and the Green boy back as far as Brantford and he might then take them in his car to Shingwauk.\n\nKindly advise by wire if I am authorized to take these children from Sarnia Reserve to Brantford in my car. Mr. Zimmerman also wishes your permission to transfer them to Shingwauk as soon as they arrive back at Brantford.\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nMWM/D\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nSuperintendent, Sarnia Indian Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIvan and Emerson Rogers, aged fourteen and twelve, sons of Mr. and Mrs. William Rogers, #210, Sarnia Band, have run away from Mohawk Institute. They arrived at their parents' home on Sarnia Reserve last Thursday, accompanied by another boy from Tyendinaga Reserve whose surname is Green. This is the second time since September, 1950 that Ivan has been truant. About one month ago he ran away and was escorted back to Brantford by the Provincial Police. Mrs. Rogers reported their arrival to me this morning. She states that the boys told her that they will run away again if they are returned to Brantford and give as the reason the fact that older boys in the school are mistreating them. At the moment the boys do not know that I am aware of their presence on the Sarnia Reserve. I have no guarantee that they will remain at the Rogers home very long, particularly if they discover that I am aware of their presence.\nOttawa, November 13, 1950.\n\nM.M.

When I called at the above firm they strongly advised me to give up the idea of a wheelchair and to bend my efforts to making the boy walk. They very properly argued that crutches would be a far less handicap than a wheelchair.\n\nFinally they offered to keep the boy and to inform me as soon as he was able to move around and should they have been unsuccessful they would register no charges.\n\nAs this seemed a very reasonable offer and the boy was willing to remain in Toronto I left him. Ten days afterwards I received word to fetch the boy home and he has since been able to get around a considerable part of the day on his crutches. He has rapidly improved in his walking and can now go up and down stairs.\n\nIn connection with his education, I find that he is barely beyond the primary stage but we are unable to keep him at school all day as he soon tires of sitting still and begins to complain of headaches. On this account I have had a bench suitably placed in the workshop and he is learning to use tools. This week he has fitted new handles to beat-knives, etc., and judging from the work he has turned out I think I will be able to arrange for him to learn a trade.\n\nThis week we received a cheque from the local Indian Office as payment of his pension. As he is a very deceitful boy and provides tobacco for other boys whenever he has money I have returned this cheque with the request that it be allowed to accumulate for the boy here as he will probably need some funds when he leaves us.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.bac-lac.gc.ca\nOttawa, Oct. 10, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your report on the activities and progress of the work at the Mohawk Institute during the quarter ended September 30th, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this report has been read with interest and we are pleased to note that the general work at the school has progressed satisfactorily. We note that the children returned promptly from their summer holidays and have now settled down to the regular classroom activities and routine work of the school. We are pleased that the improvements which were carried out to the building during the past summer have greatly added to the comfort and convenience of the staff and pupils.\n\nRegarding the account which you submitted, from the Dominion Artificial Limb Co., Toronto, for the equipment supplied by them for Leo Winnie, I have to inform you that this is being forwarded to Lt. Col. C. H. Morgan, Indian Agent at Brantford. He is being requested to have the account attached to proper voucher forms, certified and returned to the Department, when payment will be made. We are pleased to note that, as a result of the equipment supplied by the above firm, this boy's condition has been very greatly improved and that he is bending his efforts to walk. The securing of the equipment for this boy is approved, as well as your action in having his pension money retained for him until he leaves the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Following your reply wire the father arrived and stayed for two days. So much did the boy improve that the Doctor thought a complete recovery would result but for about ten days Reuben has been puzzling everyone as although the mastoid healed well he made no improvement physically. A septic condition was indicated and I asked Dr. Morrison to join in consultation with Drs. Brear and Palmer. After a complete examination it was decided to draw some fluid from Reuben's spine and the tests show him to be subject to the above malady. In this case, there is nothing can be done to result in recovery. I am sending a copy of this letter to Agent McCookin in order that he may inform the father and should any emergency arise pending your instructions I will wire him to arrange for father's presence at bedside.\n\nAs this is the first case of its kind that has occurred during\nmy time at the Mohawk would you be good enough to give me your instructions as to procedure in case of death.\n\nNothing that could have been done for Reuben has been left undone and I am very grateful to the nurses at the hospital who have been extremely kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 31, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 30th instant, I may say the Department regrets to learn of the serious illness of Reuben Fox, a pupil from the Caradoc Agency. I observe you state you are sending a copy of your letter to Mr. McCookin in order that he may inform the boy's father in the matter. In the event of Reuben Fox's death, his remains may be sent to his home, in which case you should communicate immediately with Mr. McCookin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

If the boy dies and action such as arranged for is taken, you may submit a voucher in due course to the Department for payment.\n\nI may add that no unnecessary expense should be incurred in connection with the funeral; and if the father is in a position to bear such expense he should be required to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Until today he has found no cause for anxiety but now he states that there are very definite symptoms of the malady and he advises her speedy removal from the institution.\n\nWe have made enquiries and find that this girl's grandparents are in very poor and needy circumstances, the mother is dead and the father worthless.\n\nMay I please have your instructions regarding the disposal of Gladys. We are continuing to give her every opportunity to be out of doors and finding her light occupation in the garden and flower beds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRogers.\nOttawa, June 18, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, reporting the serious condition of health of pupil No. 0795, Gladys Stans, of the Mohawk Institute. We note the medical officer states that she has very definite symptoms of tuberculosis and advises her removal from the institution.\n\nWe are making enquiry as to what arrangements can be made to have this girl placed in a sanitarium. You will be informed, either by the authorities of the sanitarium or the Department, as to when she can be accepted. Her discharge from your institution is granted and will take effect from the date she leaves the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nP. Rogers, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1926.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nI beg to say it has been reported to the Department that an Indian girl named Gladys Watts, who is a pupil of the Mohawk Institute, recently developed symptoms of tuberculosis, and it has been suggested that she be afforded treatment in a sanitarium. The Department, therefore, is desirous of having her enter the Mountain Sanitarium at Hamilton to receive the attention which her case requires. Kindly state whether she can be received as a patient and if so upon what date she will be admitted, it being understood that the Department will be responsible for payment in the case.\n\nIt is of course desirable to have the child placed in the Sanitarium as soon as possible. Kindly, therefore, let me hear from you without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nSuperintendent,\nMountain Sanitarium,\nHamilton,\nOntario.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1926.\n\nSir:-\n\nReferring to letter to you of the 18th instant I may say that the Department is endeavouring to make arrangements to have Gladys Stants receive treatment for tuberculosis in the Mountain Sanitarium, Hamilton. If arrangements to this end can be made you will be advised without delay. In the meantime the child should remain at the school, but if the doctor considers it necessary she should be isolated from the other pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Calder - Assis-\ntant - Dr. Palmer.\nOttawa, November 6th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to letter to you of the 29th October 1924 in which the Department granted authority to have John Alexander Olley, a pupil of the Mohawk Institute, placed in the hospital, and referring also to an account dated the 6th November, 1924, from the Brantford General Hospital where the boy received treatment, I beg to say the Department is in receipt of an account of $100.00 from Dr. Morrison who apparently performed an operation for hernia. In a case of double hernia the Department allows a fee of $90.00. In other cases of hernia where operation is necessary a fee of $75.00 is allowed. Seemingly a double operation was not performed in this case and, therefore, it would seem that the charge should not exceed $75.00. You should submit a certified voucher to the Department covering the amount payable. The Doctor's account should be attached thereto.\n\nThe Doctor has stated in a report attached to his account that Dr. Palmer, Sr., acted as Anesthetist in this case and that Dr. Palmer, Jr., assisted. If these doctors are entitled to payment for services rendered, the Department should be informed. I may remark that the fee payable for an assistant surgeon at a major operation is $10.00, and the fee for the administration of an anesthetic at a major operation is $10.00.\n\nDr. Morrison has forwarded also an account of\n\nS. Roberts, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBRANTFORD,\nOntario.\n$100.00 for services to J. Montour who was operated upon for Appendicitis. The fee which the Department allowed for an operation of this nature is $75.00. You may submit a certified voucher for that amount to which the Doctor's account should be attached. It is stated that Dr. Palmer assisted at the operation and that Dr. Calder administered the anesthetic.\n\nThe Department is prepared to consider making payment to these doctors when in receipt of certified vouchers on their behalf.\n\nThe accounts above referred to which were submitted by Dr. Morrison are transmitted herewith.\n\nINCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Yesterday, Dr. Alexander, of the Trent Sanitarium kindly examined him and discovered traces of tuberculosis.\n\nThe boy's condition is not by any means grave but the doctor states that he should have three months Preventorium treatment as he is proving very rapidly and is in a weakened condition. At the present time his parents are separated. If this were not the case I would think that three or four months sick leave with instructions for his care would be sufficient to re-establish his health. I understand the parents are at loggerheads but the Local office will have to make a decision regarding the custody of the children.\n\nAs both parents are visiting the boy I will endeavour to arrange for them to get together and try to arrange for the boy's care. I will let you twice of the result of this meeting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Schools Branch MAR 19 1928]\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**Sheet No. 8**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR DRUGS**\n\nAgency: ___________________________ Residential School or Band: ___________________________\n\nNumber of Indians or pupils: ________ (If Indians of the Reserve are treated from the Residential School, the number so served should also be given.)\n\nDate: ___________________________ Date of last Requisition: ___________________________\n\n| ON HAND | Prescription No. | NAME OF PRESCRIPTION | REQUIRED |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Lbs     |                 |                      |          |\n| 3       | 1               | Cough Mixtures, Adults A |          |\n|         |                 | Antitussive Tablet   |          |\n|         |                 | Absorbent Ointment   |          |\n|         |                 |                      |          |\n|         |                 |                      |          |\n|         |                 |                      |          |\n\n| ON HAND | Prescription No. | NAME OF PRESCRIPTION | REQUIRED |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Lbs     |                 |                      |          |\n| 2       |                 | Glauber Salts        |          |\n|         |                 | Tarponine            |          |\n|         |                 | Sulphur              |          |\n|         |                 | Skidoo (Parks and Parks) |          |\n\nApproved: ___________________________\n\nTo be signed by the Dispenser and approved by the Medical Officer or Agent.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR DRUGS**\n\nAgency: Residential School or Band MOHAWK INSTITUTE.\n\nNumber of Indians or pupils: (If Indians of the Reserve are treated from the Residential School, the number so served should also be given.)\n\nDate: Date of last Requisition:\n\n| ON HAND | Prescription No. | NAME OF PRESCRIPTION | REQUIRED |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|\n| Lbs     |                 | Cough Mixtures, Adalia A | Gall      |\n|         |                 | Alkaline Antiseptic Tablet | Lbs       |\n|         |                 |                      |          |\n| ozs     |                 | Camphorated Oil       | gall      |\n|         |                 | Glycerine             |          |\n| lbs     |                 | Mustard               | lbs       |\n|         |                 | Magnesium Sulphate    |          |\n| ozs     |                 | Castor Oil            |          |\n| Nil     |                 | Petroleum             |          |\n|         |                 | Toothache Drops       | ozs       |\n| ozs     |                 | Tincture of Iodine 2\u00bd% | gall      |\n| Nil     |                 | Vermin Powder         | lbs       |\n| lbs     |                 | Absorbent Cotton      |          |\n| pkgs    |                 | Gauze 1 yd.

Rogers, Esq.,\nMohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont.\n\nSend Eva Lickers to Brantford Hospital.\n\nJ.D. WoLean\nChg. Indian Dept.\n25th January 1928.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my wire today relative to Eva Jane Lickers Oq77, a pupil of this school, I have to report that this pupil was admitted to the Brantford General Hospital and I have just had a message that she has recovered from the state of coma in which she had been for several hours prior to her admission.\n\nThis girl has been under treatment and observation for diabetes for eighteen months and yesterday was brought to me apparently suffering from a slight attack of pleurisy. She was immediately given medicine and sent to bed. Last evening she was again treated but this morning she was found to be in an serious condition. The Doctor was summoned and was here immediately; insulin was administered and her removal to hospital arranged.\n\nOwing to the fact that Mrs Rogers is in bed again it was impossible to provide the necessary care and attention that Eva needed, hence my wire for approval for her admission to the local hospital.

She had just been examined by Dr. Davis who gave her a wash for the eye. The nurse has been attending to her regularly, but yesterday the eye had become worse so I took her to Dr. Palmer, who ordered her to be taken immediately to Dr. Brass, a specialist. He found a very bad infection which will need a course of treatment to save the eye. I would like authority, therefore, to continue the treatment.\n\nThere are a number of pupils who have defective eyesight. Some of them are very bad so that the teachers have noticed it. Will you please authorise the securing of glasses for them? I am enclosing list of names.\n\nI would suggest that we should have Dr. Brass come down and test all the children's eyes as is done in the Public Schools.\n\nI have to report, also that we have a few mild cases of Mumps. They have been reported and are being treated according to instructions from Dr. Palmer.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHorace W.

Mr. Snell of the Mohawk Institute who states that he has several urgent cases of both eyes and teeth which he considers can be saved by immediate treatment.\n\nOne girl has an infected eye which is so serious that he has assumed the responsibility himself of having it treated by Dr. Bragg. There are about twelve children in the Institute whose eyes are so defective that\nThe teachers have discovered that they are unable to read the figures on the blackboard and there are also numbers of children who are in danger of losing permanent teeth almost as soon as they appear.\n\nI would therefore ask for authority in such cases to send these children to Dr. Bragg and some qualified dentist or have appointments made for an establishment of permanent clinics.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLt.

I have examined each patient to ascertain what he may need. My charge in private practice is $3.00 for similar examination. Will you please let me know what you think a fair fee would be in this case.\n\nIn mailing the report, should we list each individual's name, or just the number of children examined?\n\nThanking you in anticipation of an early reply, we are,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nThe Brantford Clinic.\n\nHRM/HT.\nJanuary 17th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of January 7th addressed to the Minister of the Interior has been referred to me for reply.\n\nI find it difficult to know just what you refer to by an examination. The Department's fee for an ordinary office call is $2.00, for refraction without mydriatic $4.00, and for refraction with mydriatic $5.00. I do not know how many pupils you have examined, nor how complete your examination was in each case. A cursory look over a large number of children to see whether they had enlarged tonsils or some obvious trouble in the ear or nose would not, I should think, call for a very large fee for each child, but if the children were brought to you suffering from some defect and you made a thorough examination of each one, I should think it might be worth $2.00 each. In a case where the examination led to an operation, it might well be included in the fee for the operation. If you will put down in your account the services you performed for each child, I will try to do justice to you in my recommendations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.R.

I have submitted the statement to Mr. and Mrs. Rogers and they state that the services were rendered and that from time to time accounts were forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nOf course they do not know how they were disposed of finally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace T. Smith\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 20, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing an account from Dr. Bragg for services rendered to the pupils of the Mohawk Institute. I regret that the Department cannot consider payment of accounts for services prior to 1929. All of the items for the period, but one, are small. The mastoid operation for the pupil Beniah Snake was paid for by cheque No. 2853 for $100, dated September 19, 1925. The cheque was sent direct to Dr. Bragg. If he believes he did not receive this cheque, please inform the Department and I will be glad to have it returned to him for examination, showing his endorsement.\n\nWith reference to the services for the year 1929, you may inform Dr. Bragg that he should bill Mrs. Rogers personally for her visits. The treatment for Mary Baptiste was authorized and it will be in order to submit an account, in duplicate, for this service and also for the two office calls for the two Cayuga boys, provided they were sent by the Mohawk Institute. Concerning the mastoid operation for Ralph Stewart, which I believe should read Ralph Smart, the fee allowed by the Department is $100; but the circumstances concerning this operation must be explained for the Department's consideration. You should indicate who sent the boy to Dr. Bragg. After you have seen Dr. Bragg and when your reply is before the Department, consideration to the last items on the account will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B. A.,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n**DOCTORS' MONTHLY ACCOUNT FORM**\n\n**Agency:** Matamawak First Nation Band\n\n**To Dr.:** W.

I may say that it was not the intention that there should be an examination of this kind at the present time. The instruction which was sent you on October 17th had reference rather to send pupils who might be referred to Dr. Miller by recommendation of Dr. Palmer.

Dr. Bragg examined several of the pupils but, as the appointment went to another Doctor, he made no charge for the services he had rendered in this regard. When I was in Ottawa I mentioned to Dr. Stone that I had had the children examined and that those who had bad throats, to the number of about 30, were being sent to Lady Willington Hospital for tonsillectomies and he approved heartily. There were only about ten who were found to be in need of glasses. These have been all attended to and I think all but two or three are included in the accounts already forwarded by Dr. Miller.\n\nI may say that Dr. Moyle has similarly examined the teeth of all the children and several of them have already had their teeth attended to. There are some still who are badly in need of attention. I shall send no more until I have further authority though I hope it will be given as they suffer a good deal when the teeth are not looked after. Am I supposed to have authority from Dr. Palmer for attention to teeth too?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. Smith,\n\nI think there are no receipts now.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 6, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to treatment for eye trouble and dental attention in connection with pupils at the Mohawk Institute. Whenever Dr. Palmer believes that pupils should go to the eye specialist or to the dentist, you may send them to Dr. Miller and to Dr. Moyle, respectively. The accounts which you have forwarded are being paid. If, at any time in emergencies, there is no convenient opportunity for the medical officer to examine a pupil who is in need of immediate attention, you may use your own judgment, of course. The point I wished to make in my letter of the 28th ultimo is that it is not the intention to have specialists examine all pupils in a school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. F.

Landymore, 70 Eagle Ave., Brantford.\n\nDrugs: Arthur W. Smiley, 116 Market St., Brantford. Norman M. Lee, 105 Dalhousie St., Brantford.\n\nEye, Ear, Nose & Throat Specialist: Dr. Gordon Hanna, 58 Brant Ave.\n\nA. S. Williams,\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nSeptember 30th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nAll authorized dental work required for Indians of the Six Nations Reserve should be referred to Dr. Frederick ... Landymore, of Brantford, and those requiring the services of a specialist for diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat should be referred to Dr. Gordon Hanna, Brantford.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt. Col. C.B. Morgan,\nIndian Superintendent,\nSix Nations Reserve,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, October 2, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn future, when the Department authorizes the services of an Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist for pupils of the Mohawk Institute, you should engage Dr. Gordon Hanna, 58 Brant Avenue. In the event of emergency purchase of drugs, you may deal with either A. W. Smiley, 116 Market St., or N. M. Lee, 103 Dalhousie St. Of course, your regular supply of medicines, etc., should be the subject of requisitions to the Department.\n\nI also wish to make a new arrangement for dental services for pupils of the Mohawk Institute. At your convenience, will you please interview Dr. F. W. Landymore, 70 Eagle Ave., and explain the nature of the services required. When there are a number of children who should visit the dentist, the Department expects special rates. In the case of other schools, we allow $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 for each extraction when considerable work is necessary. Of course, we charge only when work is done on pupil to the dentist; we are prepared to pay $1.50 for fillings and 50\u00a2 for extractions. Dental services other than extractions and fillings are not authorized, except in special cases, which should be brought to the Department's attention. In the case of temporary teeth, extractions only are allowed. After you have seen Dr. Landymore, you might report to the Department, indicating if he is willing to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W.

There would also be a saving in money as the pupils could be sent in groups thus securing the lowest price for the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 23, 1930.\n\nRev.

The dental service is needed, but I do not think it will be necessary at this time. The dental work should be done by a dentist who is experienced in this type of work.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the dental service should be continued, but I do not think it will be necessary at this time.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ.W. Landymore\nOttawa, October 30, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to dental services for the pupils of the Mohawk Institute. For your first examination of all pupils, the Department is pleased to allow a nominal fee of $10. If synthetic porcelain filling is required in the case of anterior teeth, $1.50 per filling will be allowed. With reference to root treatment and the filling of roots of permanent teeth, I may say that the Department has never authorized this work to any extent - extraction is generally suggested.

He informs me that a copy of his letter of the 15th instant has been forwarded to you. While it is not the general practice of the Department to allow root treatments or treatments for gum lesions or pyorrhea, the dentist's remarks in this instance have been noted and the Department is prepared to make an exception. You may authorize Dr. Landymore to proceed with the work as recommended. We note that the work previously authorized will cost, approximately, $600., and that the special work which is being authorized at this time will cost, approximately, $100. It is entirely probable that Dr. Landymore will not be able to complete this work in the immediate future and, as our funds are extremely limited this fiscal year end, in fact, are overassigned, I wish to suggest that he undertake the work at his convenience and forward his account, in duplicate, to you for your certificate on or about April 1st, next. Our new Vote will then be available and the account will be promptly paid. I am not corresponding with Dr. Landymore direct as, now that the arrangements are complete for this work, it can be handled entirely through your office.\n\nPlease instruct Dr. Landymore that his account, in duplicate, should show the amount of work done for each pupil - the pupils to be named.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Please advise me when you have been successful in this regard.\n\nThey should be considered discharged from the Mohawk Institute from the date on which they are placed in the sanitarium. If, after treatment in the sanitarium, their condition improves to such an extent that they can return to school, application can then be made for the Department's approval of their readmission.\n\nThe accounts received in favour of the Brantford General Hospital for the chest plates will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRE: Ida Isaacs - No. 961; and Theresa Vanevery - No. 962.\n\nWhen I was at the Mohawk Institute on the 29th ultimo, the Principal, Rev. Mr. Snell, stated that the above two girls had not been well and he was sending them to the clinic to have them examined. Later in the day, Dr. Alexander, Superintendent of the Brant Sanitarium, requested authority to have a chest plate taken of each girl. I authorized these at a cost of $6.00 (regular charge $10.00) and I enclose the accounts, which I have signed.\n\nFollowing examination of the plates, Dr. Alexander reported that these girls were suffering from T.B., their condition being rather serious and a menace to the health of the other pupils in the school. I, therefore, authorized the Principal to make immediate arrangements to have them placed in a sanitarium and he phoned the Superintendent of the Queen Alexandra Sanitarium, London, and it is hoped to have them placed in that institution early this week.\n\nOn File 32-0-10, a letter is being directed to Rev. Mr. Snell approving the placing of the children in the sanitarium mentioned and advising him that they are to be considered discharged from the Mohawk Institute from the date on which they are placed in the sanitarium.\nFebruary 6-31\nReplying to 32-0-10, Feb. 2-31\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear sir:\n\nI have been able to arrange for the admission of\nIla Lagan - No. 0661 and Theresa Manayak - No. 0962 at the\nQueen Alexandra Sanitarium in London on the 19th inst.\nThis is the earliest date I could get any place.

I have therefore discharged them as from that date.\n\nWe have also found one boy definitely affected with T.B. Dr. Alexander recommends that he be placed immediately in a preventorium.\n\nTwo other pupils have been taken to the T.B. clinic but as one of them had been recently vaccinated and the other was suffering from a mild attack of pleurisy a definite diagnosis could not be made at the time, though the physician is suspicious of the presence of the disease.\n\nI shall send them again to the clinic and report immediately if the report should be unfavourable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Smith\nPrincipal.\nFebruary 26th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 20th reporting the admission of Ida Isaac and Teresa Vanover to sanatorium.

The Department will await further report on the cases of the other two pupils whom you have taken to the clinic.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. H.S.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that at least eight pupils of the Mohawk Institute require to have their eyes examined and glasses supplied.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, as advised in official letter dated October 2, 1930, you may have the pupils requiring attention examined by Dr. Gordon Hanna, 56 Brant Avenue, Brantford, and he should also arrange to supply the necessary glasses. It is not intended that an expensive type of glasses be supplied. It is considered that spectacles in strong mountings of cheap material, with flat lenses, would be satisfactory. The fee charged for the examination should also be as low as possible.\n\nThe Doctor should prepare an account, in duplicate, giving the names of the pupils examined, the fees charged in each case and also the cost of the glasses supplied each pupil. This account you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W.

P. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Dental Examination of pupils at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nOn April 15th and 22nd, dental examination was made of all pupils of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nOut of 134 pupils examined, 37 required dental treatment.\n\nDental restoration for those 37 pupils as follows:\n\nAmalgam fillings - 26\nAmalgam fillings with root treatment - 5\nExtractions - 6\n\n42 percent of the work found necessary was among new pupils, 28 percent among pupils who were found O.K. on my first examination last October, the balance of the work was made up of simple pit or fissure cavities that had since developed.\n\nThe five defective teeth requiring special root treatment were among the new pupils.\n\nThere were no gum lesions, or unusual conditions found. Those pupils that received any treatment last fall, showed improvement in their general mouth condition, especially among the older pupils.\n\nSince my second examination in April, all necessary work has been completed.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nDr. Gordon M. Hanna\nBRANTFORD, ONTARIO\n\nJune 6, 1931\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nBy authorization of your department and at the request of Mr. Smith, I have recently examined thirty-three children of the local school in this town.\n\nI am pleased to report that they are examined free from defective vision.\n\nThe expense incurred in connection with this case would be your burden.\n\nAs a token of my appreciation, may I request the grant of an additional reimbursement for each examination?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.M.H.\nOttawa, June 11, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Dr. Gordon M. Hanna, Brantford, in which he states that he recently examined 13 children, pupils of the Mohawk Institute, and requested to be informed as to the fee allowed for such examination. Dr. Hanna is being informed that the fee usually allowed in the case of each child examined because of defective vision is not in excess of the sum of $5, and that he is to forward his account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the examination and, if any glasses were supplied by him, the cost of the glasses in each case. You should then certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nIn connection with the examination for defective vision of any pupils in future, I have to request that, before any work of this nature is performed, you will first refer the matter to the Department and receive the necessary authority. You will be informed at that time of the name of the optician whose services you should employ.\n\nThe account of Dr. Landmore covering the cost of dental services recently performed by him has been received, and will be paid in due course. It is noted from the Dentist's letter accompanying the account that all necessary dental work has been completed. I may say that our funds for the present fiscal year are limited and no further dental or optical work should be carried out until the authority of the Department is first received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, June 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, informing the Department that you recently examined 13 children, pupils of the Mohawk Institute, and requesting to be informed as to the fee allowed for such examinations.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the fee usually allowed in the case of each child examined because of defective vision is not in excess of the sum of $5.

Mr. Smith and Miss Margaret Snell assisted.\n\nSummary of the examination follows:\n\nPupils examined 143.\nrequiring treatment 47.\n\nWork required:\nAmalgam fillings 71.\nPorcelain 13.\nExtractions 38.\n\nThe general mouth condition of the pupils is very bad, particularly among the girls. The children have each been given a toothbrush, their interest and cooperation, Mr. Smith, Nurse Mrs. Smith and Miss Snell in charge. The chair-side instruction the pupils have received in the care of the teeth and gums, is largely responsible for the interest and marked improvement that has taken place.\n\nThe approximate fee for work outlined, including examination - $100.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M. Sanderson\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDr. Landymore has completed the examination of the teeth of the pupils and I am enclosing his report and hope that I may receive authorisation for the carrying out of the treatment necessary at an early date, so that the work may be completed before school closes. You will note that the amount of treatment required is decreasing with the regular attention being given and the children are also taking better care of their teeth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 7, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the last instant, enclosing a report from Dr. Landymore regarding the pupils of the Mohawk Institute who require dental attention.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange with Dr. Landymore to carry out the work required as mentioned in his report, viz., 71 amalgam fillings, 13 porcelain fillings and 35 extractions. The fees allowed will be at the rate of $1 per amalgam filling, $1.50 per porcelain filling and 25 cents for each extraction. In the case of temporary teeth, extractions only are allowed.\n\nThe Dentist should prepare an account, in triplicate, giving the name of each pupil treated and the work done in each case. This account should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment. The total expenditure for dental services at this time should not exceed approximately $100.\n\nYou should arrange to have the dental work completed before the summer holidays begin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, June 10, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nThe report of Dr. J. J. Wall, trachoma specialist engaged by the Department, shows that Gladys Curley, No. 0940, of the Mohawk Institute, is the only one at the school that is suffering from active trachoma. It is highly desirable that this school be kept free from this disease, and the Department wishes to arrange for her discharge. The Director of Medical Services states that she may be placed temporarily in the Lady Willington hospital. Will you explain to the Reverend Mr. Snell and take this action, not later than the end of the school year. Dr. Stone is corresponding direct with Dr. Davis in the matter.\n\nThis pupil was the subject of your 102/27/1800, of October 25, 1927. It appears that her parents were Benjamin and Rachel Curley, who, at that time, had not been living together for several years. Della Curley, pupil No. 0939, a year or two older, is a sister. In 1927, the children were living with their grandmother, Mrs. Nancy Curley, who was then a housekeeper for a white man by the name of Robinson, who lived on the borders of the reserve. I find that in July last an 11-year-old brother of these girls, Alvan, was admitted to the Mohawk Institute and is now pupil No. 960. He was taken from the Onida Reserve. He had been living with David Williams for 4 years, having been left there and deserted by the mother. The application for Alvan was forwarded from your office some time in the latter part of July, last. I think you will find on your files a letter to David Williams, of Munsey, in the matter.\n\nThe Department wishes you to give some thought regarding where this girl could be placed upon discharge from hospital. You might report in due course in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell F. Parrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLt. Col. G. K.

She was playing at the Maypole and the girls stood up on her in some way and she had her leg broken.\n\nThe break is in the femur about three inches above the knee and is riding. An X-Ray was necessary and the physician reports that she will have to be kept at the Hospital for some time. As soon as she can be moved we shall bring her back here or transfer her to the Lady Willington Hospital as may be recommended by the doctor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nJuly 15, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following pupils have been successfully vaccinated by Dr. R.

The supplies are intended for the use of Indians at the Mohawk Institute in the Six Nations Agency, and should be addressed as follows:\n\nRev. H. W. Snell,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nPayment will be made by this Department on receipt of account in quadruplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nDirector of Medical Stores,\nDepartment of Pensions & National Health,\nOttawa.\nNov. 4th 1932.\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Dental Service for pupils of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe semi-annual Dental examination of all pupils was completed in three half-days, with the assistance of nurse, Mrs. Smith.\n\nSummary:\n\nNumber of pupils examined . . . 150.\nNumber requiring Dental treatment . . . 66.\n\nFollowing Dental Work necessary:\n\nAmalgam fillings . . . 236.\nPorcelain . . . 14.\nExtractions . . . 71.\nAmalgam filling and root treatment . . . 52.\nPorcelain . . . 3.\n\nOne pupil with pyorrhea will need two or three gum treatments.\nThree pupils with gingivitis will need each one gum treatment.\n\nRemarks:\n\nOf the 66 pupils needing dental work, 25 are new pupils.\nThe remaining 41 pupils show one, two or three small or \"lesser\" cavities, which have developed during the year.\nAbout 65% of the work outlined above is among the new pupils.\nAll teeth examined showing root involvement, also the four cases of gum trouble are among the new pupils.\nThe examination, just completed, shows a marked contrast in the mouth condition of the old and new pupils. The 125 pupils that have received Dental attention, and instruction in the care of the mouth and teeth, show, generally, a splendid result of this service. Much credit is due to the nurse, Mrs. Smith, and the teachers for their efforts in the follow-up work of instruction in the daily care of mouth hygiene.\n\nThe contrast between the old and new pupils is more noticeable this year, than on former examinations, and is due to the fact that the new pupils this fall are of a more advanced age, and show, clearly, the results of mouth neglect and the ravages of dental decay. Only one girl examined showed no dental defects. Ten of the 25 new pupils show an exceptionally bad mouth condition. These ten need immediate attention, and are a menace to the health of the other pupils. Their mouth conditions are in such a state, that it is impossible for them to prevent spreading infection in the classroom and dormitory. One boy in particular, Oswald Henry, age 15, shows 7 permanent teeth in a more or less putrescent root condition. Unless this boy receives immediate and careful dental treatment, he will be in line for artificial dentures.\n\nThe approximate fee for the work outlined, including examination, would cost $400.00.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. W. Landymore, D.D.S.\nBrantford, Ontario,\nNovember 5, 1932\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing the report from Dr. Landymore, the school dentist, re semi dental clinic for pupils of the Institute.\n\nYou will observe that so far as the new pupils are concerned, these 23, some of whom have teeth in very bad condition, are responsible for two thirds of the work required to be done. As for the pupils who have been here, the examination shows very satisfactory conditions and a vast improvement.\n\nI should like to mention that Dr. Landymore takes a special interest in our pupils and recently he arranged for the showing of a very interesting and helpful film to the children, along with an address from Dr. Wilson who is visiting most of the city schools in Ontario on this health campaign.\n\nAs some of the pupils have conditions which need immediate attention if the teeth are to be saved, I trust that I may receive authorization to proceed with the work at the earliest date possible.\n\nHad we not had a number of new pupils this year the amount required would have been considerably below that of former years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 16, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing the report of Dr. Landymore regarding the pupils of the Mohawk Institute who require dental attention. It is noted that the greater number of pupils in need of dental attention are the new pupils who entered the school since the beginning of the present school year.\n\nOur funds this year for dental work are extremely limited, and the total amount that can be authorized for this purpose at the present time is $200. You may arrange with Dr. Landymore to carry out the more urgent work, giving special attention to the new pupils. The fees allowed would be at the rate of $1 per amalgam filling; $1.50 per porcelain filling and 25 cents for each extraction. In the case of first teeth, no dental attention with the exception of extraction can be allowed. You may arrange with Dr. Landymore to have the dental work carried out when convenient to the Dentist and yourself.\n\nThe Dentist should prepare an account, in triplicate, giving the name of each pupil treated and the work done in each case. This account should be certified by you and forwarded to the Department for payment. As stated above, the dental work carried out at the present time must not exceed the above stated amount, as any expenditure in excess cannot be paid.\n\nI might point out that the sum of $60 was paid for dental work performed by Dr. Landymore for the pupils of your school during the period - April to August last, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Smith,\nPrincipal.\nMay 6th., 1935.\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Dental Service for pupils of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nThe semi-annual Dental examination of all pupils was made during April, and the results found summarized as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Count |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Pupils examined                      | 151   |\n| Number requiring dental attention    | 81    |\n| Extent of work needed:               |       |\n| Amalgam fillings                     | 195   |\n| Porcelain                            | 18    |\n| Extractions                          | 58    |\n| Amalgam filling with root treatment  | 10    |\n| Porcelain                            | 5     |\n\nWith a few exceptions, the general mouth conditions of the pupils are very good. During the six-month period just past, the children were given an object lesson, by means of a motion picture entertainment, in the care of the teeth, showing them the necessity of daily care, by brushing and cleaning, etc.,\n\nOwing to the Department being able to authorize only 50% of the work mentioned in my report last November, the dental work during the October-March period was spread over, so as to reach as many pupils as possible, only the more advanced caries being treated.\n\nThe work outlined above, includes treatment for five new pupils, as well as the 50% carry-over from last six-month period. Approximate estimate of cost of work, including fee for examination \u2014 $275.\n\nCopy of this report to Rev. Mr. Snell.\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. W. Landymore, D.D.S.\nOttawa, May 12, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Dr. F. W. Landymore on his semi-annual dental examination of the pupils of the Mohawk Institute. He states that eighty-one pupils require attention, consisting of one hundred and ninety-three fillings and thirty-six extractions.\n\nOur funds this year for dental work have been considerably reduced, and the total amount that can be authorized for this purpose at this school at the present time is $125.00. You may arrange with Dr. Landymore to carry out the more urgent work. Extractions and fillings only are to be performed. The fees allowed will be at the rate of $1 per amalgam filling; $1.50 per porcelain filling, and 25 cents for each extraction. In the case of first teeth, no dental attention with the exception of extraction can be allowed. Dr. Landymore is to carry out this work when convenient to him and yourself.\n\nThe Dentist should prepare an account, in triplicate, giving the name of each pupil treated and the work done in each case. This account should be certified by you and forwarded for payment. As stated above, the dental work carried out at the present time must not exceed the above stated amount, as any expenditure in excess cannot be paid.\n\nIn the carrying out of the dental services, new pupils are to receive the preference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. W. Landymore, Esq., D.D.S.,\n70 Leslie Ave.,\nBrantford, Ont.\nOttawa, May 15, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the report which you submitted regarding your semi-annual dental examination of the pupils of the Mohawk Institute, I have to say in this connection that you were forwarded, in error, a communication dated the 12th instant which should have been addressed to Rev. H. W. Snell, Principal of the Mohawk Institute, stating the funds that are available for dental services at the present time. I would request that you hand this letter to Rev. Mr. Snell.\n\nI may add that the Department will be pleased if you will carry out the more urgent dental work required at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. W. Langmore, Esq., D.D.S.,\n70 Eagle Ave.,\nBrantford, Ont.\nJuly 25th '36.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Dental Services - Mohawk Inst.\n\nThe work authorized by your department, following my report of examination of May 6th., is now completed.\n\nThe 81 pupils reported requiring dental treatment, have all been re-examined at my office, and the more advanced cases have been taken care of. This procedure is the same as followed in the previous six-month period. Besides giving preference to the new pupils, this method reaches as many pupils as possible, and prevents excessive use of treatments in permanent teeth.\n\nThe statement of work and fees is herewith enclosed.\n\nCopy of this letter to Rev. Mr. Snell.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. W. Landymore, D.D.S.\n70 Eagle Avenue\nBrantford\nJuly 27-33.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing account of Dr. F. W. Landymore for dental services authorized in your letter No. 32-0-13, May 12-33.\n\nThe account is for $124.50 and covers the urgent work. There are several pupils who need attention but this is all that could be done with the amount of money available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nprincipal.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR DRUGS**\n\nAgency: ____________________________ Band or School: ____________________________\n\nNumber of Indians or Pupils: ____________________________ (If Indians of the Reserve are treated from the Residential School, the number so served should also be given: ____________________________)\n\nDate: _______ Date of last requisition: _______\n\n| Amount to be ordered | Description | Quantity |\n|----------------------|-------------|----------|\n|                      | Absorbent Cotton 1 oz cartons | 1440.00 |\n|                      | Absorbent Cotton | 1 lb roll | 1 |\n|                      | Adhesive Plaster 2 in spools | 17.00 | 1 |\n|                      | Bandages 3\" | 3.00 | 3 |\n|                      | Bandages 3\" | 3.00 | 3 |\n|                      | Hot Water Bottles | 3.00 | 3 |\n|                      | Oiled Silk | 3.00 | 3 |\n|                      | Thermometers clinical 1 min | 3.00 | 3 |\n|                      | Hypo Syringes | 2.00 | 2 |\n|                      | Hypo Needles | 8.00 | 8 |\n|                      | Auroscope | 1.00 | 1 |\n\n**APPROVAL**\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n| Amount on hand | Prescriber No. | Name of Prescription | DO NOT WRITE IN THE SPACE BELOW | Amount required |\n|---------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| 4             |                | Gold Tablet          |                                 | 1000           |\n| 5             |                | Cod Liver Oil        |                                 | 5              |\n| 13            |                | Milk of Magnesia     |                                 | 1              |\n| 19            |                | Aspirin Tablets grs.5|                                 | 2000           |\n| 19            |                | Aspirin Tablet Compound |                             | 2000           |\n| 650           |                | Aspirin Tablet with Codeine |                           | 100            |\n| 78            |                | Incontinence         |                                 | 400            |\n| 33            |                | Worm remedy          |                                 | 100            |\n| 43            |                | Ammoniated Mercury Ointment |                               | 1lb 4           |\n| 44            |                | Gall and Opium Ointment |                              | 1lb 1           |\n| 47            |                | Rx Colourless Iodine Ointment |                             | 1lb 1           |\n| 39            |                | Sulphur Ointment With Iotanium Carb |                        | 1lb 5           |\n| 40            |                | Corbolized Vaseline   |                                 | 1lb 4           |\n| 41            |                | Zinc Oxide Ointment   |                                 | 100            |\n| 3             |                | Rx Dovers Powder grs. v |                                | 100            |\n| 20            |                | Magnesium Sulphate    |                                 | 1lb 20          |\n| 10            |                | Mustard              |                                 | 1lb 10          |\n| 2             |                | Camphorated Oil      |                                 | 2gal 2          |\n| 1             |                | Glycerine            |                                 | 1lb 1/4         |\n| 1             |                | Hydrogen Peroxide    |                                 | 1lb 1           |\n| 1             |                | Tincture of Iodine   |                                 | 1gal 1          |\n| 3             |                | Silver Nitrate       |                                 | 1fl.oz 3        |\n| 1             |                | Rubbing Alcohol      |                                 | 1               |\n| 1             |                | Luminal grs. 1       |                                 | 200            |\n| 1             |                | Eye Drops            |                                 | 1               |\n\n**Shipping Directions at the End of Requisition**\n\n**Dispenser:**  \n**Medical Attendant:**  \n**Indian Agent:**  \n\n---\n\n*Note:* The requisition form indicates that 150 Indians or pupils are treated from the residential school, and the number served should also be given.

This favourable comparison is due largely on account of the younger average age of these 36 new pupils.\n\nFollowing the inspection made in April, this year, the work needed amounted to $275. Of this amount $125. was authorized and completed, leaving a balance of unfinished work of $150. This was further reduced by $27. by pupils who left school during the summer.\n\nThe total cost of the work outlined above, including fee for inspection is $370. This amount is made up of $125. carry-over from last April, $158 for the 36 new pupils, and $79 for work among the older pupils which has developed during the past six months.\n\nCopy of this report to Rev. Mr. Snell, all of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. W. Landymore, D.D.S.\nOttawa, November 3, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Dr. F. W. Landymore on his semi-annual dental examination of the pupils of the Mohawk Institute. He states that, after examining 143 pupils, he finds 71 require dental treatment.\n\nOur funds for dental services this year are extremely limited, and, as it was necessary to assign the amount available among the various residential schools, the total amount that can be allowed for this purpose for the pupils of the Mohawk Institute at the present time is $200.\n\nYou may arrange with Dr. Landymore to carry out the more urgent work only. Extractions and fillings only are to be performed. The fees allowed will be at the same rate as previously paid him for this service, viz.: $1.00 per amalgam filling; $1.50 per porcelain filling; and 25\u00a2 for each extraction. In the case of first teeth, no dental attention with the exception of extraction can be allowed.\n\nDr. Landymore should prepare an account, in triplicate, giving the name of each pupil treated and the work done in each case. This account should be certified by you and forwarded for payment.\n\nThe dental work should be carried out when convenient to Dr. Landymore and yourself. It is to be distinctly understood that the cost of the dental attention at this time must not exceed the above stated amount, as any expenditure in excess cannot be paid. In performing this service, new pupils are to receive the preference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.

This amount is made up of a carry-over of $170.00 from the previous period, $35.00 for work among the six new pupils, and $30.00 for work developed among the other pupils during the six months.\n\nCopy of this report to Rev. Mr. Snell.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\n30-0-34\nOttawa, May 5, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Dr. F. W. Landymore with reference to the dental work required at the Mohawk Institute. Dr. Landymore estimates the cost of the work at $245.\n\nIn reviewing our files it is found that $574 was expended for dental work at the Mohawk Institute in the calendar year 1931; $300 in the year 1932 and $324.50 in 1933. These amounts are much larger than at any other Indian residential school in Canada. Under these circumstances, the Department finds it necessary to curtail expenditure in connection with dental services.\n\nAt practically all other Indian residential schools a dentist is engaged by the day. It is found that, for a school of the same size as the Mohawk Institute, two days' work a year is sufficient to keep the pupils' teeth in good condition.\n\nThe Department is prepared to allow Dr. Landymore $30 a day for two days' work. A day's work is estimated at seven hours, during which the dentist is expected to apply himself diligently. He must furnish his own materials, but is not required to provide gold fillings or any artificial teeth at this rate. Presumably, composition fillings are sufficiently good and no artificial teeth will be required. He must use anaesthetics sufficiently to avoid unnecessary pain. You are expected to assist by organizing the clinic and seeing that the dentist is kept supplied with patients.\n\nYou may inform Dr. Landymore regarding the above instructions from the Department, and it is hoped that you can arrange with him to carry out the work along the lines suggested above. If Dr. Landymore is not prepared to do this, you should at once advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Dental Services Mohawk Institute.\n\nRev. Mr. Snell has advised me of the proposed suggestions for the curtailment of dental services.\n\nWhile the installation of a dental clinic at the school has some advantage over our present arrangement, it will not, in view of the amount of work needed to \"put the pupils teeth in good condition\", accomplish that which the department desires viz., economy and less outlay.\n\nThe examination of the pupils during last month showed 77 requiring dental attention in varying amounts. The preparation of a cavity for amalgam and insertion of filling will average twenty minutes, or three per hour. This is averaging simple and compound cavities. The amalgam work alone among these 77 pupils would take approximately six days to complete it, working seven hours per day. Porcelain work averages a longer time, and there would still be extractions and the odd root treatment, therefore, if the department really want to put the teeth of these children in \"good condition\" it would be impossible to do so in two days work.\n\nIt has been the practice under our present arrangement to give the children proper attention with the minimum expense. There is no other board or department paying less for dental service. The Workmen's Compensation Board allow from $1.00 to $4.00 for an amalgam filling, and $1.00 for extractions. The Board of the College of Dental Surgeons in submitting the schedule of fees for the Workmen's Compensation Board advised the profession that these fees were considered to be only two-thirds of an average fee set by an average dentist in regular practice. The Ontario Government in administering dental relief allow $1.00 for extraction of the first tooth, and 50 cents for each subsequent tooth. Your department is paying 25 cents per tooth. I have merely mentioned the foregoing schedules to show that the department also is receiving dental services at the lowest possible outlay.\n\nTo lessen the cost, your department has suggested the use of composition for fillings. The cost of a filling is due to the time taken in preparing the cavity. The same preparation holds for either amalgam or composition. The cost to the dentist of either of these materials is...\nF. W. LANDYMORE, D.D.S.\n70 EAGLE AVENUE\nBRANTFORD\n\nthe same, and because composition is not considered a permanent material,\nits use is confined to regular practice to some cases for the temporary\nteeth. The preparation of a cavity for an Indian is exactly the same as\nfor any one else, therefore, I cannot see how the expertise in this regard\ncan be lowered.\n\nWhen I took up this work for the Mohawk Institute, my first\nexamination revealed the mouth conditions of these children \u2014 in a most\ndeplorable state, and since that time there has been a gradual improvement\nwith a decrease in the volume of work required. My last examination\nmade last month, showed only $65 in cost of services needed, which\nincluded four new pupils. The balance of $170, was work which had\naccumulated over the past two years, and $10, for examination, making a\ntotal of $245.00.\n\nIf your department would, at this time, make a special concession\nto this school, and permit me to clean up this outstanding work, and\nfurther, authorize the regular examination next October, in order to\ninclude any new pupils entering the school during the coming summer,\nI believe it will be possible to continue the work, thoroughly and\ncompletely under our present system at approximately the same outlay that\na two-day clinic at the school would incur.\n\nHowever, if your department are still desirous of installing a\nclinic in the school at this time, I shall be glad to continue to give of\nmy time and talents to the best of my ability. I presume the department\nwould arrange for the purchase of the necessary equipment, chair, engine\netc., and would suggest that the more modern the equipment, the more\nefficiently the work can be carried on.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy of this letter to Rev. Mr. Scott.\nMay 25th, 1934\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a letter from Doctor F. W. Landymore on the subject of the proposed dental work for the pupils of your school. Doctor Landymore goes to a good deal of length in describing the work he has done in the last three years and what is now required, but he does not convince the Department that an outlay of \u00a31200 in three years is reasonable expenditure for dental attention to 150 pupils.\n\nAs an example I may quote an Agency where there are about an equal number of pupils all in day school. About ten days dental work has been done for these children during three years and their teeth are in such good order as to lead the dentist to invite comparison with white children under provincial care. If two days is not sufficient during the present year, the Department is prepared to allow three, but Doctor Landymore must find his own equipment and materials. Much of the letter which he writes has no reference to the matter under discussion as the Department is not concerned with any arrangement made by the Workmen's Compensation Board, or any other organization. It has arrangements similar to those proposed in this case with many dentists who appreciate the work and take pride in it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nT. R. L. MacInnis\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nActing Secretary\nJune 11-34\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have taken up the matter of Dental further with Dr. Landymore and he is willing to undertake the work on a time basis as you suggested. Owing to the expense involved he will be unable to install equipment at the school for the work but will do it at his office giving three full days as convenient.\n\nIt is only fair to point out in connection with the comparison with dental full day schools on a Reserve that there would be very few new pupils as compared with the Institute and that the greater part of the work required each year is for new pupils admitted in the Autumn. It would be much less, once the teeth were put in good condition, if we had practically the same pupils year after year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nJune 15th, 1934\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 11th, and observe that Doctor Landymore is willing to undertake the dental work for the pupils of Mohawk Institute on the basis supplied by the Department. I think you will find this to be quite satisfactory, particularly if you are able to detail some member of your staff to act as assistant in the clinic room and another to attend to the children after they have received treatment. In referring to work done in certain day schools an Agency was mentioned which has a greater number of pupils attending the school given this service than there are pupils in the Mohawk Institute. Another point of similarity is that each year there are new cases coming up for attention, not only among the younger children, but among older children whose parents have just returned to the Reserve. It was not possible to obtain the maximum benefit the first year this arrangement was adopted, but as the clinic became better organized, better results were obtained and I feel sure that you will be well pleased after this method is given a good trial.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

In reply I may say that I am sorry I neglected to quote the authority for the general examination. This was authorized in your letter No.32-0-13, Oct. 23, 1930, which provided for a semi-annual examination. We have been proceeding under this authorization for the past four years.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that this service, at $10.00 is very reasonable. Dr. Landymore spent, at each semi-annual examination, three afternoons of three hours each. It is evident that the actual work of repairing the teeth is much expedited by this previous examination as none but those needing attention need be sent to him.\n\nI trust, therefore, that the Department will not only pay him the small fee involved, but also authorize the continuance of the examination. I do not see how we can get satisfactory results from the time authorized for work on the children's teeth without the previous examination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 22, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to continue allowing Dr. Landymore a fee of $10 for examination of the teeth of the children at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I may say that I have just had a telephone conversation with him and he says that she is definitely tubercular. He recommends that she be placed in a Preventorium immediately. He is sending his written report tomorrow and I shall forward it to you.\n\nI might say that Dr. Davis and Dr. Stone examined her the day Dr. Stone was here and thought she was clear, but as I had already made an appointment with Dr. Alexander, I took her to him. With the better facilities at his disposal he has detected definite symptoms of the disease. Of course I cannot keep her here permanently but during her stay we shall isolate her and keep her in bed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nNovember 7th, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe report on Wilma Hill, contained in your letter of October 29th, would indicate that this child should not be accepted as a pupil in your school. Your best course is to transfer her to the care of Doctor Davis for such disposition as he may think necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\nThe Brant Sanatorium\nBRANTFORD, ONT.\nOctober 31st, 1934.\n\nRev. H. Snell,\nThe Mohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Wilhelmina Hill, Age 5 ?, Mohawk Institute.\n\nHistory of family or other exposure to tuberculosis: no information. History of previous illness: negative. Present illness: It was noted that this child was somewhat quieter and more easily tired out than the average.\n\nPhysical examination: The eyes were bright with dark circles underneath. The child has an appearance of sub-normal health. Having waited a short time before the examination, the left side of the face became flushed. Glands are palpable along both sides of the neck. The excursion of the right side of the chest is slightly more easily controlled by bi-manual pressure than is the left. In the lower half of the right side the percussion note was noticeably impaired at the time of the first examination on October 22nd. On October 29th there was a suggestion of increased dullness in this region. An important finding was the prolonged expiratory phase to respiration in the right lung and in the left axillary region. The fact that this change in respiratory sound was in the lower half of the chest caused me to hesitate in the diagnosis even with a temperature of 100.2 at 10 A.M.\n\nI considered the child too ill to employ an I.C. test and suggested that she return for re-examination on October 29th. When she returned on October 29th, Mr. Snell reported that the child had had complete rest for the past week. Her temperature was 99.4. The face was flushed and she had a listless tired out expression. The previously noted physical findings continued and in addition a very few fine moist sounds were heard at the level of the nipple line in both axillary regions. Accompanying these were wheezing sounds throughout both lungs. These wheezing sounds were only occasionally present. The prolonged expiratory phase of the respiration undoubtedly indicates a congested inflamed condition of lung tissues. The fact that this has not subsided with a week's rest and the various other findings in this case imply justify a suspicion of tuberculosis as the causative factor in the child's abnormal condition of health.\n\nAn I.C. test was given and reported to be positive +++.\n\nThe expense of taking x-ray plates was not consider-\nTHE BRANT SANATORIUM\n\nRev. H. Snell,\nPage -2-\nOct. 31, 1934.\n\ned justifiable as sufficient evidence had been obtained to substantiate a diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n\nThis little girl's best prospects for recovery would be in a Preventorium. Certainly she is not a fit subject to continue in residence at the Mohawk Institute.\n\nNOTE: The tonsil and adenoid condition warrants a continuance of observation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHAS. C. ALEXANDER, M.D.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to Wilma Hill, 01059, I am enclosing report from Dr. Alexander, of the Brant Sanatorium. You will note that he states that she is not a fit subject to continue in residence in the Institute, and that she should be placed in a Preventorium. Pursuant to suggestion from Mr. Phelan, I have interviewed the authorities of the Brant Sanatorium and they will admit her to their Preventorium provided, of course, her admission is authorized by the Department with the assurance that the usual fee of $1.00 per diem charged to municipalities will be paid. I am, therefore asking for authority to place her in the Brant Sanatorium as this seems to be the only chance of her recovering her health. Dr. Davis assured me that she would have no chance of recovery in her own home as her mother is dead and conditions are bad.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Smith,\nPrincipal.\nNovember 12th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nYour letter of November 6th, referring to the case of Wilma Hill will have been answered by the Department's letter of November 7th, which apparently erased yours in the mail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend H. W. Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have not had our dental work this Autumn and there are several pupils whose teeth are in very bad condition.\n\nI am, therefore, asking authority to have Dr. Landymore three days work for them as was arranged last Spring. An examination of his report shows that we secured more service for the money expended under this plan than under the former fee system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Smith\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 27, 1834.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the dental services required by the pupils of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is prepared to allow Dr. F. W. Landymore $30.00 a day for not more than three days' work. A day's work is estimated at 7 hours - during which the dentist is expected to apply himself diligently. He must supply his own materials but is not required to provide gold fillings or any artificial teeth at this rate. Presumably, composition fillings would be satisfactory and no artificial teeth should be supplied. The dentist must use anesthetics sufficiently to avoid unnecessary pain. You should assist by organizing the clinic and seeing that the dentist is kept supplied with patients.\n\nThe dentist should prepare his account, in triplicate, at the rate allowed, covering the period he is engaged, which should not exceed the time mentioned above. He should also prepare a list, giving the names of the pupils receiving attention and the work performed for each. Please certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment, with list attached of the work performed.\n\nYou should arrange with Dr. Landymore to carry out the dental services for the pupils at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, B. A.,\nPrincipal, Mohawk Institute,\nBRANTFORD, ONT.\nOttawa, January 28th, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am having sent to you a sample of a remedy called \"Sphincterine\" which is highly recommended by its makers and by one or two of our residential school principals for bed-wetting. I should appreciate your giving this remedy a careful and thorough trial and letting me know as soon as possible whether you find it effective. I am well aware of the importance of this problem in most Indian residential schools and would be pleased to find some remedy which would help to solve it.\n\nYou have probably had some of the incontinence tablets which have been used for this purpose, and I would appreciate your opinion on the relative merits of the two preparations.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

As we did not have our three days last Spring I wonder if we might have six days' service from Dr. Landymore this term which would pretty well clear them up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Snell,\n\nPrincipal.\nOctober 26th, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will be your authority to engage Doctor Landymore for four days dental attention to your pupils on the basis set out in the Department's letter to you of December 27th, 1934.\n\nKindly try to make such preliminary arrangements as will enable Doctor Landymore to put the greatest possible proportion of his time on the work. Even a casual examination by yourself or better still, by Doctor Davis who I am sure would be pleased to help, should prevent the need of a full examination of each pupil by the dentist himself.\n\nIf, after four days the necessary work is not completed, please communicate with the Department. Strictly speaking there are no funds for this work but the Department will endeavour to do as well as it can.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. Le MacInnes\nActing Secretary\n\nReverend H. W.

The name was Mr. John Johnson, and the amount is $25.00.\n\nI shall appreciate it very much if you can do something about this, as it is a perfectly legitimate case, and I feel it should be paid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.D.

The Department's record shows that you wrote about this case in June 1934, and that the reply was that it was not possible for the Department to recognize your claim as you had not been authorized to supply spectacles. I am sure you are aware that the Department is not responsible even for necessary articles sold to Indians without its knowledge and consent. There are so many authorities to whom a vendor at Brantford can apply that the Department does not feel able to make an exception in this case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F.

Small,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nLM\nApril 11-37,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe nurse reports that the condition of the teeth of many of the pupils is in a bad state. This is largely due to the fact that we were not able to have the usual dental work done last Autumn. I do hope that at least the usual three days may be possible this Spring. Would it be possible, in view of the necessary neglect last Fall, to have five days this Spring? This would, probably, be enough to take care of all the urgent cases and contribute much to the continued good health of all the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nApril 17, 1937\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nThe Principal of the Mohawk Indian Residential School in the city of Brantford, Ontario has asked for a dental clinic which will require about four or five days.

In Mr. Snell's application it is stated that three days' work is required. The usual plan may be followed of offering the dentist a fee of $30.00 per day for his professional services and the supply of materials for extractions and simple fillings. Doctor Bradley Linscott of Brantford is to be employed for this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. A. C.\nDirector of Indian Affairs\n\nMajor W. P.

Jackson,\nSecretary.\nMemoandum,\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nDental Attention - Mohawk Indian Residential School, Brantford.\n\nMr. Pratt's enquiry June 29th.\n\nThere is now available a report on Doctor Linscott's dental clinic and also his account. I am asked to make the following observations on this matter.\n\nA three day dental clinic was authorized, on the estimate of the Principal of the school. Doctor Linscott did four days.\n\nIt is hard to see the necessity of a dentist taking time for such complete examinations and records, when there are many children obviously in need of his services. However, he does not appear to have charged for this extra time.\n\nThe point at issue is whether the Department should allow pay for four days, after authorizing three, and without being further consulted.\n\nIn this particular case, Doctor Linscott appears to have done a fair amount of work in the four days, and to have earned his four days' fee.\nThe funds available for this work are very limited, and we are making an effort to see to the more urgent cases in the largest possible number of schools.\n\nIt is recommended that Doctor Linnett be paid for his four days, but we should really appreciate an instruction not to allow this sort of procedure in future.\n\nAs to further work at this school this year, this will depend on how funds appear to be holding out when the fall term opens.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nActing Director of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, July 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of instructions for your guidance in connection with the medical examination of new pupils entering the Mohawk Institute this year.\n\nThe instructions contained in this letter apply also to children from your Agency entering any Indian residential school from this date.\n\nYour medical officer will cooperate with you in arranging to have new applicants examined by a recognized specialist in tuberculosis.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Snell, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ont.\nCopy for the information of Dr. McGill.\n\nOttawa, 22nd July, 1937.\n\nDear Dr. Linscott,-\n\nMr. Crerar has asked me to reply to your letter of the 28th ultimo in which you report that you found it necessary to spend an extra two days beyond the period authorized by the Department in examining and treating pupils of the Mohawk Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will appreciate the necessity of the Department so planning the expenditure of money provided for Indian affairs that the most urgent cases will receive first attention. The Principal of the Mohawk School estimated that a dentist would be able to take care of the immediate needs of the pupils of his school in three days, and in planning the details of the appropriation sufficient funds were allotted to take care of that expenditure. He did not of course have in mind complete examination of every child or the completion of individual index cards. Whenever a greater expenditure is incurred in one locality than was planned there is the danger that some other work will have to be held over and the possibility that the postponed work is more urgent than that covered by the unforeseen expenditure.\n\nIn view of your report we are authorizing the payment of fees in your case for four days instead of three. This will cover your eight half day's work. I am explaining the situation to you so that in the event of your taking on any Indian work in the future you will not exceed the period authorized by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBradley W.

Re the report: The Department engaged me for three days to do the most urgent work for 150 children, but never made any allowance for inspection.\n\nIt was reasonable to ask how was I to find out the most urgent cases without full inspection? It was always tough days work looking over 150 children for dental defects. I wanted a thorough and complete report for my own satisfaction which would be valuable for the administration of the school so I scoured all my own index cards.\n\nNotwithstanding the Principal's statement there was many most urgent cases and the nurse and I agreed that it would be best to finish up some cases (which I had to) even during four days'\nDr. Bradley W. Linscott,\n\nBrantford\n\nService. I was prompted a bit in the extra day as a humanitarian service and send a report to the department. I wish to thank you for the allowance for the fourth day service.\n\nI think the department will agree the inspection was absolutely necessary to discover the urgent cases they wished me to attend to. I still believe it just in allowing me for inspection.\n\nI rendered five days of real service attended between 40 to 50 children in four days, put in 146 fillings - 28 extractions and 10 Pneumocystic treatments. In private practice $300 worth of work; real value.\n\nI respectfully ask a reconsideration for the allowance for this days inspection.\n\nI am Professfully Yours,\n\nBradley W. Linscott\n\nP.S.

You were engaged for three days work. You rendered accounts for four days during which you did about the average amount of work accomplished by dentists engaged on a daily basis, as you were.

I was approached last May to look after a Dental Clinic of four day duration which was changed to a third day clinic & look after the most urgent cases needing Dental treatment. Asked how he could have me & to find the most urgent or even urgent cases with out examination. I asked Mr. Jackson the same question in my last letter and received no answer in your letter. I was employed to look after the extraction and plans fitting for the most urgent cases.\n\nI made a complete examination of 150 children and have a complete list of\nDr. Bradley W.

I may say I could not cover all\nthe cases requiring attention.\n\nOne full day was seeing 150 Indians\nkeeping an order report, so the service\nwill extend your departments what\ntroubled your department & inconvenience.\nYour department I am sure will\nrealize the necessity of the examination\nand will recommend - just right.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nBradley W.

All drug requisitions are now required to come through the office of the Indian Agent who, in this case, is Major E. P. Randle of Brantford, Ontario. They must also bear the signature of the Agency medical attendant, whose duty it is to scrutinize them carefully before being passed on to Ottawa. The European situation has enhanced conservation of available drug supplies and has, at the same time, placed a restriction on some as you may see from the enclosed Circular of September 2nd, 1939. It, also, is no longer possible to supply rubbing alcohol in any quantity unless the medical attendant, signing the requisition, has an alcohol registration number which must appear on the order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

I should, therefore, like authority to have them attended to early in the term. As no dental care was authorized last year would it be possible to have five days' if the dentist's time this year. I doubt whether this would be sufficient for all of them to be attended to but it would take care of the more urgent cases.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSeptember 2, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. H. W. Snell, Principal of the Mohawk Institution, has written the Department requesting a five day dental clinic for the school. It will be in order for you to arrange this clinic as formerly, the dentist to receive $30.00 per day for his material and services. Mr. Snell is receiving a copy of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nMajor R. F. Handley,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nFAR\nMay 6-42.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed, please find requisition for medical supplies for the ensuing year. In accordance with your request, these have been kept as low as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa June 1st, 1942.\n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nPlease note that future drug requisitions must give the amount of all drugs on hand each time you submit a requisition, otherwise, no action will be taken except to return it to you for further particulars. This, also, will apply to requisitions on which are not clearly marked the number of Indians to be served. Space has been provided for this information on the drug order form.\n\nIt should also be noted that freezable items should not be ordered during cold weather, nor is it economical to submit an order that cannot be sent by mail or freight. One hundred pounds is the minimum on which freight has to be paid and fifteen pounds the maximum of non-liquids that can be sent by mail. I must ask you, therefore, to bear these facts in mind when ordering drugs.\n\nEfforts should be made to gain the co-operation of Indians in the matter of returning empty bottles, after thoroughly washing them, when more medicine is required.\n\nI would suggest that this Circular be attached to your Departmental drug list for future reference.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

The supplies are intended for the use of Indians of Mohawk Ind. Res. School, in the Six Nations Agency and should be addressed as follows:\n\nThe Principal,\nMohawk Ind. Res. School,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nPayment will be made by this Department on receipt of your account in triplicate. Above file number must appear on the voucher covering this order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Falconer, L. D.\nAssistant Superintendent.\n\nChief Purchasing Agent,\nDept. of Veterans Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNo. 639\nFeb.23/46\nPage 2.\n\nIt has been of interest to you that since the last allotment of work I have given 16 emergency treatments for the children (extractions, fillings and relief of tooth-ache) I have asked no fee for this service, so expect none. I offer this service to Dr. Snell for the children's sake.\n\nI wish to cooperate to the full, for the best service for the lost children.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(signed) Stanley V. Linscott.\nDr. Bradley W. Linscott,\nBrantford, Ont.\nFeb. 23/46\n\nRe our telephone conversation the \"Dental treatment for the children of the... Institute.\"\n\nThe few years I have been doing this work it has been my endeavour and practice to give the children the best dental service possible and for the greatest number. To complete dental service for 40 or 50 children in 7 days means some very diligent attention to give this service properly. Some suitable and convenient surroundings must be at hand and that place is my Dental Office.\n\nIf it is your intention to ask for the Brantford Schools Dental Clinic outfit, and it is granted you, I may say that it takes one day to pack, move, and set up the equipment when you assist and I move. That means two days lost for working on the children. I may say that dental services are at a premium during the war and since its end, and I know for a fact that some dentist could not arrange an appointment for three months. So it is too late to ask any dentist to complete 7-day service before April 15th. That could have been arranged much earlier.\n\nThe Government have also asked the local dentists to give immediate attention to the dental service for ex-service men. We are trying to cooperate, and personally I have 15 Dental charts for 15 ex-service men and more new ones each day. These must be attended to at once.\n\nTo ask the Institution to send five children each week for a half-day for appointments is co-operating, in view of the above circumstances.\n\nI told Mr. Zimmerman that during Easter Holidays I would give an all-day service until the seven days have been completed.\n\n----It may be\nOttawa, March 18, 1946.\n\nDear Colonel Randle:\n\nWith reference to Dr. Linnett's letter to you of February 23, I discussed it with Dr. Moore, who stated that he was going to London and would stop off at Brantford. He is away this week and I hope you have an opportunity of meeting him.\n\nI also spoke to him in regard to the situation at the Mohawk Institute in connection with the medical services. I pointed out to him that the school has been paying $2.00 a day to the doctor for several years. There is no reason why Mohawk Institute should not be treated on the same basis as other residential schools throughout Canada, the services of the doctor being made a charge against the Medical Vote. Dr. Moore promised me that he would also discuss this matter with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nLt.-Col. E. F. Randle,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nApril 25, 1946.\n\nDr. P. T. Moore,\nActing Supt. Indian Health Services,\nDept. of National Health and Welfare,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nEnclosed please find three prescriptions and particulars regarding glasses for three pupils, under recommendation from Dr. Bagg and Dr. Palmer.\n\nThere is one more to come almost immediately, so you will know what it is when it arrives.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the glasses could be sent as soon as convenient, as the children concerned should be wearing them as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPatron.\nPlease supply, at the expense of this Department, spectacles in accordance with the enclosed prescription and the following specifications:\n\n**LENSES** - equal to Consolidated Optical Company \"CENTEX.\"\n\n**FRAME** - strong metal, full frame, cable ear fittings, rocking pearl nose pads, equal to Consolidated Optical Company \"ROBIN HOOD\" Catalogue No. 3678.\n\nSend these spectacles by the most economical method to the following address: Indian Health Services, Booth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nFor: Blanche Martin, Sylvia Soney and Eileen Williams - (pupil) Six Nations Agency.\n\nThe account must show the prices charged for lenses and frame separately, eye examination if any, and be sent in DUPLICATE at the same time to the above address.

Indian Health Services,\nDept. of National Health & Welfare,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring this past week I sent one of the boys to the Lady Willingdon Hospital, Chawaken. He was 10 years of age. He had a V.D. condition from birth. The test of his sister was neither positive or negative. A further test has to be made. Four more children are to be tested.\n\nI am reporting these facts to you so that if you have any suggestions to make I shall be very happy to carry them out if possible. For example the boys have been using the common towels. This lad who is in the hospital had matter discharging from the eye at one stage. Needless to say that is not a happy condition. We have no locker space for the boys so that I cannot see how we can handle individual towels if they were acceptable. There are quite a number of points that come to my mind as preventive\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. W.J. Zimmerman, M.A., B.D.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 25, 1946\n\n32 -0-13\n\nRev. W. J. Zimmerman, M.A.B.D.\nPrincipal,\nMohawk Institute,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of June 21st addressed to Dr. Moore concerning your report on the family and one boy ten years of age in the school. Dr. Moore is away at present so I am replying in his place.\n\nWith the information contained in your letter, it is difficult to state just what action should be taken. As the boy has been sent to Lady Willington Hospital, I think you should take the whole matter up with Dr. Davis and Indian Superintendent. I would presume that this may be possibly congenital syphilis and there is a possibility that the other members of the family might be negative.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Davis for his action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

(place) on May 11 ............... 1936\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nWhen a pupil of an Indian Residential School dies, the Principal is required to inform the Indian Agent at once.\n\nOn receipt of the Principal's notice the Indian Agent shall convene a Board of Inquiry, consisting of himself as Chairman, the Principal of the Residential School, and the Medical Officer who attended the deceased pupil. These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? May 11-1936.\n\n2. At what time of day? 6:15 P.M.\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? 6:15 P.M., May 11-36 to Miss S. Hardie\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? Doctor called immediately.\n\n5.

They had put a board through loops in the unfurled chains and were being pushed around the pole thus throwing all the weight toward one side of the pole. This caused the pole to split a piece out of the side of the pole at the top allowing the wheel to fall to the ground where it struck Effie Smith in abdomen causing the injuries from which she died.\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\n\nHorace W.

Molly Johnson, 14, and Louise Davis, who were riding around the maypole on a beam with the Smith child, also fell off and were badly injured.\n\nThe coroner's inquest was held yesterday afternoon and continued today. The coroner, Dr. H. H. Palmer, Ray H. W. Smith, Dr. Harold Palmer, Dr. C. H. Lager, an Institute of Technology, and Dr. D. D. Smith, a dentist, and the examination was conducted by Crown Attorney Wallace.\n\nRev. Mr. Snell described the playground equipment as being in good condition when the accident occurred, stating it was equipped with swings, teeter-totters, slides, and other apparatus.\n\nThe maypole was an improvised affair, he said, and had been constructed at the institute. The wheel was an automobile wheel placed on top of the pole to a hole at the top of the pole. It was attached to the pole by a chain on one side of the pole that caused the wheel to fall.\n\nThe Smith child was not under constant supervision. Rev. Mr. Snell said. He said there were no attendants who looked after the recreational period of the pupils at the institute. He was unaware of the accident when it occurred.\n\n\"How long has the pole been there?\" Crown Attorney Wallace asked.\n\n\"It was there when I came seven years ago,\" Mr. Snell replied.\n\n\"Was it in operation before you came?\" the Crown questioned.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr. Snell answered.\n\nPointing to what appeared to be a spot where it broke, Crown Attorney Wallace asked Rev. Mr. Snell:\n\n\"Did you know anything about this?\"\n\n\"I never knew it was there,\" Rev. Mr. Snell said.\n\n\"Was that one side of the pole where the piece is broken off or was it the whole pole?\" the Crown questioned.\n\n\"From the appearance of it,\" Mr. Snell replied, \"you do not employ a regular carpenter on your staff, do you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"This maypole was constructed by a malcontent.\"\n\n\"Was this wheel, or any part of it considered dangerous by you or your staff?\"\n\n\"I don't think any of us ever thought of it as being dangerous with it.\"\n\nRev. Mr. Snell stated there were no regulations regarding the use of the maypole and that it was used by the Government for recreational purposes.\n\n\"We also recommend that the playground equipment be inspected every three months by competent inspectors.\"\n\nThe jurors were: R. W. Henry, Foreman; Elijah Smith, T. J. Smith, W. H. Williams, Charles Craddock, E. Conner and Mrs. Mary Proctor, Officer Girl W. Parrow in charge of witnesses and the jury.\n\nWERE RIDING SWAN\n\nMoff Johnson, an Institute pupil, testified that a beam, a two-by-four, had been placed across the top of the pole and was, with the Smith girl, Louise Davis, Velma Powless and Hazel Vanier, riding on it. They had hardly started when the wheel fell off and struck her in the crack in the pole before the accident. Miss Powless also stated she did not notice anything wrong.\n\nWitnesses admitted the fact that the pole was not painted black on one side of the pole would cause the paint to come off on the top of the pole to become dangerous.\n\nThe verdict in full was as follows:\n\n\"We, the jurors, find it impossible to inquire into the death of the Smith child, a pupil of the Mohawk Institute, who died May 11, 1936, at the Brantford General Hospital, as the death was due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage caused by striking a wheel from a maypole which was constructed at the Mohawk Institute in the Town of Brantford.\n\n\"We also recommend that the playground equipment be inspected every three months by competent inspectors.\"\n\nThe jurors were: R. W. Henry, Foreman; Elijah Smith, T. J. Smith, W. H. Williams, Charles Craddock, E. Conner and Mrs. Mary Proctor, Officer Girl W. Parrow in charge of witnesses and the jury.\nRe: Effie SMITH (Indian) - Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont. - Accidental Death.\n\n4. In the evening of May 15th I patrolled to Brantford, Ont. and attended the Inquest which was held at the Police Station at 8:30 p.m. Coroner Dr. D.A. Harrison presided and the examination was conducted by Crown Attorney F.E.D. Wallace. Provincial Constable C. Farrow had charge of the witnesses and the jury. The verdict of the Jury was as follows:\n\n\"We the undersigned Jury empaneled to inquire into the death of Effie Smith, a pupil of the Mohawk Institute, find she came to her death at the Brantford General Hospital, May 11th, 1936 from an intra-abdominal hemorrhage caused by being struck by a wheel from maypole which we consider was not safe at the Mohawk Institute in the Township of Brantford, May 11th, 1936.\"\n\n\"We also recommend that the playground equipment be inspected every three months by a competent Inspector.\"\n\n5.

Six Nations Reserve also attended the Inquest, and is aware of all the facts in connection with this case which was purely accidental.\n\nExpense - Nil.\n\nTo - The Commissioner, R.C.M.P.\n\nForwarded.

In the evening of May 11th I received a telephone call from F.K.D. Wallace, Crown Attorney at Brantford advising that the above named Indian girl had been seriously injured as a result of an accident in the playground of the Mohawk Institute about 6.00 p.m. that evening, and had died some two hours later at the General Hospital, Brantford, Ont. He stated the Coroner had been advised, also Major Randle, Sept. Six Nations Reserve. Mr. Wallace requested that I come to Brantford immediately and meet him and Major Randle at the Mohawk Institute.\n\n2. Accordingly I proceeded to the Mohawk Institute and together with the Crown Attorney and Major Randle obtained the details in connection with the accident. Owing to the lateness of the night the children who were eye-witnesses to the accident were not interviewed. Next morning I proceeded to Brantford and accompanied by Provincial Const. C. Farrow interviewed all witnesses in regard to the accident.\n\n3. The circumstances in connection with this death are as follows:\n\nAbout 6.00 p.m. on the night in question the above named together with four other girl pupils of the school were playing on a swinging affair which is known as the \"Maypole\". The pole itself is about 18 feet high and approximately 6 inches in diameter at the top. A automobile wheel is attached to the top of the pole by means of an axle about 15 inches long which is inserted in a hole in the centre of the pole. Four chains were attached to the wheel on top of the pole and reach to the end 2 feet approximately to the ground. Instead of swinging individually on each chain which distributes the weight evenly on the pole the five girls placed a 7 foot plank between the loops of three of the chains and the five of them sat on this plank and were swinging around the pole with the aid of two other girls who were pushing them. As a result of all the weight being on the one side the pole split at the top where the axle of the wheel fitted into the pole, which allowed the axle to come out of position with the result that the wheel fell to the ground striking the above named girl on the abdomen. The weight of the wheel itself was estimated at 100 pounds and the whole apparatus was a homemade affair. It was ascertained the pole had been split at the top previous to the accident and appeared to have been cracked for some time. The top of the pole together with the axle and wheel was taken by Capt. Farrow and myself to be used as evidence at the Coroner's Inquest.\n\n- Continue...\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BRANCH\n\nOTTAWA, May 23rd.,1936.\n\nSir:\n\nRe - Effie SMITH\nMohawk Institute\nBrantford, Ont.\n\nAttached is copy of a report dated the 16th instant received from our Officer Commanding at Toronto, Ontario, regarding the accidental death of the above named Indian girl.\n\n2.

P. Randle will be forwarding to you a full report.\n\nI may only say that it was purely accidental and so far as I can see no blame is to be attached to anyone.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHorace W. Swell.\n\nPrincipal.\nMOHAWK INSTITUTE\n\nBRANTFORD, ONTARIO, May 25 - 36.\n\nReplying to\nNo. 32-0-1\nMay 22-36.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe newspaper report of the inquest re the death of Effie Smith, while perfectly fair, hardly gives the right impression of the part of my testimony which you quote. The Crown Attorney asked me \"Does the Department make a grant for playground equipment?\" and, of course, I answered \"NO\" but added that the Department did furnish us with equipment such as balls, bats, etc. He then asked if our equipment was sometimes homemade as in the case of the Giant Stride and I answered that it was. No one who heard the evidence could possibly have inferred that the Department was niggardly in its provision for the pupils.\n\nThe court did not think Mr. Lager was remiss, inasmuch as he explained that he took it that the ring around the pole had been placed there to strengthen the pole where it was checked. The check, as was shown to the coroner and jury, did not reach completely to the top of the pole. Had the ring been nearer to the top of the pole it would have effectually prevented the split that caused the accident.\n\nI may say that the mother attached no blame to the management. In fact, she made the request that her little boy might be admitted next term if there is room for him. I have received a very kind letter written on her behalf, thanking us for our kindness in connection with the sad occurrence.\n\nI shall be glad to furnish any further information desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

This is the total amount of grant provided for the fiscal year ending March 31, next. The Department would like you to be good enough to instruct the teachers at Albany, Rupert's House and Fort George to send in quarterly returns for this fiscal year at the first opportunity presented and regularly thereafter.\n\nThe return received from the Boarding School at Moose Factory is very incomplete, and a new return should be forwarded by the Principal made out on the proper form, a copy of which is sent you under separate cover, with all the columns of the return as called for carefully filled.\n\nThe Right Reverend George Holmes,\nBishop of Neocanoe,\nCharlevoix, Ont.\nfilled in. This information is required by the Department and the Auditor General.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the grant for the Boarding School for the quarter ended September 30, last, is paid on the return received from the Rev. Claude Ovens, which return shows that there were twenty-three pupils in attendance. At $15.00 per capita (the amount payable quarterly) the earnings of the school were $345.00. An advance of $300 was sent you on October 30, last, on this account, leaving a balance due for the quarter of $45.00, a cheque for which is being sent you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter enclosing cheque for $45.00, being the balance of September quarter 1906, for which please accept thanks.\n\nI am very sorry that the returns forwarded to you from Moose Fort were so incomplete. Mr. Oxley, who was teacher last year had instructions to send in regularly quarterly returns made out in accordance with the Department's Regulations.\n\nDid you not receive returns for the Boarding School at Moose Fort for December, March & June last (1906)?\n\nI forwarded to the Department such returns as were made out by Mr. Oxley. The Boarding School opened in September 1906 with an average attendance all the winter through of between thirty and twenty six scholars; but the grant made by the Dept. only begins with 1st July 1906. Why the Dept. did not arrange for the grant to be made from the opening of the school is a little puzzling to me, owing to the inexperience of the workers & management of such schools, & they exceeding my orders in regard to number of scholars and allowance for school support. The account from the Hudson Bay Co. for support alone apart from equipment was the amount stated in the accounts forwarded in December last to the Department which was more than twice the amount I stipulated in my instructions to those in charge at Moose Fort.\n\n(over)\nI hope, therefore, that the Department will see its way to pay us for the number of scholars in the school, as bounded from September 1st to June 1st, 1906.\n\nThe Rev. R.J. Benson, who is now in charge of Moose Fort Mission, who is one of the cleverest and best of missionaries, informs me that they have an average attendance of 55 scholars including the founders which makes an average attendance of 35 half breed children. For this number of children in the North West, while I was in charge of Lower Slave Lake School in Athabasca, the grant for the number was $700.00, and ought not to be less in Ontario since it is self evident that no one teacher can do justice to 55 children. During the summer months when the Indians are present there will probably not be less than 150 scholars.\n\nSo far the half-breeds have received no consideration such as they have in the North West Territories. It does not therefore seem unreasonable that the Post should provide missionary means for the secular education of their children.\n\nWill you kindly let us know the proper quarter ought to apply for an increase in this Grant & obliging\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGeorge Mosson,\nBishop of Moosefort.\nOttawa, 26th February, 1907.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your favor of the 11th instant I have to say that it would be impossible for the Department to assist you with the maintenance grant of the Moose Factory Boarding School prior to the 1st of July 1906. You will remember that the School was opened in advance of any recognition by the Department and it did not appear as an institution for which the Government was responsible to a certain extent until the appropriation voted by Parliament became available on the 1st of July last. It was understood that you proposed to bear the full cost of the School until the Department was in a position to assist.\n\nAn application for a grant for educational advantages provided for half-breed children, and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario, should be made to the Education Department, Toronto. As Mr. D. G. Macmartin who was the Ontario Commissioner for Treaty No 9 is acquainted with the situation at that post with reference to half-breeds as well as Indians, and as the Ontario Government has already recognized the half-breed claims by granting 100 acres each, it might be well to refer to Mr. Macmartin in your communication to the Ontario Government.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Right Rev.

Hanson,\n249 Albany Street,\nToronto, Ont.\nSelkirk, Jan.\n\nJan 14th, 1910.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn the discussion we had last October you mentioned that $200 each were allowed for day schools at Albany, Ft George, Rupert's House and Moose Factory, and that the same right be allowed for Ft Hope if arrangements could be made for a school there. I wrote the missionary in charge of Ft Hope but have not yet received an answer. I understand however that the rents were payable for the first 4 mentioned, so day schools are carried on at those places. I have just received the half yearly statement from our bankers, the Royal Trust Co., I find no amounts credited for any schools. What is the explanation? Is it for lack of reports? I think I handed to you or forwarded to the Dept the report for Albany day schools; and Moose day School is connected in conjunction with the boarding school.

What I had in my mind was the possibility of securing suitable boys and training them for future missionaries among their people.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief [Name]\nST.

J. Armstrong came to the school and visited the girls' bedrooms after I had sent them to bed. He then took them out into the yard and had his men cruelly whipped so much so that their hands were swollen and discolored two days afterwards. In the same manner, they were playing outside our own door not far from where my residence is. One was Clara Sutherland, a house girl and an orphan; the other Mary Smith or Morton's Falls. Sometimes we had also at different times previously observed the girls around their bedrooms. In consequence, Clara and Jane (my eldest girl) have been withdrawn from the school. The others are unable to get in their houses during the winter, else I fear they too would be withdrawn.\n\nI would also like to state that I cannot vouch as to the correctness of the reports of the Boarding School and to you as they have never been submitted to me for signature before they were sent, and if signed by anyone else as written it is false.\nas I have been in charge here as per appointment of Bishop Anderson since October 1911.\n\nI remain\n\nvery truly yours,\n\nHarry A. Johnson\nOttawa, March 21, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to call Your Lordship's attention to the following extract from a letter addressed to the Department by Miss Mary A. Johnson, Matron of the Moose Fort Indian Boarding School:\u2014 \"On the evening of the 2nd of February the Rev. W. Haythornwhite, Missionary in charge, came into the school, went to the girls' bedroom after I had sent them to bed, brought them down, took them over to his study and had two of them cruelly whipped, so much so that their hands were swollen and discolored for two days afterwards, for the simple reason that they were playing outside our own door not his and with my permission. One was Clara Sutherland, a Moose Girl and an orphan, the other May Shipe of Marten's Falls, motherless. He had also at different times previously chased the girls around their bed-rooms. In consequence Clara and Jane Tapas my eldest girl have been withdrawn from the school. The others are unable to get to their homes during the winter, else I fear they too would be withdrawn.\"\n\nThe Department considers that a thorough investigation of the alleged ill-treatment of the pupils should be made at the earliest possible date and a full report sent in, as, if there is any truth in the charges, the Principal should be removed at once.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 21, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is making inquiry into the matter of the ill-treatment of pupils of the Moose Fort Indian Boarding School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Mary A. Johnson,\nMatron,\nMoose Fort Indian Boarding School,\nMoose Fort,\nJames Bay, Ont.\nThe Diocese of Moosonee\n\nChapleau Ont.\n\nI went home inside a week after the boy and girl had been sent home, and I was summoned to see a third child die\u2014Malcolm Cowper. I was kept in ignorance of this boy's state until five minutes before his death. You must know, Bishop, that it is hard enough to keep the school full without this kind of thing, and I have no intention of allowing children to go without any knowledge. While Miss Hudson is doing her best for her own children, she is scarcely led by Miss Bennett, who is the instigator of nearly all these faults.\n\nThe above extracts from Mr. Haydon's letter, and Miss Johnson's defense, are sufficient to show that matters between the Principal and Miss Johnson have been very unsatisfactory. In fact, the Principal is now forced to keep out of the school for the sake of peace, as Miss Johnson claims that she was given entire control of the school when Miss Johnson took over the former Principal's duties last autumn. She has complained that I sent Mr. Haydon to take charge while her own religion was being taught. The Albany Church Council has come into conflict with Miss Johnson's methods. While she has, perhaps, no cause, she accepted a new position at Moose. This happened in December last, when, of course, no change could be made, and therefore Mr. Haydon continued in charge.\n\nMy own opinion is that Miss Bennett deserves to be dismissed. She has been a constant source of trouble in the class, and we have had to deal with her behavior, which is at the bottom of most of the trouble. She seems to be acting in defiance of her residence at the U.B.C. Post Office, and the Boarding School seems to be worse.\n\nThis appears from a letter of Miss Baxter, also mentioned in above extract. She says: \"I only hope Miss Bennett will go back at first open water, being a friend of Miss Johnson she spends the greater part of her time at the Boarding School; we doubtless this is the cause of the peculiar behavior.\"\n\nI wish you were coming down by first open water as it is far from pleasant here.\n\nI may say that I have planned to visit James Bay this summer, leaving as early as I can (likely about May 15th) and going via Grand Lake, Kenora, and Chipewyan House. I should reach Moose by the end of June. I will then hold a full investigation, and give you a report on my return.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 1st, 1911\nThe Diocese of Moosonee\n\nRe 306750/1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 21st, I may say that I have received a letter from Miss Johnson containing the same charges against the Rev. W. Heathcote-Watson. But I have also received a letter from Mr. Haydon-Watson containing similar charges of misconduct against the Rev. W. Heathcote-Watson. The incident between the girls and the Rev. W. Heathcote-Watson was the climax of a long process of provocation. The girls say: \"One evening as I was walking at my desk near the girls' camp, I saw something at my desk near the girls' camp. I went out into the moonlight and heard one of the girls saying in a loud voice: 'I want to go home.' I went back inside the house where I found them, but could not find them. I went home disgusted. I had not been set down half an hour before the girls came out again. I followed them into the house, and asked Miss Johnson why they were there, which she refused to do. Therefore sent them out of the house and called Miss Butler (teacher) to the day school. She then went to the girls' bedroom and told them off with a stick - that will be the same thing I had done. I went out of the house so that she had to leave a window open just as I did. Miss Butler called me to anything she wanted to do. I looked around and said, 'She was the Policeman's partner off.' The Missions premises. He replied that he had nothing to do with the mission. The day following I heard from one of the boys that the girl she had been punished had come home. Thinking the girl had run away, I went over to bring her back. It was only then I felt that Miss Johnson had asked me people to take her away because I had punished her. I got her clothes and let her come back with me. She came crying to me, telling me that Miss Johnson had sent her away again. I looked her out for a week, but she still naturally did not care for that, so she...\nOttawa, April 2, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's communication of the 25th ultimo in reference to the alleged ill-treatment of pupils at the Moose Factory Boarding School and friction between the Principal and matron of this institution.\n\nYour Lordship remarks that it is your intention to visit this school at an early date and I have to ask you to look carefully into the matters complained of and take such action as you deem necessary to secure harmony at the school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John D. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moosehead,\nChapleau, Ont.\nThe Diocese of Moosonee\n\nChapleau, Ont.\n\nWhen Miss Bennett and Miss Taylor were temporarily ill in class, these ladies continued to get Mrs. Hackett to teach in the hospital against the wishes of Mr. Haythorne. Miss Bennett and Miss Taylor were warned against the principal because he asked Mrs. Hackett to discontinue her teaching. Miss Taylor visited in the school room and was seen taking nearly all his meals there. During the day they took at night. I may say that the reports of the things done at the school at this time reached all parts of James Bay. Miss Johnson, who is an old friend of Miss Bennett, evidently soon after her arrival complained of Mr. Haythorne's conduct against the principal, and began giving him trouble with his attitude toward the pupils and school affairs. The \"playing outside our own door\" was forbidden, was only one form of punishment employed by Mr. Haythorne. His wife was deliberately encouraged by those in Mr. Haythorne's study. He made the excuse of playing \"new game.\" His Haythorne visited once from his house, summoned them to his study, Miss Johnson being present. When they reported to the provost, Mr. Haythorne visited them in his study, and visited their teacher, Miss Bennett, to punish them, which she did with the ordinary school teacher. All these facts will give me an idea of how things were carried on in the school. Miss Johnson and Miss Taylor were resigned, and have closed Mrs. Haythorne's place in order to seek Mr. Haythorne's assistance. Miss Taylor is now engaged as a teacher at Moosonee.\nthat he practically relinquished his duties at the school. Miss Hanson & Miss Taylor to investigate.\n\nI found also from other sources that he, from his stay throughout being the cause of the withdrawal of Clara Buttenworth's foster children, that Miss Buttenworth had nothing but the worst to say about them. They were dismissed by Miss Hanson, so that they were not allowed to remain. I was also told by a family of Indians in Albany, Saskatchewan, that the Indian boys had their feet frozen at the school, owing to the neglect of Miss Hanson, who, with Miss Taylor, often visited among the people leaving the pupils to themselves. I myself found when at Moose, that Miss Hanson had placed a girl that I thought was fit for a maid in the Indian Bay residence (but Moose) to work as a maid without mentioning her to the Department excepting that she knew that Miss Hanson, your aunt, had her let non-Indian Indians children could not receive it in Ojibwa grant. My opinion is that it is only an excuse because she had under various pretexts dismissed the pupils. In fact she seems to have done her best to put the school off because she liked Mr. Waymouth while she had to treat him, that is, have him disqualified & discarded. It whole trouble began in the summer of 1894 when Miss Waymouth wrote to me against a certain Mr. Hackett visiting the school. I am not sure if it was during his interval between Miss Buttenworth's departure or whether she arrived after Miss Hanson.\nThe Diocese of Moosonee\n\nOct 3rd\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring your Communication of March 21st last, I have to report that during my summer visitation of the missions and schools on James Bay, I made an investigation into the charges made by Miss Mary Johnson against the Principal, Rev. W. Haythornthwaite. The principal defended himself in person before a board which was convened by the superior, resident Bishop. It was claimed by Miss Johnson that the principal had been unfaithful to his duties and had neglected his responsibilities. After a thorough investigation, it was found that there was no evidence to support these allegations.\n\nMiss Johnson was dismissed from her position due to her inability to perform her duties effectively. She has since been employed as a teacher at another mission.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the report for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. J.G.

ANDERSON\n\nCHAPLEAU, ONT\nAug. 24th, 1913\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed by our missionary at Moose Factory that the Indian Department have promised upon an application to Mr. Thomas Barker, who has taken up the subject in the school. This latter, no doubt, has an air about him, but a course last year at the agricultural college at Sudbury, or is qualified for this work.\n\nI understand that a grant of $50 per annum is allowed by the Government for this special work and also assistance toward the purchase of seed, fencing, etc. We are making a great effort in the direction of improving our farms and gardens and believe a fine stock at Moose Factory can be cleared of brush and planted in use. Notwithstanding the severe frost in the spring, which practically destroyed all potatoes near the school, a good harvest has been raised in sufficient for the needs of the school and some to sell. I say this planning has also been successful in some cases. I mention these things to show the need of such instruction for independent improvement, and because we would like to have where to apply for the plant assistance referred to above.\n\nWith best wishes, sincerely yours, [Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 1st, 1913.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Lordship's communication of the 4th instant, in which you ask for a grant to enable the Moose Factory Boarding School to extend their farming operations, and in reply, I beg to say that the Department does not make any grant to Boarding Schools for this purpose, and any expenditure incurred must be met from the per capita grant paid by the Department. As a recognition of Miss Barker's services in connection with the Day School, the Department has decided to increase her salary by $50.00, making the total $850.00 from the 1st of current quarter, and Miss Barker is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. John G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nChapleau, Ont.\nST. THOMAS MISSION\n\nTO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nWe wish to respectfully bring before the Department the need of land at Moose in connection with the Boarding-School.\n\nAt present we occupy only a few acres of the Hudson's Bay Co.'s land, and it is very desirable that we should have enough land to farm. We should very much like to have a quarter section on \"Hazey Island.\" This Island is the only land near enough to our present buildings to be useful for that purpose.\n\nWe have now three boys able to plow and it is highly desirable that they should have some land to practice on. It is all bush land and would be too expensive to clear unless the school had some claim on it afterwards.\n\nAt present the Indians know practically nothing about farming, and as they may be required to go onto their Reserve at anytime it is very important that the Department should prepare them for the change.\n\nDuring the last two years we have been in touch with the Officials at Guelph and have made a number of satisfactory experiments on a small scale and we are anxious now to prove them on a larger.\n\nWe also think that it would be very beneficial to the Indians generally if the Department gave us some special* for this purpose. We are held back at Moose by prohibitive freight rates, and although we have spent every cent we could get, we seem to get so little for it. Many of the tools we have got out during the past two years have cost us fifty per cent more than the first cost by the time we got them here.\n\nThen just as we are getting a few machines together the horse fails and any sort of a horse will cost us $500 by the time we get it.\n\nWe think it would be good policy on the part of the Department to secure some land for the School, lend us a team and a Stumping machine, and let us show the Indians how what can be done on their reserve. If we wait for the Indians to move, it will be a long time to wait, and of course it is not the policy of the trading Company to move in this direction. If the School does not teach them now it will cost the Department a great deal more in the future.\n\nTrusting that this may have just consideration,\n\nI remain\n\nYOURS SINCERELY:\n\n(PRINCIPAL)\nOttawa, January 26, 1914.\n\nRev.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the work performed by me during the past summer in making the payment of Treaty 9 annuities to Indians residing in James Bay District.\n\nI visited the Hospitals and Schools and have no adverse criticisms to offer. I am very sorry, however, to have to report the said accident which happened at Moose. On the evening of the 29th June, twelve of the boys from the Moose Factory Boarding School were crossing the Moose River to Nasely Island, when the canoe was accidentally upturned, and in spite of prompt assistance, seven of the boys were drowned, viz., Alfred Loutitt, Thomas Loutitt, Arthur Sutherland, James Sutherland, Harry Wesley, John Sailors and Sinclair Nepaneshkum. John Carpenter, a boy of fourteen years son of Jimmy Carpenter of Fort Hope Band, supported a small boy of eight years of age until assistance arrived. I feel that this boy should receive some recognition for his gallant services and I trust the Department will take up the question with the proper authorities and have the matter brought before the Humane Society for recognition.\n\nH.M. Anney.\nOttawa, September 6, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it has been brought to the attention of this Department by Mr. H. N. Awrey, Paying Officer for Treaty No. 9, that a very sad drowning accident happened at Moose Factory on the evening of the 25th of June, last. Twelve boys, pupils of the Moose Factory Boarding School, were crossing the Moose River to Haney Island, when the canoe they were in was accidentally upset and seven of the boys were drowned.\n\nA gallant rescue of one of the party, a small boy eight years of age, was made by John Carpenter, who was also in the party. John Carpenter is an Indian boy, fourteen years of age, the son of an Indian named Jimmy Carpenter of the Fort Hope Band. He was in the canoe with the other boys at the time of the accident and through his efforts he supported one of the smaller boys and held him up in the water until assistance arrived.\n\nIt is felt that some recognition should be granted John Carpenter for his bravery, and it has been suggested to the Department that his case be laid before your society for recognition. Among the persons who witnessed the accident and saw the brave act made by John Carpenter was the Rev. W. Haythornthwaite, Principal of the school, and his wife. It is considered that recognition by your society of the bravery of John Carpenter would be an incentive to the Indians of that northern country and a reminder that such acts do not go unnoticed or unrewarded.\n\nThe Department will be glad if your Society can see its way to a favourable consideration of the case and will be pleased to assist in obtaining all particulars or any affidavits which you may require.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nRoyal Canadian Humane Association,\nHamilton, Ont.\nOttawa, September 6, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nMr. H. N. Awrey, Paying Officer for Treaty No. 9, who has recently returned to the Department, reports a very sad drowning accident which occurred on the evening of the 29th of June, last, whereby seven boys, pupils of the Moose Factory Boarding School, lost their lives by the upsetting of the canoe in which they were crossing Moose River.\n\nTheir death is regretted and the Department sympathizes with the parents and the school in their loss.\n\nMr. Awrey reports that no blame can be attached to yourself or the other members of the staff, but it is considered that to allow such a large number of boys in a canoe should not have been permitted. It is hoped that this accident will not result detrimentally to the future recruiting of pupils for the school.\n\nThe bravery of John Carpenter, one of the boys who supported a small boy of eight years of age until assistance arrived, is being brought to the attention of the Royal Canadian Humane Association, as it is considered that it is worthy of some recognition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFOR Asst.

Also respecting the Department's effort to get some recognition from the Canadian Humane Association.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that we have now received the declaration forms which will receive our prompt attention, owing to the departure of the last canoe in the morning early it will be impossible to complete them in time for this packet and it may be some weeks before another opportunity.\n\nWhile we cannot concur in Mr. Arey's most charitable opinion regarding our responsibility, we do sincerely thank both him and the Department for their kindness and sympathy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal of the Moose Factory Boarding School.\nA translation of the attached Cree letter, which was intended for\nDuncan Campbell Scott Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nA report from Moose Factory, Ontario.\n\nI, Chief Woomastoogish, and George Hardisty, Andrew Butterfly, and John Dick.\n\nWe want to give the Government a true report of the drowning of the children.\n\nThere were twelve children in the canoe and the children were alone, and the canoe which they were using was very bad. A canoe which was not fit for anyone to use. The canvas of the canoe was half ripped.\n\nNow these children were allowed to go crossing the river every day in it and very often twice one evening. The canoe was that far gone that the thwarts were just nailed on top of the gunwale.\n\nThere was not one boy big enough to have any sense.\n\nI don't know if this report was sent in yet or not, but this which I say is exactly what happened, and this is the weight which I am carrying.\n\nNow you know just the same as I do, about that which I am speaking of.\n\nI, Thomas C. Moore, of Moose Factory do hereby swear that I have a thorough knowledge of the Cree and English languages, and that I have at various times acted as interpreter, for officials of The Department of Indian Affairs, and that the above letter is a true translation of the Cree letter attached, which was written by the Chief of the Moose Band of Indians.\n\nSworn to before me this 13th day of October 1919\nat Moose Factory, in the Province of Ontario.\n\nCommissioner for taking Affidavits\nDistrict of Temiskaming\nMoose Factory Oct 13th 1919\nRefer to No 542\n\nSubject: Drowning accident at Moose Factory\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott Esq\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI recently received a visit from the Chief of the Moose Band of Indians in connection with a very sad drowning accident, which occurred during the summer at Moose Factory.\n\nHe asked my advice as to what steps he should take to bring the matter to the notice of the Department and I replied that perhaps it would be well to write to you in his own language and have a translation of the letter forwarded.\n\nHe decided to do this and the attached letter is the result. It is somewhat incoherent so I beg to supplement it with a copy of the report I sent to the Fur Trade Commissioner of The Hudson's Bay Company on the subject.\n\nIt reads as follows:\n\nSep 19th 1919\n\nI regret to have to report a very serious drowning accident in this District. It occurred on July 29th at Moose Factory. It appears that twelve of the school children from the Church of England Mission of which The Rev Haythornthwaite is in charge, were allowed to crowd into an old canoe, for the purpose of crossing to an Island to pick berries. It was high tide with quite a big sea running. When about in mid channel the canoe capsized and seven out of the twelve children were drowned. The remaining five were saved by an Indian named Archie Sailor who in a small canoe managed to pick them up. Mr Gaudet sent out his entire force of Servants with all canoes available, to search for the bodies, and by 6 p.m. on the 30th the seven bodies were recovered. Two of the boys drowned were sons of one of our Servants, Samuel Louttit who is employed at Fort George.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nDistrict Manager\nST. THOMAS' MOOSE,\n3rd January, 1920.\n\nJ. DeMcLean, Esq.\nAssistant Deputy\nDept. Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose here-with the affidavits forwarded with your letter No 306950-1, under date Sept. 16, 1919.\n\nThough there are a number of mistakes in John Carpenter's composition where the Indian idiom peeps thro', I thought that as the sense was fairly obvious it would be preferable to leave it as it is.\n\nI have taken it upon myself to fill one and have requested the Manager of Revillon Frere's Loose River Post to complete the other. Most of the other witnesses could not give a clear account of the accident and rescue in English.\n\nTrusting that these affidavits will be found correctly filled and sufficient, I have the honour to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, January 23, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 11th of September last, enclosing declaration forms to be completed and attested before a Justice of the Peace or Notary Public regarding an act of heroism, which was brought to your attention by official letter of September 6th, last. I now beg to enclose these affidavits, which were received under cover of a communication from the Rev. W. Haythornthwaite, Principal of the Moose Fort Indian Boarding School.\n\nIt is noted that these affidavits are not signed by the parties making them. As there is no Justice of the Peace or Notary Public at Moose Fort, these affidavits are taken before the District Inspector for Bevillon Freres Trading Co., Limited. Owing to the mail facilities from Moose Fort being so uncertain it would cause great delay in having these affidavits returned, and it is hoped that the Investigating Governors of the Royal Canadian Humane Association will be satisfied with the statements contained in these affidavits and that they will be able to grant some recognition to John Carpenter for his bravery in rescuing Roderic Wascowin from drowning, under the circumstances as set forth in letter above mentioned of the 6th of September.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear the decision of your association at your early convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W. Haythornwaite, who was wounded severely, ended his suffering with a bullet. According to word just received here from Rev. J. G. Anderson, bishop of the Anglican diocese of Moose Factory, on a trip to Fort Albany. Writing to his friend Bishop Anderson says the late rector died from a compound fracture of his shoulder while helping to move a piano and lay for weeks without medical attendance, the nearest doctor residing at Cochrane, 180 miles distant. While crazed with the pain in his shoulder and delirious from fever two weeks ago escaped from his Indian attendants and killed himself.\n\nRev. Haythornwaite was principal of the Indian school at Moose Factory. He was well known here where he was stationed as rector for 13 months last year. He took an active part in helping the lost American balloonists when they descended in the vicinity of Moose Factory last winter.\nOttawa, September 12, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit a report for the year 1921 on the treaty payments made to Indians of Treaty 9 residing in the James Bay District.\n\nI regret to have to report the deplorable death of Prin. Haythornswithe of the Moose Boarding School. For some time he apparently had been suffering from Dementia Praecox which possibly was intensified by an accident received on 3rd June. On June 19th he committed suicide. Fortunately Rev. Walton was there at the time. Bishop Anderson who was at Albany was summoned and was making satisfactory arrangement to have the work of the schools continued. He has placed in charge Rev. Griffin from Albany until more satisfactory arrangement can be made.\n\nIt was discovered that several of the children in the boarding school were very badly affected with T.B. and gland trouble, so a weeding out was necessary in order to prevent the spread amongst the other pupils. Dr. Day examined every pupil and as a result some action had to be taken.\n\nIn the school there were five Neepineskum orphan children. Lizzie died last winter with T.B., and three of the other children Mary, Peter and Henry have developed the disease. These children are orphans and Bishop Anderson has agreed to place these children with the grandmother and to be looked after and properly rationed until such time as they are able to return to school, on condition that the Department continues to allow the usual grant to be paid the school for them.\n\nI have authorized Bishop Anderson to send George Neepineskum to the Cochrane Hospital to have his tonsils and adenoids removed.\n\nDonald Hester aged 8 years is paralysed as result of Tubercular Spine. He is unable to walk at present is being cared for by Mrs. D. Wesley. This boy was taken from the school on 21st July. I have authorised Mrs. Wesley to take care of the child and to send in proper vouchers for same.\nI authorized Bishop Anderson to purchase a tent in which to place Chas. Carpenter another orphan boy who has been several years in the school as this boy has funds to his credit in savings. I told Bishop Anderson to submit vouchers for any expenditures made. Dr. Day states this boy cannot possibly live very long.\n\nBishop Anderson was taking necessary steps to have the Boarding School conducted according to rules. As already stated, every pupil was examined by Dr. Day and also all new applicants, a list of whom he has forwarded to the Department. The Bishop has made contracts with parents for three years as the parents would not consent to send their children if the contract was for a longer period. Bishop Anderson considers this time limit better and I acquiesce in his idea, and would suggest that he be authorized accordingly.\n\nH. N. Awrey.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 21st, 1921.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Avery, Paying Officer for Treaty 9, in a report regarding the Moose Factory School recommends that the 3 Neepinaskum orphan children who have developed tuberculosis be placed with their grandmother to be looked after and properly rationed until such time as they are able to return to the school and that the Department continue to provide the usual per capita grant for them.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say that the Department will allow of allowing the same grant for their maintenance as will be given to them while pupils of the school. The names of these children are: Mary, Peter and Henry. Their names should be included by the Principal on his regular quarterly returns. It is noted that they are being taken care of by their grandmother, but that the Department agreed to provide the regular grant for them, which is to be used towards the cost of their maintenance and care.\n\nThe action taken by Mr. Avery in authorising you to send George Neepinaskum to the Cochrane Hospital to have his adenoids and tonsils removed is approved.\n\nDonald Hester who is paralyzed as a result of a tubercular spine was placed by Mr. Avery in the care of Mrs. D. Wesley. The Department will pay for his care upon receipt of proper vouchers. Mr. Avery states that he informed Mrs. Wesley accordingly. This boy was removed from the school on the 21st of July, last.\n\nApproval is also granted for the purchase by you of a tent in which to place Charles Carpenter, another orphan boy, who has been several years in the school. You shall submit a properly receipted voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for the purpose.\n\nIt is further noticed by Mr. Avery's report that you have made contracts with the parents for the admission of their children to the Moose Factory School for a period of 3 years only, as the parents would not consent to send their children if the contract was for a longer period. Your action, under the circumstances, is approved.\n\nThe Department deeply regrets the death of the late Principal, Rev. Mr. Haythorntheite. It is understood that you have made arrangements for the carrying on of the work at this school until such time as a successor to the late Principal can be appointed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev. J. G. Anderson, D.D.,\nBishop of Moose Factory,\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 22nd September, 1921.\n\nC. A. Powis, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nRoyal Humane Association,\nHAMILTON, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to inform you of the presentation to John Carpenter of the medal so kindly donated by your Society, to him for bravery in saving from drowning an Indian, a fellow pupil of the Moose Factory Boarding School.\n\nThe presentation was made to him in the presence of Chief Wanistagoosh, his Councillors and about three hundred members of the Moose Factory Band. The Indians seemed to be greatly pleased to see the gallantry of one of their race acknowledged by your Society, and I am sure your generosity will not be forgotten, but will produce among these Indians a higher incentive to do good to others.\n\nThe Right Reverend Bishop Anderson, Reverend Mr. Walton, Dr. Day, Dr. Hughes, Mr. Neil, Men of the Hudson's Bay Company and others were present at this unique ceremony among the Northern Indians of Canada.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN Q.

J. T. Griffin has been placed, temporarily, in charge of the work at this school.

Will you kindly note this change when sending the Bonus for School Teachers, and oblige.\n\nI wish also to inform the Department that we have received further assistance by the appointment of Miss Edith Scott as Assistant Matron. Both of these workers have been sent out by the Indian & Eskimo Commission of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nObiniget\nOttawa, July 28, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the repairs stated by the principal to be necessary to the Moose Factory C. of E.

When our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, consideration will be given to the question of providing an amount for repairs to the buildings at the Moose Factory School. If our full building programme is carried out this year, there will be no funds available for unforeseen expenditures in the carrying out of repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He speaks the Ojibwa language and has had considerable experience in Indian Residential School work, having been on the staff at the Shingwauk Home and subsequently on that at the Elkhorn School, before these institutions came under the administration of our Society.

J. A. Magrath, Principal of our Society's School at Moose Fort, he informs me that there were 29 pupils in residence at the time he wrote, namely, on September 17th. The pupilage allowed at this School by your Department is only 25, but you have been good enough in the past to pay the grant for a larger attendance than this, and I am writing to ascertain if you will allow the capacity of this School to be raised from 25 as it stands at present, to 30. There is ample accommodation in the class-room, which is a separate building apart from the main school building, for 50 pupils, and as the Principal states in his letter that he can accommodate the 29 pupils in the main school building I should like to have your permission to have this number and one more if necessary, to remain in residence.\n\nWhen I visited this School last May I was requested by the Chief and Councillors to have a new school built as soon as possible which could accommodate 160 pupils. As it may not be possible to have such a building erected in the immediate future, it would afford some relief to the situation if the capacity of the existing School were increased in the way I have suggested.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW:FO\nOttawa, October 27, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to increasing the pupilage of the Moose Port Indian Residential School.

Sir:\n\nMr. Avey, of this Department, who has recently returned from his annual payments of annuities to the Indians in the James Bay district, in a report on his visit to the Moose Factory Indian Residential School, states that while in the school he found that an insane woman was being kept at the school and slept in the same apartment as the girls. The Department considers that insane Indians should not be allowed to reside in Indian residential schools owing to the danger to the young children. Mr. Avey states that he understood that steps were being taken to have this woman removed from the school, and I would point out that if this action has not already been taken it will be necessary to have the school relieved of her presence at once. In future no cases of this kind should be taken into the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Naggrah,\nMoose Port, Via Cochrane,\nOnt.\nTORONTO, August 23rd, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nIn this morning's issue of the Mail and Empire I find an article stating that Indian education costs have been re-arranged. May I know if this means any change with respect to the amount of cost which your Department will bear in connection with Indian education in Ontario. Or does the article refer to just the one situation which has been adjusted in keeping with general recent practice?\n\nFor a number of years a grant of \u00a3500.00 has been paid to the Bishop of Moosonee to assist in maintaining the Moose Fort and other schools in the James Bay district educating Indian children. Last year, Mr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, claimed that the Society was educating non-treaty Indian children at Moose Fort and in several other points in that district and pointed out that for similar work the Province of Alberta paid the Society \u00a31,000.00. The Minister authorized a grant of that amount, \u00a3600.00 of which was to be paid to the Missionary Society and \u00a3400.00 to the Bishop of Moosonee to be expended on behalf of the Indian schools under his jurisdiction.\n\nIs it possible that the Department of Indian Affairs under a recent decision may assume the cost of education of these Indian children?\n\nBestly, letter placed\n\nV.K. Greer\n\n1-1-6 Out P.O.S.\nINDIAN EDUCATION COSTS REARRANGED\n\nDominion Government Places All Bands on Common Basis.\n\nFROM T. H. BLACKLOCK,\nMail and Empire Staff Writer,\nOttawa, Aug. 15.\u2014The Dominion government will bear the whole cost of Indian education. In a recent letter to the Indian superintendent at the Six Nations Reserve, near Brantford, which was read to the council, the Indian Department announced:\n\n\"Hon. Charles Stewart has warmly supported Mr. Doucet's recommendation that all Canadian Indians be educated by the Government, and there shall be no discrimination in the treatment of Indians throughout the Dominion.\" This means that $20,000 formerly taken from the band fund of the Six Nations for educational purposes will be paid by the Government.\n\nAll the provinces of Ontario and Prairie Provinces have treaties with the Dominion Government, and under these treaties the Government has been obliged to provide Indian education. The same conditions did not apply to British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The Indians in these provinces all have funds and part of the interest from these funds has been used for Indian education. In the case of the Six Nations this amounted to about $20,000 annually, while the schools of Canada spent for the purpose from all the Indians was $85,000. The total amount spent annually by the Dominion government was approximately $1,000,000, so that the band fund contribution was a very small percentage of the whole expenditure of Indian Affairs. It was felt this forced contribution from the band funds of some tribes was the cause of the whole cost of education of others by the Government being discriminatory, and he recommended Hon. Charles Stewart Minister of Indian Affairs that the Government assume the whole cost of education for all the tribes and keep the band funds for other purposes. This Mr. Stewart agreed to do, and at the last session in the House of Commons the vote for Indian education was increased by $48,000, the amount formerly taken from the band funds for educational purposes.\nThe Love Seat\n\nPerhaps you are one of the many searching for a really comfortable piece of furniture to fit into a certain corner which is not sufficiently large for an ordinary chesterfield.

This appropriation now amounts to over two million dollars per annum. In the case of the Moose Fort Indian Residential School, we allow a per capita grant of $185 per Indian pupil per year.\n\nIn the past, however, a few Indian bands, largely in the settled portions of Ontario, have assisted from their band funds in connection with the expenses at Indian day schools and have provided tuition grants for the brighter Indians who wished to attend high schools and business colleges. This practice of allowing band funds to be used for educational purposes has now been discontinued.\n\nOur payments to the Moose Fort and other Indian residential schools remain exactly as in the past, and any assistance you are giving any Indian schools on account of the education of white or half-breed children - for whom the Department of Indian Affairs is not responsible - is a matter which, of course, rests entirely with you.\n\nWith reference to the second portion of your letter, I shall write to you in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nV.

The only school (the only school) taken notice of but Indian children. We have in this agency quite a number of children who should be attending school but there is no school for them to attend. I understand there are a number of Halfbreeds at the other posts in a similar position. I am writing in the hope that the Department might suggest something in order to give these same children at least:\n\nAwaiting your reply.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nP.H. Hamilton\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 6, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th ultimo, with reference to the education of half-breed children at Moose Factory. This is a matter that concerns the Provincial Department of Education. I believe that the Church of England officials have been in receipt of a grant from the Province towards the cost of educating children that were not wards of the Department of Indian Affairs. The usual practice is for the parents interested to form a school district and to ask the Provincial Department of Education for assistance, and, in the case of outlying districts like Moose Factory, to enlist the cooperation of a church or other interested organization.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from the Moose Fort Indian Residential School which is signed by Rev. James Blackburn as Principal. I should be grateful if you would let me know if there has been a change in the principalship at this school. If the Rev. Mr. Blackburn has been appointed, please state the date from which his appointment begins and particulars regarding his qualifications, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.

Joseph Blackburn who is filling the position of Acting Principal of the Moose Factory School, I beg to state as follows:\n\nMr. Blackburn is a graduate in Arts of Saskatchewan University, and received his theological training at Emmanuel College, Saskatoon. He was for some time Rector of St. Stephen's Parish, Winnipeg, and has held other similar positions of trust since his Ordination to the ministry of the Anglican Church. Mr. Blackburn is married but his wife will not proceed to Moose Factory before the Spring. He himself arrived at Moose Factory on the 24th of December last, having an exceedingly trying trip down the Abitibi and Moose rivers. Our Society in offering this appointment to Mr. Blackburn felt assured that they were offering it to a man of strong spiritual convictions which would enable him to encourage a high spiritual standard of living with those he came in contact with from day to day. His academic standing combined with practical common sense should fit him in a very marked degree for the Principalship of this School.\n\nI regret that through an oversight you were not notified of this appointment at an earlier date, but trust that in the light of the information set forth above, it may have your approval.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, February 18, 1930.\n\nRev.

Joseph Blackburn who is at present filling the position as acting principal of the Moose Fort Indian Residential School. The qualifications which Mr. Blackburn possesses have been noted. The Department will approve of his appointment, and it is hoped that under his management this school will meet with every success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

However, this Department does not desire that the law should be enforced in remote parts of Canada in such a way that grave hardship or starvation might result and the question of strict enforcement in the vicinity of James Bay is left to the good judgment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who are on the ground and therefore in a position to appreciate conditions.\"\n\nI may say that the Department is also writing to the R.C.M.P. in the matter. You will note that this matter will be left to the good judgment of the local Police.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOctober 3, 1930.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nDr. Hamilton, Indian Agent, reported concerning the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. He is convinced that boarding schools in this locality are not really meeting the need and he thinks that a good day school at this point is all that is required.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Moose Factory Indian Residential School, the Principal directed my attention to various requirements which should be supplied to enable him and his staff to carry on the work without unnecessary hardship, and with a fair prospect of success. I discussed these matters fully with the late Dr. Hamilton, your representative at that centre, and while we both realized the urgent necessity of keeping all expenditure at present down to the minimum, we felt that certain items were indispensable and agreed to make a strong request that they be supplied. The items required may be classified as follows:\n\n1. In connection with the Farm and Garden.\n\nTo enable the school to grow all the hay, oats, vegetables, etc., required, more land must be broken up and brought under cultivation. The school management will look after this, and I ordered timothy and alsike seed at Cochrane, and sent it forward, along with turnip seed and mangel-wurzel.\n\n2. In connection with the buildings.\n\nThe buildings should be replaced by new ones at the earliest date possible. Until they are replaced, they must be made to serve the purpose for which they exist. The hospital building which is about to be used as a Principal's residence required painting inside, and I had a good deal of this done at the time of my visit. New doors are required and I am asking our Commission to supply them. In addition to these requirements a special\ngrant of $150.00 has already been made available to provide some of the essential furnishings.\n\nA certain amount of lumber is required also (a) to put a new roof on the work-shop (the present roof is more like the proverbial sieve than any other I have seen) (b) to make part of the store-room rat and mouse proof, and (c) to cover the log walls of the new barn. I understood that approximately 75,000 feet of rough lumber was for sale at the Moose River Crossing, about 46 miles away, and Dr. Hamilton undertook to secure the price of this and to advise the Principal accordingly. If the price is reasonable the school management would endeavour to raft it to the school free of cost. Our Commission will undertake to meet the expenditures referred to under these two classifications, but they are obliged to ask your Department to meet the expenditure for the following:\n\nPaints\n\nFor class-room roof - 25 gals. black roof paint,\nFor main school building - 85 gals. black roof paint\nFor barn - 30 gals. red barn paint\n\u00bd doz. 2\" paint brushes.\n\nalso to meet the expenditure for\n\n3. Manual Training Equipment.\n\n1 doz. #1 medium sandpaper\n1 pkt. Assortment sandpaper\n1 Edgerite iron plane\n1 Hammer\n10 Coping saws\n7 doz. \" blades.\n\n4. Office Equipment.\n\n\u00bd doz. Triumph files\n2 only Reliance mucilage\n2 bxo Paper clips\n1 only Date-stamp\n4 doz. Brt Clips 3\"\n2 bxo Rubber bands, assorted\n1 doz. Filing folders, business letter size\n2 only Typewriter ribbons for Underwood Machine, black.\nLiquid glue, 2 bottles.\n5. 31 Mattresses for children's beds, 29\" wide.\n\nI trust that your Department may, despite the prevailing financial stringency, and from which our Society is not exempt, be able to supply the items mentioned, and forward the same by the Hudson's Bay Company's steamer due to leave Montreal early in July.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, June 8, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, relative to the various requirements, which you request be supplied the Principal of the Moose Factory Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the farm and garden, it is noted that the school management will arrange to have more land broken up and brought under cultivation, also that you have ordered a quantity of seed and sent it forward. With reference to the building, it is noted that arrangements have been made to acquire a certain amount of lumber for repairs.\n\nI regret that our funds for the present fiscal year are so limited, that it will not be possible to supply the quantity of paint or the mattresses asked for. Our Estimates were considerably reduced, and only the most urgent repairs, etc., can be authorized at any of the Indian schools this year.\n\nRelative to the office equipment asked for, I have to say that a requisition is being forwarded to the Government Stationery office here to send to the Principal, via Coral Rapids, Ont., the supplies considered necessary. The Principal of the school will be advised accordingly.\n\nRegarding the manual training equipment asked for, I shall be pleased if you will arrange for\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n59-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nthe purchase and forwarding of the following:\n\n1 box. #1 medium sandpaper,\n1 pint. Assortment sandpaper,\n1 Edgarite iron plane,\n1 Hammer,\n1 Coping saws,\n5 tons. \" saw blades.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in duplicate, covering this purchase. This account you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Commission have received a strong and urgent request from the Principal of their School at Moose Factory, to have the official pupilage increased from 30 to 40. When school reopened after the summer holidays the Principal was obliged to refuse admission to over 25 pupils in order that the enrolment might not exceed the official number sanctioned. As he and his family have now taken up residence in the building once used as a hospital, space is available in the main school building for the additional pupilage requested, and our Commission will be obliged if your Department will kindly authorize the same. The Principal states that he has taken up the question of the increased pupilage, with Dr. Tryer, the Indian Agent, and also with Mr. Awrey the Treaty Pay Master, and as both of these representatives of your Department have recognized the urgency of the need, our Commission see no valid reason why it should not be granted.\n\nWhile writing on this subject I desire to express the strong hope which is entertained by our Society that the Residential School building which was built by our Church at this centre over twenty-five years ago, will be superseded by a fully modern structure, with a capacity of not less than one hundred pupils, during the ensuing fiscal year. As you are no doubt aware, our Church's evangelistic and educational work at Moose Factory began in the year 1861, and has been carried on at an immense cost of life and money ever since, and not without highly encouraging and creditable results. As Indian parents at Rupert House and Albany, in addition to those in the Moose River district are keenly desirous of having their children educated at our Moose Factory School, and the present building cannot accommodate them, you will understand the necessity of having a new and larger building provided at the earliest date possible. With the completion of the T. & N. O. Railway to Moose Factory, the cost of forwarding building material will be greatly reduced, and I most\nsincerely trust that nothing may be allowed to prevent your Department from providing our Society next year with the new building requested, in addition to a new building to replace the existing Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 13, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to increasing the pupilage at the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. Before arranging for additional pupilage for the coming fiscal year, it will be necessary for the Department to have a rough sketch of the total dormitory accommodation, with three dimensions in the case of each room. The Principal's sketch should show what dormitory accommodation has been used in the past and what it is proposed to add if the extra pupilage is allowed.\n\nYour representations concerning the need for a new building at this institution have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. O.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th ultimo, number 44-6-1, in which you request a rough sketch of the total dormitory accommodation at our Loose Factory School, with three dimensions in the case of each room, I beg to state that I applied to the Rev. J. Blackburn, Principal of this school on Nov. 17th, for this information, and have just received his reply.\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find the sketch requested with the three dimensions of the room given thereon. You will please note that the sketch is certified correct by the Principal and endorsed by the local Indian Agent. As there appears to be ample accommodation for the additional pupilage requested, I trust that your Department may sanction the same and notify me accordingly.\n\nWishing you, Sir, the compliments of the Season,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 23, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a rough sketch showing the size of the dormitory accommodation at the Moose Factory Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is noted from the measurements of the sketch submitted that there is accommodation for 37 pupils. The Department will allow a per capita grant for this number as from April 1, 1932, provided the extra room is equipped and proper ventilation provided. I have to request that you will inform the Principal accordingly, and he may recruit up to the number for which the per capita grant will be allowed as from the date mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

I shall be obliged if you will let me know if your Department will supply this equipment direct from Ottawa, or authorize me to do so, and send the bills to you for payment. Suitable beds with mattresses and pillows can be secured in Winnipeg for approximately $59.50. To this would have to be added the cost of freight from Winnipeg to Moose Factory. As I understand there is only a monthly train service to Moose Factory at present, I shall be glad to have your decision at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, February 12, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Moose Factory Indian Day School to be supplied with 7 beds, with mattresses, pillows and bedding, to provide dormitory equipment for the extra number of pupils for which per capita grant will be allowed as from April 1st, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of seven (7) institution beds of the sizes required, complete with springs, mattresses and pillows. You should obtain prices from Simmons Limited and the Parkhill Bedding Company, in Winnipeg, and place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price. The beds should be shipped to the school via the T. & N.O. Railway to Moose Factory. After the purchase has been made, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. If you prepay the freight charges, you should obtain a receipt covering the amount, and you should forward same to the Department, when reimbursement will be made.\n\nThe Department is not prepared at the present time to supply any bedding material, such as blankets, sheets, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He replied, stating that he had been on the permanent staff since October 20th, last.\n\nI should be grateful if you would advise the Department when Mr. Thompson was appointed principal and also supply full particulars regarding his qualifications.\n\nIt is considered that the Department should have been previously notified concerning the change in principal at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Gilbert Thompson to the Acting Principalship of the Moose Factory School from the 20th of October last. At the moment, I find it quite impossible to explain how this matter was overlooked, and I am now taking the first opportunity I have had since my attention was directed to the oversight, to remedy the same.\n\nMr. Thompson is a graduate in Arts of the Western University, London, Ont., and a graduate of Huron College in the same city, in Theology. Before proceeding to Moose Factory, he was filling the position of Chaplain on our hospital ship the \"Columbia\", which operates along the southern part of the B.C. Coast, and around Vancouver Island. Mr. Thompson is 30 years of age, and appears to our Commission to possess in a very high degree, the qualifications necessary to fill successfully the Principalship of an Indian Residential School.

During his absence from the School Mr. Wilson, the Farm Instructor, has been placed in charge. We sincerely hope and pray that Mr. Thompson's operation may be completely successful, and that he may be able to resume his duties towards the end of the current month of May.\n\nJust before leaving the school for the hospital, he advised our Commission that four girls will be graduating this summer, and asked that they be provided with Prayer Books and Bibles. When making this request, he appears to have overlooked the instruction issued to our Principals to make application to your Department direct for the Books in question. On account of his present condition, the matter is not being referred back to him and it will be appreciated by our Commission if you will forward four Prayer Books and four Bibles, addressed to him at the Moose Factory School.\n\nThanking you in advance for your kindly help in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department regrets to learn from your letter of the 11th instant of the illness of Rev.

Subsequent trains leave Moosonee August 5th and 19th. One or other of these latter dates will probably suit your proposed visit with Dr. Tyer to the Eastern Coast of the Bay.\n\nI am having the Aladdin Construction Company working out the plans and cost of the proposed Preventorium and should the cost be within our present means, will write to you and Dr. Stone further in the near future.\n\nPlease accept this expression of my appreciation of your sympathetic interest in, and support of, our plans for placing a worthy and complete equipment at the historic post of Moose Fort, or Factory, whichever the correct title may be.

Williams, Esq.,\nAccountant,\nMissionary Society of\nthe Church of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI was very glad to have the opportunity of making your acquaintance and discussing the matters which are of our mutual concern.\n\nMy visit to the school at Moose Factory was necessarily short, but I was much impressed by the efficient manner in which this institution appears to be operated. We have started the school year with a complete staff with the one exception of the Head Matron, and we are hoping to hear from a former worker that she is willing to take up this position.\n\nI found the Principal much concerned by reason of the failure of a number of the pupils to return to the school after the summer holidays. From letters he has received from parents and from our missionaries at various places on Hudson Bay, it appears clear that some adverse influence has been at work. While letters of parents were often vague and spoke of \"not sending back the children this year\", the missionaries had written that various criticisms of the school had been circulated and several serious charges which on investigation were found to have no foundation whatever. As the last boat has now come from points to the north, there would seem to be nothing to be done now, but the Principal is concerned about the number of children of school age at Moose Factory who are out of school. In view of his very small enrollment this year he wondered if the Department could not write the Agent to exert some pressure in regard to some of these cases. Dr. Orford has apparently advised the parents that the children should be in school, but does not appear to have been able to exert any pressure. If you can do anything to influence this situation we shall indeed be grateful. I may say that I had a long conference with the Chief and some of the\nIndian Affairs Branch - 2.\n\nSeptember 30, 1943.\n\nCouncillors who expressed themselves as very pleased with the management of the school, and I urged the Chief to use his influence towards the desired result of having all the children in school who should be there.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\n\nSecretary.\n\nHAA:A.\nOttawa, October 5, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th ultimo, in which you refer to the difficulty experienced by the Principal of the Moose Fort Residential School in securing his full quota of pupils for the present academic year.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that I am today communicating with the Indian Agent in respect to this matter. It is my earnest hope that the agent, by working in close co-operation with the Principal of the School, will be able to substantially increase the enrolment in the course of a few weeks. I have noted, with interest, your reference to certain criticisms of the school, that appear to have been circulated in the district. These criticisms, as you may readily suppose, arise from time to time and usually stand rectifying. In the case of the Moose Fort School, however, I am disposed to think that better economic conditions and the measure of prosperity that Indian families are now enjoying may be mainly responsible for the poor attendance at the school. In any event, I feel confident that the agent will do all he possibly can to persuade the parents to send their children to the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. A. Alderwood, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House,\n156 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, October 5, 1943.\n\nDear Doctor Orford:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by this Branch from Dr. R. A. Alderwood. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIn view of the acute shortage of teachers existing throughout the Dominion and the difficulty experienced by the church authorities in securing the staff necessary to operate our schools in this crisis, it is of the utmost importance that everything humanly possible should be done to persuade Indian parents to send their children to school.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if you would discuss this matter with the Principal of the Moose Fort School and, with him, reach a decision with respect to the best ways and means of increasing the present enrolment. In my reply to Dr. Alderwood I have stated that while adverse criticisms of the school itself in the district may retard recruiting, it is my opinion that the measure of prosperity the Indians are now enjoying may be in the main responsible for their tendency to keep children at home. You might, at your convenience, let us have any comments you may care to send forward with respect to the local situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. R. A. Hoey.\n\nRe: Pupils for Moose Fort Residential School. Your file 44-6-1.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have to thank you for your kind letter of October 5th, and for your action in enlisting the effort of the Indian Agent in this connection. I think it is fair to assume that improved economic conditions among the Indians is tending to lower pupilage in many cases, but we shall all do our best to see that as many children as possible continue their education.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa,\n\nRef File 44-6-1 - Letter of October 8th., 1943.\n\nI have read the copy of the letter you received from H.A. Alderwood, Secretary of Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Church of England.\n\nI feel certain that there is no adverse influence at work anywhere in James Bay towards keeping children out of school. If anything, the reverse holds true.\n\nThe school at Moose Factory draws its children from Albany on the west coast and from the east coast as far north as Factory River. Due to the unfortunate loss of the school at Fort George during the past year a number of children at Fort George, East Main and Factory River were unable to return this year and during my visit to these posts I attempted to convince the parents to send their children to Moose Factory at least until such time as the Fort George school is rebuilt. The answer in practically all cases was that they did not wish to send their children so far away and that - \"the children at Moose Factory learned bad language.\"\n\nUndoubtedly the fact that the Indians along this coast are comparatively well off at the present time does have some influence on their keeping their children at home, because many of them send their children to school not because they expect them to learn anything but because they are better fed and better clothed than they themselves can ordinarily look after them.\n\nHowever, I think the best answer to Mr. Alderwood's remarks lies in the record of school attendance this year for the Moose band children. More of them are attending residential school than at any other time.\n\n(over)\nMr. Alderwood appears to consider that I have not been able to exert any pressure on parents to make them send their children to school. I think the Moose band attendance is sufficient answer to that and it stands to reason that when I see other bands only for a few days each year it is impossible to do other than to attempt to influence them by conversation. However perhaps you will recall on two or three occasions during the past term when children were either taken from school by their parents or did not return after holidays, I asked for advice from the Department as to the manner in which these children could be made to return for their education according to the Indian Act and the laws of the Province. The reply was to approve of their discharge.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. L. Offord\nOttawa, Nov. 29, 1946.\n\nReport on partial inspection of James Bay Agency\n\nAttawapiskat\n\nIn this report I have not commented on the need for local nursing stations nor on educational facilities, nor have I mentioned a lengthy visit and interviews at both residential schools.

Hoey,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has seemed best that the Rev. Gilbert Thompson, who for the past ten years has been Principal of the Indian Residential School at Moose Factory, be transferred to one of the other schools. Just which one has not been decided as yet.\n\nI am writing, therefore, to ask that the Rev. H. G. Cook, B.A., now at South Porcupine, Ontario, be appointed as his successor. Mr. Cook is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario. He has served for eight years among the Indians at Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River. He is temporarily stationed at South Porcupine pending his appointment to Indian work for which he has expressed preference. We have confidence in his ability and have reason to think that he will prove acceptable as Principal at Moose Factory. I write therefore to recommend that he be appointed Principal as from June 1st, 1945.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nL. A. Dixon\n\nLAD K3\nOttawa, May 11, 1945.\n\nDr. T. J. Orford, Indian Agent,\nMoose Factory, via Moosonee, Ont.\n\nI am advised by the Reverend Canon L.A. Dixon, General Secretary of the M.S.C.C., that it has been decided to transfer Reverend Gilbert Thompson from the Moose Fort School. On the nomination of the M.S.C.C., the Department has approved the appointment of Rev. H. G. Cook as Principal of this school, effective June 1, 1945. Mr. Cook is a graduate of the University of Western Ontario. He has served for eight years among the Indians of Fort Simpson, on the Mackenzie River.

Cook,\nPrincipal\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nRe: Family Allowances\n\nHerewith report on recent visit to some of our Northern Agencies in Quebec and Ontario.\n\nJames Bay Agency -\n\nDr. Orford, Indian Agent, is handling all the registration personally, coincident with his Treaty Payment Trips.\n\nThis Agency has a population of roughly 600 families. Registration has been completed for the Moose and Albany Bands, which represent about 25%. The originals of these forms have been despatched to the Regional Director in Toronto. The balance of registration is expected to be completed by the 15th of October.\n\nAll families in this Agency will receive their allowances in kind (Category B). Sub-registrars have been appointed and vouchers will be distributed as follows:\n\nH.B. Co., Albany - monthly\nH.B. Co., Attawapiskat - mostly monthly\nH.B. Co., Nemaska - twice yearly\nH.B. Co., East Main and Factory River - monthly\nH.B. Co., Great Whale River - 2 or 3 times yearly\nH.B. Co., Fort George - annually for inlanders (approx. 50%)\nH.B. Co., 6 times yearly (Coastal Indians)\nMoose Factory, Moosonee, and Rupert's House - by Agent Orford monthly.\n\nIt is intended also to appoint sub-registrars of independent traders - Attawapiskat - Albany - Fort George - and Factory River. It will be seen by the above that Dr. Orford intends to issue personally from him his office as many vouchers as possible, and at the same time appoint quite a few sub-registrars. He intends to experiment during the Winter with other methods of distribution.\n\nDr. Orford is satisfied that traders are pretty well stocked with our list of preferred foods. The writer had the opportunity of meeting Mr. Cowan of Winnipeg, James Bay District Manager of the Hudson Bay Company. He assured me that every effort was being made to stock all Hudson Bay Trading Posts with the food and clothing that we specified. He further stated that with the exception of woollen underwear he did not anticipate any trouble in having sufficient stocks of everything at all of their posts.\n\nMr. Cowan stated that instructions had gone out to all of his traders, that no substitutions were to be allowed unless first approved by the Indian Agent. In our conversation I could not help but be impressed.\nwith Mr. Cowan's desire to cooperate with the Indian Affairs Branch to the fullest extent in the administration of the Family Allowances Act. The local Hudson Bay posts at Moose Factory in charge of Factor Dunlop appear to have generous stock of various articles.\n\nI took the opportunity of spending some time going through the Moose Factory Residential School, Mr. Cook, principal. This school appeared neat and tidy with a summer carry-over of 11 pupils. Some of these pupils would be returning home when contact could be made with their parents. The principal and Dr. Orford were asked to send to the Regional Director in Toronto, a list of all pupils that would not be returning to their parents for the summer holidays.\n\nThe writer took the occasion to inspect practically every Indian tent on the Island. I was agreeably surprised at their cleanliness which speaks well for Dr. Orford and the Public Health Nurse.\n\nIn general, this agency appears to be fairly well in hand so far as Family Allowances are concerned. Dr. Orford's registration forms have been carefully completed and checked, and I feel that it would be a matter of gratification to the Regional Director in Toronto, (W.J. Jackson).\n\nH.M.

Then too we find it hard to supervise their play at this time of the year and hope you can see your way clear to grant the above mentioned concession.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, Horden School\nOttawa, April 10th, 1947.\n\nT.J.

This took place over a six-week period to the pupils of the school by the General Officer or, for developments, I.D. The boys left the school (for one week) Friday morning and returned Sunday noon. While absent from the school they were under the direct supervision of their instructors. Food and shelter was supplied by the school and the other equipment by the local Indian Office.\n\nThe boys attended to duties in the bush during the quarter:\n\n- Peter Thompson\n- Joseph Johnson\n- Lawrence\n- James Johnson\n- William Johnson\n- Billy Johnson\n- John Johnson\n- Robert Johnson\n\n---\n\n**Average number of days pupils in residence during Quarter**\n\n- Total: 403\n\n**Average attendance of pupils during Quarter**\n\n- Total: 638\n\n---\n\n**Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of columns.**\n\n**Total:** 403\n\n---\n\n**Signature**\n\n[Signature]\n\n---\n\n**Public Archives Canada**\n| Name               | Age | Sex | School |\n|--------------------|-----|-----|--------|\n| Mary Ann Mark      | 8   | g   | Goose  |\n| Annie Diamond      | 9   | g   | Rupert's H. 1 |\n| Marion Katapeltuk  | 9   | g   | Rupert's H. 1 |\n| Winnie Jacob       | 9   | g   | Rupert's H. 1 |\n| Emily Jacob        | 8   | g   | Rupert's H. 1 |\n| Marion Morwood     | 9   | g   | Rupert's H. 2 |\n| Lottie Sutherland  | 13  | g   | Albany  |\n| Iza Chozen         | 12  | g   | E.

General:\n\nA requisition has come in from the Moose Fort Boarding School for twenty-five single iron beds, which are said to be urgently required. The Department is under no obligation to supply these beds, but as the per capita grant for the school, which is in such an out-of-the-way place, is small it is for you to say whether you will allow them anything to assist them in providing these beds, and, if so, how much.\n\nThe number of pupils provided for is 25 at a per capita grant of $72.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nHarley Ross\nOttawa, January 26, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of an application from the Principal of the Moose Factory Boarding School for a grant to purchase twenty-five single iron beds, and it would like to have a report from you on this application, in which you should state what accommodation in the way of beds they have at present and the need, if any, for the number now asked for.\n\nI may add that the number of pupils provided for at this school is twenty-five.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.G.

There was consequently some time before the school was able to make any substantial progress.\n\nThere was some question raised about the suitability of the school for some time now. Before undertaking the purchase of any more land, it seems to me more advisable to see what can be done with the present land.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.J. Ramsden\nOttawa, February 8, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a requisition for twenty-five iron beds for the Moose Factory Boarding School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no funds available for this purpose at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Ernest O. Duke,\nPrincipal,\nMoose Factory Boarding School,\nMoose Factory,\nOnt.,\nvia McDougall's Chutes, Ont.\nOttawa Sept 8th 1909\n\nIn reference to my inspection of Moose Factory Boarding School and the request for 25 beds, I have to report as follows: there are 13 single home made beds (camp bed style) for girls good condition; 6 double beds for boys good condition; 1 single iron bed good condition.\n\nThe management has been arranging the accommodation which seems to be for (8) eight more children. I would therefore recommend 8 more iron beds for these additional pupils.\n\nI see no necessity of replacing old ones while in present condition. I do see some objection to the double bed system, but as the institution is not likely to be filled at the time the new beds can be utilized in place of the double ones.\n\nTREATY 9\n\nJ. E.

Office\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAs President of\nthe Indian & Church\nSchool Board here, I beg to\nreport to your Department\nof some profound changes\nwhich we deem it wise in\nthe interests of the Work to make.\n\nWe have a fine large attic,\nin the construction of the building\nleft unfinished and unused.\nproposed plan for the proposed additions can be made at a cost of one hundred and seventy-five dollars. The labor required is $3500 (\u00a3175) by Mr. Duke.\n\nI trust that you may see fit to favor our project.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nO. Duke\n\nEndorsed: [Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOur first proposal is to convert the attic into a properly equipped store-room with a stairway leading from the second floor. By so doing the convenience of carrying on the work would be in many ways increased and the first problem of keeping the children's clothing separate would then be solved. The room which now answers the purpose of a Clothes Store-Room could then be converted into a Children's Bed Room; thus our capacity would be increased from twenty-five to thirty, an increase of five.\nTelkwa, Alta.\nNov. 10th\n\nFrank Redden, Esq.,\nSupt. Dept. of Indian Affairs\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you a communication from the Principal of the Moose Fort Boarding School which I endorse. I mentioned the subject referred to in this letter to Mr. Scott in a personal interview last month. I believe Mr. Macdonald has also mentioned the matter in his report.\n\nThe above Communication...\nHas been much delayed in transit.\n\nI am sending a separate cover a full report of the year will by Mr. Burke.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Macdonald\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, November 16, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 10th inst., inclosing a communication from the Principal of the Moose Factory Boarding School, in which he asks for a grant to enable him to fit up the attic in the building as a store-room and convert the present store-room into a dormitory, the estimated cost of which is $123.50 for material and $50.00 for labour.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay for the material needed to the extent above mentioned, $123.50, upon receipt of duly certified accounts, stating shewing the amount of lumber purchased with prices. In giving assistance of this kind it is the policy of the Department to require the schools to perform the necessary labour, and no grant can be made for this in the present instance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRight Rev. J.G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nSelkirk, Man.,\nSecretary.\nSelkirk, Man.\nDec. 1st, 1905\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter of Nov. 16th ult., and most thank you for the offer of $125.00 covering the cost of material required for the attic alteration at the Moose Fort Boarding School. But I must also say that I cannot understand the policy of the Dept. in refusing to pay for the cost of labour. I do not think that this is the policy of the Gov't regarding their public buildings in the Dominion. We are trying to do for the Indians what the world with much hardship, whatever that is clearly the duty of the Gov't. Government.\n\nWe are only getting a per capita grant of $60 per annum, while, I have been told, other schools in Saskatchewan & the West are getting as much as $125. I venture to say that the cost of living at Moose Fort is much higher than any place in Saskatchewan or Alberta or Qu'Appelle. From facts which I have examined recently, I find that the Moose Ft. School cost $3700 last year, exclusive of much help from the Canadian Women's Auxiliary in clothing, house linen etc. and also from the Missionary Ladies' Assoc. in England. Do let\npractically the Diocese has to provide $2000 over + above the Board grant. I am in all fairness, do this right? I consider that we have at least every reason for getting as large a grant as the Western Schools. The same arguments are applicable to the Chapleau School. Though the cost of living is not quite so high at Chapleau, still $60 per capita grant falls a long way below our expenses.\n\nI trust that your Department will give these matters their best consideration, and I am sure they will see the justice of our claims. We do not want the trouble to make any demands, but the struggle to maintain an school in these places is difficult, and I do not think that we are going beyond what we are justly entitled to in making a request for some assistance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nActing Deputy Indian Affairs\n\nJohn F. Macdonald\nOttawa, December 7th, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the last instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department in making a grant only for the material required for alterations at the Moose Factory Boarding School is carrying out the policy invariably followed in giving such assistance to schools which are not the property of the Department. The Moose Factory School, which is the property of the Church of England, cannot be regarded as a public building in the sense referred to by Your Lordship.\n\nIn reference to the per capita grant I have to inform you that $72.00 has been paid since the April 1st, 1907. This is $16.00 more than is paid the Chapleau School, and, with one single exception, as high a grant as is paid to any boarding school in the Western Provinces. In view of the foregoing the Department considers that in offering to assume the cost for all the material necessary to make the changes asked for by the Principal it acted liberally towards this school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev.

B.

A Combined Sinker and Planter, which we can obtain from Steel Bros. Co., for $50.00. I suppose Messrs. Harris & Co. could also supply the machine. This would be effectual in the Potato Field Garden.\n\n2. A Cultivator or Plow, which J. Eaton & Co., Toronto, advertise at $45.00 Complete. The depth of wood is very expensive. We have to cut it a mile or so above Morse Park, using wood on the Island, they since having returned, will be able to do the work other wise it would be too costly.\n\n3. A one-tonne hay mower, which Messrs. Harris & Co., Toronto, have offered to supply us with, for $40.00. The Hay Mower is $5.00. The Hay supply is another thing which has been very costly here, as we have been dependent on the N.B.C. for their own, but now we are able to get it up the Island in boat. Before this year we used to send our cows to Ross's field on our property. We intend to build a shelter for the school apart from the main building, where the cows will be fed clean from our own pasture.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn F. Woodside\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Address: All Hall Rd., will be No. Principal O'Hara, Macdonald College, Toronto]\nto clear more land for this purpose, and believe\nthat we can raise almost sufficient for our own\nneeds. In fact last summer we were able to get\nnearly half of the produce needed at home, but we\nhad to get the N.W.C. to cut it for us with their\nscissors which meant the loss of time & man as\nwell. But having our own horses, we could cut\n& dry ourselves at the proper time, so we have one\nmore of our own.\n\n4. We must increase our live stock, both Cows,\nfor obvious reasons. A special reason at Moose is\nthat we have written we cannot get a supply of\nfresh meat. Our season we may be able (not all we\nneed), the next year at all, as happened last winter,\nbeing entirely on canned meat & not from anywhere,\n& particular need for Indian children. We've had,\nsay four or five, we would soon be able to kill an\nanimal or two every winter. As it is, we only have\none Cow & calf and no horse. We would like to\nadd two cows this year.\n\nCan the Department help us to get this important\nneed supplied? Mr. Wilson Ross will transport them\n& horses. He needs I can send down with seed by\nthe first canoe down from Cochrane. You can understand\nwhat an education the use of these machines will be for\nthe pupils of the school after June 1st in view of saving\nexpenses. We'll be glad to hear from you at your earliest\nconvenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Postscript]\nTo Secretary Dept.

The Principal has bravely gone ahead and with the help of the J. & Co. and Revillon Bros. has secured lots and lumber and a new building is now well on its way. The companies mentioned have kindly advanced lumber and supplies & will give us some time to make payment. However, they will not help us much in replacing all our losses, though relieving us for the present.\n\nWhat can you do for us?

I find that the rough charges for the school building are very heavy, but they are necessary for the future. These charges are for the school building, including land and other emergency needs of the school. Besides, we need a new school building in order to meet the needs of the students.\n\nThe government has approved a grant in view of the special case, and I am sure that the school will be able to meet the needs of the students.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nJohn G. Anderson\nMarch 6th, 1915.\n\nMy dear Bishop Anderson,\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, in reference to freight charges on articles sent into Moose Factory by the Woman's Auxiliary, with a request that the Department refund the expenditure incurred. If Your Lordship will send in these receipted accounts, I shall be pleased to give consideration to the matter of payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev. J.G.

I also sent an receipt for W.A. freight in basis for 1913, as for some reason, steamer fires did not send in a statement of accounts for that year, but included it in their statement for 1914. Miss Nelson promised to forward these receipts to the Dept. of Finance and recording the facts. As I have had no advice from the Royal Trust Company, Moosonee, of the payment of these amounts, and as our pressing needs are calling for money, I am wondering what is the cause of delay and shall be glad to hear from you what the steamer fires have replied to the Department.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDiocese of Moosonee\nSeptember 2nd, 1915.\n\nMy dear Bishop Anderson -\n\nI have Your Lordship's communication of the 30th ultimo, in reference to freight charges on articles sent into Moose Factory by the Woman's Auxiliary.\n\nI find that on the 27th ultimo we received from Miss Nelson freight receipts for bales sent to Indian schools to the extent of $535.54, for which a cheque was sent her on the 31st ultimo. Among these I find, in addition to some small items, charges on bales to Moose Port in 1913, $125.00; charges on bales to Moose Port in 1914, $261.64; and charges on special furnishings for this school in 1914, $125.71.

I enclose the following statement which I have just received from Rev. W. Hay, Superintendent, missionary at that place.\n\nThe work of rebuilding has been slow as some of the materials were missing and others missing. We had the advice from Toronto, we have now come to a standstill and cannot proceed with the rebuilding due to shortage of funds.\n\nI would be grateful therefore if the Department will decide to increase the amount to plant two trees at the cost and issue the necessary cheque. You will understand, I am sure, that the cost of the inevitable upkeep of maintenance and a total loss of funds is not evident. I know that you will do your best in no matter the circumstances. Sincerely yours \u2014 John G. Moosonee\nMarch 23rd, 1916.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson -\n\nI have your Lordship's letter of the 20th instant, with enclosure showing expenditure to date in connection with the rebuilding of the Moosonee Port Boarding School.\n\nAlthough our funds for the coming year will be extremely limited I hope to be able to do something to help you. It will be necessary, however, to have pro or vouchers to present to the Auditor; these should be in detail, and in the case of labour should show the number of men employed and the rates of wages paid, and for material, quantities and prices.\n\nI would ask your Lordship to be kind enough to obtain these at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

I have now gone over these accounts and made a special school account for the materials used and labour employed and have given them exactly as they appear in the several accounts of Revillon Freres and Hudsons Bay Companies. I have also had these checked by the Post Managers and signed.\n\nYou will notice that the total is more than the last account I rendered as I have brought them up to the date of this letter.\n\nIt will hardly be necessary for me to remind your Lordship that we shall yet need about $1,500 (Fifteen hundred dollars) to complete the work when the money is available.\n\nYOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT\n\n[Signature]\nTOTAL COST OF REBUILDING MOOSE FORT BOARDING SCHOOL MARCH, 1914 TO MAY 1916.\n\nHudson Bay Company's Account $1,210.92\nRevillon Freres 869.77\nMetallic Roofing Company's 136.43\n\nT.

They had all the let parts unpaid which were broken & have them ready for the seats. I hope therefore that the Dept will have them sent next spring. (To Miss)\n\nRevillon's Montreal Allouez Missionary in Charge\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Griffin\nOttawa, Nov. 7, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th ultimo, regarding your requisition to be supplied with the wooden portion for the seats of 13 new desks furnished to the Moose Fort Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the desks supplied were those known as the \"Snider\" school desk and were purchased from Goodwin's Limited, Montreal, in the summer of 1914. The firm which manufactured them have retired from business and it is impossible to get parts for the Snider desk.\n\nIt is considered that a carpenter could make the wooden seats and have them screwed to the metal part of the desk. If necessary, the Department would pay the expenses in having this work done, providing properly certified accounts covering the cost of the material and labour is received. The account for labour should show the number of hours or days the carpenter is employed, and should be receipted by him. The account for any material bought for the purpose should also be receipted by the person from whom the purchase is made.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to arrange to have the seats for the desks made, as it will be impossible for us to obtain them and have them forwarded to the school.\n\nWhen these desks were shipped by Havillon Freres' boat in 1914, all parts securely packed were delivered at their warehouse in Montreal, and your letter is the first intimation we have received that all the parts did not reach Moose Fort.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As a labour saving device of this sort will be of very great assistance to the staff at the school in question, I should be obliged if you will forward same, or authorise me to do so, and send the bill to you for payment.

They turn that they are to the animals, and both hens and the eggs given to the animals, and from the litter trodden under their feet the manure residues are preserved and utilized to the fullest extent.\n\nT. B. G.\n\nHALF-HOLIDAY ORDER\n\nA meeting of the Agricultural Wages Board was held on Thursday in London, Sir Alfred Wollaston presiding. It was decided, as the period for holding objections to the Board's proposal to define the working day of all persons engaged in the services of 48 hours on a Saturday or on such other day (not being Sunday) in every week as may be agreed between the employer and employee, has expired, to make an Order on the basis of their proposal, subject to certain modifications in regard to time spent by horsemen, ploughmen, shepherds, team men, and other classes engaged in the care and cleansing of stock. The full terms of the Order, which will come into operation on March 1, will be published in due course.\n\nHastings was visited by representatives of both workers and employers to the death of Mr. Joseph Arch, and the Board decided to forward to Mr. Arch's family a copy of these resolutions expressing sympathy and to place on record their high appreciation of the work of Mr. Arch on behalf of the agricultural labourer.\n\nAt a meeting of the Grimsby Branch of the Lincolnshire Farmers' Union the following resolution was carried:\n\nThat this meeting of the Grimsby Branch of the Lincolnshire Farmers' Unions considers that the proposal made by the Wages Board to introduce a compulsory half-holiday is one which requires very careful consideration. We believe farmers should be allowed a half-holiday to agricultural labourers in the summer months, when the days are long and the weather hot, so that they may have leisure time in their gardens or in recreation, and when the stock are out at grass and do not require much attention.\n\nA Potato Dredger (see above).\nA NEW VIBRATORY POTATO SORTER\n\nA new machine of a simple and easily worked type, with large capacity, has recently been designed by Mr. J. C. Powell. This is an automatic potato-sorting machine, using the necessary vibratory motion imparted by a set of spiral springs. The weight of the potatoes coming down the chute causes the screen to vibrate on these spiral springs, and thus separate the tubers into three grades. It appears that automatic vibratory action can be assisted by hand or foot.\n\nThe capacity of the apparatus is four tons per minute. Mr. Clarke, Trumps Green Farm, Virginia Water, says that one of his men can easily grade about two tons per day with the appliance, which works so easily that he thinks a girl should obtain as good results. He says that the grading done could not be better.\n\nThis machine is made in various forms and sizes to suit the requirements of farmers who want to keep their potatoes clean and free from dirt. The largest can be fitted in a shed or barn, and is capable of taking the load from a cart and grading it at once. A medium size is well adapted for use in the field, grading potatoes as they are collected. A small potato-grader is made in wood or wicker for grading fruit. The work is in full charge of the attendant, who is therefore able to pick and sort other vegetables. Miller, Webb and Co., 25, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C. 2, have these graders in stock.\n\nPROPOSED M.F.A. AND CHAMBER OF AGRICULTURE AMALGAMATION IN STAFFORDSHIRE\n\nAt a meeting of the Staffordshire Chamber of Agriculture on Saturday week the question of the amalgamation with the National Farmers' Union was discussed.\n\nMr. T. Foster proposed the formation of an association to represent the interests of the National Farmers' Union and the Staffordshire Chamber of Agriculture. He said that the amalgamation would enable them to do more effective work in the interests of agriculture. The Chambers of Agriculture alone were not able to make the same demands as the National Farmers' Union, and in consequence the resolutions were not introduced in any advantageous spirit, but in consequence of the amalgamation there was a strong feeling in the county in favour of such an amalgamation. The negotiations, which were carried out in the preliminary stage, could not be undertaken by a single body.\n\nIn supporting the resolution Mr. J. G. Patterson said that the question connected with agriculture was one of the most important questions in connection with the parting of the ways. They were not disposed to amalgamate with the National Farmers' Union, but felt strongly that their future methods of work must be different from those of the past. The two organisations had been working together for many years, and it was thought, high time they started something to unite them under one banner. Tenant farmers were also represented at the meeting, and it was gratifying to find that they in Staffordshire were the first to commence an agitation for amalgamation. The resolution was carried with but one dissentient.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nToronto, Ontario, Jan. 30, 19--\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report that the following items have been received by me from Mr. J.

H. Westgate\nField Secretary\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\n--Re URGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MOOSE FACTORY SCHOOL C.of E.\n\nThe Rev. J.T. Griffin, Principal of our Society's School at Moose Factory, has presented to our Commission, in his annual report, the following information with regard to urgent requirements at his school, and I have been instructed to direct your attention to the same and to solicit your assistance in having them as fully supplied as possible.\n\nThe part of his report referred to reads as follows:\u2014\n\nP-R-E-S-S-I-N-G N-E-E-D-S.\n\n1. MAIN CELLAR. In excavating the cellar under the large dining-room of the main building in the year 1921, we found that the rafters (sills?) under the floor were rotten. This necessitated temporary rafters being placed under the flooring, which was done by the Principal and boys, and propped up by round poles. This is in a very bad way and should be attended to at once. The cost would only consist of a couple of carpenters from the Hudson Bay Co. for a short time. We would use some of the lumber which we had prepared for the new byre. The cellar has never been properly finished, and it needs lumber squared on two sides to be fitted all around the walls to keep back the clay from falling out from under the foundation. If this were done, and steps fitted on the outside of the entrance to the cellar, it would secure the building from falling in and make the place more useful for storing the large quantities of potatoes,\nturnips and other vegetables during the winter.\n\n2. BALCONY. The outer Balcony, leading off from the Girls' room, and also under-balcony of same is very much decayed and needs a complete new one. The cost of this would not be much, as the carpenters would be instructed to fill up the pillars and basins, and the remainder of the work could be done by some of the bigger boys and painted.\n\n3. A NEW DOOR, is required for the main entrance into the Dining room.\n\n4. A NEW LAUNDRY HOUSE. We have a large sized house (20'6\"x14'6\") which at present is used for holding Indian books and odds and ends. I would like this to be lined on the inside (it is only weather-boarded) and fitted up for use as a washing room, a place where the laundry of the school could be seen to. At present we use a partitioned portion of the study for this purpose in the winter, and outside on the grass in the summer. The books &c. can be put away in the top of the food store. This is certainly a pressing need and it would not cost much to turn it into a suitable laundry place, and it could be used for the Boys'washing room in summer.\n\n5. EXTENSION OF FARM. Outside of the enclosed compound there is a very large piece of ground off which the timber has been taken, and quantities of the stumps have been pulled out and are awaiting removal. Besides this, there is an inner portion of the ground almost cleaned\u2014 I should say perhaps about 2 acres\u2014which needs further work. I would suggest that this inner portion be further cleaned and enclosed by wire and posts and that potatoes be planted in same. The yearly standard price for one bag of potatoes is $3.\n\n6. BYRE. Last year we were able to secure a very large number of logs which came down the Moose River from a burst boom belonging to some Pulp Company. These we had sawn up into lumber and logs squared for the purpose of building a new byre for a Hay shed. The cost of sawing this 17,000' of lumber came to $55.\n\nIn connexion with the above matters I may say that I had hoped to visit Moose Factory this summer, when I should have had an opportunity of estimating the cost of these repairs &c., after a close personal examination. As I have been obliged to postpone my visit, the estimate of the cost must be made out from the above data, and this, in the opinion of our Commission, will amount to about $1,200. I shall be obliged therefore if you\nwill authorise an expenditure of this amount, it being understood that the sum of $1,200 must not be exceeded, and only that portion of it expended which is actually required for the purposes specified above.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL.A.R. Westgate\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/K.\nJuly 22, 1924.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRev. Dr. Scott,\n\nRev. Dr. Westgate requests authority to expend an amount not exceeding $1200 in the carrying out of repairs which he states are urgent at the Moose Factory C. of E. Residential School buildings. He has enumerated the various repairs required.\n\nWe have no funds provided for repairs to this school in our appropriations for the present fiscal year. I would point out that these buildings are the property of the Church Authorities and we have never expended any amount for their erection or upkeep. I would recommend that Dr. Westgate be informed that there are no funds available but that the matter will receive consideration when the Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared. We have authorized a number of expenditures for Church of England schools, which were not provided in the Estimates - recently $2,000 was granted for urgent repairs at the Hay River Residential School - and after our full building programme is carried out this year, there will be very little left for unforeseen expenditures.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.T.

In my letter page 5 to the Deputy Superintendent General dated October 30th I suggested that the sum of $1200.00 would be required and specified the following items: (1) Main cellar, (2) Balcony, (3) new Door, (4) Laundry House, (5) Extension of Farm, and (6) Byre.\n\nIn a letter recently received from the Principal he presents a very strong request for new metallic roofing for the main buildings at the Day School. He stated that while it might be possible for the main buildings to last another year without a new roof, he felt quite certain that the Day School would suffer serious damage if the new roof were not supplied this summer.\n\nAs the grant for the Day School is by arrangement paid to Bishop Anderson, I was directed to refer the matter of a new roof to him for any action necessary. His Lordship however, is now on a visit to James Bay but it would appear that his Commissary has referred this urgent need to your Department as I have just received the following telegram from him in this connection:-\nThe Secretary.\n\n\"Indian Department refuse metallic roofing for Moose Factory Day School\".\n\nAlthough I have not been able to visit this School in person I feel well assured that every effort should be made to have this metallic roofing supplied, and if you will kindly let me know what money is available for repairs etc., for this School this year I will make whatever arrangements it may be possible and will do my best to have the roofing sent in and other improvements made so as to ameliorate the difficult and trying conditions under which I am quite satisfied our Principal and his staff at this School are carrying on their work.\n\nI remain, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.A.R. Westgate\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nTERV/JF.\nOttawa, July 18, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the funds that are available for the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. I regret to inform you that there was no provision made in the Estimates for this fiscal year for this work. There are so many pressing needs that certain items are crowded out of the Appropriation for Indian Education. Unless exceptional circumstances are drawn to our attention, no funds are available for the residential school.\n\nInasmuch as the Department allows the church authorities certain considerations in lieu of rental at the Moose Factory Day School, it is our opinion that the church should make the necessary repairs. His Lordship the Bishop of Moosonee has been so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. D. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C.

He suggests that the kind which would be most suitable would be an engine \"with a make and break ignition not under 3 Horse Power\", along with this he specified a saw large enough to cut through logs 18\" thick, and with it \"a saw mandrel\". The frame for the saw he states could be made at the school, but if sent in it should be knocked down to save expense on freight.\n\nAs it would now be too late to have the above forwarded by boat from Pagwa, they should be shipped by Hudson's Bay steamer, due to leave Montreal sometime in July.\n\nI very much hope that your Department will undertake to furnish the above, and forward the same to Canon Griffin at Moose Fort this Summer. As our Auditors report shows that the cash disbursements made by our Society for this school for the year 1925 amounted to $7,153.96, while the per capita earnings amounted to only $4,620.00, leaving a balance of $2,533.96 to be met from our Society's funds, I trust that you will be able to recognize the necessity which is laid upon us to apply to your Department for assistance in the provision of the above equipment.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 10, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, concerning the provision of a gas engine, pole saw and saw mandrel for the Moose Port Indian Residential School.

Ltd. to our Society's School at Moose Fort, I beg to state that the delay in this connection is entirely due to the delay in the arrival of these items of equipment at their destination. In letters received two days ago from Moose Fort and written at the end of September it was stated that the local Hudson's Bay Co.'s boat which had gone out to Charlton Island in James Bay to receive the supplies brought in by the steamer from Montreal had not returned. It was expected to return soon and as the engine and pole saw would arrive with it, we may expect to receive the certified account before the end of this month. As soon as it comes to hand I will forward the same to you.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. R.

Westgate, for the use of the Moose Fort Indian Residential School, I now have to say that we are informed by Dr. Westgate that he sent the account to Moose Fort to be certified by the Principal of the School. Dr. Westgate states that he expects to have this account returned to him before the end of the present month, and that, as soon as it comes to hand, it will be transmitted to the Department. When we receive the account, payment will be made. As the order was placed by Dr. Westgate, he should have certified the account, as it was not necessary for him to send it to the Principal of the school to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF.

We have been favorably advised by the committee of working men, and it is considered that it would be in keeping with their policy, and that we will try to have a new school erected at this centre during the coming year. The committee feel that the school will be built in connection with the new school as requested in your letter addressed to the Secretary of the Department.\n\nAfter the completion of this building a new school for Moose Factory will be erected, if funds in our Society's fund cover such a request. It is hoped that the building may be referred to you for consideration by the erection of a new dormitory at this centre.\n\nSo pending this important matter to your attention, I remain, with very kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary\nFebruary 25, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, urging the Department to consider the rebuilding of the Moose Port Indian Residential School next year. The Department is finishing the Alert Bay Indian Residential School this year and is commencing the erection of the Old Sun institution. The earliest possible date for the proposed new school in the Lesser Slave district is 1930. In view of these pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, it is uncertain when funds could be provided for capital expenditure on James Bay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

S. C. C. to the Hudson's Bay Company for freighting supplies from Montreal to Moose Port during the summer of 1928, and requesting that this Department make reimbursement to the amount of $276.08.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to official letter of February 27, 1928, authorising the purchase of the equipment for which you now request payment of the freight charges, and in which it was stated that the Department considered the church authorities should be responsible for the freight.\n\nI would point out that the Moose Port Residential School is in receipt of a higher per capita grant than schools nearer lines of communication, to assist in covering costs of transportation of supplies, etc. The accounts which you submitted are returned herewith.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

March 25th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 19th instant, number 44-6-5, relative to the payment of freight charges on equipment sent last year to our Loose Factory School, I beg to state that your decision has placed our Commission in a decidedly awkward position, as they had reckoned from the wording of your letter of Feb. 27th, 1928, 44-6-5, that you would purchase and pay the freight charges on the kitchen range, iron beds and mattresses, if they purchased and paid the freight charges on the laundry washer. They closed their books for 1928 on this understanding, and now they are faced with an expenditure which they never anticipated, and which it seems to them from the wording of your letter already referred to, they should not now be asked to meet.\n\nIn the light of this explanation I shall be glad to know if you will reconsider your decision. The matter will have to be referred to our Executive Committee in Toronto, as our Commission's credit lapses at the end of each calendar year. I shall, however, withhold any further immediate action until I hear from you again.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Acting Principal of our Society's School at Moose Factory has submitted the following items in his list of requirements for this year, which our Commission have instructed me to ask your Department to kindly purchase and forward by the Hudson's Bay Co.'s steamer due to leave Montreal about July next.\n\nLinseed paint oil ........................................... 10 gal.\nTurpentine .................................................. 10 \"\nWhite lead .................................................... 250 lbs.\nPutty ............................................................. 50 \"\nPaint for dormitory - Girls.

Green ....................... 75 \"\n\" \" Study .................................................. Brown .... 25 \"\n\" \" Bedroom ................................................ Light \" .... 25 \"\n\nThe total cost of the above f.o.b. Montreal should not exceed $130. In addition to these he also makes an urgent request for a 2\u00bd h.p. Johnson Outboard motor for an 18 foot freighter canoe which our Society purchased last year. The cost of this, as given in the Eaton catalogue is $175., but I can secure the same engine from another source for $161.50. In the list of requirements presented by our Society to be provided by your Department for this School this year, the sum of $1,000. was included for a canoe and engine. As it is expected that a new school will be built at this centre within the next two years, our Commission are of the opinion that the freighter canoe already purchased, if provided with the small engine requested, will meet the School's needs until the larger and fully modern School has been completed.\n\nI shall be obliged, therefore, if your Department will\nundertake to provide all the items specified above.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Field Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 27, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with further reference to freight charges on equipment for the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. In view of the difficulty in which your Commission is placed, the Department has reconsidered the matter, and if you will forward vouchers, in duplicate, supported by receipts, the sum of $276.08 will be reimbursed.\n\nI have also your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to this year's requirements at Moose Factory. I regret to inform you that there are no funds provided for special needs other than urgent repairs. However, I am pleased to authorise an expenditure of $130 for paint and to meet the freight costs relative thereto. When the purchase has been made, you may forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, and you might have the transportation company bill the Department for the freight on this shipment only.

As Mr. Waller would receive the motor much earlier by this route than if sent by the Hudson's Bay Company's steamer from Montreal, I shall be obliged if you will kindly have it sent via the Island Falls route. It should be consigned to the following address:\n\nMr. S. Waller,\nMoose Factory,\nc/o Hudson's Bay Company,\nIsland Falls, Ont.\n\nWhen ordering the motor I shall be obliged if you will kindly note that it will be fastened to a canoe with a pointed end and not a square end.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, referring to the supplying of a Johnson outboard motor for the use of the Moose Factory Indian Residential School, and requesting that same be sent in care of the Hudson's Bay Company, Island Falls, Ont.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that while the Department, in official letter to you of the 27th ultimo, authorized the supplying of $130 for print and payment of the freight costs thereon, no mention was made of supplying an outboard motor. As you were informed in letter referred to, there are no funds provided for special needs at this school other than urgent repairs. The Department, therefore, regrets that it will be unable to supply this school with a motor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McLean,\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some time the Acting Principal of our Society's School at Moose Factory has been pressing our Commission to provide increased accommodation for the pupils. In support of his request, he points out that during the winter months, the children's dining-room has been used as a play-room as well as a laundry and drying-room. As a temporary solution of the difficulty he first suggested that our Commission should provide the School with a number of army huts, but the Commission declined to provide these on account of the expense and asked him to submit a further recommendation.\n\nIn a letter just received, he mentions the possibility of having logs converted into lumber locally by the Hudson's Bay Company's mill for the cost of operating the mill only. He states that if the logs are on hand when the Company's mill is in operation, the cost would not amount to very much. In his letter to me he failed to submit any estimate of the cost and as it took too long to receive a reply to a letter addressed to this School I shall be glad to know if your Department will sanction an expenditure, say, $500.00 to have lumber cut in the way the Acting Principal suggests. The Acting Principal writes in this connection, in part, as follows:\n\n\"If we had a supply of ready lumber, and are allowed to use our own initiative, we could solve many of our problems with very little cost. We should have on hand our own supply of lumber at all times to avoid being at the mercy of the Company for every little piece required for repair work throughout the year.\"\nIn the list of requirements which our Society asked your Department to furnish this School this year, the sum of $1,000.00 was included for a canoe and engine. As our Commission have already purchased a canoe which will meet the School's needs until a new and larger school has been provided, and as the engine which I requested your Department to provide in my letters of March 20th. and April 4th. will not likely cost more than $200.00 delivered at the School, I trust that favourable consideration may be given to the request that $500.00 be sanctioned to provide this School with a supply of lumber which will enable the School Management to erect any smaller buildings and to effect any minor improvements which may be necessary until the new and larger school has been provided.\n\nShould the total sum of $500.00 not be required to meet the cost of cutting the lumber, the balance could very well be utilized in paying a carpenter to help the School Management with building or repair work undertaken.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 12, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to an expenditure of $500 for lumber at the Moose Factory Indian Residential School. As you were informed in official letter of the 27th ultimo, there are no funds this year for other than urgent repairs at this institution, and I regret that the Department is unable to authorize the expenditure in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

DESIRE TO HAVE PROVIDED DURING\nTHE FISCAL YEAR 1930-31.\n\nNew school for Moose Factory. The present school was established\non Sept. 5th, 1908, with funds provided by the Church of\nEngland, and was the first \"Boarding School\" established in\nthat part of the Dominion. After 25 years of service the\nbuilding is no longer fitted to meet the increased need and\nincreased demand for educational facilities among the Indians\nin the surrounding areas, and consequently should be replaced\nat the earliest opportunity. The Indian peoples themselves\nhave been pressing our Society for a larger and fully modern\nschool building, and as the year 1930 will mark the 25th\nanniversary, not only of the establishment of the \"boarding\"\nschool at this centre, but also the 25th anniversary of the\nsigning of the Treaty with the Indians at that centre, it is\nearnestly hoped that provision may be made in the Departmental\nestimates to supply this building next year.\n\nThe extension of the T. & N.O. railway from Island Falls to a\npoint beyond the most difficult of the rapids on the Abitibi\nRiver, and within a distance of 100 miles of James Bay, will\ngreatly help to reduce the cost of transportation of building\nmaterial. This consideration, along with the discovery of\nlignite in that part, and the possibility of rapid developments\nin other directions, increase the urgency of having the Indian\neducational work placed on a satisfactory basis at the\nearliest date possible. The cost of operating a small school\nsuch as that at Moose Factory where the freighting costs are\nso heavy, and the per capita earnings so small, falls heavily\non the funds of the Society, and they are extremely anxious\nthat the situation should be so altered as to make the\nincome and expenditure more nearly meet than at present.\n\nThe new school desired should have a capacity of not less\nthan 100 pupils and the estimated cost is approximately\n$100,000.00.\nMOOSE PORT\n\n(a) Hen house.\nEstimated cost $150.00\n\n(b) Implement shed.\nEstimated cost $200.00.\n\n(c) New closets.\nEstimated cost $100.00.\n\n(d) Sundry repairs.\nEstimated cost $500.00.\n\n(e) Bread making machine.\nEstimated cost $100.00.\n\n(f) One horse.\nEstimated cost $300.00.\n| DATE | ARTICLES                  | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | TOTAL   |\n|------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| Sep. 4 | To 1 only Hay Mower       |               |              |         |\n|      | \" 1 \" Hay Waggon          |               |              |         |\n|      | \" 1 \" Sleigh with shaft   |               |              |         |\n|      | \" 1 \" Yoke with fittings  |               |              |         |\n|      | \" 1 \" Plough with single tree |           |              |         |\n|      | \" 1 \" Bob Sleigh          |               |              |         |\n\nCertified that the above charges are correct and are a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nActing Principal, Moose Factory, Oct 14th, 1929\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

As the per capita cost of operating this School is approximately \u00a3274.00 per year, and the grant received from your Department is only \u00a3185.00, you will understand the difficulty with which our Society is faced in providing such items of equipment as those I have mentioned. As the horse and typewriter should both go forward by the Hudson's Bay Co.'s steamer from Montreal early this summer, I shall be glad to know if your Department will kindly arrange for the purchase and shipment of the same.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 23, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nOne Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) is available for improvements at the Moose Port Indian Residential School. Dr. Westgate now writes regarding the urgent need for a horse and for a typewriter. The Reverend Principal had written regarding a typewriter and, as the school was only a small one, the request was refused. In view of Dr. Westgate's urgent letter, I propose, with your concurrence, to supply a typewriter and to arrange for the purchase of a horse. The Department has been asked to place these on the Hudson Bay steamer from Montreal, early this summer.

The animal might be purchased in or near Montreal and it should be placed on the Hudson Bay Company's steamer which visits James Bay this summer. If your Montreal representative communicates with the Hudson Bay Company, he can learn on what day the boat will sail and could arrange his purchase and shipment accordingly.\n\nThe horse should be consigned to\n\nRev. J. Blackburn,\nIndian Residential School,\nMoose Factory,\nvia Hudson Bay Company's steamer from Montreal.\n\nThe account, in duplicate, covering the purchase price of the horse and any incidental expenses, should be certified by yourself and forwarded to me for payment. You might have your representative ask the Hudson Bay Company to bill this Department direct for the freight charges. Your representative will learn whether he or the Hudson Bay Company will provide hay for the boat trip.\n\nWhat is required is an animal for light agricultural work, and your suggestion that it be from 4 to 6 years of age, approximately 1400 lbs., gentle and well broken, is satisfactory to this Department, and your estimate of approximately $800 for the price of the animal is also satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At a meeting of our Commission held on the 29th ultimo, I was instructed to ask if your Department would kindly undertake to meet these requirements.\n\nIn the general list of requirements submitted to your Department by our Society last autumn for inclusion in your estimates for the current fiscal year, a bread-making machine was included. As our Commission have decided not to press for this item of equipment this year, they considered that it would be reasonable, on their part, to ask you to supply the sewing machine and paint instead. If you agree to grant their request in this respect, I shall be obliged if you will arrange for the items mentioned to be shipped by the Hudson's Bay Company's steamer from Montreal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, May 7, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to supply, from your branch office in Montreal, one (1) Singer sewing machine, described in your catalogue as follows:\n\nNo. 2 - 5 Drawer Machine, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nThis machine should be delivered to the\n\nHudson's Bay Company,\nShed 47, Montreal Wharf,\n\nbefore the 20th of June, next, to go forward by their boat from Montreal, and should be addressed as follows:\n\nRev. J. Blackburn,\nIndian Residential School,\nMoose Factory, James Bay.\n\nThe machine should be strongly crated in order to prevent any damage in transportation to Moose Factory.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the machine should be forwarded direct to this Department. It should show the retail price and discount of 50% off the 90 day list price, \"on which terms purchase is made\".\n\nI should be pleased if you would arrange to have this machine delivered to the Hudson's Bay Company before the date mentioned above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, May 7, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting that a sewing machine and a quantity of white lead, turpentine, linseed oil and putty be supplied for the use of the Moose Factory Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order is today being placed with the Singer Sewing Machine Company to deliver from their branch office in Montreal one Singer sewing machine. This is the type of machine we supply to all our residential schools. The above Company have been requested to make delivery to the Hudson's Bay Company, Shed 47, Montreal Wharf, before the 20th of June, next, so that the machine can be forwarded by their boat to the Principal of the School.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and forwarding of 200 pounds of white lead, 10 gallons turpentine, 10 gallons linseed oil and 10 pounds putty. If the order is placed with the Hudson's Bay Company, Winnipeg, they could, no doubt, have their office in Montreal make the purchase and arrange for the shipping of these materials. You should obtain an itemised account, in duplicate, covering the cost. This should be certified in the usual manner and sent to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

In fact, he showed me your latest communication dated the 26th of April, #44-6-5, in this connection.\n\nFor many years now the Commission have hoped that your Department would be able to erect a larger and more modern school for the benefit of the Anglican Indians on Factory Island, and for this cause much-needed repairs have been neglected. The time has now come when repairs can no longer be withheld, and on my recommendation and report, after a thorough inspection, the Commission have authorised an expenditure of $800.00, to put the School on a satisfactory footing.\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs - 2  \nJune 8, 1933.\n\nThis considerable sum is, of course, a heavy drain upon their resources, and in spite of previous correspondence, I would once more appeal for the sympathetic consideration of your Department to help the Commission in this absolutely unavoidable expenditure.\n\nIn addition to the items already mentioned, the desks in the School are in very poor condition, and I would request, if at all possible, the following may be purchased from the George M.

I wired to our Commission in Winnipeg to authorize an expenditure of $100.00 to meet some of these, and this authority has been granted. We cannot, however, provide new desks for the classroom, and as these are very greatly needed I sincerely hope your Department may provide them. I spoke to Dr. Tyner, your representative here, about this need, and he is forwarding the Principal's requisition for classroom equipment which includes the desks to which I refer.

McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYour letter, dated the 4th inst., file 44-6-1, stating that my proposal to erect at the expense of the Church of England in Canada \"a new building to replace the present Moose Fort Indian Residential School\" was submitted by you to the Minister and that he \"is disposed to favourably consider providing per capita allowances for one hundred (100) pupils, if accommodation for that number is available in the new building;\" was considered by the Executive Committee of this Society at its meeting on the 15th inst.\n\nThe Executive Committee decided unanimously to proceed this summer with the erection of the building in question on the assumption that the Minister being satisfied of the accommodation provided in the new building, a further letter would be received from him definitely accepting the proposal as submitted by me to you; viz., that the provision will be made for per capita grants, at the existing rate of $200.00, for 60 additional pupils bringing the total provision up from the present number of 40 to 100; this rate to continue unchanged for a period of 10 years after we have secured an attendance of 100 pupils in the new school.\n\nConcerning our ability to obtain 100 pupils, the Bishop of Moosonee, who knows the Anglican Indian population of the District very thoroughly and whom I consulted on the point, states in part in his reply as follows:\n\n\"Wherever I have gone during the past three years particularly, I have been besieged with requests from parents to have their children admitted to the Moose Boarding School and have been obliged to say there was no room.... So that I have not the slightest doubt that we can secure 100 pupils for the school at Moose.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6203, file 467-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nJanuary 4th, 1937.\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nWhen discussing our Estimates with the Minister and yourself on the second instant, you will remember I mentioned that the Church of England had proposed that, if the pupilage at the Moose Port Indian Residential School were increased from forty (40) to one hundred (100), the Church authorities would be prepared to erect a new building suitable for the accommodation of the increased number of pupils.\n\nHonourable Mr. Grover expressed his willingness to favourably consider the offer of the Church of England and I so advised Canon Gould on the 4th instant.\n\nCanon Gould replied by stating that the Church of England is prepared to proceed with the erection of a new building during the coming summer and requests that, in addition to the increased pupilage, the Department provide the children's desks, blackboards and other minor equipment for the classrooms.\n\nAt the present time the Department is allowing grant for a pupilage of $40. The rate per capita at this school is $200. Consequently, the increased per capita allowance would be $12,000. The cost of the desks, blackboards, etc., would be approximately $900.\n\nI would recommend that Rev. Canon Gould be informed that, on the completion of the new building, grant for 100 pupils will be allowed and also that the Department will provide the desks and blackboards.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nDr. Harold McGill\n\nThe Principal of the School places the number that would desire admittance to the new school from 120 to as high as 150. There is, therefore, I am convinced, no question concerning an enrollment to the capacity of the school at an early date after it is erected and open.\n\nAs you are aware, I think, Mr Orr is now drafting a plan for us which will ensure that the dormitory space provided has the necessary cubic air content conforming to the regulation of the Department.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I am assuming that the final and full agreement of the Hon'ble the Minister, is assured and that I may proceed as soon as the plans are completed to take the steps necessary for the erection of the school during the coming summer since the large amount of materials necessary must be delivered at Moosonee for transportation over the ice before the Spring break-up.\n\nIt was further understood and agreed between us that the Department would provide the cost - seats, blackboards, etc - of the equipment of the new classrooms; in this case to be provided for in a separate building.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary\n\nSG:G\nTORONTO 5, ONT., December 31st,\n1936.\n\nDr. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nFollowing the receipt from Mr. Orr of outline plans for the accommodation of 100 pupils in the proposed new Indian Residential School building at Moose Factory, I am having the working plans prepared by our local architects. On the completion of their work I propose to award the contracts for the large amounts of material etc.\n\nOn reading copy of my letter to you, dated the 18th inst., I note that the word \"existing\" in the second paragraph was inserted through a mistake and should, in consequence, be omitted.\n\nThe main building will measure 36 by 115 feet, and be three storeys in height. The wing will measure 30 by 64 feet providing space for boys' recreation room, laundry, boys and girls wash rooms, on the ground floor; the whole of the second floor being devoted to classrooms.\n\nAll the lumber will be cut to size and form in a mill at South Porcupine, shipped to Moosonee and transported over the ice to Moose Factory Island. As soon as the spring thawing of the ground permits the placing of the foundations, the work of erection will proceed with great speed.\n\nAs stated in my letter, dated the 18th inst., I am interpreting your letter dated the 4th inst. to mean that on completion of a building with accommodation for \"one hundred (100) pupils\" departmental provision at a per capita of $200 will be made for ten years for that number. It is because\nof my anxiety to exclude any possible occasion in the future of misunderstanding on this essential point that, at the risk of repetition, I am writing this further letter.\n\nFailing any advice from you to the contrary, I shall proceed as indicated above.\n\nWith every good wish for the New Year,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, January 11, 1937.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI received your letter of December 31st, with reference to the new Indian residential school which the Church of England proposes to erect at Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of December 15th, I formally placed your request for increased pupilage and seats, blackboards, etc., before the Honourable the Minister. As yet, I have not received his reply, but expect to do so in the near future and will immediately write to you. I would suggest that you hold your plans in abeyance until you hear further from me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. Canon S.

(RC 10, Volume 6203, file 467-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMISSION ON HIS VISIT TO MOOSE FACTORY\n\nNEW BUILDINGS: The two years which elapsed since your Secretary visited this historic centre during the summer of 1935 were busy and eventful ones, and the progress made in that comparatively short time greatly exceeded his expectations. In the establishment of the fully modern Newnham Cottage Hospital, with ten beds, two cots, and one bassinette; and in the creation of a new three and a half storey residential school building with ample accommodation for 100 pupils, the Church of England in Canada has furnished unquestionable proof of her deep and practical interest in all that pertains to the highest welfare of her numerous and devoted Indian people in the Moose Factory and James Bay areas.\n\nNever once, so far as your Secretary has been able to ascertain, since the arrival of John Henry Patterson as Bishop in 1881, has the Church of England failed to provide labourers for this part of the world-wide mission field, and it is surely fitting that the good and glorious work which they began, and carried on so faithfully and so long, should now be maintained and extended by their successors with the increased resources and facilities they have at their command. The double process of maintenance and expansion is admirably exemplified in the work through the provision of those two very necessary and very efficient buildings, and one cannot but devoutly thank God for the abundance of wisdom and help bestowed upon the General Secretary of our Society, whereby he was enabled to find a way of making this provision possible.\n\nTHE HOSPITAL: As members have already received the printed pamphlet which furnishes considerable information about the Hospital, your Secretary does not consider it necessary to make any detailed reference to it in this report.\n\nAt the time of his visit five patients were in residence, two of them having been brought from Fort George, a distance of approximately 500 miles. As two more were expected to be transferred from the Hospital at Cochrane, there is ground for believing that the operating costs may be fully met by the usual grants for patients as made by the Indian Department.\n\nFor the time being, at any rate, Nurse Hockin, who is in charge, and Mrs Sauzier, the House Matron, are quite sufficient to cope with the work, and additional help is not required.\n\nThe General Secretary recommends that responsibility for the Hospital be vested in the Commission, in the same way that the one at Hay River now stands, and your Secretary commends this recommendation to the members for sympathetic consideration and acceptance. It is the opinion of the General Secretary that the unification of control of\nall the Society's work at this important centre, possesses advantages which should not be disregarded, and he expressed the hope that the members of the Commission would take the same view of the matter.\n\nTHE SCHOOL: The new buildings with the annex, the purpose of which will be described later, is pleasing in design, spacious in capacity and substantial in structure. The foundations rest on cement piles with wide footings, and the roofing material is asphalt shingles of the best quality. There is a neat little belfry on the apex of the roof at the east end, surmounted by a cross, and the bell itself purchased by contributions from the local Indian community has an unusually mellow tone. As the exterior of the building is painted a cream colour, with door and window frames in brown, the general effect, when viewed from a distance and against a background of green foliage, is decidedly pleasing.\n\nTHE ANNEX: At the east end of the main building (School) (which is 115 feet long by 36 feet wide) and connected therewith by a closed-in passage, there is another building, 64 feet long by 30 feet wide, which provides comfortable space on the ground floor for wash rooms for the boys and girls (each 24 feet wide by 13 feet) the laundry, the light and power plant, and the boiler-room (the boiler is 18 feet by 13 feet.) On the upper floor it provides two well-lighted class rooms, each 30 feet by 30 feet, separated by a partition which can easily be removed when the combined space is required for an entertainment or general assembly.\n\nYour Secretary feels confident that the detachment of the class-room work from the main school building will strongly commend itself to the members of the Commission, as it is in keeping with the policy they have been hoping for some years to have adopted at a number of the other schools under their control.\n\nTHE CHAPEL: Of all the rooms on the ground floor of the main building itself, undoubtedly the most interesting and beautiful is the one set apart, and furnished in oak, as a Chapel.\n\nThe Chapel is 60' 6\" in length, 13' 4\u00bd\" in width, has a Communion Table, Prayer Desk, and two chairs at the Sanctuary end, and a sufficient number of seats and kneeling boards in the nave to accommodate the staff and a capacity enrollment of pupils. The beauty and dignity of this room are greatly enriched by a window (21' x 11' 2\") of stained glass, located on the outside wall directly opposite to the main entrance. In the four\ncorners of this delightfully and artistically coloured window are excellent portraits of Bishop Horden, Archbishop Macfay, Bishop Anderson, Bishop Rev. John Cass, while a third panel on the left half carries a remarkably fine reproduction of the painting of Bishop Mountain's momentous journey to the Red River. In a corresponding panel near the top of the window may be seen the lady Foundress of the W.A., as she unfolds to the Board of Management, D & F.M.S. the plans which under Divine guidance and protection culminated in the honoured and Dominion-wide organization so well known today. In the centre of the window appears the Saviour of the world, pleasing disciples gathered around various nations, an Indian and Eskimo included, and, in the border on either side of this central group may be seen the official monogram of the M.S.C.C. and the Winchester Cross of the W.A. Few who see this window are ever likely to forget it, and one can only hope and pray that all who worship in this quiet and peaceful place may receive such spiritual benefit from the record upon the memorial window asaries of the heroic men and women of the past, as will enable them to dedicate their own lives to similar great undertakings for Christ in the future. Fastened to the walls on either side of the memorial window, and becomingly framed are reproductions of the two paintings by Margaret W. Tarrant, one of which is entitled \"LOVING SHEPHERD OF THE SHEEP\", and the other \"BEHOLD I SEND YOU FORTH\".\n\nOther rooms on the ground floor of the main school building are as follows:\n\n1. Childrens' refectory (50' x 30')\n2. Staff dining room (13'4\" x 13')\n3. Hall (45' x 10') with three furnaces\n4. Kitchen and pantry.\n5. Store room; and\n6. Dairy.\n\nAt either end of the first floor are spacious children's dormitories, one of which is 48' x 16' and the other 55'6\" x 14'. Connecting these are two passage ways, each 9'4\" x 16'7\" approximately 4'4\" wide. On this floor is located the Principal's office (15'10\" x 12'); the staff sitting room (32'3\" x 16' 6\"); three bed rooms, each 15'10\" x 10'); a guest room of the same size; a women's wash room 15'10\" x 7'5\"; and a Supervisor's room 16'4\" x 10'.\n\nThe Second Floor has two dormitories each 56' x 38' and two supervisor's rooms, each 13'4\" x 9'.\n\nThe Attic provides a room for storing clothing; another room for general storage; a recreation room for girls (49'4\" x 14'); and a sewing room 16' x 13'4\".\n\nAll rooms throughout the building are well lighted and storm and screen windows are available for winter and summer use respectively.\n\nFURNISHINGS AND EQUIPMENT. The annex will be heated by two Banner Furnaces, No.333, made by the Galt Stove and Furnace Co., and the main school building by three Banner Furnaces, No. 328, year 1921, made by the same Company. The furnaces in the annex will burn wood, and those in the main school building wood and coal.\n\nA Delco plant, Model No.23-C-1, Serial No.378902, 2500 watts, and 52 batteries will provide the light, also power to pump the water and operate the two Thor washers to be installed in the laundry.\nThe Water Supply is drawn from the river, with a Delco motor (Model 3747, Serial No. 26,115 volts D.C.) installed in a cement shaft on the river bank to operate the pump, and force the water through a 6\" pipe to the school, a distance of some 450 feet. Due care has been given to the question of protecting the pipe against the severe frosts of winter.\n\nThere is a pressure, also a hot water tank in the laundry, a jacket heater. A table will be provided, also a stove for heating smoothing irons.\n\nTables and benches were available for the children's refectory, also a table for the staff dining room. Beds for the dormitories had been ordered, and there appeared to be every indication that the building would be ready for occupation by the end of the current year.\n\nAFFILIATED BUILDINGS - such as a modern stock barn, implement shed, poultry house, pigery, etc. will have to be provided as funds from the Department or some other source become available. The \"mission house,\" or staff part of the old school plant will be left standing and used for storing supplies. A root-house can be secured by putting a cement basement under this building. The Principal estimates that about 50 tons of cement will be required, and your Secretary recommends that the Department be asked to provide this, and the affiliated buildings mentioned.\n\nSTOCK. The School has four good horses at present, and these are sufficient for current needs. It has four cows milking, one day, one heifer and one bull. More cows will be required in the Spring.\n\nTHE STAFF. The numerical strength of the existing staff, if augmented by one Teacher and one Supervisor, will probably be found sufficient to handle the work of the new and larger school.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL (Rev. Gilbert Thompson, B.A.) is a diligent and capable worker. He conducts three services each Sunday - one at 11 o'clock in the Church at Moosonee, and the other two in the Church near the School, on the Island.\n\nTHE PUPILS. The enrolment of pupils at the time of your Secretary's visit was 39, but the daily attendance at the class room was not less than 30. There are Treaty pupils receiving classroom instruction number 23, and there are about as many Treaty Indian children from the Settlement who benefit in the same way. Rev. Louis Sampson, the Teacher, has carried on the classroom quite steadily and faithfully, but it appeared to your Secretary that his qualifications better fitted him for work amongst senior grades, and none of which are to be found at this school. He himself has a keen desire to return to ministerial work and your Secretary advised him to communicate with some Bishops with a view to securing a suitable opening.\n\nT.B.R.W.\nTORONTO 5, ONT., November 13th, 1937.\n\nDr. Harold W.

A. Williams,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn line with your request to the Delco Motor Products at Oshawa, and their Mr. Mounts' letter to your attention under date of January 28th, we would quote on equipment for Fire Alarm System and Watchman's Detector Stations for the school at Moose Factory, as follows:\n\n**Fire Alarm System**\n\nSystem Type SS\n\nClosed Circuit---operation of any station sounds a predetermined code ring four times on all bells in the circuit. This circuit is supervised and is so arranged that if there is any trouble on the circuit such as grounds or short circuits the trouble bell will ring in the Engineer's or Superintendent's office indicating that there is trouble on the line and should be examined and adjusted so that the system will be maintained 100% for alarm purposes.\n\nThis system is for operation on 110 volts, D.C.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| Bells #23 - 8\" Single Stroke | 11 | $22.95 each |\n| F.A. Stations - #1275-2 Surface Type | 7 | $39.10 each |\n| Type SS - Control Panel 1 circuit | 1 | $187.00 each |\n\n---\n\nGeneral Open Circuit System\n\nOperation of any Break Glass Station causes all vibrator bells in the circuit to ring continuously until a new glass is placed in the station. This circuit is not supervised, and should be tested at intervals to make sure that there is no fault on the circuit in case an actual alarm is put through.\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| #661 - 8\" Belle Vibrating 110 volts D.C. | 11 | $19.55 each |\n| #228 - Break Glass Stations, Surface | 7 | $10.20 each |\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN, QUOTATIONS ARE FOR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

(RG 10, Volume 6201, file 467-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES - ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nWe would strongly recommend the use of the closed circuit type, which we believe to be the ideal system for fire alarm protection, although as you will note the cost of this equipment would be somewhat higher than the equipment as used in the general open circuit system. We are returning with this quotation two (2) sets of blueprints which were brought into us by the Aladdin People, and on these we have marked on the various floors the locations which we believe would be best suited to give a general coverage of the equipment. The fire alarm bells are marked in white pencil with a circle with a line through it. The fire alarm stations are marked with the letter \"F\" also in white pencil. These are our impressions of where this equipment should be located from the blueprints themselves, but however, either yourselves or the architect might wish to locate at other points in accordance with the building construction. You might also wish to either decrease or increase the number of stations and bells on anyone floor.\n\nWe would quote in connection with Watchman's Time Detector System as follows:\n\n**WATCHMAN'S TIME DETECTOR SYSTEM**\n\nThis System consists of a Time Detector located in the Superintendent's office with outlying magneto stations where the watchman calls and puts through his visit on permanent record in the Time Detector.\n\n1 - #78 - 6 Station Time Detector (Without Clock) $141.96 each\n1 - #75 - 6 Station Time Detector (With Clock) 295.80 each\n3 - #162 - Magneto Stations (Surface) 25.50 each\n\nYou will also find the various marks on the blueprint in white pencil, the \"X\" denoting the magneto station, at which point the Watchman would insert his key into the magneto station into operation. This would register the time at which that particular station was operated in the Watchman's Time Detector shown as a rectangular shape in white pencil with the letter \"X\".\n\nIn the Supervisor's Room on the first floor. In connection with this Watchman's Time Detector System we would point out to you that as it is magneto operated it would have absolutely no connection with your 110 volt D.C. System. The same remarks would apply to the Watchman's Time Detector System, that is, as to quantities and losses as in the fire alarm system.\n\nWe are enclosing literature with more information regarding both the fire alarm and Watchman's Time Detector equipment. All prices quoted herein are net, sales tax included.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN, QUOTATIONS ARE FOR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES WITHOUT NOTICE.

This detail, of course, would not be necessary insofar as the Watchman's Time Detector equipment is concerned.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nThe Principal of our Moose Factory School has directed the attention of our Commission to the need of a fire alarm system with station time detectors, and I consulted the Northern Electric Company from whom the lighting system at the school was secured, with regard to the most suitable kind, and the cost of the same. Enclosed herewith is the original of their reply to my letter.\n\nThey recommend the closed circuit system described in their letter (page 1) as the System Type S.S. The cost of this equipment would be $715.15. As the six station time detectors would cost an additional $295.80, or a total of $1009.95, I am writing to ascertain if your Department can authorize this expenditure.\n\nAs the need cannot be questioned, and as you know the dilemma in which our Society stands at present financially, your help in this matter will be appreciated more than it is possible to express.\n\nAlthough I am writing this from our Toronto office, will you please address your reply to me at my Winnipeg office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the proposed installation of a fire alarm system in the Moose Factory Residential School.\n\nThis school was recently remodelled by your Commission and I presume was made as fireproof as possible in view of northern conditions. In addition we make an allowance for a night watchman. No special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for such a heavy expenditure as you request at the Moose Factory Residential School and I therefore regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 16th ultimo, #44-6-5, awaited me on my return from eastern Canada a short time ago, and I sincerely regret the decision embodied therein, not to provide the fire alarm system requested for our Moose Factory School.\n\nWhen making the request for this equipment as embodied in my letter of the 16th ultimo, I was under the impression that as our Society had made a capital expenditure of approximately $60,000.00 in providing the new school building at Moose Factory, and had therewith, met your Department's request, you would be able to help us to the comparatively slight extent indicated, in the same way that you made a grant of approximately $2,000.00 for equipment at our Aklavik School.\n\nFurther, as our Society during the past few years has provided not only the new school buildings at Moose Factory, but new school buildings at Fort George and Aklavik as well, at a total cost of approximately $125,000.00, the request did not, nor does it yet, appear to me to be an unreasonable one.\n\nAs you state in your letter that \"no special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for such a heavy expenditure as requested at the Moose Factory Residential School\", I have been wondering if some of the saving affected by your Department through the non-payment of P.E. grants could not be made available for the equipment in question. For instance, had capacity attendance of pupils been maintained in 1937 at all the Schools administered by our Society, our Society's revenue would have been increased by the amounts indicated in the following list:\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 6203, file 467-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n| Location       | Capacity | Average Attendance | Loss   |\n|----------------|----------|--------------------|--------|\n| White Fish Lake| 50       | 27.57              | $415.11|\n| Blackfoot      | 100      | 88.38              | $1889.28|\n| Peigan         | 60       | 46.68              | $466.54|\n| Lac la Ronge   | 100      | 97.48              | $974.27|\n| Elkhorn        | 145      | 142.64             | $200.73|\n| Sioux Lookout  | 125      | 99.62              | $546.21|\n| Chapleau       | 100      | 92.61              | $1123.66|\n\nTotal $10422.80\n\nThis heavy loss in revenue, along with the further loss of approximately $10,000.00 through the 5% cut in the grants, will indicate to you the difficulties which confront our Commission in the efficient administration of our Society's Schools, and while there may be some Department ruling to the effect that past grants which are not claimed automatically lapse, I trust that if no such ruling obtains, some of the losses effected last year on grants in this way, may yet be applied to the provision of the fire alarm system requested for Moose Factory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, March 7, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you express regret at the inability of the Department to provide the alarm system you requested for the recently constructed residential school at Moose Factory.\n\nI may state by way of comment that negotiations relating to the construction of a residential school at Moose Factory took place before I entered the Department a little over a year ago. It is my understanding, however, that this school was to be constructed and equipped by the Anglican Church authorities and that the Department, in turn, had promised an increase in pupilage from 40 to 100. These negotiations were carried on by Reverend Canon Gould, representing your Church, and Dr. McGill, Director of this Branch.\n\nI note your reference to the funds that might be available as the result of the regulation which permits us to pay only on the average attendance at residential schools. I may state that the average attendance at residential schools is carefully considered when the estimates are prepared from year to year and an amount necessary to pay approximately 50% of the per capita grant payments included. You can readily ...\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\ncan readily see, therefore, that there is no surplus available from this source. In addition to this, an Order-in-council was passed recently, making provision for the payment of an additional $5.00 per pupil to residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan. I regret, therefore, that we have not at our disposal in the appropriation of this year the funds necessary for the construction of a fire alarm system at the Moose Factory School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

My only comment is that you should watch the school carefully to see that no child remains in it who has tuberculosis in a phase which is a menace to the other children and that those children whom you describe as pupils with a bad family history should have a substantial advantage in the way of feeding, rest, and relief from exertion. If certain dormitories could be set aside for them I think it would be of advantage. This was the object of the other proposed arrangement and it will be so much the better if it can be accomplished without further building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L.

It is my understanding that it would cost $75 complete with 24 stencils, stylus, ink, etc.\n\nIn addition to the capacity enrollment of pupils who are in residence, there is a large attendance in the classrooms of Day pupils from the surrounding settlement, and the Principal points out that the duplicator would be of great service to the teachers in their classroom work. Further, as many of our Schools keep in touch with the parents of pupils in residence, as well as with graduate pupils, by sending out a monthly letter embodying information of interest to all, the duplicator would be of very great service in more ways than one, and I sincerely hope that you may be able to find some way of providing it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in which you submit, for Departmental consideration, a request received by you for a duplicator from the Principal of the Moose Factory Indian residential school.\n\nI hesitate to send forward to the Purchasing Department a requisition for a duplicator such as the one described on the sheet enclosed with your communication. I feel confident that a requisition for a duplicator at this price would not be acceptable to the Purchasing Division.

McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nDuring the discussion of this matter it was suggested and finally agreed that the best course to take would be to build a new and larger hospital and allow the present hospital building, erected in 1936, to be used as the Principal's residence. As this building is conveniently located to the new School, and would serve very well for this purpose, the Committee hoped that the arrangement would commend itself to you and to your Department.\n\nAs the existing hospital, however, must continue in operation until a new and larger one has been provided, it was unanimously agreed by the Committee that the provision of the new hospital should be undertaken by the Government.\n\nIn support of this view it was pointed out that as the Society had erected the new School at a cost of over $50,000.00, and the existing hospital at a cost of at least $7,000.00, including equipment, it should not be asked or expected to make any further large expenditure for the new larger hospital required.\n\nI was instructed, therefore, to ask you to include in your estimates for the next fiscal year the sum of at least $10,000.00 to build the larger hospital necessary at this centre.\n\nIt was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee that the residence of the Principal should be provided out of Government funds, and, as the cost of materials and plus freight, wages, etc., for the existing hospital building amounted to not less than $5,000.00, the Government expenditure for the two buildings will be reduced by that amount.\n\nAs the Federal Government has recently given very careful attention to the question of improving the health of its Indian wards, and has voted a very considerable sum of money for this purpose, the Committee earnestly hope that this comparatively small expenditure may be made possible next year through the provision of a hospital capable of meeting for many years to come, the medical requirements of the Indians in the Moose Factory and James Bay settlements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nDuring my interview with you on the 9th instant I mentioned the urgent need of a mechanical washing machine for our school at Moose Factory, and it is my recollection that I promised to submit a request to you for some help in securing this very necessary item of equipment. The smaller washers which have been in use have been found to be inadequate, and the Principal (Rev. Gilbert Thompson, B.A.) has submitted to our Commission the following recommendations:\n\nThe J. H. Connor & Sons Ltd., Ottawa, are willing to supply a \"No.1 K.W. Wood Tub Washer with counter shaft, electric motor and wringer. Capacity 36\", length over all 69\", height over all 56\". Price $10.00.\"\n\nMr. Thompson states that \"This is the smallest machine we could get if we are expected to work economically.\"\n\nWhile I am deeply conscious of the financial difficulties confronting your Department at the present time, I am regrettably obliged to state that the Government's decision to reduce the pupilage at the Indian Residential Schools to 92.24% from January 1st of last year, has made it impossible for our Society to meet...\nall essential requirements such as this item of equipment out of their present income. Our difficulty has been further increased by the fact that the Society was obliged to install, at very great expense, a septic tank at this school and also to enlarge the intake pipe in connection with the water supply.\n\nShould your Department be unable to meet the total cost of the washing machine recommended by Mr. Thompson, I would earnestly hope that you may be able to make a generous grant towards the cost of the same.\n\nIn the list of sums provided in your Estimates for the current fiscal year, and as submitted in Departmental letter of June 30th last #160-2, I note that the sum of $300 is included for general repairs and painting at this school. I had hoped that some of this amount might still be available for the purchase of the washing machine, but the Principal wrote to me in August to say that a large part of this amount had already been used, and that the painting was essential to preserve the fabric of the main school building from deteriorating.\n\nA similar washing machine will be required for our Aklavik School but owing to lack of transportation consideration of this need may be deferred until next year.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to a request that you have resolved for a new washing machine for the Moose Port Residential School.\n\nAs you were previously advised, an amount of $300.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Port School. We have had no communication from the Principal with regard to the expenditure which he advises you he has incurred. Consequently the $300.00 is still available. If you so desire I am prepared to recommend to the Minister that this amount be allowed to your Society toward the cost of the washing machine. I regret, however, that we cannot allow any larger amount than $300.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Chlorinator for Moose Factory Indian Residential School - Your letter of July 22nd, File 44-6-5\n\nOn November 18th, 1941, a school girl developed symptoms referable to a diagnosis of Typhoid Fever. There had been no known contact and possible sources of carrier infection were investigated without result. Diagnosis was positively confirmed by Widal reaction of blood sample sent to Ontario Department of Health.\n\nWater sample taken from the school tap at that time and sent to the Ontario Department of Health was classified as \"D\" with a count of colon bacilli found in 1 c.c.\n\nI received a letter under date of December 22nd., 1941, from Mr. Hugh McIntyre, Provincial Sanitary Inspector at Kirkland Lake, from which I quote -\n\n\"The samples of water which you have had tested give very poor returns ------- I may say the Mattagami River (a tributary of the Moose) has been found to be constantly infected by Typhoid as far North as Smoothrock Falls, and there is a possibility of infection occasionally from the Moose River water in consequence. Such water should not be drunk at any time without boiling.\"\nI received a letter under date of January 10th, 1942, from W.H. Turpel, M.D., D.P.H., Division of Epidemiology, Department of Health, Ontario from which I quote:\n\n\"Dr. Berry, the Director of the Sanitary Engineering Division also suggests that you install a small hypochlorinator machine on your pumping system, which will ensure a safe water supply to the school.\"\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter dated February 5th, from Dr. P.E. Moore:\n\n\"I believe that there is sufficient endemic typhoid in the North to make it advisable to vaccinate the children in the Residential school. I believe that a small chlorinating machine such as you suggest should be installed.\"\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter dated February 9th, received from Mr. Hugh McIntyre, Provincial Sanitary Inspector:\n\n\"I think you have very good grounds for suspecting this source of supply for drinking water (Moose River) in view of the fact that all the sewage from Timmins, Iriquois Falls, Cochrane, Smoothrock Falls, Kapuskasing and Hearst goes into its tributaries. No doubt some considerable distance separates you from these sources of pollution but such steady and long continued pollution is bound to tell in the end, especially as the discharge of paper mill waste tends to kill off fish in these rivers. My opinion is that the river water should not be used unless boiled or chlorinated. I always understood the river water at Moose Factory is brackish, especially at high tide.\"\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter received from Dr. Moore dated February 11th:\n\"I agree - that in view of the reports on the river water, there it is unsafe to drink and is very probably responsible for carrying the infection that causes your endemic gastro-intestinal disturbances.\" (Sh. Para dysenteriae Sonne)\n\nThe following are some reports on water samples sent to the Department of Health - Toronto:\n\nDec. 9th, 1941 - Hospital tap \"D\" smallest amount of water with colen bacilli 10 c.c.\n\nSchool tap \"D\" 1.0 \"\n\n22nd School tap \"A\"\n\nJan 14th 1942 River Raw \"D\" 1.0 \"\n\n28th = = \"A\"\n\nFeb = = \"A\"\n\nHospital tap \"A\"\n\nApril River Raw \"D\" 10 c.c.\n\nMay River Raw \"D\" 10 c.c.\n\nReport has not been received as yet on the sample sent out in July.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDr. T.J.

Ross,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAfter receiving your letter of June 30th last, No.160-2, in which you advised that a grant of $500.00 was available for repairs, improvements, etc., at our Moose Factory School, I wrote to the Principal requesting a list of repairs etc. to be undertaken, also a list of the materials required to complete the same. Enclosed herewith is a copy of his reply, and I will be obliged if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if the grant of $500.00 (less the $25.00 already expended) may be used in providing the Septic tank suggested.\n\nNo order should be given for any of the materials listed, until further notice, as the total cost will greatly exceed the grant from your Department, and we must know how this is to be provided.\n\nIt will be a help to us in deciding whether the building of the tank is to be undertaken or not, if we know whether the grant (now $475.00) can be applied towards this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTREWIA.\nEnc.\nOttawa, August 24, 1948.\n\nRe: Repairs, Moose Factory Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th instant and also copy of a communication received by you from the Principal of the Moose Factory Residential School, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be advisable for you to send forward a list of the supplies needed for the construction of a septic tank at the school, to a value of approximately $500.00. These supplies in our case will have to be purchased in the regular way through our Purchasing Division. I am anxious that you should carefully note this fact because we have been reminded recently that owing to priority ratings all purchases must be made by our purchasing agent. It is just possible that difficulty may be experienced in securing a number of the articles included in the list supplied by Mr. Thompson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Comm., M.S.C.C.,\n38-43 The Bible House, 184 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nList returned with letter\nWINNIPEG, MAN. September 3, 1942.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing for the specific purpose of soliciting your help in enabling our Commission to retain at their Moose Factory School the services of Mr. John H. Long, the Engineer. In a letter just received from him he states that he had received a notice to report for medical examination and military training, and while he felt doubtful about being accepted for active service, there was a possibility that he might be taken for some form of service.\n\nThe Reverend Principal Thompson of our Moose Factory School, when writing to me in this connexion, stated that Dr. Orford had examined Mr. Long, and he thought that \"due to the foot defect he would probably be put in category 'C'.\"\n\nAs our Commission, since Canada entered into war, has released approximately fifty staff agents, or nearly one-third of all of their school staffs, they felt that in this way they have made a valuable contribution to the war effort. The finding of other men and women to take their place has imposed a very heavy strain on our Commission and especially on our office staff, and at the present time we have important staff vacancies which we are most anxious to fill. Half of the men who are engineers at our schools have enlisted, and if Mr. Long is taken away for any reason whatever, it may be months before we are able to secure anyone else to take his place. Principal Thompson is relying on him to supervise the installation of the septic tank referred to in your letter of August 24th last, #44-6-5, and I can assure you that any help you may be able to give us in arranging for Mr. Long to remain where he is will be fully appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRWIA.\nOttawa, September 8, 1942.\n\nRe: Engineer, Moose Fort\nResidential Schools\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you solicit our help in retaining the engineer at the above-noted school.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a number of somewhat similar requests have reached this Branch since the outbreak of war. I regret to state, however, that under existing regulations it is not possible for the officials of this Branch to intervene, either directly or indirectly, in such matters. We have been informed that no exceptions can be made in regard to men called up for military training. It is just possible, of course, that in the case of Mr. Long his physical disabilities will be such that he will experience little difficulty in securing a release. In any event, we are powerless to take any action in cases of this nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend T.B.R.

This excess is referred to as \"Residual Chlorine\" and can be readily measured to determine that the correct amount of chlorine has been added.\n\nWhen a chlorine feed rate produces a residual higher than required, chlorine is being wasted and, of course, when the residual is less than that required, the desired results will not be obtained. In the interests of economy and proper chlorination it is essential to adjust chlorine feed rates accordingly.\nProper adjustment of chlorination to meet the seasonal changes in chlorine requirement therefore demands a simple method of determining chlorine residual quickly and with laboratory accuracy.\n\nBecause it is simple, easily and quickly performed and because it requires no special chemical or technical training, the ortho-tolidin color comparison test is widely used for this purpose. Ortho-tolidin when added to water containing residual chlorine will develop a greenish yellow or orange color. The intensity of the color developed varies with the amount of residual chlorine present.\n\nTo meet the demand for an accurate, permanently reliable, yet inexpensive device for this color test the W&T Junior Tester is of particular advantage where chlorination will be confined to narrow residual limits and where requirements do not warrant the purchase of standards for a complete range as furnished with the W&T Comparator.\n\nThis apparatus is furnished with either of two sets of standards. For drinking water chlorination it is customary to use the standards which show residuals of 0.1 parts per million and 0.3 parts per million. For swimming pools and applications where higher residuals are usually in order, a set of color standards for 0.2 p.p.m. and 0.5 p.p.m. is furnished. With either set of standards, it is an easy matter to interpolate the results of any test.\n\nDescription\n\nConsisting of a housing which is firmly supported on a broad base, the Tester is made of moulded plastic material which is durable, resistant to corrosion and not affected by either acids or alkalis. Two rectangular sample tubes fit into the housing, one for the sample being tested and the other for an untreated sample. By this means natural color and turbidity in the water are automatically compensated for and a true reading of residual is obtained. An even diffusion of light over the samples is assured by milk glass set in the back of the case. Non-fading, accurate color standards are built into the front of the case with the numbers which indicate the value of each standard. The standards are made of a carefully colored and accurately calibrated glass, permanently maintaining their reliability.\n\nOperating Procedure\n\nClean both tubes and fill to 10 cc. mark with water to be tested. To one tube containing sample of water, add 0.5 cc of ortho-tolidin reagent, mix thoroughly and place in center compartment of test kit. Allow maximum color to develop\u2014which usually takes from 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nCompare developed color in center tube with glass color standards by placing untreated sample tube first in left hand compartment and then in right hand compartment of test kit. Residual values must be estimated if the developed color lies between the two color standards.\n\nGeneral\n\nSquare sample tubes provided with this Tester eliminate shadow interference and all color standards are calibrated for the 13 mm. depth of liquid and the quantities of water and reagent as indicated. It is essential that the correct sample tubes and color standards are used at all times with this kit.\n\nBefore taking readings be sure that the glass color standards, the sample tubes and the frosted glass in the back of the case are clean.\n\nNever test samples that have stood in sunlight as the color developed by ortho-tolidin will fade.\n\nCONVENIENCE\n\nRepresented in 32 convenient cities, a nationwide organization of Wallace & Tierman specialists in sanitary and industrial chlorination are ready to be of service. They are prepared to offer advice on any phase of the application of chlorine for any purpose.

Today, more than 85% of the country's domestic water supply is chlorinated but too many individual smaller supplies have been neglected due to the lack of suitable equipment. The W & T Hypochlorinator has been specifically designed to meet this need. Small in size, easily installed and requiring a minimum of operating supervision, it offers for the small supply the efficient protection of chlorination at the lowest possible cost.\n\nHow the W&T Hypochlorinator Operates\n\nThe Hypochlorinator consists essentially of a diaphragm pump constructed of corrosion resistant material and so designed that the rate of chlorine application may be easily adjusted to properly chlorinate the water flowing through a pipe line. The fundamental operating principle is outstanding from the standpoint of design and is exclusive with W & T Hypochlorinators. It consists in the use of a balanced diaphragm with a single suction valve and single discharge valve, solution being drawn into the diaphragm chamber on the suction stroke and forced out to the point of application on the discharge stroke. On the delivery side of the diaphragm the pressure is the same as that at the point of application. On the reverse side of the diaphragm, water under full main pressure is allowed to flow into the diaphragm chamber through a non-return control or check valve which confines this water and balances the diaphragm between equal pressures. Pumping is accomplished by application of an intermittent impulse which causes the diaphragm to reciprocate in a manner similar to a pump piston. This principle of operation gives extraordinarily long diaphragm life because of minimum strain on the diaphragm and, in addition, allows the pump to deliver a uniform volume of solution regardless of the water pressure encountered. Control of the pump may be effected either with a small electric motor or specially designed water driven element depending upon existing conditions at the point of application. Manual or automatic control, depending upon the type of installation, can be used on either electric or water driven type and a third type, water driven and meter controlled, will automatically proportion the rate of chlorine application to the water flow. Hence, the W & T Hypochlorinator is readily adaptable to any small water supply whether it be a steady flow, a pumped supply with automatic start and stop, or a variable flow gravity supply.\nElectrically Operated Hypochlorinator\n\nThe Electrically Operated Hypochlorinator is particularly adaptable for use on small pumped water supplies operated either manually or by automatic start and stop of the pumping unit. The equipment is operated by water under pressure equal to or greater than that into which the chlorine solution is applied and operation is directed by means of a small electric motor. Since water pressure furnishes the major part of the power needed to operate the Hypochlorinator, the electric power required is greatly reduced and the small electric motor used consumes no more than 40 watts\u2014at ordinary rates, a cost for electricity averaging not over 5c. a day. Waste water is also reduced to a minimum and averages no more than a quarter of a gallon per minute.\n\nRate of chlorine application may be varied by changing the length of the pumping stroke or by the choice of either of two operating speeds, the total capacity range of the apparatus being 36 to 1. Motor and gears are entirely enclosed and operate in an oil bath\u2014hence there is no lubrication problem.\n\nThe Electrically Operated Hypochlorinator is designed to operate on any water pressure from 5 lbs. to 125 lbs. per square inch. For pressures below 5 pounds per square inch or where negative pressure exists at the point of application, a special electrically operated unit has been designed which operates entirely on electric power and has no water connections or fittings.\n\nWater Operated Hypochlorinator\n\nThe Water Operated Hypochlorinator uses only water pressure for operation, one flow being used to operate the balanced diaphragm and another flow controlling the operation. Since it is entirely independent of electric or external mechanical power it is particularly well adapted for emergency work, for standby or duplicate installation, or for any installation requiring a steady rate of chlorination. The equipment is operated by water under pressure equal to or greater than that into which the chlorine solution is applied, the minimum water pressure being 10 pounds per square inch and the maximum 125 pounds per square inch. By using the pilot principle of design wherein minute mechanical forces are able to operate the equipment with small quantities of water, the amount of waste water is reduced to a minimum and averages not more than one-half gallon per minute. Variation in rate of chlorine application is accomplished by changing the number of pumping strokes per minute and gives a 12 to 1 range. An important advantage of the W & T Water Operated Hypochlorinator lies in the fact that the suction stroke is extremely rapid, requiring only a small percentage of the running time and hence the rate of chlorine application is remarkably steady.\n\nAutomatic Hypochlorinator\n\nBecause of wide flow variations on small gravity water supplies, an automatic meter driven chlorinator of small capacity has long been in demand. The W & T Automatic Hypochlorinator fulfills the requirements for this type of installation in all respects. Operation is similar to the Manual Water Operated Hypochlorinator but the rate of pumping and hence the rate of chlorine application is directly controlled by a water meter installed in the main water line. Any type of meter in which a shaft turns in direct ratio to the flow of water through the meter may be used, and the chlorine applied will be at all times proportional to the water flow. Variation in treatment is accomplished by varying the length of stroke, for which purpose a control handle and dial are provided on the equipment. The accuracy of the W & T Automatic Hypochlorinator when used with small water meters is outstanding and is due to the important and exclusive principle of design wherein small mechanical power is required to activate the balanced diaphragm pump\u2014an advantage found only in W & T equipment.\n### Table of Specifications\n\n| SPECIFICATIONS                                      | Electric Types | Water Manual | Automatic |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Maximum chlorine capacity lbs./24 hours             | 5              | 5            | 5         |\n| Maximum volume pumped in 24 hours (gallons)         | 60             | 60           | 60        |\n| Ratio maximum to minimum volume of solution         | 3.1            | 12.1         | Meter\u201420:1 (approx.) |\n| C.C. solution per 3/4\" stroke                       | 13.2           | 13.2         | 13.2      |\n| Maximum allowable main pressure lbs./sq. in         | 125            | 5            | 125       |\n| Minimum allowable main pressure lbs./sq. in         | 5              | vacuum       | 10        |\n| Maximum normal water consumption g.p.m              | 0.3            | non          | 0.1       |\n| Drawn required                                      | yes            | no           | yes       |\n| Maximum allowable solution strength                 | 15             | 1            | 1         |\n| Kind of electric current                            | A.C.           | none         | none      |\n| Maximum Watts consumed                              | 40             |              |           |\n| Transformer size                                    | 100 v.a        |              |           |\n| Relay controls                                      | 10 watts at 110 volts | 10 watts at 110 volts | maximum 12 |\n| Strokes per minute                                  | 2 or 12        | 1 to 12      | maximum 12 |\n| Length of electric cable                            | 10 ft.         |              |           |\n| Hose size                                           | 1/4\" I.D.      | 1/4\" I.D.    |           |\n\n### Short Specifications for W&T Hypochlorinator\n\n**TYPE:** The Chlorinator shall be a Manual or Automatic Control Operated Hypochlorinator designed to feed sterilizing solution in the form of hypochlorite for treating a flow of water containing not more than 100 pounds per square inch.

A representative of Wallace & Tierman, Ltd., Toronto, called here today and was seen by Mr. Phalen and myself. I believe that Wallace and Tierman supply the majority of chlorinating apparatuses that are recommended by various Public Health officials. They are recognized specialists in this field. The outfit that they quoted on in their letter to you of October 19, of which I received a copy, would be the chlorinator that I would recommend for this school. The price quoted was $495.00 F.O.B. Moose Cree.\n\nI am not quite sure whether it would be necessary to have a man go from Toronto to install it, but rather think that with suitable instructions, someone at Moose Factory would be able to make the installation. This Branch has forwarded previous evidence as to the necessity of putting in this chlorinator as the river water is unsafe to drink and on reports from the Department of Health, Toronto, has been graded unfit for human consumption.\n\nP.S.M.\n\nF.

It has not been found necessary to expend any of this amount and, if the purchase of the chlorinating plant is approved, it will no doubt be possible to transfer sufficient funds from the amount mentioned to the Moose Fort school in order to provide the sum of $495.00 which is the cost of the chlorinating plant.\n\nR.A.

L. [illegible]\n\nDear Mr. L.:\n\nI have just returned from a trip to Moose Factory, where I visited the Bishop Horden Memorial Indian Residential School. During my stay, I discussed the current situation at the school with the Principal, Mr. Thompson. We also had a chance to review the progress made since last year.\n\nThe school is in good condition, and the students appear to be well cared for. However, there are some areas that need attention. The Principal has informed me that he will be submitting a report to the Board of Directors outlining these needs.\n\nIn conclusion, I am pleased with the overall state of the school and the dedication of its staff. I believe that with continued support, the school will continue to provide a quality education to the students.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. Thompson\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing invoice from the George Taylor Hardware Company. This account is being passed for payment. With reference to the additional amount which you consider will be required, you should write to me again early in May. At that time I will likely be aware of the amount allowed in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1943-44 for repairs and improvements at the Moose Port School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nAs you know, the Moose Fort Residential School is a Church-owned building and we provide specific amounts for such buildings in our appropriation and are not allowed to exceed them. Other supplies purchased for the Moose Fort School during the past few months have practically exhausted the amount specifically provided and, as a consequence, we did not have funds for the chlorinating unit which you have recommended. However, we now find that we can transfer funds from another appropriation where the money was not required and consequently we have made further inquiries and are practically ready to make the purchase.\n\nThe information that we have received indicates that electric power is available and is 110 volts direct current. Is this information correct? If not, let me know the strength of the electric power available. It is very important that we should have specific information on this point as it affects the type of chlorinating unit which we will purchase.\n\nR.A.

On the 29th of October last, approval was granted for the purchase of this equipment from the Paterson Engineering Company of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, at a price of $326.00 f.o.b. Moosonee, Ont.\n\nIt is noted that you recommend the purchase of the higher priced equipment offered by Wallace and Tierman, Ltd., Toronto, at $495.00. If the Wilson DES-0 Pulsafeeder offered by the Paterson Company is not considered satisfactory, will you please advise in what respect it does not conform to the specifications prepared by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, or in what respects the Wallace and Tierman product is sufficiently superior to warrant a difference of $169.00.\n\nI enclose herewith our complete file on this subject for your assistance. Please return same with your reply.\n\nH. J. Davidson,\nDept.

Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, recommend that a chlorinating plant be supplied immediately for the Moose Fort Indian Residential School, as the river water is unsafe to drink and reports received from the Department of Health, Toronto, indicate that this water has been graded unfit for human consumption.\n\nIn Vote 167, 1942-43, there is an amount of $1000.00 for maintenance of equipment at Church-owned Indian residential schools. It has not been found necessary to expend any of this amount. The sum provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Fort Residential School has already been expended and consequently we are requesting authority to use an amount of $325.00 from the item \"Maintenance of Equipment\" for the purchase of the new chlorinating plant.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1943.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL MEMORANDUM\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of the last instant, with reference to the proposed purchase of a chlorinating plant for the Moose Fort C.K.

Our experience has been that it is virtually impossible to secure such a high rating unless the end use of the equipment has a definite relation to the war effort. In this connection I may state that one of your competitors offered to supply a suitable chlorinating outfit if we could procure a priority rating of A-1-J or better.\n\nIn view of the above, will you please advise if it is not possible to obtain the required equipment with a lower rating than A-3. Otherwise we may be obliged to consider cancellation of our order.\n\nYou state in your tender of Sept. 10, 1942, that the unit is constructed of 60% Canadian goods. Would it not be possible for you to obtain the parts made in U.S.A. by means of a P.R.P. application.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.J.

In the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Fort School and, as this is a Church-owned school, we are only allowed to expend the amount specifically provided. We have already purchased equipment for the installation of a chlorinator at a cost of $45.00 and this leaves a balance of $457.00 available. As this is all we can spend, we are requesting the Departmental Purchasing Agent to order the 200 bags of cement and the 400' of 6\" vitrified tile. The school management will have to be responsible for the balance of the material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.
