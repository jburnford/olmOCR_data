John H. Davis. The meeting will be addressed by the Rev. Mr. Davis.\n\nSettlers' Union\n\nThe question of whether or not a Union should be formed among the settlers of Prince Albert and vicinity was discussed at a meeting this morning, and a motion was carried that a committee be appointed to draft a constitution and rules for the proposed union.\n\n$100 REWARD\n\nOn the trail between Wolverine Creek and the Salt Plain, on Monday, 3rd day September\n\nA pocketbook containing Eight Hundred and Forty-five Dollars and some Papers, valued at $350.\n\nJohn B. Dunlop, M.D.,\nLucie of the Royal College of Surgeons,\nand Lady of the King's and Queen's College of Physicians, Ireland.\n\nRETURN OF THE BISHOP\n\nFrom a Visit of Ten Years.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of the Basque of Winnipeg returned to Prince Albert on Friday afternoon after an extended visit to the populous parts of the North-West Territories.\n\nHe has been absent more than two months, and has visited every part of the North-West, from Fort Macleod to Edmonton, visiting many places and making good work in each place. He has been very successful in his missionary efforts, and has accomplished much good work in the midst of the aboriginal population. He has visited many places in the North-West, and has impressed many with his teaching and preaching.\n\nthe following was taken from the Baptistical Chronicle:\n\nThe Bishop was received by the Indians of the Abenaki tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Micmac tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Iroquois tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Attikamek tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Montagnais tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Huron tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Ojibway tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Cree tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Assiniboine tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He was received by the Indians of the Sioux tribe, who met him at the mission field and greeted him with great enthusiasm.\n\nWilliam W.

We have heard from the Clerk that no warrant had been issued to the Court contrary to our expectations that Mr. Richardson's late judge would be transferred to Regina; but nobody has yet heard of his successor having been appointed.\n\nIt seems that something was known about it. We understand that the Court was arranged to be held on the 2d of June last, and by its action we are issued returnable, and just as the last moment word was received from him that he was attached by Governor Dewar, Mr. Bonneville's going had to be postponed, and matters and their witnesses had to be sent back to Regina at an enormous expense. We understand that a difference of opinion among members as to whether the warrants issued for the August Court and returnable ones are good for the October sittings. Some who do not think they are are issuing arrest warrants where others hold them to the old one. There is confusion existing and somebody will have to pay the piper. It is about time that the Clerk received instructions on this point so that there will not be confusion in the coming weeks.\n\nCANCELLATION OF HOME STEADS.\n\nThe old system of cancellation of home steads, under which some do not feel they have any claim, has been given up. Claims have been made and \"jumped,\" some have joined, and no doubt the new legislation will ensure that going forward parties to those claims must be held to account.\n\nCONSERVATIVES SPEAK.\n\nA meeting of the Conservatives of Moose Jaw was held on Monday evening, the 9th inst., at which resolutions were adopted condemning the actions of the Dominion Government regarding the land policy. It was also resolved that the government be memorialized by the Conservatives of that place, asking the government to grant an immediate solution of the land question. This has been done extensively on behalf of the government having removed thirty-six square miles for public purposes\u2014an amount of land that is being changed daily at a cost of more than $2,000 per acre.\n\nAlthough much of what has now become an enormous interest is publicly significant, the situation has become quite critical on the part of the settlers who hold land at a rate exceeding $200 per acre.\n\nThis will continue until the land has been removed from the market, and although there are many who believe the land could still be bought at a lower rate, there may soon be none available.\n\nTO BE TAKEN UP.\n\nThe Bill King question is to be dealt with once taken over and settled in the manner demanded by the Minister of Justice. He says so in the Regina Leader, and as we understand the matter, there has been a demand that the land be returned at an early date.\n\nThe farmer who has bought land at a lower price is the only one who can benefit from this arrangement, and it will be seen that the matter has been brought into focus by the recent events.\n\nNOTICE\n\nIn the affairs of the past period the position of the Indian Agent has been announced, and we believe that this will benefit the settlement in this district.\n\nNotice\n\nManitoba Weekly Free Press.\n\nThe Largest Paper in Canada!\n\nThree Handsome Cash Prizes\n\n$500-$200-$100\n\nBURRAGE HALL LEADS AGAIN.\n\nOur Great Selling Sale is still going on, and for a few days more we will offer all our Dry Goods at Cost, Ready-made Clothing, do Gent's Furnishings, do., Ladies' Furnishings, do., Infants' Clothing, do.\n\nGROCERIES\n\nAt Greatly Reduced Prices.

P.'s on the rampage. A dangerous trend.\n\nOn Tuesday evening a special train brought from Regina about 9:30 p.m., the members of the quasi-parliament who had been ordered by the government to meet at Winnipeg for the session. Mr. Neepay opened the proceedings, and the North West Council, the Mounted Police, and the Mounted Police, Col. Hartshorne followed and replied for his Mounted Police. Then Mr. Killean proceeded to make a speech, followed by the names of W. White, M. N. W. C. Hayter Reed, M. N. W. C., and Adjutant Murray. Mr. Neepay made a most excellent speech. Mr. Hayter Reed followed, and then Mr. Cotton made a very good speech, fluent and clever. Mean while the other members were talking Charles Lamb, in making some guests to a party. Mr. Neepay made a literary conversation till nine o'clock, then the meeting will continue. In due time the fighting persisted. The speeches were common, and the ladies present continued until the party got on board the train and parted afterwards. There was a great deal of noise among the racks and near the station. Among the episodes was Martin, the M. P. for Portage la Prairie, who spoke at a certain Winnipeg point against a certain Martin, saying that he would not allow anyone to be hanging on and having no right to the name of Martin. Mr. Neepay said, \"I will put you in prison if you act this manner.\" Then Mr. Neepay said, \"I will hang on and have the name Martin, and Mr. Neepay said, \"I will hang on and have the name Martin, and Mr. Neepay said, \"I will hang on and have the name Martin.\"\n\nFIRE!

J. DRYGIES, Land Commissioner.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nBREWERY LICENSES.\n\nTo the Editor of the Times,\n\nSir,\u2014I notice in your issue of the 23rd September, a letter addressed to the subject of Brewery Licenses. I would be glad to express a few of my views on the subject. Your correspondent states that the legislature has no power to make any regulations that shall be sold in places licensed for the purpose, namely beer shops and saloons, and that it cannot be the intention of the Act of a license being granted, but could distinctly state therein, that beer was only to be sold to travelers, and not to housekeeping families for private use only, and not for sale. Moreover a brewer's license contains the brewer's name only, and he may not retail any beer by the glass, therefore a brewer's license does not constitute a licence being granted for saloon purposes.\n\nAs regards the Indian population, the lawgiver very severely punished those who committed the offence of them with beer, and although I have known the Indians to go to the brewer's for beer after dinner, they were never found drunk at that time; and although they drank beer, they were quietly told how dangerous it was for them. A brewhouse would be of great assistance here, helping to keep out the bad influences which are so prevalent among the Indians, and would abolish the the use of extracts and essences which are present in such abundance among the Indians, and which would be of great advantage to the unmarred Indians, who have to do their own cooking. If the Indians were provided with a place where they could boil their tea, or if they had a small bag of beer, they would be able to make tea for their own use and that of others, instead of purchasing it from the traders doing the same trade, and thus saving them money. The Indians would be able to save money, and would be able to purchase goods which they could not otherwise afford.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that the brewhouses should be encouraged, and that the Indians should be encouraged to purchase goods which they could not otherwise afford.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nE. C.\n\nKicking Horse Pass.\n\nJust as we go to press we learn that the Kicking Horse Pass is now closed, owing to the snow which has fallen on the Devil's Head chain. This will only make a difference of about eight miles, and will not materially affect completion. (Signed) E. C.\n\nBAKING POWDER.\n\nROYAL\n\nABSOLUTELY PURE.\n\nThis Powder never cakes.
