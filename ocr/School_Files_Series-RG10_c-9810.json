(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 17, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Learns:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to Indian Education cheque No. 6433, being a payment of $6,000 to the Presbyterian Church for the Round Lake Indian Residential School property which was transferred to the Crown.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Presbyterian Church, in November, 1922, suggested a nominal price of $10,000 or $12,000 for the church property at the school. As was explained on the voucher, the property consisted of approximately 22 acres on which was situate the residential school, the barns and other outbuildings. The buildings alone represented an investment on the part of the Church of considerably more than either of these figures. The land is entirely in the valley and is quite valuable.\n\nIn the winter of 1923-24, a fire destroyed the classroom, which was one of the outbuildings. I learned that insurance, amounting to $2,000.00, was paid to the Church authorities. I immediately suggested that this amount be deducted from their lowest price and that the consideration for the property be $8,000.00. I discussed the question with Mr. Commissioner Graham, who is thoroughly familiar with the situation, and he considered this a fair adjustment and a satisfactory price.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWm. Learns, Esq.,\nAsst. Auditor General,\nAuditor General's Office,\nTransportation Bldg.,\nOttawa.\nRegina, Sask., June 29th, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honor to submit the following report of a visit which I made to the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lakes Agency on the 22nd and 23rd of the present month.\n\nFOOD (Round Lake Boarding School)\n\nI was present during the dinner hour and noted that the food supplied was ample and good food. The appearance of the tables after the meal showed a lack of judgment. There was altogether too much waste. At nearly every place there were large portions of meat, bread already buttered, pudding, etc. left over. This waste was so general that I had to comment upon it.\n\nGENERAL\n\nI regret that the Principal was absent as I would have liked to direct his attention to the conditions as I found them. I am of the opinion that his staff have not had the training or experience to enable them to carry on the work in the manner that it should be done at an institution of this kind.\n\n(Sgd.) W. Murison.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honor to submit the following report of a visit which I made to the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lakes Agency on the 22nd and 23rd of the present month.\n\nROUND LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL (Presbyterian)\n\nSTAFF\n\nThe Staff at this school consists of the Rev. R.J. Ross, Principal; his wife, Senior teacher; Mrs. Margaret G. Starrell, Junior teacher; Mrs. Munachers, Matron; Miss Otthon, cook; Mrs. Carlyle laundress; Mrs. Moss, seamstress; A. Moss, Farmer.\n\nI visited this school on the 22nd and found that both the Principal and his wife were absent in Ontario. Mrs. Ross had been called away a few days previous to my visit owing to the death of her father.\n\nAttendance.\n\nThere were 76 pupils present, 37 boys and 39 girls. They looked fairly healthy but in all my experience I never before saw such patched up and ragged looking clothing as that worn by the boys. The girls had better clothing but appeared listless and indifferent and had a frowsy look. They did not present.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\npresent the alert cleanly appearance that we have a right to expect in the pupils attending our residential schools.\n\nIn going through the school building I was oppressed with an atmosphere of listlessness in everything and feel that the members of the staff with whom I came in contact have not the qualifications necessary to manage an institution of this nature. I was told that conditions were better when the Principal and his wife were at home, but surely their absence for as short a time should not disorganize the routine of the institution.\n\nBuilding. A separate building providing two classrooms was built last year. This building is 40'x 48' and is heated with hot air. The classrooms are large, bright and cheerful looking. The ventilation is good and I am told that the building was quite comfortable during the winter months.\n\nMain Building. This building has been described so often that the Department are familiar with it. The exterior has not been painted since the building was repaired in 1922 and in consequence has a patchy appearance. The basement floor provides room for a kitchen dining room, laundry and furnace room. I found the kitchen clean. The dining room looked untidy and\n\nIf money is available painting should be done this summer.\n\nW.M.G.\nshowed a lack of orderliness. The laundry also was not in a well kept condition. Their equipment consists of a large power washer, a hand mangle and four set tubs. The first floor provides an office, staff sitting room and two playrooms. The second floor, girls' dormitory and staff bedroom, and the attic provides the boys' dormitory. Wash basins and sanitary closets are provided on each floor.\n\nThe interior walls are not clean. The bathroom walls are badly splashed and dirty. The girls' beds had white spreads on them and they looked clean. The boys' dormitory on the third floor is on a par with the girls' as regards condition. I noted that each pupil was provided with his or her own towel.\n\nSewing Room\n\nThe sewing room and store rooms are in the old part of the building. The sewing room was tidy and the work I saw in this department was very good. In the store rooms I found a large supply of new clothing. Two complete new outfits were being prepared for each pupil to take home for use during the holidays. The clothing in the store rooms seemed to be all jumbled up and the lack of orderliness was very evident in that department.\nWater Supply\n\nThe water supply is pumped from the lake into a pressure tank. The supply is abundant but I noted that the pump is not in good working order. There is a broken cast iron washer in the pump head and it appeared to me that there was a loss of about 50% in efficiency through leakage. The Principal supervises the care of the machinery and the need of a man who is competent to take proper care of this department is evident.\n\nFarm & Garden\n\nMr. A. Moss, a practical farmer, is in charge of the farm work. Their crop consists of 50 acres wheat, 50 acres oats, 60 acres barley, 25 acres green feed, 5 acres of potatoes and vegetables. The farm work has been well done. An improvement was noted in this department. They are well equipped with farm implements - excepting a drill and disc harrow which are done stock. They have 8 work horses, 50 head of cattle, 3 brood sows and 21 other pigs. They are now milking 12 cows among which are two pure bred Holsteins purchased last fall. After providing for the calves there are about fifty quarts of milk per day available for the requirements of the school which appears to be ample.\n\nThe farm stock is in good condition and has a well cared for appearance. Apart from the Holsteins the cattle are mostly scrub Shorthorns.\n\nFood.\n\nI was present during the dinner hour and noted that the food supplied was ample and good nourishing.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lake Agency by Mr. Inspector Murison.\n\nMr. Murison first deals with his visit to the Round Lake School, which is under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. You will note from the Inspector's remarks that he does not speak very highly of this institution, and it seems to me there is room for much improvement.\n\nThere is a matter also in connection with this report that I think should be brought to the attention of the Department. It is absolutely and entirely wrong for a Principal who has the responsibility of looking after 80 or 100 children, to leave the institution without advising the Department or this office. The building might burn down or accidents might happen, and so far as this Office is concerned we would know nothing about it. It is not until the Inspector goes in that I find out the Principal is away and has left the school in the hands of apparently incompetent help. At one time principals of schools were under the same regulations as regular officers of the Department, and leave of absence was granted through the Department. I speak very strongly on this matter. Something will happen some day, and we should at least know where our principals are and whether they have authority for being away from their work.\n\nIf the Department have any funds available I will have the school re-painted on the outside. I would say about $600.00 would do the work.\n\nThe report on the Cowessess School is encouraging and shows that everything is well looked after and that the children are getting a proper training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, July 9, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-9 of the 4th instant, enclosing a report of Mr. Inspector Murison which has reference to the Indian residential schools in the Crooked Lake agency. I am writing to the Rev. Principal of the Round Lake School, relative to absenting himself from duty without reference to the Department, and will have a further communication to you in connection with painting the exterior of the main building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 9, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to draw to your attention the advisability of officially reporting to the local Indian agent any proposed absence from an Indian residential school on the part of the principal. The Department deeply regrets the circumstances which made it necessary for you to leave the Round Lake Indian Residential School during the month of June; but we should be advised through our local representative whenever it is your intention to be off duty. The name of the officer who will be responsible for the institution should be indicated when such notices are being forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Am I to understand that I am still to be kept in the dark with regard to this matter? Are we to send Inspectors to these schools and find that the Principals are absent in Ontario or British Columbia? Surely the Department can come to some satisfactory solution of this problem. Why should not these men make application for leave of absence through this office and have it forwarded on to Ottawa?\n\nThe report on the whole was very unsatisfactory. You make no reference to this in your letter to me. I do not know how we can run these institutions properly if this is the way in which reports of this kind are to be dealt with. I find it difficult to carry on with as little support as I get with regard to important matters of this kind. I do not know if the Principal has even been reprimanded for the condition in which this school was found.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As this is my first absence from the school, I was unaware that it was customary for the principal to notify the Department of his intention to be away. I shall be careful to do so in future.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I wrote from Toronto to the Agent, reporting the absence of a pupil from the school owing to accident. He therefore knew of my own absence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nK.J. Ross.\nOttawa, August 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the Round Lake Indian Residential School. As you were informed in my letter of the 9th ultimo, I wrote to the Rev. Principal relative to absenting himself from duty without reference to the Department. Under cover of the 25th ultimo, he replied that he would be careful to comply with our wishes in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. K. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant #108-1-1, with reference to the Principal of the Round Lake School absenting himself without reference to the Department. I was perfectly aware of the contents of your letter of the 9th ultimo, but this, to my mind, did not clear the matter up, and I wrote you on the 22nd of July, pointing out that I would still be kept in the dark if this leave of absence was to be granted direct from Ottawa, and asked if the applications from Principals for leave of absence could not go through this office, as is done with regard to leave for all other officers in the field. To this you have made no reply.\n\nYou are aware that our Inspector visited this school and found the absent Principal absent. Had we known that he was away I would not have sent the Inspector there. Only a short time ago our Inspector visited Fort Alexander School for the purpose of conferring with the Principal regarding painting and repairs. He found the Principal absent. These are not the only cases where this has happened and it is very unsatisfactory and means a great deal of time lost. I have suggested a remedy, but for some reason you do not seem to wish to act on my suggestion, which is a reasonable one and would be applied in another business concern but the Indian Department. What I want to know now is this, is the leave of absence for these men to be recommended through this office or not. Kindly advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, September 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 504-ll of the 20th ultimo, with reference to principals of Indian residential schools absconding themselves from duty without permission from the Department. It is the practice of principals to acquaint the local Indian office and church authorities to inform the Department if a principal is to be away from his school for more than a few days during the academic year. There have been no complaints of late from any of our officers in Canada, except yourself, in this connection and it may, therefore, be considered that the present arrangements are satisfactory in the main.\n\nIt must be remembered that principals of Indian residential schools are employees of the various churches more than of this Department and more discretion and tact must be exercised in the prescription of rules and regulations than if they were on the staff of the Department.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to ask principals to acquaint us concerning absences during the holiday months of July and August. At this season, principals quite properly feel themselves more or less free from their more onerous duties; and as all responsible gentlemen, I feel it can safely be left with them to make satisfactory arrangements for the management of the schools during the vacation weeks.\n\nIf your office has in hand during the summer any activity which requires the presence of the principal of a school, it would be well for you to acquaint him with your plans and to ask that you be notified as to who will act as principal when he is not on duty.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegina, Sask. Sept 18th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector says about the Portage la Prairie School. I only wish all of our schools were managed in such an efficient way. We have too many inferior men in charge of our schools; men who have no idea of business, which is very essential in conducting institutions of this kind. At the Round Lake School our Principal has fallen far short of the mark. I regret this as the Indians on this reserve have not had a fair chance. This school should be called upon to do better work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I received a long distance telephone call today from the Indian Agent at Crooked Lakes, informing me that the Principal of the Round Lake School is incompetent to handle the lighting and pumping machinery at that institution.\n\nIn looking over Inspector Hurison's report on the Round Lake School, dated the 29th of June, I notice he remarks that a man should be supplied to take charge of this branch of the work. It is absolutely wrong, in my opinion, for the Department to put in these expensive plants and hand them over to incompetent men to run. I hear this constantly from the men who go to these institutions to install the plants; they usually come back and say that the men who are left in charge are not at all qualified to look after the machinery. It seems to me that the Department have not dealt with this matter seriously.\n\nBefore authorizing the appointment of men to handle the electric lighting, pumping and laundry machinery at our schools, even temporarily, the Department should make very searching enquiry into their qualifications, as incompetent men can in a very short time do irreparable damage to this expensive equipment.\n\nI have asked\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have asked Mr. Pugh to go down to the Round Lake School and look over the situation and make a special report.\n\nAlthough a very adverse report was sent in on this School by Mr. Hurison I have heard nothing at all from the Department with reference to it. I do not wish to appear to be too insistent in this matter, but it seems to me that a report of this kind requires action on the part of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A of the 11th instant, in which you draw attention to inefficiencies in the management of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I note that there is on the staff no one competent to supervise mechanical plant. As soon as you forward a report, following Mr. Pugh's special inspection, I will take the matter up with the Church authorities and will also draw attention to general conditions at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to state that I have recently visited the Round Lake School, and while there looked over the plant as instructed.\n\nThe Fairbanks engine has been installed and was running well when I was there. There is an extra pulley required for this but I understand this has been ordered. This is required to run the line shafting as this engine also supplies power for the washing machine and a water pump.\n\nI went into the care of the plant with the Principal, and he informs me that his is giving his personal attention to it, with two older pupils doing the regular running. He also states that in the event of a breakdown he gets assistance from Goldsby who is a good man with machinery. I might add that I have mentioned to Mr. Ross that he really requires a man to take care of the plant, and as I stated to you on the phone, I am of the opinion that if a good man was obtained to look after the light and water plant, that it would be economy.\n\nThe water pumping has given a lot of trouble, causing shortage at the building of water supply.\n\nIf it was decided that a man be placed there I would suggest that he had some supervision duties of the older boys, as I am of the opinion that the older boys under supervision, might be made much more useful, and their time occupied to good training advantage, both in cleanliness of premises, repairs etc., that are always to be found at an institution of this kind.\n\nWith the addition of another pressure tank for the water supply, which I understand has been ordered, I see no reason if a good man was employed there, why there should be any trouble with either of the plants at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Jno. E. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department #108-1-1 dated the 19th instant, I beg to enclose copy of a letter I have received from Mr. J.B. Pugh, Indian Agent with reference to the care of the plant at the Round Lake School, which I trust will enable you to now take up with the Church authorities the question of the proper supervision of their mechanical plant by a qualified man.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nCohowa.\nOttawa, January 5, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI regret to inform you that Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham, of Regina, has reported somewhat unfavourably concerning the Round Lake Indian Residential School. It is reported that the children are untidy and that the institution generally showed a lack of orderliness. I should be grateful if you would inform me if Rev. Mr. Ross is giving satisfaction to the Church authorities and I should be pleased if you could make suggestions concerning remedial measures.\n\nOur officers report that it would be advisable to have on the staff of this school a man who is competent to care for the mechanical plant. I do not suggest that an engineer be added to the staff, but I consider it necessary that one of the regular workers is qualified to supervise the electric lighting and water supply systems.\n\nPlease bring these questions to the attention of your organization and let me know if action leading towards more efficiency at this institution can be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H.

I will make inquiry in regard to the matters you refer to and will write you later.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HG\n\nIndian Affairs.

Enclosed please find\na copy of a letter she has written me today.\n\nThe W.M.S. seem well satisfied with Mr. and Mrs. Ross.\nThey feel that if they had been present when the inspection was\nmade, the report would have been different. However, I will\nwrite Mr. Ross as Mrs. Clark suggests and urge improvement\nwhere necessary.\n\nI understand that the Government is now improving the\nsewage system and the electric lighting plant. When this is\ndone, we are quite prepared to employ practical man who will\nsupervise the plant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HC\n\nIndian Affairs.

Edmison,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nThanks for copy of Dr. Scott's letter from Ottawa, re Round Lake efficiency.\n\nLast June Mr. Ross came east for General Assembly, the first time he left the work there since his appointment. In his absence, Mrs. Ross received a wire that her father had passed away very suddenly. She left at once to be with her Mother and a substitute teacher was provided in her place.\n\nThere was a disturbing element among the remaining staff that our W.M.S. asked to resign with a month's notice. During the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Ross, three Government Officials made an official visit to the school - Inspector, Agent and Nurse. Our Matron wrote me that the pupils were clean but were wearing their old clothes, which were patched but whole and clean. They were to leave for their vacation soon and she wanted them to wear their better clothes going away. She also said that the staff member who was asked to resign did not help matters but made the situation harder. This School has abundance of good clothing for every day wear, and also serge middy suits for Sunday. We send in each Fall sufficient for the year, with shoes included. If there is a shortage in any line the Matron writes us and we send in what is lacking. Of course the Inspector's report was not up to usual but I believe he made an excellent report on his next visit to the school.\n\nLast winter they had trouble with the sewage system freezing up and a shortage of water. Also the electric lighting plant was not adequate. This caused much discomfort to the staff and pupils. As the school is now owned by the Government I wrote Mr. Graham and pointed out these deficiencies and asked him to have them looked after before the present winter set in. I also wrote our Principal, Mr. Ross, and said he must have a handy man with mechanical ability to supervise all the plants and our W.M.S. would pay his wages if necessary, but he must provide the right kind of help. Mr. Ross is not mechanical, but has many other admirable talents.\n\nMr. Ross wrote me some weeks ago that Mr. Graham was helping them re sewage, better water supply and in some other ways. Mr. Ross was quite hopeful for the outlook for the future. They require the addition to the school which was to have gone on last summer.\n\nI would prefer that the Secretary of Home Missions write direct to Mr. Ross and find out from him how things are at this time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSigned- Adelaide Clark,\nIndian Secretary, W.M.S.\nOttawa, January 16, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 11th instant, concerning conditions at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I note that you are writing the Rev. Principal with a view to effecting improvements. I might point out that the sewage system and the electric lighting plant have been put in good condition and that a practical man should be added to the staff without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto (2) Ont.\nRegina, Sask., Jan. 8th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith the nursing report of a visit that was made to the Crooked Lake Indian Residential School in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nYou will notice that the dining room and tables are reported to be in an unsanitary condition. The nurse does not give details, but I imagine it is a lack of care on the part of those in charge which brings this report from the nurse. Just fancy a school of this nature being carried on without opening the windows. The nurse says that not one window will open at the present time, and that they have not been opened for six months. She also says that the kulsomining is not attended to, and only about half of the windows are screened. It is beyond me to know how a man could possibly go on and live under these conditions. The water supply is reported as being off. I may say that since this report was written we have had a new installation, and I hope that from this standpoint there will be no more complaints.\n\nThe classrooms are reported to be untidy, and the children are sitting with heavy coats on in their seats. I can just picture this Indian School. I have seen them before.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nStockholm, Sask., Jan. 29, 1926.\n\nJ.H. Edmison, D.D.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI received your letter of the 11th inst. re Round Lake School.\n\nAs soon as Commissioner Graham promised us an extension to our School, we began increasing our attendance. The result was that in 1925 we had the children but the extension was not built. We had to carry on with what accommodation and what conveniences we had.\n\nThen during my absence at the Assembly, Mrs. Ross' father died suddenly and she was called to Ontario. While we were both away, the official visit was made.\n\nI discussed thoroughly with Commissioner Graham the report of this visit, having him call in the inspector that I could question him. The result was that I advised Mrs. Clark (you were away at the time) to replace me with some person who would be in favor with the Commissioner. I had offended him by going away to the Assembly without asking his permission. I had offended him by trying to save one of the officials he had dismissed. And then I had this very adverse report to contend with. I was afraid that Round Lake would suffer and that the best way to help the school would be to get out. Mrs. Clark referred me to you.\n\nBy this time the inspector had spent another day with us and reported improvement, had made plans for the erection of three out-buildings, an ice-house, an implement shed and a poultry house, and had indicated to us that we were likely to get a lighting plant and also a large pressure tank for water. All these improvements have been made. The pressure tank is on the ground but not installed. I discussed with our matron the report as to the untidy condition of the children. She said they were wearing their clothing, much of it, for the last time, (the visit was made in June just before the holidays) and that she gave them new clothing for going home.\n\nWe have had a second man since December and he understands the mechanical part of the plant. He has been accustomed to electric lighting and steam heating in his own home.\n\nI have purposely refrained from writing you details of our work because I thought you were too busy. I shall be only too glad to give you information at any time.\nWe are following a very simple plan. We give the child what we think is best for him, and regardless of cost. For instance, this year we bought 25 barrels of the best Ontario apples. We give instructions, to the shoe manufacturer to give us the best article he makes having regard to the use to which we put it. We buy sleighs and toboggans and skates for them in winter and balls and bats in summer. We are trying to carry out the Department's instructions not because it is their instructions, but because we believe it is best for the child.\n\nI came here at your request to help out a situation entirely different from what I imagined it to be. I want to remain just as long as I can help satisfactorily but no longer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned- R.J. Ross.\nDuncan C. Scott, D.Litt., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy-Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nSince writing you before in regard to the situation at Round Lake, I have consulted with Mr. Ross, the Principal, in regard to the adverse report sent in. I have a letter from him today, copy of which (in part) we are enclosing. I trust this will help to clear things up.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/HC\n\nIndian Affairs.

The enclosure throws light on the situation which we have discussed. The Department learns with satisfaction that a practical man, who can supervise the mechanical plant, has been added to the staff at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. A. Clark, of the W.M.S., United Church of Canada, Toronto, in which she informs me that Mr. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School has advised her that Lulu Ironstar and Alex Sparvier have both passed their Entrance Examinations to High School, and that he is confident, if given a chance, these pupils would do well in High School. He points out that both are physically in good health.\n\nMrs. Clark would like to know if the Department would be prepared to pay the per capita Grant for these children for another year or two and allow them to go to some point where they could attend High School. Kindly advise me what the Department are prepared to do, if anything. This is all the information I can furnish regarding these pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 17, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 304-11B of the 10th instant, relative to the request of Mrs. A. Clark, of the W.M.S. of the United Church of Canada, for a tuition grant to enable Lulu Ironstar and Alex Sparvier, two pupils of the Round Lake Indian Residential School who have recently passed their entrance examinations to attend high school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will continue the usual per capita grant at the rate allowed for these pupils when they were in attendance at the residential school, together with an extra tuition grant of $50 each towards their expenses in attending high school. This will make a total grant in each case of $190 for the academic year 1926-27. This grant will be paid upon receipt of vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified by you, in favour of the parties to whom payment should be made. I shall be pleased if you will ascertain and inform the Department as to what high school these pupils will attend, also what provision has been made for their general oversight during the period of their attendance.\n\nPlease advise the authorities concerned of the grant allowed in order that they can make the necessary arrangements for both these pupils to enter high school when it reopens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nHis No. 304-11, dated February 18, 1927.\n\nOriginal on 108-1-5.\n\nRound Lake School\n\nThe work in the senior classroom at this school seems to be progressing favourably, but I agree with the Inspector that we should have a better qualified teacher for the junior room.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Principal's residence is not in use. Mr. and Mrs. Ross live in the school. This appeared to me to be a very poor arrangement as it required him to have his office, bedroom and living room all in the one small front office. It is nearly as crowded as some of the Indian homes. This is unnecessary and if Mr. Ross had a proper staff he would not be required to reside in the school.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit a short report on the Round Lake School, inspected July 7th, 1927. I also spent a few hours at this school on July 13th when inspecting the Ochapowace valley.\n\nHere, as at Cowessess School, all the children were home on holiday. The Principal, the Reverend R.J. Ross, was the only member of the staff in the building. He is assisted outside by a young man, a mission, who was employed as mechanic, but now is doing all the outside work as the Farming Instructor. Mr. Ross has left. At present the wife of this young foreigner is doing the cooking. She is unable to speak English.\n\nThe farm crops were weedy. I understand that considerable of the crop had been diseased in this spring, which is poor farming and certainly does not tend to improve the weed situation. I feel that where we are instructing young boys how to farm, that only the best methods should be employed. The grounds and gardens about the school were weedy and certainly needed attention.\n\nOn my second visit, Mr. Ross had secured another foreigner to assist with this outside work. I do think that sufficient help ought to be kept so that the work is properly carried on.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\ncarried on during the holidays, or else that half the boys be retained while the other half take their holidays, and in this way keep the work up to the mark so that one need not be ashamed of it.\n\nThe new barn allowed was practically finished and the work appeared to be well done. This building adds greatly to the appearance of the yards.\n\nThe chicken house and ice house have never been painted. These, and a small stable near the Principal's home, should be painted. The chimney in his house is also in poor condition and not safe; it will need to be rebuilt. Mr. Ross intends to live in this house after the holidays and would like this work done before they move in.\n\nThe school building, with the exception of the old wing, is in good repair except for some work needed on the plaster in the dormitories and play rooms. This work would not cost much and perhaps could be best done now while the children are absent.\n\nI received complaints while on the reserve as regards the way Mr. Ross sent the boys home for holidays. They were furnished with one suit of combination overalls, one shirt, cap, boots and one pair of stockings. The parents claimed they were unable to take their children any place in such clothes. I do think the Principal might furnish these boys with a decent suit with which to go home. I do not say he need give them their best but they surely have a second best which they might at least have.\n\nThe bridge which crosses the river just outside the school gate is a source of worry to the Indians. They claim Mr. Ross allows the children to play on it and\non it and are afraid of an accident. Mr. Ross resented my request that the children be kept off this bridge. He says they spend many pleasant hours on it. I do not think he realizes his responsibility in the care of these children. A bridge is no place for any child to play and I strongly advised Mr. Ross to see that in future no children played on it.\n\nA new teacher has been engaged for the junior room, and I believe Mrs. Ross intends holding the senior room. Mr. Ross suggested that his wife would likely be matron as well as senior teacher. I admitted to Mr. Ross that Mrs. Ross could quite well fill either position but I felt she could not do both satisfactorily. If she tries to carry on both, either the children or the work will be neglected, or else part of her work will be pushed unto others. I believe a full staff is necessary at these schools and that well qualified people should be employed. If Mr. Ross moves into his house, I fail to see how Mrs. Ross could teach, do the duties of a matron, and also keep her own home. I understand the following members of the present staff have resigned:\n\nMrs. Runniger - Matron.\nMrs. Ross - Sewing Teacher.\nMrs. Huson - Kitchen Teacher.\nMr. Smith - Junior Teacher.\nMr. Ross - Farming Instructor.\n\nTwo of these positions have been filled, namely, Junior Teacher, and Sewing Teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., July 25th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the Round Lake Indian Residential School by Mr. Inspector Hamilton. You will note that at the time of the inspection the children were absent on holidays.\n\nIt seems to me that of all places where an effort should be made to have clean farms it is at the Indian schools where they have so much help, and the Inspector has drawn Mr. Ross's attention to this important branch of the work. You will note that the barn is now completed with the exception of painting, which work is being done at the present time. I have instructed the Agent to see that the chimney on this house belonging to the Department is rebuilt. We cannot take any chances with defective chimneys. The old wing at the school referred to as being in bad shape is well known to the Department. If the school is ever enlarged this wing will have to be taken down.\n\nI think the Inspector acted quite properly in drawing Mr. Ross's attention to the anxiety of the Indians regarding their children playing on the bridge. I am writing to him saying that the children should not be allowed to play on the bridge.\n\nThe complaint\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe complaint about the Agent sending children home in a ragged condition is one that I think the Indians have good grounds for. It seems to me extraordinary that Mr. Ross does not try at least to satisfy the Indian parents in a matter of this kind. It makes recruiting so much easier, and creates a better attitude towards the school.\n\nI think the Department should insist on having a Matron at this school. We are paying a high grant here and Mrs. Ross cannot act as teacher and matron any more than anybody else can in these large schools, more particularly when she is living outside of the school. I should like to hear from the Department on this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJuly 29, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI wish to inform you that I have received reports with reference to general conditions at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, which lead me to believe that the present staff is inadequate. It appears that Mrs. Ross, the wife of the principal, is not only senior teacher, but matron. I am convinced that a great many of the difficulties at this school would be overcome if you could add to the staff a lady worker, who would be qualified to supervise the domestic activity. I should be very grateful if your Society would take whatever steps are necessary to this end.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. E.

Mrs. Ross only supervised the matron's place until a suitable one for the position could be secured. It was not her desire to do so permanently only to help out in an emergency. She absolutely declined to carry on as matron. Mrs. Ross will devote all her time to her school work of which she has been most successful. Word has reached me recently that the pupils who were sent up for entrance exams this summer have both passed with honours.\n\nDuring the month of June I visited Round Lake among the other schools under the supervision of our W.M.S. I was well pleased with the work carried on in the Institution and pointed out to the Principal the necessity of having a competent head over each Department. I presume it would be more difficult to carry on effectively during holiday time and building operations going on with shortage of staff.\n\nKindly convey the contents of the above to Dr. Scott.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(signed) ADELAIDE CLARK.\nOttawa, August 10, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 5th instant, concerning the appointment of a matron at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to learn that your Society has already taken this action, as we were convinced that it was necessary in the best interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

BRANDON,\nTravelling Nurse, dated January 17, 1928,\non her visit to the Round Lake Indian Residential School\n\nOriginal on #108-1-13.\n\nThe classrooms were clean and orderly. I beg to mention that the teacher in the senior classroom seems to be in charge of all matters as regards the condition of the building or I may say housekeeping, also the staff, and is a most efficient and capable lady, but works all the time, whereas a matron could look after the condition of the building much better and do some disciplining. The lady in sewing room is not a teacher as she is kept busy patching and mending all the time. There is a very nice Romanian woman in the laundry, the wife of Louis the farm instructor, who is a servant, not a teacher. She is just learning the English language.\n\nThe number of girls old enough to do any kind of heavy work is small as two at least are in the classroom all day.\n\nMrs. Herron who assists Mrs. Ross would appear quite capable to take over the work in the school and direct the care of the children under the Principal.\nOttawa, January 31, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nLast summer the Department discussed with the church authorities the advisability of appointing a matron at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, so that the time and energy of Mrs. Ross might be applied solely to the classroom activity. We were assured at that time that a matron was appointed. Travelling Nurse Brandon's recent report, however, reads in part as follows: \"The teacher in the senior classroom seems to be in charge of all matters as regards the condition of the building and the staff. . . . She is a most efficient and capable lady and works all the time; whereas a matron could look after the condition of the building and some of the discipline.\" This suggests that Mrs. Ross is still matron; but, before writing again to the church authorities, I wanted to have a report from you and a recommendation as to how the work could best be apportioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nMr. Russell J. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI thank you for your courtesy in writing me of the appointment of a matron at Round Lake Indian School.\n\nWe appointed Mrs. Margaret Heron to the staff of the school in July 1927. We started her on a matron's salary and expected that in a month's time, as soon as we were sure she was making no mistakes, she would undertake the full responsibilities of matron.\n\nWe also appointed a dietitian to take charge of the kitchen. This young lady, however, disappointed us, going to the university instead. We then put Mrs. Heron in charge of the kitchen and gave her the young wife of our farm instructor to help her. After some delay, we secured a suitable officer for the kitchen, but she was not accustomed to institutional work and it was necessary to leave Mrs. Heron with her for a time.\n\nThen the lady in charge of the laundry resigned to prepare for her approaching marriage. Mrs. Heron had to remain in the laundry for a time until the lady we placed in charge there became accustomed to the working of that department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHerou gave close supervision to these two departments until she had them running smoothly. At the same time she undertook more and more of the matron's duties. For instance, at the New Year, she took over the Dispensary work and the cleaning of the building. At the beginning of February we asked Mrs. Herou to assume full responsibility as matron.\n\nAlthough Mrs. Ross was doing double duty during this time, she did not receive a cent of extra pay. Her reward came in the satisfaction she experienced in getting things done.\n\nWe are sorry if our method of meeting a difficult situation does not meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.J. Ross.\nOttawa, February 10, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the position of matron at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I am glad to have your explanation concerning the difficulties you have had and I trust that the school will be much benefitted by the arrangement that you have lately made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRossell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nMarch 1, 1928.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nThe Department has recently received a report from one of our inspectors concerning conditions at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, and I am satisfied some changes will have to be made before really successful work can be expected. Mr. Heron, the teacher in the junior classroom, is without professional qualifications, and our inspector is doubtful of his ability to make progress. There is a very large class in the junior room and an expert primary teacher is required. The farm instructor appears to be quite capable of doing a good job, but is reported as wholly incapable of giving proper instruction to Indian boys. The stockman is a young Scotchman, who has had practically no previous experience with a milch herd. The woman in charge of the laundry is now learning to speak English and, of course, cannot be a capable instructress.\n\nThe report, on the whole, is rather discouraging and the Department is taking steps to effect some improvements in connection with the building and other physical equipment. It is the opinion of Mr. Commissioner Graham that some of the unsatisfactory conditions should have been noticed and the necessary alterations made by the Reverend Principal, himself.\n\nI believe the Rev. Mr. Ross could show much better results if he had an efficient staff under him and I should be grateful if you would take whatever steps are necessary to this end.\n\nI understand Mr. and Mrs. Ross live in the school building. You will remember that the Department purchased the MacKay residence for the use of the Principal. I believe that the appointment of a proper staff at this school would make it possible for Mr. Ross to purchase this house which is quite suitable for the purpose. You might bring this matter also to the attention of those responsible for the conduct of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. G. E.

As doubtless you know she superintends the Indian work for the Woman's Missionary Society or the United Church. She has agreed to notify Mr. Ross, Principal at Round Lake, that he should take steps without delay to secure an efficient staff in connection with this school.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory to you,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

Clark,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mrs. Clark:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant and also a copy of Dr. Scott's letter re the inspector's report on the staff at Round Lake. You have asked me to deal with the situation, and I am doing so by acceding to Dr. Scott's wishes as much as possible.\n\nMr. Donald Heron belongs to the very finest type of young Canadian manhood and the Indian boys and girls have had a great privilege in associating with him. But he has, as you say, no normal training. I am therefore taking steps to put a fully qualified teacher in his place. It will likely take a month at least to make the change.\n\nThe young Scotseman who was looking after the stables was working under the direction of the farm instructor. This young man expects to leave in two weeks' time.\n\nMrs. Louis Bartha has been working in the laundry under the close supervision of our matron who reports that her work is very satisfactory. She is the wife of our farm instructor. But she does not speak English well. I have therefore offered the position to a young woman in Manitoba.\n\nMr. Louis Bartha is in many ways the best all-round man we have had as farm instructor. He is industrious and thorough and prompt. He has been here now nearly a year and a half. At first he appeared to be diffident about exercising his authority over the boys. That may be accounted for by the fact that he was subordinate to Mr. Moss. He has however lost his diffidence and is making the boys toe the mark.\n\nWe very often employ an extra man or two in order to let all the boys have a half day in school. We think we have reached the stage where we should have two men permanently. With this object in view, I have been in communication with some likely men and am now waiting a reply from an Ontario man who is highly recommended.\n\nFear of fire more than anything else has kept us from enjoying the comforts of the home purchased for us by the Department. We have already extinguished two fires in the main building. These both took place, however, during the day. If it were not for the kindness of our staff in doubling up, two using the same room, we should be compelled to occupy the principal's residence.\n\nMrs. Ross is gradually improving. She was downstairs for the first time yesterday but we had to carry her back again. There are no fresh cases.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(signed) R. J. ROSS.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This shortly and\nexactly describes the Principal's present method of\nmanagement which is well known.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nA departmental auditor visited the Round Lake Indian Residential School on the 8th ultimo and found considerable difficulty in making a proper audit owing to the manner in which the books are kept. His remarks in this regard are, as follows:\n\n\"It should be mentioned that Mr. Ross lacks business experience and is not very methodical in recording the school business; no files or folders are used to keep vouchers, invoices or cancelled cheques, but they are scattered about in different drawers, baskets and parcels, and are not in order of date, consequently, to make a detailed audit for the fiscal year at this time was not considered.\"\n\nThe Principal never balances the Bank Account or records outstanding cheques. During long periods when deposits are not made, he continues to issue cheques and, in order that the Bank account be not overdrawn, he phones the Bank to transfer a sum from his personal account to the Trust account to cover the cheques issued. Exchange is hardly ever recorded, either of cheques paid or received, and, at present, there is an apparent surplus, presumably his own money, of $127.48.\n\n\"If there was cash on hand at March 31st, then the surplus would be increased by such an amount, but Mr. Ross does not remember whether he had cash on hand at that time and, when questioned, could not say how much the Trust accounts owed him. Two Trust accounts are kept as shown on Bank Adjustments - one a Savings Account (in the name of the School) and the other a Current Account, and when the latter becomes exhausted, he phones the Bank to transfer from the Savings A/C.\n\n\"The entries of expenditures in the cash book are not made from the cheque stub or when the cheque is written but are entered the following month from the cancelled cheques when they are returned from the bank. In order to save storage and demurrage charges on supplies hauled by rail to Stockholm, the nearest\n\nRev.

I also left him in regard to certain matters in regard to the keeping of the books, filing invoices and other documents, retaining copies of deposits or a deposit book, and the discontinuance of transferring his own money to the Trust accounts and leaving blank cheques signed with other people.\"\n\nIn his report for the month of May on the Round Lake School, Mr. Agent Ostrander comments, as follows:\n\n\"General management very good but, in my opinion, too much of the Principal's time is taken up with work which should be the farm instructor's and the Principal does not have sufficient time to devote to the real work of a principal.\"\n\nThe Department trusts that the Home Missions Board will give early consideration to the above reports of our officers and it is hoped that the condition mentioned in our Agent's report will be remedied.\n\nIt is desired, also, to direct your special attention to the last paragraph of our auditor's report.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 11th, 1929.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have your letter asking certain questions regarding the administration of an Indian residential school. I note that you have recently been appointed to the staff at our institution at Round Lake.\n\nThe per capita grant of $155 per annum is for the school's current expenses and the Principal must be prepared to account for the school's finances whenever requested by either the Department or the Missionary Society that is associated with us. The amount of the grant is determined by the average attendance. The school's books are not open to the public but, of course, may be shown by the Principal to any whom he wishes.\n\nIt is the Department's intention that the half-day system be in use at all Indian residential schools, i.e., one-half day in the classroom and the other half in one of the vocational departments.\n\nThe Indian Agent or the Principal of the school must secure the permission of the Department before formally admitting children. Those under the age of seven cannot be compelled to attend. The authorities of the school or the Department's representative may refuse holidays to pupils for disciplinary or other reasons if they consider it in the best interests of either the pupils or the school. A classroom teacher in an Indian residential school must teach whatever children the Principal admits. He is responsible to the Department. A classroom teacher's work is under the supervision of the Principal of the school, of the Department's Agent or other representatives, and of the Provincial Public School Inspector who visits the classrooms at our request.\n\nIn future, I believe it advisable for you to direct your questions to either the Principal himself or to the Indian Agent. Both are acquainted with the Department's wishes and regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Lucy Affleck,\nStockholm,\nSask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., 11th September, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the schools of the Crooked Lake Agency, inspected during my stay at the agency between August 29th and September 6th, 1929.\n\nRound Lake School.\n\nThe senior classroom is in charge of the Principal's wife, Mrs. Ross, and splendid work is being carried on under her supervision. The grades in this room range from Grade 3 to Grade 7 and the roll calls for 39 pupils. The child-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nchildren are well along in their grades, and I believe are making good progress. The classroom was clean and neatly kept, but the walls and ceiling are badly in need of kalsomining, as they have become very dark due no doubt to the smoke from the furnace.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Miss Afflick, who is a qualified experienced teacher, and I think the Department can count on much better work being done in this room than during the past few years. There are 27 pupils in grade 1, 8 in Grade 2 Jr., and 7 in Grade 2 Sr. This room is also badly smoked and would be much brighter and more cheerful if the walls were kalsomined white.\n\nIn addition to the two teachers and the Principal, the staff consists of a sewing room teacher, Miss Rown; Laundry Matron, Miss North; Kitchen Matron, Miss Joury; Farming Instructor, Mr. Bushnell, and Assistant Farming Instructor, Mr. Harvour. I am inclined to think that the lady members on the staff are the best qualified Mr. Ross has had in his employ since I have been inspecting the school. With regard to the farming instructor, he is nothing more than a green Scotch boy about twenty years of age and has been out in this country about two years. I would say that he should be receiving instructions instead of giving them. Mr. Harvour, I understand, is an Englishman, recently out from the Old Country, and he did not impress me favorably, and I would say that he has no qualifications which would entitle him to a place on any school staff. As a labourer, he would perhaps prove satisfactory.\n\nThe barn and out-buildings were in good repair. However, I noticed on going into the barn that two of the horses were loose and crowded in a narrow feed-way; while hay forks were standing here and there in places where they could easily be knocked over and stepped on. This, of course, points - to lack -\nto lack of supervision or lack of competent men to so instruct\nthe boys. I would again point out that at present there is no\nmatron in charge and this is noticeable at every turn, as is the\nlack of a proper farming instructor and engineer. I understand\nthat during the past year Mrs. Ross's mother acted as matron,\nbut she left when school closed for the holiday season. Mr.\nRoss did suggest making Mrs. Ross matron and securing another\nteacher for the classroom. As matron, it would be necessary for\nMrs. Ross to continue living in the building, but certainly some\ndifferent accommodation should be provided other than that which\nnow exists. At present the Principal and his wife are living in\na room which is supposed to be the office, and which I pointed\nout to Mr. Ross could neither be called an office nor a bedroom.\nHis desk was littered with tools, belts, wrenches, paper, and\nnumerous other articles; while on the back of the door hung\nclothes belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Ross, which made it almost\nimpossible to find the door knob. The rest of the room was in\na similar condition. We must, however, admit that, if Mr. Ross\nwill not live in the house which the Department provided at con-\nsiderable cost, we cannot expect a room 12 x 16 feet, used as an\noffice and living quarters, to be always in shape to be used as\na reception room. I think the Department will agree that this\nis not a satisfactory arrangement, and that the Principal should\nhave proper living accommodation as well as an office suited to\nhis position.\n\nThe sewing-room is in the old building and is\nheated with a box stove. It was impossible to tell in what con-\ndition the chimney is, but I would suggest, as this part of\nthe building is very old, that a new chimney be built on the\nNorth of the school, which would make it safe and would allow\nanother stove to be used in heating a room where the washing\n\n- could be -\ncould be hung to dry. The laundry is very small and cramped. The power washer is in bad condition and is liable to give way at any time, as the wood is badly rotted. The question of drying the clothes again presented itself. I have no doubt if a drier were installed it would greatly assist, but until Mr. Ross is prepared to place a proper man in charge of the machinery, I do not feel justified in recommending the purchase of any expensive machinery. There is a room in the old building referred to above which could be used as a drying room if a new chimney were erected.\n\nBoth the boys' and girls' dormitories have been painted and kilnsmoked and these were in excellent condition. I might however point out that the girls' dormitory is overcrowded. The Principal informed me that at present there are eight girls for whom he had no beds and four other girls will be returning soon, which will mean that there are at least one dozen girls for which some provision will need to be made. This accommodation cannot be obtained in the present girls' dormitory, as it is now filled to capacity. The only other available space is in the old building, which might be made habitable.\n\nMr. Ostrander informed me that on his visit the previous week to the school Mr. Ross was busy trying to repair a number of the toilets which were not in working order. I was surprised to find on our visit that he was still busy at this job, and that a number of the toilets could not be used. I believe a lot of the trouble is due to carelessness on the part of the children, and I have no doubt that if a proper mechanic were on the job that no trouble would be experienced in making these repairs. In trying out the toilets on the various floor of the building, I found no water supply. I might say that I was informed by one of the members of the staff that such is the condition a great part of the time.\n\n- MR. ROSS -\nMr. Ross explained that water was pumped night and morning, but that on some days more water was used and, consequently, at times no pressure existed. No doubt this condition exists due to the fact that all this work falls on the Principal, who really cannot attend to everything. I pointed out the necessity of always having plenty of water, and asked Mr. Ross what he would do in the case of fire. His reply was that it was only a matter of a few minutes to start the engine and get 20 pounds pressure which he considered sufficient. I had the pump started and in about ten minutes when the pressure reached twenty pounds, I tried the fire hose on the ground floor and found that the pressure was not sufficient to force the water up to the roof of the school. The hose was then shut off and I requested Mr. Ross to increase the pressure to at least 75 pounds, but before it reached 30 pounds the belt came off and on examination I found it to be too slack and to have the lacing at two points partly broken. On further examination I found this belt to be past repair and it certainly should be replaced. In fact all the belts in connection with the engine and dynamo are too slack, and I would say the plant needs a general over-hauling. The department will perhaps recall that a stand-pipe was placed in this school a year ago in order to give better water protection in case of fire. It can be readily seen, had a fire occurred previous to my visit, how useless our equipment would have been when it was impossible to get pressure sufficient to put the water on the roof of the building. I also pointed out to Mr. Ross the condition of the boiler room, where undoubtedly the greatest danger of fire exists, and he made the remark that it was in a much better state than usual. I do not think Mr. Ross is really aware of the condition in which we expect these buildings to be kept, and I am more convinced than ever that it is only by having a man qualified to do this work that the...\nDepartment can feel that the school is in the condition that it should be in.\n\nThe fire escape from the girls' dormitory on the west side of the building is so situated that a child in sliding down the pole can hardly avoid coming in contact with the railing along the steps leading into the boys' playroom. This railing is about six or eight feet off the ground, and a child striking it coming down as swiftly as they do is liable to meet with an accident. I would suggest that this fire escape be moved North to the next window which would then give plenty of clearance to anyone coming down the escape. The pole of this fire escape is secured at the top by a brace against the school. This brace I found to be detached and the pole was swinging free. I pointed this out to Mr. Ross, who was aware of it, but as this fire escape has not been used for fire drill he has neglected fixing it. Since the return of the children, the Principal has had no fire drill. Upon my request this was carried out, but, as a number of the staff were unaccustomed to the proceedings, it was necessary that they be told and consequently I did not consider that the drill was a real test. I instructed Mr. Ross and the Agent, Mr. Ostrander, to have fire drill regularly, so that in case of necessity the children and the members of the staff would know exactly what to do.\n\nAuthority was granted a year ago for the purchase of material for the erection of a root cellar, which no doubt is badly needed at the school. The work I understand was to be carried out by the school authorities. As yet this cellar has not been built and what few vegetables they have had have necessarily been stored in the old cellar which is in the basement of the school and adjoining the dining-room. Although the school will have no great quantity of vegetables this year, I think this work should be proceeded with at once, so that it will - not be -\nnot be necessary in the future to use the store-room in the basement of the school.\n\nThe yards around the buildings were tidy, but there has been no effort made on the part of the Principal since I have visited the school to seed down any of the grounds in an effort to beautify and improve the surroundings. Immediately in front of the school the ground is used as a vegetable garden, which is also the case at the side, except for a small triangular block which is used as the girls' playground. I noted that the children's playground had little equipment for their amusement, and I was informed by some of the members of the staff that practically no supervision is given to the children in regard to amusement.\n\nThe crop threshed this year was very light and amounted to about 400 bushels. At the present time ten cows are being milked which should supply sufficient for the needs of the school. Mr. Ross informed me that he was disposing of all the cattle except the registered Holstein stock. Shortage of feed made this necessary.\n\nIn discussing conditions with the Principal, he agreed that undoubtedly the fault lay in not having a properly qualified staff with which to carry on the work. He realized that a matron was necessary and also a first class man as farming instructor and engineer. However, he stated he was not prepared to pay more than $80.00 per month, and as long as Mr. Ross feels this way he cannot expect to get men who will assume responsibilities of this nature. Mr. Ross is a capable man, but it is impossible for him to act as engineer, plumber, and general repair man about the building, as well as farming instructor and stockman, and also carry on the general management of an institution such as this. In the majority of cases we find...\ncases we find principals assuming the general management of an institution and not actually going about in overalls doing the work themselves, and it is in such institutions that we find the best work being carried on.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nsir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nREGINA, SASK., September 25th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a report on the two Boarding Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency. This report was written by Mr. Inspector Hamilton and the inspection took place between the 29th of August and the 6th instant.\n\nThe report on the Cowessess School shows that everything at this institution is in first class shape and good work is being done.\n\nYou will take notice of the Inspector's remarks regarding the readers that are being used at this institution. I am not prepared to say whether they should or should not be used. The Department should, however, be aware of this fact.\n\nThe hog pen, which is needed, is provided for in the Estimates which have recently been submitted to the Department.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the Inspector's report on the Round Lake School.\n\nThe repairs required in the classroom have been provided for in the Estimates which have been recently forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nI would draw your attention to the class of men that Mr. Ross has employed to assist in instructing the Indian boys how to become farmers and citizens. To me it is almost a joke, and the Department should insist, without delay, to have these men replaced and proper men\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nproper men put in their place. Giving supervision of this kind is doing the Indian more harm than good, and he would be better off if he had never been to school, so far as receiving instruction in agriculture and the care of animals is concerned. I would ask the Department to insist on this change being made at once. The general conditions of the farm appear to be very bad.\n\nThere is also great room for a matron at this institution.\n\nThis school has never been satisfactory, and I consider Mr. Ross a very bad manager and not the type of man who should be in charge of an Indian school. He might be saving money, but he is saving it at the expense of efficiency.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the way Mr. & Mrs. Ross are living - in a little room overcrowded with their clothes. I also wish to direct your attention to the picture Mr. Hamilton paints of this man's desk. A poor example, indeed, to Indians or to a staff.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that a new chimney be built, we would first have to ascertain whether the existing chimney is defective. The plumbing and drainage at this school has always been unsatisfactory and always will be as long as Mr. Ross is there.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the unsatisfactory manner in which the Inspector found the fire apparatus, pressure tanks and pumps. I feel satisfied that we are taking a great risk in having Mr. Ross in charge of this school in view of the fact that he is so careless about everything. Anything that is broken about the place is let go until it is completely ruined.\n\nAuthority\nAuthority was granted to build a root house, it is true. The Principal has not taken advantage of this, and as there are very few roots around the place this year, I doubt whether it is needed.\n\nI would also draw your attention to the wages which Mr. Ross pays to a Farming Instructor - $50.00 a month. He could not get an ordinary boy for this. The question is, are the Department going to go on paying out money for this kind of supervision. I would suggest that a change be made at once. I have always thought we could well afford to close this school up and take the children to the Brandon School where they would receive proper attention, medical care and training. The United Church could establish a Mission at Round Lake and could look after their interests there, but the children could be sent on to Brandon. This should be seriously considered by the Church and the Department.\n\nI may say that I am in receipt of a letter from the Provincial Dept. of Public Health, complaining about the unsanitary manner in which Mr. Ross kills his beef animals. This is a further proof that all I say regarding this man's incompetency to manage an institution of this kind is correct. He can save money, but he cannot instruct Indians.\n\nI cannot recommend any alterations or repairs. The original building, which is joined on to the addition which was built a number of years ago, is unfit for school purposes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOctober 3, 1929.\n\nDear Mrs. Clark:\n\nI regret to inform you that there has been received a very unsatisfactory report concerning the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Principal Ross is trying to run the farm there and look after the mechanical plant, with very poor assistants. The result is that he has far too much to do, and I feel it is my duty to insist upon the appointment, without delay, of a properly qualified engineer. Such an officer, in the summer time, could assist the farm instructor and could take some duties in connection with the supervision of the boys. The water supply system, including protection from fire, the sewage disposal and machinery generally show the need of a competent man. Fire drill has not been practised regularly, and, at the time of our inspector's visit, one of the fire escapes was even partly detached from the wall. Of course, this condition of affairs cannot be allowed, and I know that you will take immediate steps. It is true that a competent man will demand a larger salary than Mr. Ross has been paying, but it should be provided.\n\nEarly in the spring, a proper farm instructor should be appointed.

I quite agree with you that Mr. Ross undertakes entirely too much work personally. There must be a competent man appointed to run the machinery, preferably an engineer capable of making any repairs to the plant from time to time as necessary and also that a farmer with much more mature experience in Canadian farming should be appointed before the spring, one who can thoroughly instruct the boys. I am recommending that these appointments be made as soon as possible, the most urgent being the engineer. We will insist that fire drill shall be regularly carried out.\n\nI entirely disagree with Commissioner Graham in his suggestion to close Round Lake School and transfer the pupils to Brandon. The pupils would eventually scatter and go to the nearest school. We would lose many to the Catholic School, being the nearest.

A.,\nNov. 15th, 1929.\n\nMr. Graham,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am addressing this letter to you in the interests of the children of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Stockholm.\n\nIn August of this year I was engaged as Junior teacher. On Nov. 8th I was dismissed by the principal, Rev. R. J. Ross, because of my \"disloyalty\" in writing to Dr. Barner, Toronto, the Superintendent of Indian Missions under the United Church, re conditions in the school which ought not to exist. May I report to you the situation as I saw it in my intimate association with the work for the past three months? It is difficult, however, to point out specific conditions that are outstandingly bad, as the entire administration under Mr. Ross is such that an atmosphere of suspicion, sordidness, and slackness exists throughout, due, I believe, to the indifference and inefficiency of the principal.\n\nI think, perhaps, the greatest lack from which the children suffer is the lack of a qualified and efficient matron, and farm-instructor. Mrs. Ross, who is Sr. teacher and who is in the school-room from 9.00 A.M. until at least 5.30 P.M. each school day, is the head of the matron's department. From last autumn (1928) until May (1929) her mother was matron, nominally. From May until October there was none. In October, the farm instructor's wife was given the position. She is quite inexperienced and of the type who is quite willing to be subservient to Mrs. Ross, doing any task to which Mrs. Ross assigns her in any department. She has nothing to do with the clothing of the children, with supplies for her department, or with the assigning of tasks etc. The children need a \"house-mother\" who would be intimately in touch with their needs both physical and otherwise, a woman with some vision and an understanding of children, and in control of her department. As Senior teacher, Mrs. Ross can not get time to act as matron, even if she had an understanding of their needs, which she certainly has not. The majority of the 78 pupils are young, 48 being in my department at school and so in Grades 1 and II only. Hence the need for a \"house-mother\" is greater. In all my 18 years experience as a teacher, I never had in my school a dirtier, more ill-clad - or more like-able - class of little folk. Yet, when I went to the\n\n- matron to -\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nmatron to talk it over with her, she said she could do nothing without going to Mrs. Ross about it.\n\nI do not know much about the farm instructor's department. When I went there the office was held by three young, ignorant, (very) immigrant boys, the oldest 22 years, two of them were dismissed shortly after and the other left on his own accord. They were most uncouth and illiterate and I know that there had been no other farm instructor for at least a year previous. The present farm instructor, an ex-gardener from Scotland, keeps the grounds, outbuildings, etc., very clean and neat, and makes a good janitor. He is absolutely honest, a good man, and good to the children, but very illiterate. He too gets all his instructions from Mr. Ross regarding the farm work etc. Neither he nor the matron know anything about the financial receipts or expenditures in their departments, of course. Knowing how very loath Mr. and Mrs. Ross are to spend money on clothing, fuel, supplies, repairs, etc., and how keen they are to increase the number of pupils attending (although ten girls are already sleeping double in the single beds of the girls' dormitory) and how little is raised on the farm, one cannot but suspect that there is a reason why the principal wishes to keep the control of all departments absolutely in his own hands.\n\nThere are a great many things about the school that spell indifference and slackness and that make for unlovely and unsanitary conditions. In the boys' dormitory, bath room, neither of the two closets can be used, an open pail being used. They will not \"flush,\" nor drain away and have not for months, so I tied them up to prevent their being used, as I supervised the children's work in that dormitory. The open pail has been in use for a year, but Mrs. Ross did not approve of my tying up the closets. She said, \"What will the Nurse say when she comes around.\" When not tied up, they look all right, you see. Of the 5 basins, only 1 has a plug and yet 26 boys wash. In the girls' dormitory (the \"show\" dormitory) the closets are almost equally bad. In the playroom lavatory, the single closet there has been completely out of commission for some weeks, all the children using the outdoor closets in all weather, at all hours. No combs are ever provided in either playrooms. Dining room conditions are very unlovely. The children sit on benches around bare tables, all their dishes being granite, \"chipped\" and ugly. A bowl of lard sits in the centre of each table. (no butter is ever used) - the lard is bought by the barrel) and the senior girls pass the bread around, carrying the big thick slices piled in their hands or arms from table to table. The tea (a cheap variety) is put on the table in big granite pitchers holding about a gallon. Only two tables (about 20 pupils) get milk. I do not know that the children are underfed and I think they get considerable variety. I do not think the food is well chosen, and it is most unattractively served. Breakfast always\nmeans porridge, bread and lard and tea - nothing else. When I asked the cook why so little porridge for each child (about 3 thps) she said, \"The children don't like it and besides the pot isn't big enough to make more\", I do not wonder that they do not like it. It is always \"stone cold\" when they get it, and badly made. The washing for the school (twice each week) is hung in the dining room to dry, from end to end. Children who leave Round Lake school will take away with them a very poor ideal of what a home should be. Of personal cleanliness and neatness they see very little. Of course, they get a bath and clean clothing once a week, but, after that, run wild for another week, with no one to care what they look like. Mr. Ross himself has complete charge of the foot-wear for both boys and girls, and he gives them the most ridiculous outfits. The little girls go teetering around in pumps with outlandish heels, or those old fashioned very high boots with high heels, sizes too large, or silly little sandals that won't stay on their feet - cheap lots that he buys for next to nothing, or second-hand misfits that come in bales. The boys have to wear theirs until they can scarcely keep their feet in them, with binder twine for laces, and garters, quite often. Of course, each child has a better outfit, the one he puts on for \"church\" and takes home with him at holiday time. To almost everything at Round Lake, there is the two sides, the side that goes in the report and that inspectors see, and the side that exists from day to day in the actual working out.\n\nThe staff at the school find conditions so unpleasant that they are constantly changing, especially if they are the better type of staff-member. The cook is leaving about the 20th of this month, and, when she leaves, only one member will be on the staff who has been there more than 3 months. Nothing is done to make it pleasant for the staff. We had to almost fight to get the furnace going this fall. The staff sitting room is occupied by the farm instructor and his wife, as their bed-room. Mr. and Mrs. Ross sleep in the office, where he also keeps his store of apples, oranges, candy, etc., which he sells to the children (buys apples by the box and oranges by the crate and sells them at double the price, and more). No one ever gets any use of the radio excepting himself. The car or truck never leave the place except when he drives (even to haul supplies in or out) and he never invites the staff to accompany him. More often than not there is no water on either dormitory floor. (Mr. Ross has sole charge of the engine).\n\nRe the education which the children get in the school, I need say little. It is a secondary consideration with Mr. and Mrs. Ross, secondary always to getting the work done in and around the institution. The children are in low grades for their years owing to the frequent change of teachers and the hiring of unqualified teachers in the junior room. They leave the school usually in Grades 3 and 4, and when Senior Grade 2 is reached, they are only half-day pupils. In the years since Mr.\nRoss has been principal, only one boy has gone through Grade VIII and five girls. I believe that the school education that a child gets who leaves school in Grade 3 or 4 to go back to the reserve is almost of no use to him. He has just laid the foundations and builds nothing on them afterwards.\n\nOf the religious training which the children get from Mr. Ross, I shall say nothing beyond the fact that it is little - very little more than the formal observance of many customs (as the family worship twice daily) prayers repeated in concert, graces sung before and after meals, etc. He has no oversight over the children in any way. Mrs. Ross is the disciplinarian, and she is right in her element there.\n\nRe the health of the children, I shall say little. There are several children needing medical attention, but I suppose a nurse will report such. There was no nurse visited the school in the three months that I was there. Dr. Allingham visited the school at more or less regular intervals, but his visits were purely formal. He examines only such cases as Mrs. Ross takes to him.\n\nI am sorry that this report has grown so lengthy. It has been most difficult to condense it and still give you a true picture of things as they are. As I said before, it is not so much that bad conditions exist, as it is that the children might and should be getting so much more than they are, with the same expenditure of money and effort. There is a lot of very fine \"human stuff\", second to none, in the Round Lake school, and I know that our Government desires only the best for them while they are its wards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Miss) Lucy L. Affleck.\n\nP.S. Until Tuesday next my address will be Y.W.C.A., Regina.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the 15th instant I forwarded to you Provincial School Inspector Winter's report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School, and in my covering letter made mention of the fact that Miss Affleck, whose work was favourably spoken of by the Inspector, had been in my office complaining bitterly of matters in connection with the management of the school. She had a great deal to say and I asked her if she would submit in writing anything she wished to have brought to the attention of the Department. I am now attaching a copy of her report, which I should be glad if you would read.\n\nThere is no doubt a great deal in what Miss Affleck says. Mr. Ross's management of this school has not been satisfactory. He is not at all cut out to manage an Indian school and there has been a continual change of staff ever since he took charge. He is apparently not competent to judge men, and as a result the institution has always been poorly staffed.\n\nI have read through various reports on this school and they have always been more or less unfavourable since Mr. Ross took charge. Sometimes the school inspectors give satisfactory reports on the classroom work, but as a rule the teachers will not stay any length of time as the surroundings are so uncongenial.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIn February, 1928, when forwarding Inspector Hamilton's report on the Round Lake School, I drew your attention to the fact that Mr. & Mrs. Ross were occupying sleeping quarters in the school, which I did not consider they should do, and in a letter dated March 2nd, 1928 you stated you were hopeful that with a proper staff Mr. Ross would be able to move into the McKay residence. You will see, however, from Miss Affleck's letter that Mr. & Mrs. Ross are still residing in the school, and are using for their sleeping apartment a room that is in use as an office and storeroom. Mr. Ross, I consider, is not carrying on the work as a Principal should at all, but is more like a puttering hired man. Everything about the place apparently is broken. The water works are out of order and they are having trouble with everything. They have never had a capable Matron there, and I am told that the new Matron who was appointed a couple of weeks ago is absolutely unsuited for the job. Writing letters to him and warning him that he must do better is only a waste of time, in my opinion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nNovember 27, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 304-11 of the 21st instant, enclosing copy of a report of Miss Lucy L. Affleck, concerning conditions at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. It is just possible that this teacher is somewhat disgruntled because she was discharged. Soon after her appointment, the Department had a letter from her, asking for considerable information, and, at that time, it was thought that she might be a bit of a trouble maker.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that conditions are not what they should be at this institution. I have recently been in correspondence with the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, and I am quite hopeful that new appointments on the staff will release Mr. Ross' time for principal's real duties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\nREGINA, SASK., Nov. 30th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th instant regarding matters in connection with the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI agree with you that it is quite possible this teacher is somewhat disgruntled because she was discharged. However, as you say, the fact remains that conditions are not what they should be. Mr. Hamilton saw Miss Affleck's letter, and says that there is a great deal of truth in all she said. His own report on this institution is not at all favourable.\n\nI note that new appointments are to be made at this school. One thing I would ask the Department to insist upon at once is that the Principal move out of the school to the residence provided for him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has been in correspondence with the church authorities, concerning changes in the staff at the Round Lake Indian Residential School and the re-adjustment of the duties, so that more of your time will be released for the functions of the head of the institution. There has also been discussed the advisability of your using the principal's residence and living no longer in crowded quarters in the school. I write to enquire if you are making arrangements in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nStockholm, Sask., Dec. 17th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th inst., No 108-1-1.\n\nAbout three months ago, Mr. Alex Young of Dubuc joined our staff as Farm Instructor. Before entering business in Dubuc, he had been a successful farmer. He is quite capable and is relieving me of all responsibility in connection with training the Indian boys in farming and the care of stock. He is assisted by his son who has had special training in running engines, tractors and cars.\n\nMrs. Ross and I occupied the Principal's residence for more than two years. We found it too far removed from the main building to be satisfactory. Our residence here does not interfere in any way with the accommodation for the staff as we occupy only the office. We prefer to be here because of the danger from fire. We had an incipient blaze just the other day. Then we like to keep a hand on the discipline.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nR.J. Ross.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWhen Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Indian agent at Broadview, was in my office a short time ago, he drew my attention to the fact that Mr. Ross, the Principal at the Round Lake School, was still living in the main school building, not having moved into the residence provided for him.\n\nIn your letter of the 2nd March, 1930, dealing with a report of Inspector Hamilton on the two schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, you stated that you were hopeful that, with a proper staff, Mr. Ross would be able to move into the MacKay residence. This he had not done when Mr. Ostrander was here. When the Agent visited him and spoke to him on the subject, he offered reasons for living in the main building, and Mrs. Ross, appearing while the Agent was talking to the Principal, stated that, as a member of the staff, she is entitled to live in the main building and she intends to do so. Subsequently, after Mr. Ostrander had returned to the Agency, Mr. Ross telephoned to say that he had decided to move to the residence, but the Agent is not able to state whether Mrs. Ross proposes to go with him when he makes the move.\n\nI think it is time the Department insisted upon the Principal living in the Principal's house which has been provided for him. I hope you will write him on the subject, and point out the necessity and desirability of his changing his quarters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting the Round Lake Indian Residential School\n\nFor the month of May, 1930\n\nROUTINE\n\nAt the time of my visit there were:\n\n79 pupils in the classrooms.\n\nAre the classroom registers kept up to date? Yes.\n\npupils in vocational training departments.\n\n2 pupils sick. (at school)\n\n0 pupils absent. Reasons:\n\nTotal number on roll: 81\n\nAre there any pupils in residence whose admission has not been approved by the Department?\n\nNo.\n\nHEALTH, SANITATION, Etc.\n\nAppearance of pupils: Neat and tidy and well clothed and fed.\n\nCleanliness of school: The school building was thoroughly clean throughout.\n\nAppearance of school grounds: There has been considerable improvement in the appearance of the school grounds during the past month.\n\nCare of the sick: The sick children at this school receive the best of care. There is a case of typhoid at the present time.\n\nThe children's meals: The children receive a sufficient quantity of good plain food at all times. I notice the cooking is excellent.\n\nFire drill, escapes and protection: Regular fire drill is held and the equipment is now in fair shape. Water pressure is always inadequate.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING\n\nDomestic Instruction: The girls receive some instruction in sewing, mending, cooking and housekeeping.\n\nInstruction in Farming and Gardening: In season, all boys receive some instruction in farming and gardening.\n\nTraining in the care of stock: All boys assist, more or less, in the care of the cattle, horses and hens. The school now has a fine herd of Holstein cattle, the boys assisting in their care.\n\nManual training: No manual training of any account is taught.\n\nCare of agricultural machinery and other equipment: The older boys assist in the care of the farm machinery and equipment, under proper supervision.\n\nGENERAL\n\nDiscipline at the school: The discipline at this school is fairly good, but would be improved by a suitable Matron.\n\nEfficiency of the staff: At present there is a complete staff who are fairly efficient in their work, but a suitable Matron is needed.\n\nGeneral management: The general management of this school is fair, but it seems to me that there is too much of the Principal's time taken up with non-essentials, although he works very hard.\n\nSuggestions: Organized games would be a great benefit to the children of this school. I have frequently seen pupils who were about the grounds or sit in a corner doing nothing and properly organized games would at least keep them busy.\n\nForm No. 217\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of a visit made to the Round Lake Indian Residential School by Agent Ostrander.\n\nI would again draw your attention to the Agent's remarks regarding the unsuitable matron at this school. This has been referred to several times, and it is a very important matter in my opinion. Apparently the Department have taken no notice of it; if they have, I have not been advised. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of the 17th of April, No. 304-11. I would ask the Department to deal with this matter seriously, and also insist upon the Principal of the school going into his residence at once. This is what he should do or there will be trouble later on.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 25, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of December 6th, last, and to your reply of the 17th idem, concerning the advisability of Mrs. Ross and yourself occupying the Principal's house at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Some weeks ago, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham wrote that Mr. Ostrander understood you were going to move into the residence. However, the Commissioner now states that he believes it is important that you discontinue living in the office of the main building. I write now to enquire if there are any developments in this connection and to learn of your plans.\n\nIt is also reported that a suitable matron would be able to effect many improvements in the general conditions at the school. I shall be glad to have your report and recommendation in this connection also.\n\nIn Mr. Ostrander's latest report, he writes that organized games would be a great benefit. He states that, during recess and play time, the children wander about the grounds or sit in corners, doing nothing. Please write a separate letter to the Department in connection with what games are popular at the school, and equipment will be forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nOttawa, June 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11 of the 16th instant, enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Ostrander's report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is today writing concerning the advisability of employing a suitable matron and reopening the question of the Principal living in the residence.\n\nIn connection with the second question, I may say Mr. Ross has written that he and his wife occupied the residence for more than two years. I quote from his letter: \"We found it too far removed from the main building to be satisfactory.

F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School, inspected on June 19th while on the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nThe boys' dormitory was clean. There are 12 windows and only 3 had screens on. The storm sashes were still on some of the windows. The cubic feet of air space figures to about 12,000 and the boys number 26. The toilets were not in working condition.\n\nThe girls' dormitory is bright and was clean, with all the beds neatly made. There are 11 windows with screens on 5, while on the others the storm sashes still remained. This room measures 12,160 cubic feet and at present accommodates 53 girls and in eight or ten cases two girls are obliged to sleep in a single bed. None of the toilets were in working order.\n\nNo screens are provided for the laundry which is small, and can only be ventilated by the windows. Screen doors are also needed for all outside doors, and the woodshed adjacent to the boiler room should be properly provided with doors and repaired.\n\nThe toilets throughout the building were out of working order, except the one in the staff bath-room. The children are obliged to use outside closets, which are very unsanitary. The girls use one, built on their playground about 75 yds. from the school. This is open all around the bottom. The boys are provided with one at the\n\nJ.M. Graham, Sec.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nbarns, and this is even in worse condition than the girls'. I think both these toilets should be destroyed and the toilets in the school put in proper repair. At present I consider the condition serious, as the flies are bad and have access to the filth and dirt as well as to the kitchen and dining room of the school.\n\nThe girls' play-ground is small. It is on the side of a hill and extends to the road near which the septic tanks empty and from which a very offensive odor was noticeable. The only equipment for amusement is a swinging platform, which I do not consider safe. This platform is about 12 ft. square and when in motion with 10 or 15 children on, it moves back and forth with considerable force. If a child falls off and is hit, serious results will occur. I have already seen two girls badly hurt. I think a new play-ground should be provided, as well as proper swing and teeter-totters, also a soft ball outfit. I also think these children should be supervised during recreation and taught to play wholesome games.\n\nThe class-rooms are both in need of interior painting, as they have become badly smoked and are dark and gloomy. The outside of this building should also be painted.\n\nA play-ground is being arranged for the boys. They have no equipment for amusement, and I understand are given little supervision during recreation. I think training along this line is essential, as a game fairly and honestly played is a credit to any group of boys, and contains a training which serves well at all times.\n\nThe fire protection is not good, as the new engine provided by the Principal is too small. It is impossible to get sufficient pressure, as the engine will kill down. I think as a rule, the pressure ranges from about 30 lbs. to 50 lbs. and at this it would be impossible to throw a stream of water on to the roof. A pressure tank, to be used for fire pre-\nprotection only could be installed and if properly looked after would greatly improve conditions. Mr. Sinclair, who is termed the mechanic, is really the assistant farmer and spends most of his time on the engine plowing. He is capable to look after the machinery, and boiler, as well as all general repairs about the buildings; but does not have the opportunity. Mr. Ross claims he cannot afford to keep a man around the building as mechanic.\n\nMrs. Young is still acting Matron. She really has no authority and takes all instructions from Mrs. Ross. Her salary I understand is $400.00 per year, while all the other ladies on the staff receive $500.00; so the Department can readily understand that a real matron cannot be secured at such a salary - less than the ladies she supervises.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ross still reside in the school. I understand they go across if any official happens along and, if necessary, Mr. Ross said they entertained in the home, but in no sense are they occupying it; nor do I think Mrs. Ross has any intention of doing so, as she claims she has a right to a room in the school, being a member of the staff. This home is well furnished throughout, and ready at any time to be occupied. The beds are all neatly made, the curtains clean, and the house throughout bright and cheerful. I doubt if Mr. and Mrs. Ross will ever consent to live in this home as long as she holds a position on the staff.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nI beg to enclose herewith Inspector Hamilton's report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School, which was inspected by him on the 19th June. The report, like former reports, is very unsatisfactory, and it seems to me that we are getting nowhere whatever with this school. It is certainly discouraging to myself and the Inspectors to go back year after year and find no improvement, although suggestions have been made to the Department.\n\nAt first I would like to draw your attention to the unsatisfactory air space in the girls' dormitory, which should afford twice as much fresh air per pupil. Two girls are sleeping in one single bed in several instances, a condition which Mr. Ross has been told time and time again not to have exist. You will note that there are several windows without screens, and that most of the windows in the dormitories still have the storm sashes on. The temperature in the valley has been anywhere from 85 to 95 degrees during the past couple of weeks. The toilets throughout the building are out of order. I think this is injurious to the health of the Indians, and if this condition of affairs were made known to the public, I think there would be trouble. The outside toilets are disgusting. There is no excuse for such a situation at all. How any man could see this before his eye every day and take no action is beyond me. The fire protection is not in good shape. A new engine was bought, but it apparently is not what is required. You will also note that the Matron is not satisfactory. We ought to be able to get a proper staff here. You have provided a residence for the principal of the school, and, I believe, furnished it, but he does not occupy it. This matter has been brought to your attention so often, but I feel I must do so again. The fact that he remains in a room 14 x 14, which is used as a storeroom, office, etc., indicates the type of man he is. I would ask again that you insist upon his living in the residence. I feel that if conditions are not changed at this school, we will have an accident at this school through fire or something else.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, acknowledging mine of the 16th, and advising me that the Principal of the Round Lake School states that he is now occupying the Principal's residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that at the present time he is not in the residence. Mr. Inspector Hamilton visited the Round Lake School on the 26th June and reports that he is not occupying the house. Mr. Ostrander in a letter to this office dated June 27th, states that the Principal has not moved into the house, that when some visitors come he goes over there with them for a time, but he does not occupy the house in any sense of the word.\n\nSince the receipt of your letter I have called up the Agent by long distance telephone, and he informs me that to date Mr. Ross has not moved into the residence.\n\nI hope the Department will settle this matter once and for all, as it is getting rather monotonous carrying on this correspondence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.

INDIAN AGENT OSTRANDER, FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1930, ON THE ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 108-1-7.\n\nGenerally, the staff are efficient in their duties, but the Farm Instructor's wife, who is acting as Matron, is not suitable for the position.\n\nThe general management is fairly good, but improvement is needed in some respects. There is now a good farming instructor and mechanic, but the Principal uses them more as labourers and does the farm instructing to a great extent himself.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. M.

INDIAN AGENT OSTRANDER'S REPORT ON THE ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE.\n\nOriginal on File 108-1-7.\n\nYou will note that the Agent again points out that a suitable matron is required. It seems to me this should receive the attention of the Department, and I may add that no competent matron will stay there until Mrs. Ross moves into her own residence.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nW. REGINA, SASK., 8th August, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nYou will recall that we have had a great deal of correspondence regarding Mr. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake School. For a year or more we have been insisting upon his moving into the residence provided and living there, and just recently you advised that final instructions had been given. In a report from Mr. Ostrander today he states that Mr. Ross is merely sleeping there. It seems to me that this has gone so far that some definite action will have to be taken. Mr. Ross apparently does not pay any attention to the various letters of instruction sent him in this regard.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner\n\nDuncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nI have discussed the desirability of a change in the management at the Round Lake Indian Residential School with Dr. Cochrane and the Rev. Mr. Beaton of the United Church Missionary Society. Dr. Cochrane seems satisfied with Mr. Ross' work on the whole and was not desirous of taking any drastic action. He informs me that it is probable Mr. Ross will leave Indian work in a year or so and I promised that the Department would be patient.\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Quebec.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring before you a matter in which there is considerable interest shown around here.\n\nThere is a small summer resort on the shores of Round Lake, in the Quapelle Valley, one mile from the eastern end of the Ochapaquace reserve. For some years these people have kept a small store open both summer and winter, mainly depending on the Indian trade, and from this derive a goodly share of their living.\n\nNow right across the Quapelle River from the reserve is an Indian school, a boarding school, in charge of which is a minister by the name of Ross, who for some years has been selling supplies to the reserve populace, at a great increase over cost price. Now this is greatly damaging both to the Indians and the trade of this small store, for when these ones bring wood or hay to sell at the Mission Mr. Ross induces them to take their pay in trade, where, as if he paid them cash they could purchase the same amount of groceries elsewhere and still...\nbe cash ahead due to the difference in prices charged.\n\nAlso when these Indians are hard up and needing groceries any person who gives them credit has to depend on the honesty of each Indian to pay their debts. While I've been told by people both outside and on the reserve that Mr. Rosses bills of outrage prices are collected in full and the other accounts ignored.\n\nThis Mr. Ross is supposed to be a minister of the Gospel and as such is receiving a steady salary that never fluctuates through hard times. And whereas there are only two in his family both receiving high salaries, this little store I spoke of is owned by an elderly couple the man being seventy-five, and they have one daughter and four grandchildren dependent on them, with the store their sole means of support during the winter.\n\nDo you think it fair or just that this supposed to be brother to all men should be allowed practice the profession of storekeeper, and exploit such exorbitant prices from his parishioners, as well as a salaried minister to them. If he has this right, then I'm nothing further to say, if not I only ask that you look into this and that keep to his own position and not seek to displace these honest storekeepers from their living. Also the Indians whom he is supposed to befriend but him cheat and continually complain of his unlawful sales.\n\nSusting you will consider this fairly. Remain\n\nYours respectfully Pearl J. Carter\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\nStockholm, Sask.,\nJan. 7th, 1931.\n\nMr. W. Graham,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to bring before you a matter of which there is considerable interest shown around here.\n\nI have a small summer resort on the shores of Round Lake in the Qu'Appelle Valley one mile from the Easterly end of the Indian Reserve Ochapowace. For some years I have kept a little store open both summer and winter for the Indian trade and from it am able to make a small sum of profit to help with our living. Now Mr. Ross have been selling the Indians groceries for sometime at big profit over the cost price and it is greatly damaging my trade for when they sell wood to the Mission he induces them to take there pay in trade where as if he gave them cash they could purchase the same amount of groceries elsewhere and he ahead some case on account of difference in prices. Now when these Indians are hard up and have no money and I let them have credit (through pity) I have to take a chance of there paying me at there land payment. Yet Mr. Ross's accounts with them are held out of there money for him. Now Mr. Ross is supposed to be a Minister of the Gospel and as such is receiving a steady salary, with neither decreases or stops this out hard times. While there are only two of them i.e. Mr. & Mrs. Ross both salaried, we are seven Mr. Grier aged 75 myself my daughter and four grandchildren, all dependant on me or my little store. Now is it fair or just that this supposed to be brother of all men should be allowed to practice the profession of store-keeper as well as minister of the Gospel to these Indians?\n\nIf he has a right to run a store and extort, exorbitant prices from his parishioners then I have nothing to say. If not, I would only wish that he keep in his own position as minister and not try to displace the one who only is a store-keeper. I wish you would look into this as these Indians are continually complaining to us of the high prices they have to pay. Personally I do not purchase from him. But on the reserve he is known on the \"Jew\". I trust you will consider this fairly.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSgd. Mrs. F. M. Grier.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., Jan. 8th, 1931\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter that I received this morning from Mrs. F. M. Grier, who carries on a little trading post on the banks of the Qu'Appelle River, opposite the Ochapowace Reserve.\n\nYou will note that she is complaining about the Rev. Mr. Ross, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, carrying on a trading business with the Indians of the reserve.\n\nThe Inspectors on previous occasions have mentioned this in their reports, and now that the matter is causing some feeling amongst the public, I think some action should be taken to prohibit Mr. Ross from trading with the Indians, especially if he is trading for cash. I can see no objection to their buying wood or hay from the Indians and giving flour, tea or produce in exchange, but if Mr. Ross is carrying on a trading post, as he is reported to be, I think this is unfair, and I believe contrary to Section 44 of the Indian Act.\n\nIt seems to me that this is a matter that should be dealt with promptly, and I should be glad to have your instructions. In the meantime I have written to Mrs. Grier, saying that I would communicate with her further on the subject at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

OSTRANDER,\nIndian Agent, for month of December, 1930, on\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nforwarded through Commissioner Graham's Office.\n\nThe discipline at this school is fairly good,\nbut the Matron is not very forceful. Some improvement\ncould be made by her asserting herself more.\n\nThe staff are now quite efficient in their\nduties.\n\nThe general management of this school is\nonly fair.\n\nI have several times pointed out the necessity\nfor some organized games at this school, to teach the\nboys self-reliance, manliness, fair-play and all the\nother qualities which prepare a boy for manhood, but\nonly a feeble effort has been made in this connection\nand I think a real effort is needed. There are now\nmale members on this school staff, who are well able\nto teach the games if they had the equipment and were\ngiven the time to do so.\n\"I have already told you that we sent seven children to Brandon last fall. One of these is attending the Technical School and the other six are taking Grade 9 work. Here is an extract from a letter written by one of these girls to one of her girl friends here, - \"Oh, yes, we got our Christmas Exam. marks at last and also the average for the term. There were only six that passed with honors. Edith came first in the class with an average of 81.6. Maud (File Hills) and Mary Belle came second with an average of 76.2. I came third with an average of 76.1; then Rossbelle, average of 75.7; next Martha with 75.6. (Five R.L. girls and one File Hills girl). Jessie came tenth, I think, with an average of 64.7.

The full number for which the grant is provided is 75 pupils at $160 per capita. The Department would have no objection to the school keeping in residence 4 pupils in excess of this number, in order that, in the event of any absentees among the regular grant-earning pupils, the school can draw the full per capita grant allowed - the extra number being for the purpose of replacing any absentees.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McKay, School Founder\n\nSTOCKHOLM, Sask., Oct. 8\u2014Established by Rev. Hugh McKay in 1884, the Round Lake Indian residential school this year marked the start of the second half of a century of existence.\n\nTwo months ago, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the school's founding, the Indians erected a cairn on the spot where the first school was built in 1884 just south of the present school building which is 15 miles south of Stockholm off the Ochapeawace Reserve.\n\nEntering its 51st year, the school, operated by the Women's Missionary Society of the United church, has seen through long years of Saskatchewan's side-long-building and is today a monument to the work of early pioneers.\n\nA few days ago a service was held marking the anniversary when 30 girls of the C.G.I.T. group attended the \"Rainy Day\" service held by Miss Kirkpatrick, director of girls' work under the Religious Education council and on Sunday Miss Kirkpatrick presided for Rev. William Ross. Mrs. Ross and Miss Ross Weywell are in charge of the C.G.I.T. group in the school.\n\nSTUDENTS WIN PRAISE\n\nThe old school has won recognition in several ways during its 50 years of service to the natives. The 76 boys and 45 girls who attend are mostly from the St. Sauveur and are from five to 16 years of age. Twenty of the girls went high praise from Sir Robert Borden's adjudicators at the Medicine Hat musical festival this year, as did their leader, Mrs. Therrien.\n\nCherrywood Fancy Colantha, too, has brought fame to the school. She is the purebred Holstein cow that won the grand championship prize at Yorkton, Portage la Prairie, Brandon, Regina and Saskatoon exhibitions in 1933, and which will be sent to England for the fair in Toronto soon. There is also on the farm a prize herd of Holsteins owned by the W.M.S. The farm buildings and property belong to the department of Indian affairs at Ottawa.\n\nREVIVAL BY INDIANS\n\nFor 25 years Rev. Mr. McKay was principal of the school, until 1922 when he retired because of old age. Devoted and loving to his church and to the Indians he served, there stands today a monument to his work. Built by the Indians themselves, the cairn was unveiled in the presence of a number of friends from Neudorf, Indians of the reserve, and Dr. Sahmara, a brother of Mrs. McKay, who spoke at the ceremony. Ex-chief Walter Ochapeawace spoke to the people through his interpreter, Joseph Bear.\n\nToday the following comprise the school staff: Rev. R. J. Ross, principal since 1922; Mrs. R. J. Ross, senior teacher; Mrs. W. Weywell, junior teacher; Mrs. F. W. Therrien, matron; Miss F. W. Therrien, night supervisor; Miss Lloyd French, herdman; Mrs. Lloyd French, cook; Miss K. Currie, seamstress; Mrs. Fred McKay (native), laundress; Walter Anderson, mechanic.\nOttawa, January 28, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, reporting on the circumstances in connection with the death of Percy Ochapowace, a pupil of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, who was frozen to death on the night of the 13th instant. It is noted that this boy's death has been thoroughly investigated by the Coroner; the R.C.M.P. and yourself and that the Coroner decided no inquest was necessary.\n\nIt is considered, however, that the Principal should have instituted an immediate search when it was discovered that the boy had left the school, more especially so in view of weather conditions. He should have informed the parents and yourself and instituted a search at once. The death of the boy, under the circumstances, is much regretted, and I would request that you convey to the parents the Department's sympathy in their loss.\n\nYour full report in the matter is appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

Murphy,\nSupervisor of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Percy Ochapawace - #822, Ochapawace Reserve\nCrooked Lake Agency\n\nYou have no doubt by this date received the report of Mr. Ostrander, the Indian Agent of the above Agency, giving information as to the death of Percy Ochapawace, the son of Walter Ochapawace of the Ochapawace Band. The father, Walter Ochapawace, has retained me to act for him in furthering a full investigation surrounding the unfortunate death of his son.\n\nIt is unnecessary for me to dwell upon the facts of the case at all. I might just add however that this morning I telephoned Dr. Allingham at Broadview, requesting on behalf of the father that an inquest be held on the death of the boy. Dr. Allingham flatly refused. Before taking any further action toward making a submission to the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan with a view of his ordering an inquiry, I am writing to you.\n\nMy client most certainly holds as do a vast majority of the Indians, not only on the Ochapawace Reserve but on the Crooked Lake Agency, that there should be a full investigation into all the facts surrounding the death of the boy and to clear up definitely whether there be any culpable or criminal negligence involved.\n\nWith that end in view I am writing to you and asking that there be such an enquiry and my client feels that the situation is sufficiently serious for an enquiry to be made that is not a pro-forma enquiry of an Indian Agent but put into the hands of some-one having no interest either direct or indirect.\n\nAccording to the information given to me, the Indians feel the situation keenly and they pointed out to me that this is the fourth death that has taken place on the Crooked Lake Agency since 1918 and none of them except perhaps it be this one, has there been any inquest whatsoever.\nIt is further suggested that the ends of justice in at least one of the cases should have been an enquiry of the most rigid character.\n\nTherefore, I specifically request on behalf of Walter Ochapawace, an investigation into the whole circumstances of the matter surrounding the death of this young lad with the evidence taken under oath and with a view, as stated above, of whether there is culpable or criminal negligence on the part of anyone.\n\nOwing to the state of public opinion on the Reserve, may I suggest that this matter be of precedence over others that may be before you and a definite reply sent to me as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neff, K.C., Barrister, Grenfell, Sask., requesting full investigation regarding the circumstances in connection with the death of Percy Ochapowace, a pupil of the Round Lake Indian Residential School (Crooked Lake Agency - Federal District of Qu'Appelle).\n\nBriefly - three boys absconded from the school on the afternoon of the 13th instant. Two arrived safely at an Indian's home, while the deceased, who separated from the other two, was frozen to death.\n\nThe first intimation the Department received regarding the matter was a communication from Mr. J. F. B. Ostrander, the local Indian Agent - a copy of which is attached. This gives very full information concerning the circumstances in connection with the boy's death. The Agent states the matter was thoroughly investigated by the Coroner, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and himself, and that the Coroner decided, after the investigation, that no inquest was necessary. The report of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also attached. It will be noted that this report substantiates the Agent's statement regarding the action taken by the Coroner. It will be noted, also, that the Coroner interviewed the boy's father before deciding an inquest was unnecessary. I attach, also, copy of\n\n- departmental\ndepartmental reply to Agent Ostrander's letter.\n\nThe Round Lake Indian Residential School is conducted under the auspices of the United Church, and Rev. R. J. Ross has been principal since 1922. The Principal and staff of the school were, no doubt, remiss in not taking immediate steps to institute a search when they discovered the boys had run away, especially in view of the extremely cold weather conditions existing at the time. The Principal stated to the Agent the reason he did not act promptly was that he did not anticipate any serious consequences, owing to the age of the boys - 13 to 15 years, as he thought they would have no difficulty in reaching their homes.\n\nI return herewith Mr. Neff's letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMounted Police\nReport\nSent Justice\nAF\nOttawa, February 6th, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Neff,-\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the death of Percy Ochspawace.\n\nReports received by the Department show that the boy's death was thoroughly investigated by the Coroner, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the local Indian Agent and that the Coroner decided, after the investigation, that no inquest was necessary. I understand, also, that the Coroner interviewed the boy's father before deciding that an inquest was unnecessary.\n\nI regret very much the circumstances under which this boy met his death; but, in view of the information before me, no further action is considered necessary.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGarnet C.

As to the actual cause of the death, there is, of course, no dispute. Nevertheless, it would appear that all the facts should be investigated as to the circumstances surrounding the whole affair. The mere fact that it would appear that the officials at the Round Lake School knew nothing about the death of this boy until the Thursday following would indicate a laxity and culpability for which they should be held responsible.\n\nI am given to understand that when a student enters this school, the parents sign a document giving the School the custody and control of the child. In other words, the school is in the position of a guardian. However, it would appear that no good purpose can be served by going into the matter further. In the light of the circumstances and instructions I have received there is no other course open than to communicate with the Honourable, the Attorney-General of this Province and lay the facts before him as submitted to me, asking him for the necessary order for a Coroner's enquiry.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

NEFF, K.C.\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary Public\nGRENFELL, SASKATCHEWAN\n\nMarch 8, 1935.\n\nThe Honorable Minister of Justice,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Percy Ochapawace, #22.\n\nFor your information I would advise that I have been requested by Walter Ochapawace, the father of the above Indian boy who was recently found frozen to death on the Crooked Lake Agency in the Province of Saskatchewan. The father has instructed me to take the matter up with you with a view of having a public enquiry instituted under the Enquiries Act, being Chapter 99 of the Statutes of Canada in 1927.\n\nThe facts are briefly this: This Percy Ochapawace was an inmate of the Round Lake School in the Province of Saskatchewan to which many of the Indian children of the Crooked Lake Agency are sent. This is a boarding school. It appears that at the time an Indian child is accepted into this residential school, written consent is given by the parents and the School or its officials are thereby constituted as guardians to the respective children.\n\nThis lad was thirteen years of age and had been going to the Round Lake School for several years. On Sunday, the 13th of January he, with two other boys ran away. Whether it be true or not, I do not know, but it is claimed that they were unnecessarily hard worked. Apparently from the information in my hands, the Principal of the School was warned that these boys were leaving. Sunday, the 13th, of January, was very cold and I believe well over twenty below zero. The boys left thinly clad to walk many miles to their homes.\n\nThe facts appear to be that after the departure of the boys no enquiry was made for them nor a search. I am informed the first the Principal of the School knew about the situation was on the 17th of January when he was communicated with and advised that this boy's body had been found. The immediate cause of the death was exposure from cold is of course beyond question and as far as the father is concerned he realizes that. What concerns him chiefly and the parents of the other children now attending the School is that there must be extreme laxity or carelessness either in the interpretation of such rules as there may be or in the rules themselves that it does seem to be inhuman that if it be true, no enquiry or search was made for the boy for three or four days in extreme weather, that such a state of affairs could exist such as described.\n\nMay it be stated to you that this case has caused much uneasiness and dissatisfaction among the Indians generally on this Reserve and they feel that the time has now arrived in justice to them and particularly to their children that a most rigid enquiry of a public nature should be instituted on the facts surrounding the death of this boy and particularly into the whole scheme of control of the children in this School.\n\nIt...\nIt is, I think, quite possible to have such an enquiry under the Enquiries Act and I am satisfied that is the only thing that will take place that will satisfy the people generally, both Indian and white.\n\nI might just add for your information that this matter was first taken up with the Department of Indian Affairs with the object of it taking such an enquiry and they have refused. Therefore, in making this request to you, it is all that appears to be left to the unfortunate father of this boy to attempt to at least see not only an investigation of the School but an attempt to make as a result of such an enquiry, proper regulations to be put into effect and without question, the lives of their children safe-guarded.\n\nThere are other instances on the Crooked Lake Agency where there has been unfortunate deaths without any investigation. I am not suggesting there should have been in the cases just mentioned but certainly that is the impression among the Indian people.\n\nTherefore, I shall be glad if you will look into the matter and if you require any further information or data I shall be glad to furnish it insofar as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Neff.\nOTTAWA March 15, 1935.\n\nJ.R. 514/35.\nRe: Percy Ochapawace, #622.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith copy of letter dated the 8th instant under the above heading, received by the Minister of Justice from Mr. G.

C. Neff, K.C., Grenfell, Sask., requesting an inquiry into the circumstances regarding the death of an Indian boy, Percy Ochopawace, a pupil of the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nReports received by the Department show that the boy's death was thoroughly investigated by the Coroner, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the local Indian Agent, and that the Coroner decided, after the investigation, that no inquest was necessary. The Coroner also interviewed the boy's father before he decided that an inquest was unnecessary.\n\nMr. Neff, in a letter to the Honourable T. G. Murphy, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stated that he was considering communicating with the Honourable the Attorney General of the Province and placing the facts before him, asking him for the necessary order for a Coroner's inquiry.\n\nI regret very much the circumstances under which this boy met his death; but, in view of the information before me, no further action is considered necessary. For your information, I attach the report received from Mr. P.A. Lester, Indian Agent, Broadview, Sask., and also the report of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, regarding the circumstances in connection with the death of the above named boy. I would request that, when you have finished with these documents, you return them for our file.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI regret to have to report that Percy Ochappowace, a pupil of the Round Lake I.R. School was frozen to death on the night of Sunday the 13th instant.\n\nThis boy with two others ran away from school some time during the afternoon of the day in question and the Reverend Principal found he was missing about 5 p.m. The weather was extremely cold about 25 below zero and the roads were very bad. Soon after the boys left the school a blizzard sprung up and they made their way with great difficulty to a point on the Ochappowace Reserve about 7 miles S.W. of the school reaching that point about 5 p.m. The boys then separated the deceased going south towards his home and the other two travelling west towards their own homes. These two did not reach their homes that evening but arrived at the home of Alec Belanger another Ochappowace Reserve Indian about 8 p.m. in a state of exhaustion but not badly frozen.\n\nThe deceased travelled about 1\u00bd miles after he left the other boys and his body was found late Thursday evening (17th) in a willow bluff about \u00bc of a mile from the nearest Indian home. He had apparently become exhausted and laid down and went to sleep and froze to death.\n\nThe matter has been thoroughly investigated by the Coroner, the R.C.M.P. and myself and the Coroner decided no inquest was necessary. These three boys were last seen by a member of the school staff about 1.30 p.m. Spnday and were not missed until milking time about 5 p.m.\n\nIn view of the extremely cold weather and bad roads the Revd. Principal would have been well advised to have an immediate search made as the boys tracks could have been followed in the snow but apparently as the boys ranged from 13 to 15 years of age he thought they would reach their homes in safety. He wrote me a letter dated 14th. instant informing me that the boys were truant and this letter reached me on the 16th. My first intimation that the boys were missing was by a telephone call to the R.C.M.P. at Broadview by the Ochappowace Reserve Farm Instructor on the morning of the 17th. The farm instructor had first been advised of the matter at 10 p.m. the previous evening.\n\nThe information came to him in the following manner. The boy's elder brother Daniel Ochappowace happened to call on Alec Belanger at whose home the other two boys had arrived as previously mentioned and Belanger casually asked him if Percy had got home safely on Sunday evening. Daniel replied that no one at home had seen Percy and then Belanger told him about the three boys leaving school and the two that stopped at his house Sunday night. Daniel immediately drove to all neighbouring Indian houses enquiring if anyone had seen the boy but without any result. He reported to the Farm Instructor and search was immediately instituted. Immediately I received the telephone call on the 17th. I drove with the R.C.M.P. to Ochappowace Reserve and we organised a search with the result that at 5 p.m. that day the body was found frozen to death.\n\nAs would be expected the father of deceased as well as other Indians who have children in this school are considerably upset and are inclined to place the blame on the Revd. Principal for failing to have the boys immediately followed when it was found that they were missing and also for not taking steps to inform them and myself more promptly. When I asked the Revd. Principal why he had not acted more promptly he informed me that he did not anticipate...\nDivision Fyle No.\n\nF. 237\n\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\nDivision \"N\"\nSub-Division Regina\nDetachment Broadview\nProvince Saskatchewan\nDate January 19th, 1935\n\nFyle References\n\nRe: Percy OCHAPOWACE - Death of,\nOchappowace Indian Reserve, Saskatchewan.\n\nHeadquarters\n\n17-1-35.\nAt 8:30 A.M. this date, a telephone call was received from Leander Carlson, Farm Instructor, on the Ochappowace Indian Reserve, to the effect that the above named boy had run away from the Round Lake Mission School on January 13th, 1935, in company with Glen Gaddie and Alec Wamasee. The latter two had arrived home but Percy had not been seen since they had parted on the Reserve, eight miles south of the Mission.\n\nSub-Division\n\nI immediately took the matter up with J.P.B. Ostrander, Ind. Agt. of Broadview, and after he had communicated by telephone with Rev. R.J. Ross, Principal of Round Lake Mission School, also W.J. Ball, Indian Clerk, nothing could be learned concerning Percy OCHAPOWACE, than was already known.\n\nDetachment\n\n40-35.\nAt 11 A.M., this date patrol was made in company with J.P.B. Ostrander by team to the Ochappowace Reserve, where Alec Wamasee who had left the school in company with Percy OCHAPOWACE, on Sunday January 13th, 1935, was interviewed. He stated as follows:\n\n\"I am 14 years of age, attending school at Round Lake Mission. On Sunday, January 13th, I ran away from the School at 2 P.M. in company with Glen Gaddie and Percy Ochappowace. We were going to our homes. We walked south from the mission, across Lonesome Prairie, to where Joe Mar attacked hay this summer. We were cold and made a fire in the snow. After the fire Percy left us travelling south towards Jim Assiniboine's on his way home. It was about sundown when we parted from Percy. We were all tired as the snow was deep and it was very cold and stormy. Glen Gaddie and myself left, going west towards the home of Alec Belanger. We travelled about one and one half miles and were cold and tired again, and built another fire. We lay down for awhile and went to sleep. I woke up and could not see Glen Gaddie. I found him covered up in snow. I got him out and found we had lost a light. We walked towards the light and reached the home of Alec Belanger. We found Mrs Belanger home alone. She had something to eat and went to sleep. We stayed there over night and the next morning went home.\"\n\nP.C.R.\n\nFirst.\n\nGlen Gaddie, who is 13 years of age, stated to the same effect as Alec Wamasee. Alec Belanger was interviewed and stated he had returned home about 10 P.M. on the 13th, last and found the two boys at his place, who were then both sleeping. His wife informed him that they had arrived at 2 P.M. tired, hungry, and cold. When they awoke, they told Belanger that Percy OCHAPOWACE had been with them and had gone on south towards Jim Assiniboine's, when they parted. At the time of the parting, they were about three miles from Jim Assiniboine's. Belanger thought that Percy would make that distance safely. The following morning, Monday, Belanger took the two boys to their respective homes.\n\nContinued on page (2).\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the night of January 16th, 1935, Alec Belanger was at the home of Nasacase's when Daniel Ochapowance, brother of Percy Ochapowance, came there. Alec asked Daniel if Percy had arrived. Daniel stated that he had not, and that he was at Round Lake Mission School. Belanger then informed him what had taken place on Sunday.\n\n6. Daniel Ochapowance then set out on horseback, travelling from house to house making enquiries about Percy but was unable to gather any information as to his whereabouts. He then informed Mr Carlson, Farm Instructor.\n\n7. A search party was then organized of approximately 25 Indians on horse-back, and in company with Lee NASACASE, we proceeded to where they had the first fire, where Percy had left them. Travelling a mile south of there, we left the body of Indians searching. In company with J.P.B. Ostrander we proceeded on to the Round Lake Mission School, where Rev. R.J. Ross, was interviewed and stated to the following effect:\n\n\"On Sunday, Jan. 17th, '35, I did not miss Glen Gaddie, Alec Nasacase or Percy OCHAPOWANCE, until about 5 P.M. On questioning some of the boys I learned that they had left the School about 1.30 P.M., telling the other boys that they were going home. The boys had had about 3 hours start. I did not think it worth while sending after them, as they would have nearly reached home by this time. It is not customary to follow boys, 12, 13, or 14 years of age, after they get a 2 or 3 hour start on us, from the school. I did not get in touch with anyone outside of the school to let them know the boys had left, but I wrote a letter to Mr Ostrander, on 16th, Jan./35, informing him that these three boys had run away from the school. The letter was posted in Stockholm on Jan.17th, 1935. I did not know that the boy had not arrived home safely until I received the telephone call from Mr Ostrander this morning.\"\n\n8. We returned to where the Indians were searching and the body was found around 6.30 P.M. about 1\u00bd miles south of where the boys had parted, a half mile south from the road which he had travelled on. His foot prints and tracks could be followed into the bush where he had lay down; he then had crawled on his hands and knees for about 15 yards into some willows. Here the snow had been partly scraped away and he lay in the hollow, face down. His hands were held up under his face with his mitts off under his hands. He was frozen solid. He was dressed in a pair of blue bib overalls, black and red sweater, fleece lined underwear, one pair of grey socks, gum rubber boots size 9 and no overcoat. The rubbers appeared to be too large for him and the snow had packed in around the tops of them, making his feet wet. There were no tracks in the snow around him other than what had been made by him. Alec Belanger, Bert Francis and Joe Boar were left to guard the body until I returned with the Coroner.\n\n9. I returned to Broadview Detachment at 12.15 A.M. of the 18th, Inst.\n\n10. At 8.30 A.M. this date, in company with J.P.B. Ostrander, and Dr. A.W. Allingham, Coroner, a further patrol was made to the Ochapowance Indian Reserve, where the body of Percy Ochapowance was examined by Dr. Allingham. He stated that death was due to Exposure and Freezing. After interviewing Rev. R.J. Ross, of the Mission School, and Walter Ochapowance, Father of the deceased, Dr. Allingham, stated that no inquest was necessary.\n\nContinued on page (3).\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nRound Lake Mission,\nStockholm, Sask.,\nMarch 14, 1936.\n\nE. B. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the past year the teachers of our school have been wondering what the attitude of the Government is towards Indian education. Do they consider that those who are capable of taking higher education should be given every opportunity to do so? Do they want the pupils encouraged to take advantage of their educational opportunities? Are they willing to stand behind the teacher who is making an effort to raise the standard of scholastic training among the Indians? If so, there are a few difficulties to which we would like to draw your attention.\n\nWe feel that a half day at school, and no study periods outside school hours is insufficient for those pupils in Grade Eight, where they are faced with a Departmental exam. In this limited time, it is almost impossible to cover the prescribed amount of work, let alone give them the amount of drill work needed to give them a thorough grasp of their work.\n\nExperience has shown us that there are a number who are capable of attaining high school standard. For example, in our own school during the past twelve years we have had eighteen successfully pass their grade eight exams (eleven with honors). One year there were seven in the grade eight class. All seven passed, and all seven passed with honors. This surely shows that the Indian children have the ability.\nWe feel that education is a very strong factor in raising the standard of living and the ideals on the reserves, and in aiding the Indian in becoming eventually self-supporting. We willingly admit the necessity of education for our own race. If it is necessary for our own race with their background of civilization, how much more necessary is it for the Indian who has only the present from which to draw? Teachers in Indian schools are faced with many difficulties that do not present themselves in white schools.\n\nFirst there is the half day already referred to. Although these pupils attend school but half the time they are expected to complete a full year's work and pass exams set for the Inspectorate. Furthermore, as there is no time allowed for study periods outside of school hours, all the work must be done during this half time at school. As the pupil progresses in his grades the amount of work he must cover increases accordingly. Consequently it becomes increasingly difficult for him to cover his prescribed amount of work in this limited time. And by the time he has reached grade eight it is almost impossible to get over the work let alone teach it thoroughly.\n\nThen there is the matter of texts. The authorized Primer for this province is The Highroads To Reading Primer. But the Department do not supply these. They do offer two alternative Primers but, as these were not intended as preludes to The Highroads To Reading Readers, they are naturally not as suitable. The work in the Highroads Primer has been carefully selected so that the child may easily make the transition form the Primer to the Grade One Reader. Why are these not available for use in Indian Schools?\n\nWe also consider that inspection by the Provincial Inspector just once a year is not sufficient, and, as the teacher has no access to a copy of the report he submits she has no means of benefiting from his criticism.\n\nThen, too, there is no superannuation scheme for teachers in Indian schools. When a teacher with a provincial certificate assumes duties in a school under the Dominion Government she is cut off from the benefits of superannuation. Should she later return to a Provincial school she is given\nno credit for time spent in that Dominion school. And in the case of Saskatchewan, if she has been absent from a Provincial school for a period of two years she loses all credit for any years of previous teaching experience she may have had. Teachers can hardly be expected to remain permanently when they are thus penalized. And yet, permanent teachers are what Indian schools need for it takes time to adjust yourself to the Indian pupil, and to the conditions prevailing in Indian schools.\n\nIn view of the above facts we feel that teachers in Indian schools work under many difficulties and have many barriers to contend with. Is the Department sufficiently interested in Indian education to want the teacher to make every effort for better educational standing in spite of these difficulties? Or do they adopt the 'laissez faire' attitude?\n\nWe would appreciate your reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary B. Ross.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mrs. R.J. Ross, the senior teacher at the Round Lake Indian Residential School concerning difficulties which present themselves in preparing pupils for departmental examinations and other matters in connection with superannuation which is self explanatory.\n\nCould I have this information to pass on to Mrs. Ross, please? I find both teachers at that school very conscientious in the matter of their duties in school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.H. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing letter received from Mrs. R. J. Ross, senior teacher at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The Department cannot understand why Mrs. Ross writes as follows:\n\n\"We feel that a half day at school, and no study periods outside school hours is insufficient for those pupils in Grade Eight.\"\n\nAs far as the Department is aware, all Indian residential schools provide a study period, and the Department considers that the Principal of the Round Lake Residential School should make the same provision.\n\nWith reference to the Readers, the Department gave very careful consideration before deciding to supply the Pre Primer \"Two Little Indians\" and the Primer \"Friends\". It is felt that when a pupil has mastered these two books there should be no difficulty in proceeding to Book I of the \"Highroads to Reading Series\".\n\nOwing to the cost involved, the Department is not prepared to arrange for the provincial inspectors to visit Indian schools more than once a year.\n\nThe Department has given consideration to the question of arranging for teachers in Indian schools to participate in the provincial teachers' superannuation fund, but as this would involve a heavy expenditure on our part, due to the fact that we would have to make arrangements with each province in Canada, it has been found necessary to defer taking any action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE. A. W. R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDecember 2nd,\n1936.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School\n\nI am writing to make the most emphatic and urgent request that the Department of Indian Affairs put in the Estimates for the fiscal year beginning April 1st, 1937, a sum of money sufficient to rebuild the residential school at Round Lake, Saskatchewan. As you have visited the building personally, you are well aware that it is a disgrace both to the Department and the United Church. In addition to that, it is a fire-trap.\n\nWe have given long and serious consideration to this question and made a careful survey of the prospective pupils from Indian Reserves in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, hoping that perhaps it might be possible to eliminate the Round Lake School as a residential centre. It is becoming increasingly evident that this cannot be done and that for many years, if the policy of residential school education is to be continued at all, such a school will have to be carried on at Round Lake.\n\nThanking you for your consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, December 8th, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, requesting that an amount be included in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1937-38 sufficient to rebuild the Indian residential school at Round Lake, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn reply I would say that no provision is being made in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year to erect any new residential school buildings. While the need at Round Lake is noted, I am not in a position to state when it will be possible to provide the funds to erect a new building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nSir:\n\nMrs. Ross, teacher of the Round Lake I.H. School has requested that\n\nGladys Reed - 16 yrs.\nAlice Beer - 15 yrs.\nAgnes Kayesaywaysemat - 16 yrs.\n\nthree of her pupils at this school be allowed to devote the whole of their time from now to the summer holidays in the class room.\n\nIn this connection I have taken up the matter with the Principal who explains that when school leaving age was 16 years there was always many girls on hand but now with the leaving age at 16 years, he finds he has not enough girls of working ability to assist with the work and as he is understaffed he finds it very difficult to spare these girls from their duties for classrooms more than the half day each day.\n\nOn the other hand when a girl is taking her last grade at this school, shows promise of fair intellect and with steady application to her studies can accomplish her entrance examination for more advanced studies it seems a pity that she is handicapped to this extent.\n\nI would be pleased to have the Department's instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.R.

If these girls have shown special aptitude for academic work, it is considered that they should be given every opportunity to pursue their studies. However, in the majority of cases, it is felt that it is preferable to devote the last year or two of their school life to work which will prepare them for looking after their homes.\n\nYou appear to be under the impression that children must be discharged when they reach the age of sixteen years. The Indian Act does not state this but it does provide that children can only be kept in a residential school after that age with the express permission of the Superintendent General. When pupils attain the age of sixteen years and the Principal and yourself desire that they be kept for another year or so, the proper procedure is for you to write the Department requesting such permission and giving explicit reasons for making this request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Evans, Esq.,\nLive Stock Editor,\nFamily Herald and Weekly Star,\nMontreal, Canada.\nIndian School Has Champion Holsteins\n\nThe Qu'Appelle Valley in Saskatchewan offers many picturesque spots to the traveller and the present site of the Round Lake Indian Residential School with its beautiful expanse of lake, its wooded slopes and high table lands, is one of the most pleasing. At this point the valley is much wider than it is farther west giving room for a number of up-to-date highly productive farms. The soil is of the best and the climate is more temperate than it is up on the prairies.\n\nA comparatively few years ago the voyager to this country would have probably encountered only Indians chasing buffaloes. Today he will find a bunch of Indians working hard at farming or a herd of Holstein cattle which by its show ring performance has demonstrated itself to be one of the finest in Western Canada.\n\nThere is quite a difference between hunting buffalo and milking Holstein cows yet the Indians are making good use of both under the watchful eye of Rev. R. J. Ross, Superintendent of the school.\n\nThe School was founded in 1884 by Dr. H. McKay, a missionary sent out by the Women's Missionary Society of Canada. Serving several groups of Indians in the Reserves which are found in the Qu'Appelle Valley southeast of Regina, the school which is connected with the School has gradually come to play an important part in the Round Lake mission to the Indians.\n\nFoundation from Strathmore\n\nIn 1922 Dr. McKay retired and his place was taken by Rev. R. Ross who brought the first herd of Holsteins into the herd in 1924, when he purchased two pure bred heifers from the farm near Strathmore, Alberta. Today there are 90 head of registered black and white at Round Lake, and today at the same time other cows are kept. About 50 gallons of milk are used daily and some of the children drink it twice daily.\n\nThe buildings of the school belong to the Department of Indian Affairs. Besides the school, the farm and the herd of Holsteins are all maintained by the Women's Missionary Society of the United Church of Canada. The school is provided for the girls and boys of the Reserves in the district. Public schools in the Reserve possess texts and practical equipment science for the girls, and practical agriculture for the boys are on the curricula. The experience gained at the school makes the better citizenship and self-reliance when they return home to their homes on the Reservation.

The herd sire is Senor Peter; Senior herd sire is Colony Wimple Heilo Romeo, which was grand champion at Moose Jaw in 1936.\n\nCh. Franzy Colantha was out again in 1935 and was senior and reserve champion in the circuit shows at Brandon and Saskatoon. In 1935 Cherry completed an R.O.P. record of 7,152 pounds of milk and 615 pounds of butter in 365 days.\n\nFranzy Hartog Lass has never been shown but her claim to prominence through the performance of her progeny and more particularly her two daughters, Cherrywood Franzy Colantha and Cherrywood Franzy Pouch. Franzy was bred by Clair Peers of Woodstock, Ontario, and was purchased by Mr. Ross at St. Boniface, Manitoba, and delivered to J. Harold Wilson, Cherry Wood Farm, Sintaluta, where she was known as Franzy Hartog Lass. Franzy has two outstanding sons which have never been in the Round Lake herd. One of them, Franzy Franzy Pouch, was shown with considerable success in 1936 and placed second at the recent show at Moose Jaw. A number of animals are again being groomed for the 1937 western circuit.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nJune 26th, 1937\n\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Ross, teacher at the Round Lake I.R.

She had some difficulty with her first husband and they were separated and the Children's Aid Society took this boy and placed him with one Lloyd French who I understand is employed at the Government Indian Reserve School at Round Lake, Saskatchewan. (P.O. Address being Stockholm, Saskatchewan).\n\nIn 1935, we obtained a judgment from the Supreme Court of Ontario granting the mother the custody of the child. Since then we have made repeated effort to have the boy returned to his mother but this Lloyd French refused to do so, although, the mother went on two or three occasions they refused, being on the grounds that the Ontario Judgment is not enforceable in Saskatchewan and the only thing left for Mrs. Urquhart to do would be to go to Saskatchewan, pursuant to the judgment and sue there which would be a most expensive litigation.\n\nI understand that this man, Lloyd French, had represented himself as a school teacher but it was found out that he is not a teacher at all and this boy is not being properly cared for and his education sadly neglected. His stepfather, John Urquhart, is employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway and has been employed by that company for the last forty-two years earning about two hundred and thirty-dollars ($230.00) a month and is fully able to look after the boy and promises to give him a good schooling and a University education.

They feel that it is not in the best interest of the boy's future to be brought up in this Indian Reserve and they asked me to make a request that you use your good offices in assisting to get the boy back to them.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a certified copy of the judgment of this court and would appreciate your effort in trying to have the boy returned to his family.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

Principal of the Round Lake Residential School requests that the quota for his school be raised from seventy-two to eighty pupils. He states:\n\n\"There has never been a time during the last decade when this school has not had to refuse admittance during the year to at least eight pupils. This fact is more of a problem today than ever before ourselves are actually trying to meet it partly because within each year there are more children for whom no grant can be obtained because they number over and above our present quota for recognition by the Department.\"\n\n\"You realize we operate with what may be termed the minimum number of pupils for a Residential School. The resultant problem of finance is exceedingly difficult. One could meet the needs of many more pupils with little added expense. If the Indian Department would grant us permission to admit eighty pupils we could accommodate them and at the same time the problem of finance in spite of rising costs would be greatly facilitated.\"\n\nAs there are quite a few children on the reserve who should be in school but for lack of accommodation have been unable to be admitted I would recommend his request for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant with reference to the request of the Principal of the Round Lake Residential School for an increase in pupilage.\n\nThe funds at our disposal do not permit increasing the pupilage of any Indian residential school in Canada and consequently it is not possible to favourably consider the request of the Principal of the Round Lake School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nTHE WOMEN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nREV. A. C. HUSTON\nPrincipal\n\nSTOCKHOLM,\nSaskatchewan\n\nHow applicable is all this to the Work among Indians? The mere fact that we have been dealing with Indians and not with their more aggressive white brethren explains in part why conditions have not been subjected to periodic change. Surely the time is ripe for a review of our whole approach to the Indian problem.\n\nLast Winter we did think that something was about to be done when Mr. Doucet under authority from your Department visited several schools in the hope of adjusting the curriculum to help meet in a fuller way the special needs of the Indian Child who would in time become a citizen of his home reserve. We liked Mr. Doucet and we also liked what he had to say but alas what has come of it?\n\nEvery five years the Department should send out, not one man but a small representative commission. They should come not primarily to the schools but to the Reserves. In any approach to the Indian work as a whole we must keep in mind that each Reserve must be considered by itself and that everything that is done for the Reserve must be done keeping its people and no other people in mind. Everything that is done should be contributory to life on that certain Reserve and no other interest should predominate. It is not uncommon to find even in a Residential school machinery functioning more for its own interests than for any special thought that has been given toward the people on the reserves from which the children come or the future welfare of the pupils when they return to those reserves. I know a Residential School in the Prairies teaching children coming from the far northern wilderness how to farm. This is but one example of how we can care for the Indian and err because we have not in mind either the reserve from which he comes or his future when he shall have to return to it. This I feel is one folly growing out of our loose jointed arrangement between church and the government.\n\nThe small committee just suggested let it be made up of Educated Specialists sufficient in number to approach the problem with a balanced view. In this sense they would be your department seeing things first hand and through unbiased and unprejudiced minds. This commission would consider each reserve by itself, spend time enough to fully acquaint themselves with every detail, satisfy themselves that they have an intimate knowledge that they have discussed their findings with end in turn heard the judgment of the General Superintendent, the Indian Agent and the principal of the school within the area under inspection.\n\nAmong those composing this commission there could be an Economist, a Psychologist, trained Social Worker, perhaps a civil engineer. I could describe the expected contribution of each toward making a complete report but rather than take more of your time I will try to illustrate by describing the field covered by the Economist in this special investigation. First and foremost among problems in any section of our country is the economic one. Let scientific investigation reveal the adequacy or the inadequacy of the present means of making a livelihood on each reserve toward supporting life not only now but under future conditions that may arise in a state of existence or living. If the means is found to be inadequate then it is high time something is done about it. On the other hand if the means is adequate, incentive whatever angle it may take should be fostered to get the full and complete co-operation of the Indian.\n\nThe main thing in all this is not the size of the commission but its composition, its vision and its intelligence and its sympathies. Once a project like this is set on foot we will be on our way to a modern and sane adjustment of existing difficulties and future programs.\n\nThe future of Indian affairs in Canada I fear hardly admits any of the things I had hoped for it. Rather than spend more years in work where the maintenance of the status quo seems the chief interest I have decided after giving sufficient notice to join the army as a Chef-lain. Trusting you will interpret this letter in the same spirit with which it has been written. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. C. Huston\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nTHE WOMEN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY\nUnited Church of Canada\n\nDr. H.W. McCallum,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDr. McCallum:\n\nWhen you were at Norway House in July 1934, Mrs. Huston and I were attending a conference of workers among Indians conducted at the Residential School in that place. We were also waiting a plane to convey us to the remote northern post of Nelson House. After four years at this isolated Mission during which time Mrs. Huston as nurse and I as missionary travelled thousands of miles by canoe and dog toboggan, the church called me to accept my present work on the Prairie. As far as I know, none of the Missions may to accept the responsibility of an Indian Residential School and came to the work with enthusiasm and a vision of its possibilities. The war intervened to prevent me from visiting several schools in the United States in search of ways and means for the better conduct of my duties.\n\nFrustrated in this I set about to find with limited facilities way of helping Graduates to find a place in life. I also introduced into the school those different factors that I hoped would measure the child's future in a world larger than the confines of his own Reserve. I felt at the time there were certain graduates who with help could adjust themselves into this wider citizenship. After four years of working among the children and having contact with their parents in the homes on the Reserves I have come to the conclusion that something fundamental is amiss in our whole program.\n\nAdjoining to our school there are four Reserves from which our children come. It seems to me that the churches apply to every aspect of life to be seen there you could find none more applicable than the word\u2014Indifference? This to be sure has always been the besetting affliction of the Indian. Still I do believe that proper diet and an adequate incentive would work wonders as a corrective. Let me add that incentive need not always express itself in attractive garb but at times must be made especially with Indians to take the form of co-operation. The Department of Indian Affairs has gone far beyond the letter of the law in keeping the treaty obligations and has been content at the detriment of the Indian with the bare minimum from him.\n\nThe churches have within reason been given a free hand to do what each denomination saw to be right under existing circumstances. Each in turn has had its wants financed not always on the basis of necessity but sometimes on the power or its representation. On the other hand the government itself has kept almost entirely to secular matters. It is easy therefore to see how under this loosely knit arrangement there has and still can exist many shortcomings that impede the work and how hard these will be to overcome.\n\nAny Constructive criticism should come from Ottawa. Yet it is almost always easier to procure money from the sponsor of an existing order for its maintenance than to secure from them the application of courage, intelligence and vision sufficient for striking an axe at its roots.\n\nChurch as well as state has often acted on the assumption that there is but one way to reward long and faithful service. They hand out high authoritative positions as one might confer a degree with the result that the work over which the appointment has been made is often conducted in a fashion that is conservative rather than progressive. These men as a rule have sound judgment but they lack the ability to untangle themselves from the past. They lack enthusiasm and the capacity for quick and decisive action in the face of a new set of circumstances. They lack the vision and the healthier, more hopeful outlook of younger men. Surely we would be wise to take a page from the experiences of our army in this regard. They are continually setting their house in order. They have learned that change is a law of life and that the old order as well as the old men who created it must go and give place to new.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 28, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Huston:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 11th instant, addressed to the Director of this Branch. Dr. McGill is at present absent from the office on holidays and is not likely to return for a couple of weeks. In the meantime I am replying on his behalf.\n\nI want to thank you very heartily for your communication and for the suggestions contained therein. At the same time I must express regret that you seem disposed to resign from the principalship of the school and enter the Army as a chaplain. It was my earnest hope, particularly after our personal interview of a few months ago, that you would be able to remain at Round Lake until we had worked out a worthwhile educational program, based on the establishment of an improved day school that might embody the best features of our residential and day school programs.\n\nWe certainly need young men in the Indian service, and when I speak of young men I mean young men with the missionary spirit and with deep-seated convictions in respect to the worthwhileness of the work in which they are engaged and young men with enthusiasm.\n\nI heartily agree with you when you state in the sixth paragraph of your letter that it has been the practice of both Church and State in the past to promote elderly men to positions of trust and responsibility as a kind of reward for services rendered. I agree with you also that this has had a tendency to arrest or delay necessary reforms, not only in this but in many other departments. Elderly men, except in rare circumstances, do not readily sense or adjust themselves to changing conditions and, as you state, lack the more hopeful and buoyant attitude of younger men.\n\nI flatter myself that this condition, insofar as the Indian Affairs Branch is concerned, is a temporary one. In a very few years practically all the senior officials of this Branch will be superannuated, and I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that younger men will be sought out and brought into the Service. The need for young men in the field force is in my judgment particularly urgent. The field officials, after all, are the men in the front line trenches and unless such men are young, hopeful, enthusiastic and aggressive, it is exceedingly difficult to do much from here.\n\nYour suggestion that a commission be sent out every five years by the Department is one that does not appeal to me. Governments in the past have never been particularly fortunate in the selection of men for such work, and I am convinced that such a commission could\n\nRev. A. C. Huston,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nWhitewood, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nnever take the place of well qualified and capable Indian agents and inspectors. Indeed the demand for such commissions usually arises in an attempt to correct conditions that can only be corrected by the members of the permanent field staff. This suggestion made by you, however, will be sent on to the officials at the Minister's office for their consideration.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to Mr. Doucet. Mr. Doucet has during the last three years visited practically all the residential schools in the Dominion. In addition to this, he has worked out a vocational course of study which covers a three year period. It is unnecessary to remind you, however, that before this course of study can be adopted at a school with any hope of success, suitable classrooms are required and also a certain amount of equipment and a supply of carefully selected tools. With the limited funds at our disposal and with the existing acute shortage of certain supplies, we have hesitated to encourage the adoption of this course of study at schools unless requested to do so by the principal and until we had an assurance that at least one teacher with some training in vocational work was prepared to assume responsibility for the success of the work. You have at the present time only two teachers on your staff and both of these are girls. If, however, you feel that a start should be made in a small way with vocational instruction for boys, we shall be glad to send you and show you a summary of the first year's course. In the meantime there is no reason whatever why girls should not be encouraged to undertake such work as the repair and remodelling of discarded military clothing and the knitting of socks, in addition to the work they now undertake in the kitchen and in the dormitories.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you a very Happy Christmas. It is my hope that the New Year will have in store for all of us better times and a more promising outlook.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, December 28, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your consideration, copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend A. C. Huston, Principal of the Round Lake United Church School, Whitewood, Sask. I am sending forward also copy of my reply to this communication.\n\nIt has occurred to me that you might find Mr. Huston's suggestions of some value when you meet the representatives of the churches at a conference to be held on January 12.\n\nI was greatly disturbed to learn that Mr. Huston was seriously thinking of abandoning his present position to enter the Army as a chaplain. Mr. Huston, who called at this office early in August of this year, is in my judgment one of the best qualified and one of the most promising principals in charge of any of our residential schools. Mr. Huston was born on an Ontario farm, took his high school course at Peterborough Collegiate Institute and took an Honours Course at Toronto University in Arts and a Theological Course at Victoria College, Toronto. Immediately following his graduation he volunteered for missionary work at Nelson House, Manitoba. He is still a man in his early thirties and his wife is a qualified nurse. He is just the type of man that we should retain in our service. If such men as Mr. Huston are permitted to leave the service, the outlook from the educational standpoint is in no sense promising. The Round Lake School which is established in the Crooked Lake Agency is, as you know, in a deplorable condition. Mr. Huston is a young and aggressive type of individual and is too far advanced in his thinking along social and economic lines to receive much help or much encouragement from our field staff in that particular section of the country.\n\nActing Director.\nRegina, March 3rd, 1943.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Esq., Indian Agent, BROADVIEW, Saskatchewan.\n\nI wish to inform you that it has been brought to my attention that Mrs. George Gaddie, of the Cowessess Reserve, has a son by the name of Bruce who is attending the Round Lake School, and his mother informs me that he is a rather sickly looking boy and puny.\n\nLast year he did something that displeased the Principal and as a result he received a strapping on the hand but the strap cut his arm and made it bleed, and the arm was black and blue up to the elbow. Again this year, I think on or about the 21st of February, this boy received similar treatment from Mr. Huston and I understand that John Stevenson, who lives nearby, was at the school shortly afterwards and saw the boy's arm, which was swollen at that time.\n\nI want you to go down to the Round Lake School just as soon as you can get there, and I hope that will be before Sunday, to investigate the case thoroughly, and I would ask you to report your findings to this office in duplicate.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nP.S. Have you heard that the farming instructor at the school by the name of Mr. Osborne, was disliked by the pupils there?\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.,\nMarch 6th, 1943.\n\nM. Christianson, General Superintendent of Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe 304-11 A.U., March 3rd, 1943.\n\nAs requested in your above letter I visited Round Lake School yesterday and investigated the complaints of Mrs. Geo. Gaddie regarding mistreatment of her son Bruce.\n\nThis boy is 14 yrs. of age, and while is puny and small for his age, he appears in good health.\n\nThe strapping was administered to him for refusal to do his assigned morning chore, which was filling up the lackett heater, making up the furnace and sweeping up in the furnace room in the main building. This was given him as a light job because of his size. He had neglected to do this work for a week and hence the punishment. When I examined him there were no signs of any marks, though the boy told me that his arms had been marked on the inside of his forearm from wrist to elbow. Mr. Huston stated that there was only a slight discolouring which is usual immediately after a strapping.\n\nThis boy, along with some others, was punished last year for going into the girls' dormitory. He stated that on that occasion his arm was black and the strap cut his wrist. The strap used is the regulation strap.\n\nAs regards Mr. Osborne, the farming instructor, he does not appear to be very popular with the boys. A large number of the older boys used abusive and obscene language to him. He had some trouble with Douglas Gaddie (Bruce's brother) three or four months ago and wanted to resign but Mr. Huston persuaded him to stay.\n\nW.J.D.Kerley, Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that Mrs. George Gaddie, of the Cowessess Reserve in the Crooked Lake Agency, who is a widow and has a son Bruce attending the Round Lake School, came in to see me a few days ago.\n\nThis woman informed me that last year the Principal of the Round Lake School, Mr. Huston, had given Bruce a strapping on his hands and the strap used had cut the boy's arm causing it to bleed and become black and blue. This boy has received another strapping according to information received by Mrs. Gaddie, and this time his arm was all swollen up.\n\nIn view of this I immediately asked Mr. Kerley to make an investigation in connection with the matter and I am attaching herewith copy of my letter to him of the 3rd instant together with copy of his reply.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nMarch 17, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant,\nforwarding information regarding punishment ad-\nministered to Bruce Gaddie by the Principal of the\nRound Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThis makes me think of our own four Reserves where farming is the one means within the Reserves for the maintenance of life. When White people with ancestors whose farming experiences go back for generations have among their number men who find no interest or incentive to farm how can we expect an Indian population with only experience in hunting behind them to take to farming as a group. The child like mind of the Indian demands as a reward for his effort immediate and visible results. Nature almost always rewards the hunter that way. The farmer on the other hand has learned to wait and hope for the uncertain reward of the harvest. It is easy to see how the Indian accustomed to the one way would find little incentive to put forth his best as a farmer when the reward seems so far away and so uncertain. What I am trying to say is that immediate and visible rewards provide for the child like mind a real incentive.\n\nThis idea has caused me to ponder the wisdom of placing a factory or shop on Reserve similar to ours. The weekly pay envelope would provide the immediate and visible reward for effort expended and we hope, the incentive to continue. Not long ago I was in a small factory in a local town and the thought struck me that Indians could have performed every operation that was being done as readily as the whites. I take it that the Indian has a certain skill. The type of workshop or factory that would be placed on the reserve would have that in mind. It could be managed by a White man serving under the Department in much the same capacity as the Agent.\n\nIt seems to me that work of this type would provide employment for those with no desire or aptitude for farming. It could offer part time employment to the Farmer in need of ready cash. It would or could be a means of developing workers for a similar type of work elsewhere. Surely in these days when so many peace time industries are on war production it would be a good time to start on a peace time product and build up a market before post war competition becomes an issue.\n\nIt is my intention before long to work out on paper my ideas for the new school that will we hope be erected after the War. Recently I have been down lecturing in Winnipeg and addressed seven audiences in three days. Everywhere I go I speak hopefully of the future among Indians because I believe there is a way of tackling our Indian work aggressively and that the Department will after the war face the issue in real style. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIt has been my intention on several occasions to reply to your very considerate and helpful letter of December the twenty second written on behalf of Dr. McGill. I waited knowing that time would eventually enable me to unravel and settle within my own mind the problem as to whether I should enlist as a Chaplain or remain at my present task. There seems to be at the present time a shortage of men to fill that position. Indeed I would have been permitted to have remained at the school until June thirtieth so as to have given The Woman's Missionary Society sufficient opportunity to secure a successor. At long last after much debate I have decided to remain at my present post.\n\nIn reading the last issue of The Beaver published by The Hudson Bay Company I was interested in the investigations made by Dr. Moore and his associates. I knew well the country also the various types of maladies which they described. All resulting from the lack of proper nutrition. In my letter referred to above you may recall how I said to Dr. McGill that if one was looking for one word that could explain the condition of every phase of life on the average Indian Reserve one could find none more applicable than the word \"Indifference\". I then hastened to say that proper diet and an adequate incentive would work wonders as a corrective. I am very glad to note that our Department of Indian Affairs is attacking this problem with gloves off and in a scientific way. I used to say to the Indians on the trail If I had your grub box and you had mine I would be dead and you would be super men. Proper nutrition would remedy many of the ills that afflict them and this should lead us to go still further and investigate the ways and means available by which a livelihood can be made.\n\nYou may recall that when speaking of incentive I said it need not always express itself in attractive garb but at times it must be made, especially with Indians to take the form of compulsion. In other words I meant that when the ways and means of making a livelihood were found on a certain reserve to be adequate for the maintenance of life according to a decent standard of living that the Indian should be made to work. To-day there is plenty of work outside the reserves being offered to Indians, yet ninety percent of those who could do otherwise live far below par because there is no inner or outer compulsion to make them lay hold on this special opportunity.\n\nWhen peace comes these opportunities will vanish and then the various reserves will have to have within their own boundaries the means for providing a livelihood. Surely the means must be made available and the Indian must be presented with an incentive that will call forth his co-operation.\nOttawa, March 23, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Huston:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 16 and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that Dr. Moore will visit Saskatchewan early in April and will deliver a lecture during his stay in Regina. If you have an opportunity to do so, you might discuss with Dr. Moore the proposals you have in mind in respect to Indian welfare on the reserve lands adjoining your school. You might also discuss the matter with your Indian agent and with Mr. Christianson. When you have had an opportunity to take part in these discussions I should like to hear from you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. C.

I believe the Indians at least some of them seem to think they are handicapped as compared children coming from the public schools of the different provinces coming from Public School.

MacDonald,\nBarrister, Solicitor, Notary, Etc.,\nBroadview, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that on my return from White Bear Reserve this week I called at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. There are 78 children in residence there and I must say that these children looked very well; in fact they all looked fine and seemed very happy. I arrived there just before lunch and as the staff eat in the children's dining room also I had an opportunity of seeing what the children were getting for lunch. The food they were eating seemed to be well prepared and ample and the children certainly liked it.\n\nThe school building, as you know, is old in the first place and has been added to repeatedly. I was in one dormitory on the second floor and this was in very good shape and the beds were all in good order also, but I did not go up to the other dormitory as it is on the third floor and I am not very fond of climbing stairs. Mr. Huston informed me that during the holidays some work would be done on the interior of the place, such as painting, kalsomining, etc. There are also floors to be put down in the two play rooms. They have the material there.\n\nThe outbuildings and ----\nThe outbuildings and barns are in the same shape as the main building, old and dilapidated. However, there is one barn that seems to be in fair shape. The grounds are well kept and 3500 trees have been put in this Spring. There are three small buildings on the East side of the School. These are used for fuel and wood. They are in a terribly dilapidated condition. Whenever this can be arranged these should be torn down and a new fuel storage erected. However, there is probably more important work to be done than these old buildings. You will understand that, while these are an eye-sore, of course we have other eye-sores other places so that I am not insisting that these buildings be replaced, unless the Department have sufficient funds to do so. I have looked up the Estimates and I find that this expenditure was included, on Page 11 there is $150.00 for this purpose. The hired man and some of the boys had torn the old root house down. This was located alongside the school on the North side. They found out last year that this root house was too small and therefore it is now being enlarged to take care of their extra supply of garden truck, as the school has a lot of potatoes and all kinds of garden truck this year in excess of what they had last year.\n\nThere is a staff of ten at this Institution and as far as I could ascertain it is a good staff and they are doing their work very well. They were very happy over having received the jacket heater which had been installed ---\nwhich had been installed, and they had word from this office about the washer being supplied and also had word from Winnipeg that it was being shipped. The trouble is that when we get one thing fixed up something else breaks.\n\nI was glad to note that there are several children in the higher grades.\n\nM.

I wonder whether you could write a letter to Mr. Butler, or perhaps to the Head of The Unemployment Insurance Commission in Ottawa, telling them about the Residential Schools, and thus save them a lot of unnecessary letter-writing, which I would gather from this correspondence is just about to begin. You would, I am sure, release the services of a number of stenographers if you could get this done right away.

I wonder whether you could write a letter to Mr. Butler, or perhaps to the Head of the Unemployment Insurance Commission in Ottawa, telling them about Indian residential schools and thus save them a lot of unnecessary letter-writing, which I would gather from this correspondence is just about to begin.\"\n\nI may state by way of explanation that Indian residential schools are established by the Dominion Government for the education of Indian pupils ranging in age from 8 to 16. There are at present 76 of these schools in operation, with a total enrolment of 8,729. These schools, I may add, are operated by the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and United Churches, the Government allowing an annual per capita grant in return for which the co-operating Churches provide food, clothing and instruction.\n\nThe Unemployment Insurance Commission,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMISSION\n\nOTTAWA, July 6, 1944.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of June 22 with reference to the insurability of employees of Indian Residential Schools. We note that a specific case has arisen in the case of the school at Round Lake.\n\nThe letter, from which you quote two paragraphs, written by the Rev. George Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, indicates that Mr. Dorey is under a misunderstanding regarding the insurability of Government employees. It is not correct to say that the Dominion Government does not insure its employees. As you are aware, all employees of the Dominion Government within the insurable classes are insured unless their employment is certified to be permanent in character.\n\nThis privilege of certifying as to permanency does not extend to private employers, such as churches. Churches are, however, considered to be charitable institutions, and exception is, therefore, granted to employees of a church under the provisions of paragraph (g) of Part II of the First Schedule to the Act.\n\nThe question of insurability of employees of the Indian Residential Schools seems to depend, consequently, on who is in fact the employer, the Dominion Government or one of the churches.\n\n(Over)\nIt would assist us in clarifying this question if you could supply us with a copy of the statute or other documents under the authority of which the Dominion Government and the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and United Churches operate the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTo Mr. Macdonnell\n\nIndian Affairs.

Macdonnell,\nfor Supervisor of Coverage.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of July 6, in which you seek additional information with respect to the operation of Indian residential schools.\n\nSection 9 of the Indian Act reads:\n\n\"The Governor in Council may establish\n\n(a) day schools in any Indian reserve for the children of such reserve;\n\n(b) industrial or boarding schools for the Indian children of any reserve or reserves or any district or territory designated by the Superintendent General (Minister).\n\n\"2. Any school or institution the managing authorities of which have entered into a written agreement with the Superintendent General (Minister) to admit Indian children and provide them with board, lodging and instruction may be declared by the Governor in Council to be an industrial school or a boarding school for the purposes of this Act.\"\n\nWe have at this date 76 residential schools in operation throughout the Dominion. These schools are operated by the Government in co-operation with the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian and United Churches. In actual practice this usually means that the school\n\nThe Unemployment Insurance Commission,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\np.t.o.\nbuilding is established and equipped at government expense, on the understanding that the church under the auspices of which the school is operated or administered will provide food, clothing and instruction, the cost of which is borne also by the Government, by the payment of an annual per capita grant ranging from $150.00 to $250.00. Teachers, members of the household staff, farming instructors, etc., at residential schools are the employees, not of the Dominion Government, but of the Churches. In the case of Roman Catholic schools, the teachers are invariably members of a teaching Order.\n\nI am sending forward herewith a copy of the Indian Act and a copy of the report of the Indian Affairs Branch for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1943. You will note on page 168 of this report a list of the residential schools, by provinces. I might add that Indian day school teachers are government employees, classified as temporary Civil Servants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector.\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMMISSION\n\nOTTAWA, July 25, 1944.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nO T T A W A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe thank you for the further information supplied in your letter of July 12th regarding the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAfter consideration of this information and of the Indian Act, copy of which you enclosed with your letter, we are of the opinion that since these residential schools are operated by various churches, assisted by government grants, the church in each case is the employer. Consequently, since churches are regarded as charitable institutions within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Act, no contributions are required on behalf of employees of the Indian Residential Schools.\n\nWe are advising our Regional Auditor at Winnipeg of this opinion, so that local auditors may be instructed accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Macdonnell,\nfor Supervisor of Coverage.\nJuly 26, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of June 20, with reference to correspondence you have had with the Unemployment Insurance Commission.\n\nFor your information I enclose letter dated July 25 which reached me today.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The school, two-room, is a very good building. It is in a neat and clean condition. The Residence or living quarters for the children is an old building, but in an excellent condition. It shows that the children have been made to understand that they must not deface or destroy property. The boys' and girls' dormitories and playrooms are much better than you would expect to find in an old building. The Principal and Teachers deserve credit for the condition of the building.

A.C. Huston was transferred as Principal from Round Lake School to Portage La Prairie School. Rev. W. McWhinney is acting as Principal until the new appointee, Rev. J.A. Card, arrives. Mr. Aaron Wakentine took over the duties of teacher at White Bear Day School succeeding Miss. G. Cass.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nReport on Round Lake Indian Residential School\n\nI have made two trips to the Round Lake Indian Residential School, on September 5th and October 11th respectively. My visit on September 5th was just at the opening of school and not a favourable time to judge any school as the staff is often made up of new members and the children have just returned from their holidays.\n\nWhen visiting the school on September 5th I found many things unsatisfactory and drew them to the attention of the Principal, Reverend Mr. J.A. Card. He had many excuses to offer chief of which was that he had not been at the school very long and that everything was in bad shape when he started. I was inclined to accept his excuses and expected to see considerable improvement on my next visit. However, when I visited the school on the 11th instant I regret to say that I found no improvement whatever in the many things which needed improvement.\n\nMrs. Menzies, the Provincial President of the M.M.S., one of whose chief interests is the Missions and Schools under the United Church, happened to be at the school the same day. This had not been arranged between us but was a fortunate coincidence as I had told her following my visit to the Round Lake School on September 5th that there were many things about the school in which I was dissatisfied. She informed me that she was going to make a trip to the school to investigate my complaints.\n\nMrs. Menzies informed me that she had written to the Reverend Principal of the school about two weeks previous to her visit advising him of the date she would visit the school. Either from intention or carelessness Mr. Card had arranged to be absent in Winnipeg on the date of Mrs. Menzies' visit. I did not advise him of the date of my visit because I wished to visit the school without special preparation having been made for my visit.\n\nI took Mrs. Menzies around the school buildings to see the many instances of neglect and carelessness about the school. Mr. Kerley, the Indian Agent, was, of course, present also.\n\nAs the Department is aware, the Round Lake School is a fire trap if fire ever breaks out in it. The only fire escape which had been in operation on the west side of the building, being that part of the building which is most likely to afford a means of escape from the dormitories, if there was a fire, had been eliminated by building at the foot of it an outer porch over the door to the boys' play room. I was annoyed when I saw this on my visit to the School on September 5th and drew Mr. Card's attention to it. He said he would have it moved to another window on the same side of the building where it would allow an immediate exit from the porch. The fire escape has not been moved when I again visited the school on October 10th. The broken panels of glass at the time of my visit on September 5th ran into dozens. Every building on the premises had some broken windows and some of them had many. None of these had been repaired on October 10th, in fact I believe even more had been added to the number in a little over a month. The school grounds are receiving no attention whatever and there are tall weeds in front of the main school building which have been growing all summer, and were still there on October 10th. All the buildings of the school needed painting but broken boards here and there and other damage resulting from...\nresulting from carelessness and lack of discipline with the children have rendered the buildings unsightly and unfit for painting until considerable repair work has been done. The flooring of the boys' play room had dangerous holes in it and many boards of the flooring ready to break through at any moment. Mr. Kerley, the Agent, informed me that there has been flooring at the school for some months for repairs to these floors but nothing has been done to repair them. Some of the dormitory floors are practically worn through in spots, also, and much repair work is needed.\n\nA new school building is certainly needed at the Round Lake School and I believe should be the first one built in this province if the Round Lake School is to continue in operation. I do not think, however, that Mr. Gard is a suitable Principal and he would have to show me a great deal of improvement before I would feel inclined to trust him with the supervision of a new school and the costly equipment which would go with it.\n\nI am quite aware that Mr. Gard has staff difficulties and has had difficulty in replacing undesirable members of his staff with people who have the right qualifications, but many of the repair jobs and the school grounds could receive attention by the older boys of the school if the school was properly supervised and I see no excuse whatever for having weeds everywhere about the buildings with many Indian boys in the school well able to perform such work if properly directed.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, October 30, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am sending forward herewith for your information copy of a report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School received by this branch from Inspector Ostrander.\n\nThis is a matter that I shall be glad to discuss with you at the time of your next visit to Ottawa. In the meantime, it has occurred to me that consideration might well be given to the desirability of having an educational survey undertaken on the reserves immediately adjoining this school; in fact, I should like to undertake a number of such surveys just as soon as the officials qualified to undertake this work are available.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nTORONTO 2B, Ontario.\nAttention of Mr. R.A.

I am, however, sending your letter on to Colonel Nemy, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, for his consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nReverend A. C.

Both reports are entirely satisfactory and both teachers are graded as A. and B. throughout on the teacher grading scale.\n\nThe only comment which would seem to indicate action on your part is that Mr. Moir found the outside door of the school, the only exit, locked. In all probability this matter has already been discussed with the Principal of the School, but in view of the fire hazard it should not be permitted to happen again.\n\nBernard F.

They should return on Sunday two weeks later.\n\nThis arrangement was carried out a year ago and we had 100% of our pupils back on time.\n\nWe wish your approval for this plan again this year.\n\nKindly excuse writing, am in hospital recovering from attack of Pneumonia.\n\nYour Respectfully,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nJ.

Card,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nWhitewood Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Christmas Holidays\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI was sorry to be advised in your letter of December 8 that you were ill in hospital after an attack of pneumonia. I hope that you are fully recovered by now. Please find attached a circular letter on Christmas Holidays which clarifies the situation for everyone. I believe this will clarify the point raised in your letter, and it will be quite in order for your children to go to their homes on December 19 and return on January 2, 1949.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFH/AM\nThe photos illustrate certain outstanding factors about this school:\n\n1. The remoteness of the school from habitations. The reserve is across the water (ice).\n2a) The basement is dark.\n   b) Drinking water is always a pre-occupation.\n\n3a) A happy, well-carded student-body\n   b) A well-disposed staff\n   c) An alcove off the senior room for beginners. With another (third) room and teacher, this drawback could be rectified.\n\nWhen the two physical plants are compared, Round Lake makes File Hills look good.\n\nA good case could be made for the early replacement of this school.\n\nWhether day-schools are as good an alternative would require a much more extended survey than has so far been possible and would involve a study of:\n(a) the terrain, population clusters and home conditions,\n(b) the effects of seasonal conditions on existing roads; drought, flood conditions, deep snow have been mentioned.\n\nC.A.T.

Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. Clark.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe beg to make requisition for a new and adequate Residential School to take the place of the present Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe present building can not be properly heated in some of the rooms. In the coldest weather the children's play rooms are below freezing point.\n\nMuch of the equipment is incapable of giving proper service especially in the kitchen and laundry.\n\nMay we hope that a thorough examination of this school building and the equipment be made with a view to replacing it with a modern building and equipment.\n\nIf we continue in this building the plumbing and the heating system will have to be overhauled and much replaced. This will doubt have a bad effect on the health of pupils and staff.\n\nThanking you for attention and interest in this matter.\n\nYour Truly,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 29, 1948.\nJanuary 25, 1949.\n\nMr. J.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nFuture Policy - Round Lake Residential School.\n\nI also had an opportunity of discussing the future policy of the Department with regard to this school with Dr. Dorsey yesterday.\n\nYou will recall that in discussing the situation in my office recently, you were advised that the Donald Inspection Company report on the general condition of the building was unsatisfactory.\n\nIn fact their report concluded as follows:\n\n\"We consider that the condition of this building not such as to justify major repairs or additions but should be replaced with a new one as soon as provision can be made therefor\".\n\nIt is agreed that the situation at Round Lake with regard to replacing the residential school with day schools presents a much more difficult problem than that at File Hills.\n\nHowever, we would appreciate receiving from you the same information as requested under our letter of the same date on the File Hills Residential School. We will then be in a position to hold further discussions concerning this school with the United Church officials.\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter dated January 25th, 1949, File 661-1/-5(E), regarding the future policy with respect to the Round Lake Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith list completed by Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, of the Crooked Lake Agency, showing the surviving children born in the years 1937 to 1948, inclusive, of the Ochagowace, Kahkewistahaw, Cowessess, and Sakimay Reserves, and their religious denominations.\n\nJ.P.R. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n22nd April, 1949.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBroadview, Saskatchewan.\n\nRegional Supervisor Ostrander has forwarded to us the list which you prepared showing the surviving children who were born in the years 1933-1948 inclusive, of the Ochapowace, Kehkwistahsw, Cowessess and Sakimay Reserves, and their religious denominations.\n\nOn reviewing this list we find that in some instances you show the religion of the children as United Church, but state that they are attending a school conducted under Catholic auspices. Where the list shows this situation, we have placed a red mark.\n\nThere are also cases where you state the religion of the children to be Roman Catholic, but show them to be attending a school conducted under Protestant auspices. Where the list shows this situation, we have placed a green mark.\n\nWe would like you to review the list and if there have been some mistakes made, you should correct them. If not, you should give an explanation. Please give the matter your immediate consideration and have the list returned to us at the earliest possible date.\n\nBernard F.

These schools would take care of practically all the children attending Round Lake School with the exception of those from Sakimay Reserve.\n\nThe feeling of the majority of the Indians is in favor of a Residential School in preference to Day Schools, provided a new Residential School were erected.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley,\nSuperintendent.\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nDay schools to replace Round Lake Residential School:\n\nWith Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Kerley I discussed and examined sites on the reserves on June 20 and 21.\n\nOur view is that four schools will be necessary.\n\nThe sites suggested have been selected with regard to probable future concentration of homes on the better farming land.\n\nMr. Kerley is to finalize the map of the reserves showing the four points:\n\n(i) In the valley at the north end of the reserve, on the road leading to Dubuc, near Stanley's house. There should be water.\n\n(ii) At the corner of sections 2, 3, 35, 36 across the big slough from Alexson's near a good spring.\n\n(iii) About five miles east of (ii) on a knoll near Mrs. Assumption's house. A community field likely to be settled soon is nearby. It is not far to a spring and a well.\n\n(iv) In the SW \u00bc of section 6 on the Raddemacher. Water has been encountered here but has to be verified. Not much settlement nearby, but it is the area where the Indians should farm.\n\nSome children will for the present be too far from any day school.

In order to continue it would be necessary to build a small barn for horses and in lieu of cows to supply milk, liquid or powdered. And there are other changes that would incur difficulty and expense.\n\nBut it is too late to hope to get the pupils into new day schools by even the end of the coming September.\n\nI foresee obstructions to the admission of a significant number to white schools.\n\nThe continued schooling of these children may, therefore, require adjustments at Berilo, Brandon, Portage la Prairie, and perhaps Gordon's residential schools.\n\nIf the upper grade pupils go to Brandon I again recommend that pupils of that school begin their course at Brandon High School in Grade Seven.

Clark, dated June 21st, 1949, in connection with the future of the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Clark's letter was written after a discussion between us, and, of course, I agree with its contents.\n\nCertainly some definite decision will have to be made at a very early date, and I do not see how the Round Lake Residential School can continue for another term without a large expenditure. A barn and other out-buildings will have to be built, unless it is proposed to carry out the farm work with a tractor and buy milk for the children.\n\nThe equipment in the kitchen, laundry, and boiler room is in very poor shape, and there is no space in these rooms to permit installation of suitable equipment, in addition to which, the whole of the building being a terrible fire hazard, we would not be justified in installing expensive equipment in it.\n\nIt is my opinion that, as there is small likelihood of day schools being built this year to replace the Round Lake Residential School, certainly not in time for the beginning of the next term, Mr. Kerley should be given information as to the number of children who can be accommodated for the next term at the Birtle, Brandon, and Portage Schools, in order that he may discuss with the parents the matter of sending their children to those schools, and have a definite decision with regard thereto at least by the middle of August. I believe that a few of the children from the Round Lake Area could be placed in the Gordon's School, when it opens, if there is no objection to the United Church children being placed in an Anglican Residential School.\n\nWe had hoped that a number of the children, particularly of the Ocharowace Reserve....\nof the Ochapowace Reserve, could attend white day schools which are reasonably close to their homes. However, Indian Superintendent Kerley has been definitely informed by the Broadview School Unit Board that they will not permit the Indian children to attend their schools. This question may be settled to our satisfaction later, but at least accommodation at the white schools will not be available at the beginning of the next term.\n\nI agree with Mr. Clark's recommendation that pupils of the Gordon's School with a standing of Grade 7 or higher, should be sent to Brandon for the purpose of attending Brandon High School at the beginning of the next term.\n\nMay I be given definite instructions with regard to these matters, as soon as possible.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have made a report today in connection with the re-opening of the Round Lake Residential School but did not mention therein a matter which in my opinion is deserving of serious consideration by yourself and whatever action you consider necessary.\n\nIn my opinion Reverend J.A. Card, the Principal of this school is entirely unfit physically and mentally to continue as principal if the school is to continue in operation. I would suggest that you discuss him with Mr. Clark who visited the school with me recently. When appraising the school I mentioned to Mr. Clark the mental state in which this gentleman has been for some time, and the fact that whether he was undergoing nervous breakdown or for some other reason I do not know, I have to introduce myself to him every time I visit the school as he does not remember me from one visit to the next. I asked Mr. Clark to take particular notice of this when he got to the school and he will remember the fact that I had to introduce myself. He will also remember the fact that Mr. Card could not recall whether or not there had been a visit of a School Inspector during the term.\n\nActually it is practically impossible to do business with Mr. Card because of his mental condition, therefore you will imagine how unfit he is to manage the institution. You are also aware that there has been considerable difficulty in controlling the children and dealing with the parents of the children. This is mostly due to the fact that Mr. Card is completely incapable.\n\nI did not previously bring this matter to your attention because I expected that the school would close and the matter would right itself. However now that it seems quite possible that the school will re-open very serious consideration will have to be given to replacing Mr. Card as Principal. How that is to be done I do not know, nor am I willing to officially state that Mr. Card's mental condition is as bad as I have indicated in this letter. However if Dr. Dorey and the Ladies of the W.M.S. are so anxious to continue operating the Round Lake Residential School they will certainly have to do something about its management.\n\nJ.P.B.

A. Card of the Round Lake School is entirely fit, physically and mentally, to continue as principal of this school, now that it has been decided to continue its operation.\n\nOur Educational Survey Officer was rather concerned over Mr. Card's health on his last visit. I have received a report from Mr. Ostreander, in which he states as follows:\n\n\"I would suggest that you discuss him with Mr. Clark who visited the school with me recently. When approaching the school I mentioned to Mr. Clark the mental state in which this gentleman has been for some time, and the fact that whether he is verging on a nervous break down or for some other reason I do not know, I have to introduce myself to him every time I visit the school as he does not remember me from one visit to the next.

We therefore feel that enquiries should be\nmade of your local officials to ascertain the suitability of Mr.\nCard as principal. You can appreciate how difficult it is for us\nto proceed in these matters and therefore I would ask that an effort\nbe made to get details of Mr. Card's health before the re-opening\nof the school in September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

After all, the ordinary individual is in no position to express a judgment on the condition of a person's health. Dr. McDonald, with our concurrence, has made the suggestion to Mrs. Loveys that Mr. Card be requested to have a medical check-up and get a statement from a physician which can be submitted.

Perhaps this is as good a time as any to tell you that I am back on the job.\n\nI am simply writing to say that we have been informed by the Woman's Missionary Society that Mr. Card is in the hospital in Saskatoon. The doctors are not sure what is the matter with him but his condition is serious enough to warrant concern. The question at the present time is one of diagnosis.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGDHC\nRegina, August 12th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter from Indian Superintendent W.J.D. Kerley, of the Crooked Lake Agency, and a petition signed by many of the parents of the Kahkewistahaw and Ochapowace Bands protesting against Mrs. Linton, senior teacher at the Round Lake School, remaining as teacher for the next school term.\n\nI may say in this connection that when Mrs. Loveys was at the Round Lake School recently I mentioned to her that I had been informed that this petition was circulating, but that I had not yet received it. I know nothing particular against Mrs. Linton, and I believe she is fairly successful in the classroom. I believe that perhaps she is rather strict with the children, and the strap is too much in evidence. I mentioned this to Mrs. Loveys and she, in turn, mentioned it to Mrs. Linton. Mrs. Loveys afterwards informed me that Mrs. Linton stated that she does not punish the children, and that any necessary punishment of the children is done by Reverend Mr. Card, the Principal. I cannot argue this point, but I doubt very much that he imposes much punishment on the children. In any case, I think Mr. Clarke will tell you that there was a strap on display in Mrs. Linton's room on one of his visits. If she does not use it for punishment, at least she keeps it on display as a threat of punishment, which does not promote harmony in the classroom.\n\nI do not feel inclined to recommend the removal of Mrs. Linton as I believe that many of the difficulties at the Round Lake School will be overcome if Reverend Mr. Card retires and an efficient Principal is placed in charge.

I enclose a copy of the Doctor's report.\n\nI have been in conversation with Mr. Dewar, the local Member, concerning the future of this school and he is prepared to approach the United Church with reference to its closing at the end of the next school term.\n\nWe have included in our 1950-51 Estimates the four one-room day schools requested for this reserve and it is presumed that these will provide for most of the Indian children now attending the Round Lake Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter.\u201d\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. A. C. Newton\n\nDated: October 3, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Oct. 24, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL WHITEWOOD, SASK.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the WHITEWOOD, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days attended of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the WHITEWOOD, SASK., School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 2, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 7th day of October, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the WHITEWOOD, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: W.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: J. A. Card\n\nDated Oct. 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Nov. 5, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: J. A. Card\n\nDated: Feb. 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated APR 5 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nResp.

Quarter**: $5433\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 7, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this JAN 10, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the Board Residential School at Round Lake on Ochagamie Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1946**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DAYS OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 274            | Hugh Board      | 10  |     |      |               |                  |                          |                           | 54/50      |\n| 275            | Edward McKay    | 11  |     |      |               |                  |                          |                           | 90         |\n| 276            | Robert Sparrow  | 9   |     |      |               |                  |                          |                           | 45         |\n| 277            | George Wasacoo | 9   |     |      |               |                  |                          |                           | 30         |\n| 278            | Edward Isaac    | 11  |     |      |               |                  |                          |                           | 30         |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n| TOTALS | 32 | TOTALS | 87434213 | -5735 | TOTALS | 44891623 | 2783 |\n\n**NOTE**\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: J. A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal J.A. Card\n\nDated January 6, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this JAN 10, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal: J. R. Card\n\nDated: April 8th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCROOKED LAKE AGENCY\n\nDated at Broadview, Sask.\n\nAPR 17 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, ragging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: J.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ______ School for the Quarter ended ______.\n\nPrincipal ______\n\nDated ______\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent ______\n\nDated at ______ this ______\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. J.A. 403\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Broadview Lake School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nCROOKED LAKE AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Crooked Lake School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: J.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Round Lake School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: John Card\n\nDated: June 25, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCROOK'S CREEK AGENCY\n\nDated at Broadview, Sask., July 5, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

R.J.Ross, had been complied with, regarding the balancing of Bank A/c's and the school cash book. The book had been written up to March 31st. only, and some of the totals and entries were in pencil and others in ink. Two Bank Accounts are kept, as previously reported - one a Current Trust A/c, and the other a Savings A/c, and transfers take place from one Account to the other as funds are depleted. The Principal sometimes draws a personal cheque on the Trust Account in error and then adjusts it by either paying cash or drawing another cheque, necessitating more book entries which inflates the \"miscellaneous\" column. Mr. Ross apparently dislikes doing the office work, does not file anything methodically or have any uniform system and cannot get anyone to help him or do it for him.\n\nNo statement had been prepared for the fiscal year, or sent the Department, so I compiled the attached statement from the cash book totals covering the year. The items may differ somewhat in their classifications, but the totals were balanced. A detailed audit would have taken several days.\n\nTotal Revenue appears to have been $17,757.74. The proceeds from Farm & Garden include large quantities of meat sold to Indians, and I understand some beef and pork was also traded for fuel wood, which accounts for the large supply on hand, and the heavy expense of $2,002.75 under \"Expenditures\" for \"Fuel & Light\". About 800 loads of wood were purchased and there is-\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nand there is considerably more than a year's supply on hand at present. Clothing, tobacco, candies and confectionery are also sold to adult Indians and the children, and the revenue recorded.\n\nThe item of \"collections & donations\" includes collections at church services and concerts, and is disbursed under \"miscellaneous\" to the Church societies, which inflates that item under expense.\n\nUnder 'Expenditures', the salaries exceed half of the per capita grant, and the list of staff and salaries at present totals $6,540.00.\n\nThe clothing item is low, $704.92, as I believe most of the clothing is supplied by the Church authorities, but some, as above mentioned, is sold to Indians.\n\nThe \"Farm & Garden\" item is very high, $5,275.89, but includes a carload of feeder cattle purchased last year and wintered up to the present in the hope of selling at better prices and realizing a higher price for grain indirectly. However, if the original price were considered, together with cost of feed to date, and the present price of the cattle, it would appear as if a considerable loss will result.\n\nThis item also includes a grinder $400.00, (not all paid for), for crushing grain, a cultivator, truck expenses, hay and feed for cattle, the purchase of a bull, and pedigreed calves.\n\nThe Principal informed me that he had at present 80 head of cattle (more than the total pupilage), 13 horses, 34 pigs, and 50 poultry. About 200 bushels of potatoes were raised last year, but a poor garden crop and insufficient root vegetables for the School's requirements were grown.\n\nCompared with the previous year the cost of operations is slightly less, and would have been considerably less if such large amounts of money had not been invested in cattle and other livestock, as well as wood. A certain amount of food from the Farm and Garden has, of course, been consumed by the children and staff, so this item would be greater if an estimate were made and added to the actual food cost.\n\nThe following statements, in duplicate, accompany this report,-\n\nBank Adjustment as at March 31/31\nReceipts and Expenditures do\nList of Staff, Occupations & Salaries\nCost of Operation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nH.

I do not know whether the Principal has made his annual report and submitted a statement to the Department or not, but there are certain matters in the administration of this school of which I do not approve or think proper.\n\nYou will note the last paragraph of Page 1 of the report, regarding the trading with Indians. I have been informed that the Principal has more than once requested the Agent to assist him in making his collections from the Indians. The matter of the Principal trading with Indians has been recently brought\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbrought to the attention of the Department by me, and upon your instructions being received, they were repeated by letter to the Principal. Apparently these instructions have been disregarded - not a very satisfactory situation, I should say, and it appears to me that the Department will now have to take steps to stop this, in view of their instructions being disregarded.\n\nOn Page 2 of the report, it will be seen that there are over one hundred head of live stock at this school, including 90 head of cattle, some of which were purchased from the grant with the hope of selling at a profit.\n\nApart from using the per capita grant for the purchase of feeder stock, which could be regarded as speculation, I do not consider there should be more than a milking herd sufficient for the 75 pupils in attendance. It means that the Indian boys are working too hard looking after this stock, the feeding and herding of them, and also using the farm buildings, which would be overcrowded in the severe part of the winter.\n\nI would be glad if the Department could see their way to request Mr. Ross to keep his books and documents so that they could be audited properly, and also point out to him the matter of trading with the Indians and venturing too much in the cattle business.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. H. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 18, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of July 8th, last, with reference to the bookkeeping at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Mr. Rayner reports that he had the same difficulty upon the occasion of his visit last month, and I write now to ask you to put into immediate practice the recommendations of the Departmental Auditor. I am sure that he will be glad to give you assistance by correspondence, if you will write to him at Commissioner Graham's office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nOttawa, June 18, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 304-11 of the 5th instant, enclosing Mr. Rayner's report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is again writing to Mr. Ross, with reference to the bookkeeping at the school, and is corresponding with him direct concerning trading with the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Upon this visit I am pleased to report that a great improvement has taken place, practically all my suggestions having been carried out. The cash book is balanced monthly with the Bank Accounts, and a Bank Journal now used. Cheques for expenditures are written instead of cash paid, and they are numbered, and those numbers recorded in cash book. The statements and vouchers are attached to the cheque for which it is in payment, and these are filed for future reference, which was not done previously.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. K. J. Ross, now keeps his own personal funds and expenditures from being mixed with the School Trust Account, and states that by following the above methods he has been enabled to correct the Bank at times, and keep closer control over his expenditures.\n\nThe books were written up to date and found in good order, so a statement was prepared for the past fiscal year and is attached hereto. I have continued from the previous period which was submitted May, 1931.\n\nTotal receipts, \u00a316,190.24 include \u00a31800.00 received from the W.N.S. as grant for clothing, etc. Proceeds from the farm and garden, chiefly cattle sold, amounted to \u00a31619.42; the per capita grant \u00a31,461.86, and over \u00a31200.00 from other sources as listed.\n\nThe expenditures total \u00a314,726.31, compared with \u00a318,632.47 for the previous year, reductions being noticeable in food, fuel and light, farm and garden, extra labour, and miscellaneous expenses.\n\nAlthough the crop, both for grains and vegetables, was a complete failure, and much of these products had to be purchased, care has been taken in financing, and at the fiscal year end, \u00a31462.92 was the unexpended balance on hand. Sufficient wheat had been retained from 1930 crop for the purposes of 1931, and this was gristed to flour for the school's consumption.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-3, part 1)\nAt present the livestock consists of 76 head of cattle, 15 horses, 22 hogs, and about 100 poultry.\n\nThe principal has been informed by a Provincial Government official that the Saskatchewan Department of Agriculture would purchase some of his Holstein cattle for breeding purposes. Some of the cattle will be entered in the Regina Fair.\n\nThere are about five surplus milking cows on hand, and possibly a few heifer calves, which Mr. Ross would be willing to pass on to the department for some good purpose. I understand he has intimated this to the church authorities, in response to the query of the department recently made as to surplus stock and implements, etc., which any of the schools might have on hand.\n\nThe average number of pupils in attendance for last year, and at present, total 75, and upon this figure is based the cost of operation as shown on attached statement, which compares more favourably than a similar statement prepared last year.\n\nFrom casual observation while at the school, the building appeared clean and tidy, and the children contented and well nourished.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, a copy of which is being given to Mr. Inspector Purison:\n\nReceipts and expenditures for fiscal year\nBank Adjustment\nCost of operation\nStaff, occupations and salaries.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

During the past three years I had some difficulty in inducing Mr. Ross, the Principal, to keep the records in good shape and have reported accordingly. The cash book is now balanced monthly with the two Bank accounts and a Bank Adjustment statement is recorded. Cheques for expenditures are written instead of being endorsed. Vouchers are made from the proceeds and these are all numbered and those numbers recorded in the cash book. The statements and vouchers are attached to cancelled cheques and these are filed for future reference, which was not done previously.\n\nThe Principal now recognizes the value of keeping his own funds and personal expenses from being mixed with the school Trust Account and states that by following the above methods he has been enabled to correct the Bank at times and keep closer control over his expenditures.\n\nThe books were written up to date and found in good order and a statement was prepared for the past fiscal year and is attached hereto. I have continued from the previous audit which was submitted June 25th, 1932.\n\nTotal receipts were $16,082.51, of which amount $11,367.40 was the per capita grant. A grant of $1,750.00 was received from the W.M.S. at Toronto and the proceeds from farm and garden and other items are as shown under the heading of \"Receipts\". Many of the items under \"Expenditures\" have been reduced compared to previous years, the total being $14,536.56 with a balance on hand as at March 31st last of $1,545.95. This amount agreed with the Cash Book figures for the month of March as shown on the Bank Adjustment Statement attached.\n\nTwo Bank accounts are kept for the purpose of earning a little interest from a Savings Account. As the current Trust Account is reduced, transfers are made from the Savings Account in order to meet current expenses. It will\n\n- be noted that last -\n\nN. C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nbe noted that last year $56.63 was obtained from Bank interest.\n\nThe \"Cost of Operation\" statement also shows proportionate reductions compared with the figures previously submitted. Salaries have been reduced by over $430.00 and the Principal informed me that he had been advised from his Headquarters in Toronto that, effective January 1st next, there would have to be a further reduction of 15% from the salaries of the Staff.\n\nUnder the item of \"Farm and Garden\" expenses $1,150.00 is included which was payment for farm lands purchased from the Canadian Pacific Railway. These payments were made in settlement throughout the year and it will be necessary to erect approximately six miles of new fence, for which the Principal will pay from the grant.\n\nNew seats have been installed in the Chapel at an expense of $162.60, which is included in the item of \"Miscellaneous Expense\". Also included in that same item is the sum of $435.00, remitted to the Church Authorities and which appears as a receipt under the heading of \"Collections from Staff for Church funds\", and part of the proceeds from the sale of candles etc.\n\nLast year the crop returns included 1,400 bushels of wheat, 1,500 bushels of oats, approximately 40 tons of barley and green feed, and 250 bushels of potatoes, which quantity was insufficient for school requirements, so the necessary purchases increased the food item to some extent. However there were ample roots and vegetables obtained.\n\nThe livestock at present includes 80 head of cattle, 50 of which are pure bred and registered; 15 horses; 11 hogs; and about 50 poultry.\n\nI questioned the necessity of having 80 head of cattle on hand, although perhaps it does not come within my jurisdiction to do so. However 80 head of cattle for a pupilage of 75 children appears to me excessive, as there is the necessity of furnishing ample feed for such a number and it entails extra work upon the older boys. The Principal informed me that a Holstein cow which he had and which had obtained first prize at the Yorkton fair had been valued by the Saskatchewan Livestock Commissioner at approximately $1,000.00. Mr. Ross was of the opinion that if he could obtain an offer of that sum at the Regina Exhibition, he would probably sell and the proceeds would be credited to the school funds.\n\nCrop prospects at present are very good. All of the school lands are in or adjacent to the Qu'Appelle Valley and it is estimated that about 200 tons of green feed will be obtained this year compared to about 40 obtained last year.\n\nMr. Ross takes a very keen interest in the\n\n- raising of pure bred -\nraising of pure bred cattle and the school certainly has a reputation for raising very good herds.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report, a copy of which has been handed to Mr. Murison.\n\nStatement of Receipts and Expenditures for fiscal year ended March 31st, 1933\nBank Adjustment\nCost of Operation\nList of Staff, occupations and salaries as at July 31st, 1933.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. B. Rayner,\nAuditor.\n\nP.S. Since writing the above, the awards for prize cattle have been announced as per the attached cutting. It will be seen that Mr. Ross has been successful in obtaining quite a number of prizes for the Round Lake School.\nHolstein Owned\nBy Indian School\nHas Fine Record\n\nTuesday's judging at the World's Grain Show brought the grand champion award to the Cherrywood Prancy Colantha, 186290, Holstein female.\n\nThe cows won similar awards at Brandon, Portage and Yorkton this year.\n\nCherrywood Prancy Colantha was purchased from J. H. Haggard, who owns the herd at Round Lake Indian residential school at Shellbrook. She is the dairy branch fieldman of the Saskatchewan branch of the Canadian Dairy Council.\n\nShe had never been shown until taken to the show grounds here and was pronounced by the judge, Mr. Axe, to be the best cow in the show which would do credit to the province and bring the consideration of the Toronto show.\n\nOperated by Church.\n\nThe Round Lake school is operated by the Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church of Canada, and a fine herd of 50 purebred Holstein cows has been kept up at this school during recent years.\n\nThe herd has been tested for milk and butterfat production and the school has completed two records in which the cows have been given certificates in butterfat production under the new regulations. To qualify for a black seal certificate, the minimum yield of butterfat is 400 pounds for a mature cow.\n\nMr. Haggard purchased Lakeview Lillian, 84445, the grand champion Ayrshire female, from Roland Ness of Trewinton, Alberta. He also bought two cows, Spice and Anderson, of Saltcoats No. 360, from Mr. Ness, resident of the Round Lake Indian school, near Shellbrook. These cows were not entered in the show but were purchased and delivered to their respective owners.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nLands Branch\n\nSchools Branch\n\nThe attached report on the Round Lake Residential School (United) Crooked Lakes Agency, by Mr. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI submit herewith a report of an examination of the books at the above school covering a period of two years, dating from April 1st 1933 to March 31st 1935.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. F. W. Holmes, I left the Inspector of Indian Agencies' office at Regina on the evening of the 16th inst., and arrived at the school Thursday morning the 16th, completing my examination on the afternoon of the 17th, returning to the Crooked Lake Agency to complete this report.\n\nAs there was but a small balance on hand at the end of the fiscal year ending March 31st 1935 very few transactions had been recorded in the Cash Book for April, and I therefore confined my examination to the period previously mentioned.\n\nThe Bank Pass Books for the Trust Account, and Savings Account, as well as all cheques paid by the Bank to March 31st last were on hand. The revenue as shown by the Dr. cash book entries was checked to deposits in the Bank.\n\nThe cancelled cheques were checked to the expenditure items in the cash book, and the items compared to accounts and vouchers which were attached to the cheques. I found many payments to local and wholesale grocery concerns were entered in the cash book under \"Food\" expense, but on examination of the accounts I found many of them contained items of clothing, house equipment, etc. Some time was spent in adjusting these entries, and correcting the monthly totals and yearly summary.\n\nI explained these matters to the Principal Mr. Ross, and how such entries, if left as entered, would increase his food expenditures, and in the future he will examine the accounts more closely and summarize them before making his cash book entries. My instructions applied also to the Ashdown hardware accounts, which included items of expense relating to Farm, or House Equipment but which had been charged to Buildings and repairs.\n\nSome confusion exists at the schools as to what items should be entered in the column Building and repairs. Some schools enter any repairs even those on Farm buildings, machinery or passenger auto in this column, and I would like to be advised on this point, and would suggest that the schools be given a circular in this connection. Also a few schools charge freight on coal to fuel expenses, on groceries to food, while others charge all such items to freight.\n\nBank Adjustment statements were prepared as at March 31st 1934 and March 31st 1935, the cash book balances agreeing with those shown on Statement 2, which is a comparative statement of Revenue and Expenditures for the two fiscal years.\n\nAlthough the statement of Revenue would appear self explanatory, I might state that the proceeds from Farm & Garden $2,102.99 for the fiscal year 1934-35 includes $907.01 from the sale of wheat and other grain, $486.40 from sale of cattle & pigs, and $156.42 from\n\nN. C. Allen, Esq.,\nRepresentative of the Treasury,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nand $642 from sale of butter, milk and eggs. For the previous fiscal year the Farm and Garden Revenue of $657.45 included sale of grain $162.20, cattle and pigs $278.58, milk, butter and eggs $164.00. The latter sales were to a C.G.I.T. camp which locates near the school each summer, and at a time when most of the pupils are away on their vacation.\n\nFor the year 1933-34 revenue under the heading of Donations and Sundry refunds consists of $391.92 contributed by the school staff to Church Missions and the balance sundry refunds by the staff for purchases made on their behalf from school funds. The donations were remitted quarterly by cheque to the officer in charge of the Mission Fund for the United Church, such cheques being included in Expenditures under the heading Miscellaneous.\n\nDuring the year 1934-35 the method of accounting for donations was changed, and instead of paying salaries in full and accepting their donations, deductions of such donations are now made at quarterly periods and only the net salary paid to the staff. A separate cheque is issued to the Mission Fund and charged to salaries. As a result the revenue under the heading Donations and Sundry refunds for 1934-35 consists of $91.16 collected from the staff before accounting procedure charged, $164.25 for sale of potatoes purchased for the school and later found to be surplus to requirements, $63.75 for refund of Provincial gasoline tax covering twelve months to March 31st 1934.\n\nThe Expenditure items are shown comparatively for the two years, and for the most part appear normal. The small clothing item of $405.26 is due to the school receiving a quantity of second hand clothing from the W.M.S. in 1935.\n\nDuring the year 1933-34 the school had a quantity of fuel on hand, but from their own land, while in the year 1934-35 most of the fuel had to be purchased.\n\nAs to the Farm & Garden expense of $2,743.01 in 1933-34 the chief item contained therein was the purchase of a section of pasture and wood land for $1,200.00. Purchase of implements cost $109.00; hay and feed $287.00; purchase of and registering of cattle $238.10.\n\nDuring the past fiscal year $1,643.75 was spent for feed and seed, as the crops last year were very poor, the school having to buy most of their hay and feed. Livestock purchases amounted to $415.30.\n\nFor the year 1933-34 extra was employed at the school, as the harvest crop that year was exceptionally heavy, but last fall the crops were very light. This accounts for the larger expense of $714.95 when compared to $75.20 spent in 1934-35.\n\nThe costs of operation statement 3 is based on an expenditure of $15,776.90 in the year 1933-34 and an average attendance of 76 pupils; the costs for 1934-35 on an expenditure of $16,880.56 and an average attendance of 75 pupils. Increases appear in the cost of clothing, the smaller expense in the former year was due to the donation of clothing as before mentioned.\n\nOn statement No. 3 is listed the members of the staff, their occupations and salaries as at May 1st 1935.\n\nThe Principal informed me that the livestock at the school consisted of 80 cows and calves; 19 horses; 15 pigs; and about 50 poultry.\n\nThe returns from last\nThe returns from last year's harvest were 500 bushels of wheat, and 40 loads of hay. No oats nor barley were obtained.\n\nThe potato crop was a failure, but fair quantities of other root vegetables were secured.\n\nThe following statements accompany this report which is in duplicate:\n\nBank Adjustments for March 31/34 and March 31/35.\nReceipts and Expenditures for the past two fiscal years.\nCosts of Operations for the past two fiscal years.\nSalaries as at May 1st 1935.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nG.

I trust that this report is in order.\n\nAlso the Principals Report for the same period. Once again I would like remind you that in these matters I have not had the benefit of being here for a time before the previous principal left nor any actual experience in Indian Residential Schools or Indian work of any kind.\n\nIn reference to my letter concerning the per capita I wish to say that I made the mistake of computing the allowance by the calendar year instead of the fiscal year. Since completing this present Report I find no discrepancy in the allowance as between one year and another.\n\nI am very pleased that the account of Steele and Lang, Limited is to be paid. Again I was at fault through lack of a thorough knowledge of proper procedure.\n\nMay I thank you for your help in these matters.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. A.

In checking over previous requisitions I find that we have sent to you the Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics. These books are in stock and I feel that we should make use of them before going to the expense of buying new books. If you should need any further number of these Canadian Problem and Practice Arithmetics, please let me know and we will have the Stationery Office send them to you. I am sending for the information of your teachers one copy of each of the Arithmetics (of each of the Everyday Arithmetics requisitioned). This is to permit the teachers to choose from other Arithmetics, the material required by the Saskatchewan course of study.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nYour letter of the seventeenth re-arithmetic just received.

Barn $4,000. Send authority to Regina for the painting and have an expenditure of approximately $3,000 on the barn.\n\nJune 9, 1926.\nOttawa, June 17, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation when in the Department, I have to authorize you to arrange for the painting necessary at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The appropriation for this purpose is $800; but, if a saving can be effected, please arrange to do so.\n\nYou are also authorized to build a barn at this school. Mr. Ferrier states that you are hopeful of an expenditure of not more than $3,000 for this purpose.\n\nWhen purchasing materials or engaging labour, etc., please be guided by the instructions in the Deputy Superintendent General's letter, No. 1-1-5, of the 14th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to inform you that I made a visit to the Crooked Lake Agency on the 4th and 5th of the present month.\n\nWhile on this reserve (Ochapowace) I visited the Round Lake School. There is no doubt that the outbuildings are necessary here, but I question whether we will be able to get them up. If funds are available the stable asked for should be built not later than next year. There are 72 children attending this school, but I am informed by the Principal that there are a number of children waiting to get in. He thinks they should have an addition to the school and I think perhaps he is right. An amount will be placed in the next Estimates for this.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nDuncan Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nNov. 15,\n1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe Round Lake Indian Residential School has, I understand, been under the management of the Woman's Missionary Society of the former Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe W.M.S. of the United Church, into which the various Women's Missionary Societies of the uniting churches have been merged, is pressing for a forty foot extension to the main building of the Round Lake School.\n\nThe statement submitted to me is to the effect that there are at least twenty children of school age on the reserve served by the school for which there is no accommodation in the present building. The proposed extension would provide more dormitory space and also more room in the dining room, and it is also desirable that there should be at least one more staff room for an engineer. The laundry could be enlarged by this extension and a proper sewing room provided. The kitchen could be placed in the basement of the new building and the present kitchen used as a store-room. It is also hoped that by this extension a small dispensary and a couple of rooms for sick children could be made available.\n\nTrusting that an appropriation will be made in the near future for this extension,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

Clark, who is the officer connected with the W. M. S. of the United Church who supervises the Indian work carried on by the former Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn this letter she calls my attention to the fact that Mr. Ross, the Principal of the Round Lake Residential School, did not make application for a grant for a new barn in connection with this school when he presented the requirements of this Institution to her, and says that she overlooked the matter of a grant for a new barn.\n\nI was at Round Lake during the past summer and quite appreciate the need there is for a new barn to meet the requirements of the farm connected with this school.\n\nTrusting you will give this application favourable consideration, I am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\n\nREGINA, SASK., Feb. 9th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools inspected by me in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was inspected on January 28th, 1927. The class rooms were first inspected. Mrs. Ross, wife of the principal, teaches the senior room. She holds her Second Class, non-professional Ontario, no Normal training, and is about 35 years of age. The senior room is made up of grades 4 to 6, with an enrolment of 34. According to the register, the attendance is good. Mrs. Ross keeps splendid order, and her manner and methods of teaching are good. Grade 6 attends all day and I believe has done so for two or three years. In view of this, Mrs. Ross should be able to make a good showing of her work. I understand there are other children who also attend all day.\n\nThe junior class room is in charge of Mr. Smith, who does not hold a certificate. He is about 26 yrs. of age. The grades taught are from 1 to 3, with an enrolment of 35. The work in this room is only fair. Mr. Smith is not a good teacher; his style and methods are very poor. I feel that the junior room should have a teacher with good qualifications, who will get the children started right and only by so doing can the best results be obtained in the senior grades. This foundation work is very important. The children in both rooms.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nboth rooms were clean and tidy, and the class rooms were in first class shape.\n\nThe dormitories were clean and well aired. All the beds had white spreads and were neatly made. These rooms showed care and attention. In this school they have no room where the sick may be cared for; the dormitories in which the children sleep must also accommodate the sick. There was at the time of inspection one case of Pneumonia and several of Chickenpox, as well as those with the 'Flu. This is certainly very bad for the children and difficult for the lady in charge.\n\nThe dining room is rather small, and is a poor shaped room. The ceiling is very low. The children's tables have recently been covered with a linoleum, which is very easily cleaned and looks well.\n\nThe laundry is very small and cramped. On wash day it is necessary to hang the clothes in the dining room to dry as there is no room in the laundry. They have no clothes dryer at this school.\n\nThe kitchen is also small. It is in the basement and the ceiling being so low makes it very hot to work in. In addition to this inconvenience, it is overrun by cockroaches, and these have spread to the second floor. This building is old, and I doubt if these pests will ever be entirely exterminated.\n\nI might mention here that the old wing on this school is in very poor condition, in fact, is beyond repair. The second floor is used as a store room, and I was surprised to find it very untidy and poorly kept. The Matron tried to excuse this on account of the recent sickness, but I fear it was purely a case of neglect and\nneglect and poor management.\n\nThe new chicken house is very satisfactory and greatly appreciated. The barns are very poor and far from being adequate. A new barn is badly needed and it should be a good size, so as to accommodate all the cattle and horses needed to carry on the work of this school.\n\nThe Principal's residence is not in use. Mr. & Mrs. Ross live in the school. This appeared to me to be a very poor arrangement as it required him to have his office, bedroom, and living room all in the one small front office. It is nearly as crowded as some of the Indian homes. This is unnecessary and if Mr. Ross had a proper staff he would not be required to reside in the school.\n\nConsiderable repair work is needed to the plaster in the school room, girls' dormitory and girls' playroom. On all the ceilings patches have fallen off and no doubt considerably more will have to be removed before the patches can be satisfactorily repaired.\n\nThe following are the members of the staff:\n\n- Mr. Ross - Principal\n- Mrs. Runniger - Matron, about 50 yrs. old\n- Mrs. A. Moss - Sewing Teacher, about 58 yrs. old\n- Mrs. Hudson - Kitchen Matron, \" 54 \"\n- Mrs. Best - Laundress, \" 50 \"\n- Mrs. Ross - Sr. Teacher, \" 35 \"\n- Mr. Smith - Jr. Teacher, \" 26 \"\n- Mr. Ross - Farming Instructor\" 59 \"\n- Mr. Barthu - Mechanic, a young Ruthenian.\n\nI have already discussed the work of the school teachers. With regard to the other lady members of the staff, they appeared to carry on the work quite satisfactorily, although I feel that some of these women are really too old to handle such positions. The Farmer,\n\nMr. Ross.\nMr. Ross, knows farming, but is too old for the position. He appeared to fill the position of a \"hired man\" rather than Farming Instructor. A young man who can handle boys and who is alive to agricultural advancements is badly needed here. The mechanic is a young Ruthenian, not the type of man I would care to hire, although Mr. Ross claims he is a good worker and cheaper than Canadian labour. I do not think a few dollars should be considered in securing proper help for these institutions if we are to expect the best results.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. Ross, is a good worker and desirous of making a success. However, I believe he is only just realizing the big responsibility which has been his, and whether or not he will ever measure up to this responsibility, I am not prepared to say. I consider his methods are very far from the best, and until he is prepared to change them, the best results will not be obtained. He informed me that his resignation had been handed in to the church and that he was prepared to leave as soon as his position could be filled.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK., February 18th, 1927\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a report on the two Residential Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Inspector Hamilton during the latter part of January and the first week of February.\n\nRound Lake School\n\nThe work in the Senior classroom at this school seems to be progressing favourably, but I agree with the Inspector that we should have a better qualified teacher for the Junior room.\n\nIt is pleasing to note that the dormitories were clean and well aired. It is regrettable, however, that there is not a separate room in which to nurse cases of sickness. This difficulty will be overcome when the new addition is built to the school. As you are aware, there is an item of $15,000.00 in the Estimates for this purpose.\n\nA new barn is needed at this school, and this matter has been under consideration for some time now. There is a small item in the Estimates for repairs to the buildings, but not sufficient to do all that is necessary.\n\nWith regard to the staff, I cannot say that I agree with the Inspector that these people are too old to carry on the work successfully. The Inspector is of the opinion that the mechanic should be a Canadian, or British born. However, I do not know that we can interfere very much in a matter of this kind if a man does his work well.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe report on the Cowessess school is very satisfactory. Everything seems to be in good order. The outbuildings are reported to be poor, with the exception of the barn. This is true. An item of $60.00 is in the Estimates for the purpose of re-flooring the stalls. There is also an item to provide an implement shed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nFebruary 24, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nShortly after the Round Lake Indian Residential School was acquired by this Department, the per capita grant was reduced from $165 to $140. The payments are made to the Missionary Society in Toronto and the Rev. Principal of the school was unaware of the lower rate for several months. The school was in a solvent position financially and he continued to make replacements and repairs, without asking for the Department's assistance. Such action is to be commended, but the lower per capita grant has left the school with a small deficit.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has asked that the Department reimburse him for certain expenditure that could quite properly not be charged to the per capita grant, and, in view of the unusual circumstances, I wish to recommend that payment be made for the following items:\n\n| Item                          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Materials for painting and decorating | $110.84  |\n| Force pump                    | $9.50    |\n| Wind-mill                     | $167.63  |\n| Furniture for staff parlour   | $152.50  |\n| Dining room suite             | $130.40  |\n\n$570.87\n\nReceipted accounts have been presented and payment would be quite in order.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 304-11 of the 18th instant, enclosing Inspector Hamilton's report on the residential schools of the Crooked Lake agency. I shall communicate with the proper authorities regarding the advisability of securing a better qualified teacher for the junior classroom of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that there is an item in the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year in connection with a new barn for this school and also for some painting. I note your remarks regarding the advisability of an addition at this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, February 25, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nUnder separate cover, there is being forwarded to you a cheque for $570.87, which should be credited to the Round Lake Indian Residential School account. As you are aware, last April the per capita grant was reduced and the Rev. Principal continued to make replacements and repairs without asking for the Department's assistance. Such action is to be commended, but the lower grant has upset the Rev. Principal's calculations. This cheque is for the purpose of reimbursing the management for:\n\nMaterials for painting and decorating $110.84\nForce pump - - - 9.50\nWind-mill - - - 167.63\nFurniture for staff parlour - - - 152.50\nDining room suite - - - 130.40\n\nTotal: - $570.87\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You stated that you would see that this request was not overlooked when presenting our requirements for the coming fiscal year to Parliament. Was an amount allowed for the above purpose?\n\nAlso, may I ask what has been done relative to an addition to this school building? You intimated in your letter of November 17th, 1926 (No.108-1-5) that our request for an addition to the main building would have due consideration when the estimates were being prepared.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\nMay 14, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nThere is an appropriation of $3,200 for the purpose of erecting a new barn at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I should be grateful if you would ascertain just what is required and proceed with the work. If a saving can be effected, you may let me know what repairs to the other buildings can be undertaken. You will remember that, upon the occasion of your last visit to Ottawa, you informed Mr. Ferrier that the barn should not cost more than $3,000. There is also an item of $800 for painting the main building. This work, also, may be proceeded with. Please be guided by general instructions in my 1-1-5 of the 6th instant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMay 14, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to improvements at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that funds are available for the erection of a new barn and for the painting of the main building. I am today authorizing Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, to undertake the work. I regret that it will not be possible to build an addition to this school at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. E.

I have told him that if he will agree to advance the amount of the expenditure over $3000.00 which will be necessary for this style of barn we will erect it. Personally I do not see the necessity for having a bank barn.\n\nI may say that the item of $800.00 allowed for painting will be available for some other purpose as this painting was done last Fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

Ostrander, Indian Agent at Broadview, that the play rooms at the Round Lake Residential School are unfit to be used in cold weather as they cannot be kept warm enough, even with full steam turned on, and consequently are useless when needed most. Two small steam radiators are provided in each of the two play rooms. He suggests that if these four were installed together in one room and two larger ones purchased for the other, there would then be sufficient heat. The school would do the work of installation if the Department would provide the radiators, and I have ascertained that the latter could be procured at a cost of approximately $100.00, plus carriage to Stockholm. I would recommend making the change suggested. I shall be glad if the Department will grant the necessary authority.\n\nThe Agent reports further in connection with this school that the old cattle barn could be serviceably converted into a hog pen at a cost of about $50.00 for material. As a hog pen would be useful and the cost would be small, I would recommend the incurring of the expenditure mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

The items totalled $14.00 and I would recommend payment of this amount, if the Department agrees.

Grierson & Son, Ltd., Whitesand, Sask., for material for converting old stable into hog pen, Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 108-1-5 dated 7th September, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on an inspection of the two Boarding Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency which was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton during the latter part of January and the first week in February.\n\nThe first school reported on is the Cowessess Indian Residential School, which is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and the Principalship of the Rev. Father Carrierie. With reference to the barn needing paint, I may point out that an amount has been asked for in the Estimates to have this work done and if the amount is authorized the work will be carried on during the coming summer. Regarding the Inspector's remarks concerning a henhouse and pigsty, an amount to provide for these buildings was placed in the Estimates, also for a root house. It seems to me, however, that it would not have taken much of an effort on the part of the principal and his staff to have a root house erected, as there are a great many Indians living right near the school. A good root house was built at File Hills by the Principal.\n\nRound Lake. This school is under the auspices of the United Church and the Principalship of the Rev. R.J.Ross. The report on this school is not satisfactory at all. The junior classroom work should be under a qualified teacher, instead of that it is under a mere lad and I understand that this is the first school he has taught in. He is a son of the Mr. Heron who was at one time Principal of the Indian School in Regina when it was in operation. The laundry here is in poor shape but if the Principal had exerted himself he could have improved matters a great deal. The old school which is attached to the present school is empty and it seems to me that by putting forth a little effort they could have made better arrangements regarding their laundry work. With reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. and Mrs. Ross giving up their room in the school, I would point out that the Department bought a splendid residence for Mr. Ross and this building has not been used since the purchase was made some years ago. This is a mistake and the Department should insist on his going over into his own house and making room in the school for the accommodation of pupils and staff.\n\nYou will notice that the entrance to the root cellar is from the dining-room and on the occasion of the Inspector's visit the roots were being picked over, and frozen and rotten ones gathered up, with the result that the building was permeated with a most offensive odour. This arrangement is most unsatisfactory and the Department should not allow it to continue.\n\nYou will note that there is no standpipe in this building to supply water in the event of fire, and this is a most unsatisfactory and dangerous situation. A standpipe should be put in at once and hose attached to same. The exits on to the fire escapes from the dormitories are most unsatisfactory. As the arrangement stands now it means that the children would have to go out of a window, slide down a portion of the roof and then reach over and catch hold of a pipe to come down. Doors should be cut down to the floor level, landings built outside and pipes running through the floors of these landings. It looks to me as though a larger and heavier style of pipe should be used for this purpose than that which is in use at the present time. The fire drill that was called for during the Inspector's visit was, as you will notice, unsatisfactory, and indicates that the children have not been getting the proper instructions along this line.\n\nI do not think that the staff at this school are at all what they should be.\n\nI note that the children are not dismissed in the afternoon for recess and that the work in the classroom is carried on until 5 p.m. If the classroom work is carried on from 1.30 to 5 p.m. this practise should be stopped at once. This is too long an interval and the children cannot stand the long confinement. I should be glad to know if you wish this to be changed. I am of the opinion that it must be a system they have adopted themselves without the knowledge of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI inspected this school on February 1st, 1928.\n\nI first visited the senior classroom where Mrs. Ross, the wife of the Principal, is in charge. In this room\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nthis room the work of grades 4 to 8 is being carried on. Mrs. Ross is a splendid teacher and puts a great deal of effort in her work. I noticed that the children were not dismissed at recess and that the work of the classroom was carried on until 5 P.M. Whether this is wise or not I am rather doubtful, as very often the children are unable to stand so much classroom work. The room was well ventilated and clean. The children were all neat and tidy.\n\nIn the junior classroom, which is in charge of Mr. Heron, the work of grades 1 to 3 is carried on. These little children go to school all day, with the result that the work in this room is very heavy, even for a well qualified teacher as the roll calls for 51 pupils, 60 of whom were present on the day I inspected the school. I was informed by Agent Ostrander that little progress had been made and that the discipline was very poor, but that he had spoken to Mr. Heron as regards this. I must say that on the day I inspected the classroom, very little fault could be found with the discipline and Mr. Heron appeared to have the situation fairly well in hand. He is a well meaning young man, and if he had his normal training, I believe he would make an excellent teacher. However, the lack of this training is quite apparent in the manner in which he carries on the work.\n\nAs pointed out in previous reports, the room where the laundry work is carried on is very small and cramped. They have no dryer with which to dry the clothes, and the Principal informed me that to get the clothes dry, it was necessary to hang them in the dining room where the children and staff eat. On the days when this washing is hanging in the dining room, as it was on the day\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthe day of my inspection, one does not relish the meals, no matter how well provided, on account of the odor from these clothes mingled with that brought in on the boys' clothes from the barn, and also on the clothes of some of the male members of the staff who work outside and apparently are not particular about removing their overalls when coming to the dining room table. I pointed these things out to the Principal, and also to Mrs. Heron who is supposed to be the Matron of the school. They agreed with me that conditions were not what they should be, but until the new addition was built, felt that no improvement could be made. I did not agree with them in this respect, and pointed out that one of the rooms in the old part of the building could easily be fixed up and used as a drying room. Mrs. Heron agreed that this could be done without very much work to anyone, and was quite willing to make the change. Mr. Ross, the Principal, finally agreed to the arrangement.\n\nI found the dormitories well aired, clean, and the beds in good condition. I would, however, point out that the girls' dormitory is badly overcrowded. At the present time there are six more pupils than beds, which means that some of the single beds are used as doubles. I suggested to the Principal that more beds be put up, but he informed me that he had no more beds and that the dormitory would not accommodate six extra beds. In looking over the situation, I found that the dormitory would accommodate two extra beds and that if Mr. and Mrs. Ross gave up their room and moved over to the residence provided for them, there would be sufficient room to accommodate the other four beds and perhaps more. I understand that there are four new pupils ready to come into the school.\nthe school, so that ten beds are really needed. Mrs. Heron agreed with me that the room now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Ross would be suitable to be used as a small girls' dormitory, and as it is just opposite her own room could be quite well looked after.\n\nThe room now used as a root cellar opens off the dining room. This is very unsatisfactory and unhealthy as all the odors from spoiled vegetables escape into the dining room. On the day of my inspection, this root cellar was being cleaned out and the potatoes sorted over. Apparently, when they picked the potatoes, frozen ones were also gathered, with the result that now a great many of them are rotten, and the work of picking them over was not only unpleasant for the ones carrying out the task, but also to the entire school as this disagreeable odor not only entered the dining room but passed out through the halls and permeated the whole building. In fact, I would not care to use the potatoes which were picked out from the bad ones as they were all wet and smeared by the decayed potatoes. A root cellar could easily be built outside the school as the ground slopes readily towards the lake, and a cellar could be dug in the bank. It would, however, cost something to cement the walls and put a roof over it.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nThis school, as is known to the Department, is a frame building. In view of this fact, I went carefully into the question of fire protection, and was certainly surprised to find that no water is obtainable, in case of fire, except from the small taps which supply the wash basins in the various bathrooms. I do not\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nFire Protection (Cont'd.)\n\nconsider it would be a difficult matter to put a pipe from the boiler room up through the bathrooms, on each of the three floors, to which a fire hose could be attached. There is abundance of water by keeping the windmill pumping constantly, and the tank in the boiler room holds about 1,000 gals.\n\nIn the girls' dormitory there are two fire escapes, one on each side of the building. The exit from the dormitory on to the fire escape is by means of a window. On both these windows I found outside windows, and it would be necessary for the children to climb out over the window sill, which is perhaps 2 ft. off the floor. I think the one fire escape, properly fixed, on the side facing the classrooms, would be sufficient for this dormitory. It would allow the children to escape by this way if the fire were in the front of the building. Should it be in the rear of the building, the children could then escape by the front stairs. To make this fire escape convenient and satisfactory, the window sill should be cut out on a level with the floor and a door placed in the opening to open outwards on the fire balcony. The present balcony would need to be re-built as it is only about 2 ft. wide and this would not allow for the opening of the door. The pipe leading down from the balcony is too small being only 1\u00bd\" pipe, and it already shows signs of bending as a result of the weight of the larger girls. This pipe should be at least 2\". It would also be much easier for the children to slide down than the small pipe. The fire escape on the other side of the girls' dormitory might be left as it is at the present time, as it is also used by the boys who are on the floor above.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nFire Protection (Cont'd.)\n\nA door opens from their dormitory where again a light pipe of 1\u00bd\" leads down on to the flat roof of the old school, which they cross and then slide down the fire escape which leads out from the window of the girls' dormitory. This gives the boys an opportunity to get out at the back in case the fire is in the front part of the building. They have also a way of escape through a window on the front of the building where there is another 1\u00bd\" pipe which they can slide down on to the roof of the verandah across the front of the school. They must then go to one end of this verandah, climb over a 3 ft. railing, and slide down another 1\u00bd\" pipe to the ground. There is no platform on which to stand, either at the top where they step out of the window or at the side of the verandah after they have climbed the railing. I consider this arrangement very dangerous, especially for the small children, and at the present time a large percentage of the children are very small. This window should also be cut down on a level with the floor, and a proper door built to open outwards on to the fire escape balcony. The railing should also be cut on the roof of the verandah. At the present time, it seems as if we are placing obstacles in the way of these children, rather than assisting them to escape, in case of a fire. In all cases, I consider the 1\u00bd\" pipe too small, and feel that it should be replaced by a larger pipe.\n\nTwo new 5 gal. fire extinguishers have recently been supplied by the Department. They have a number of old fire extinguishers, all of which, I understand, have never been re-charged, and are now 10 or 12 years old. It is doubtful whether these old fire extinguishers would be\n\nof any value\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nFire Protection (Cont'd.)\n\nof any value should a fire occur, and I feel that at least another four of the 5 gal. fire extinguishers should be supplied.\n\nAfter the children had retired to bed on the night I inspected the school, we rang the fire bell. Through some misunderstanding with the officers in charge, the boys used the back exit, with the result that they were trying to come down the same fire escape as the one used by the girls. This, of course, complicated matters, and it was necessary to have the boys turn back and come down the front fire escape. This I considered a very serious mistake, and I pointed this out to the Principal. In case of fire drill or in case of a real fire there should be no misunderstanding between the officers and Principal and directions should be clearly given. However, even after making this mistake, the children were all out of the building within 12 minutes after the bell rang.\n\nI also noticed at the foot of the fire escape, where the girls come down, a number of articles to be used in connection with blacksmith work. This is a sheltered corner of the building and Mr. Ross informed me that the blacksmith work was carried on here. However, I pointed out to him that there should be no obstacles of any kind at the foot of this fire escape. This is certainly not a satisfactory place to carry on blacksmith work as it is also on the girls' side of the building.\n\nIn going over the building, I found that the floors in both the girls' and boys' playrooms were worn through in places, and in fact, the entire floors needed to be renewed. Both the doors leading from these playrooms have been continually repaired until now they are past...\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (Cont'd.)\n\nare past repairing and new doors are needed. The walls in the playrooms are plastered, with the result that considerable of the plaster is falling off. Plastered walls do not appear to be satisfactory for playrooms, and I would suggest that these walls be covered with V Joing or wallboard.\n\nI found the new barn in good condition and well filled with stock. The other outbuildings were in good repair.\n\nThere was no sickness in the school at the time of my visit, and the children all appeared healthy and were certainly well clothed. I cannot help but feel that these children receive good attention and plenty of well prepared food.\n\nAgain, I was rather disappointed with the staff which the Principal has employed to carry on the work at this school. The Farmer, known both by the children and the staff as Louis, is a Ruthenian. He is a good mechanic, and to the ordinary farmer would be a first class labourer, but I do not consider him a Farming Instructor capable of instructing Indian boys in the best methods of farming.\n\nRecently, the Principal secured from the Old Country a young Scotshman, about 20 years of age, to look after the stock, etc. I asked Mr. Ross if he considered this man suitable to instruct the boys in the care of stock, and he replied that in the Old Country this man was a miner, but he hoped to train him so that he would make a good stockman. It seems to me that what is needed at these schools is practical, experienced men who understand farming in this western country and also stock raising. Many of these Indian boys know more about this work.\nthis work than the men who are employed to instruct them.\n\nThe lady in charge of the laundry is the wife of Louis. She is a very nice woman, but is only now learning to speak English. I suppose it is quite possible to show girls how to do laundry work without telling them. However, I think it would be more satisfactory if the woman could speak English fluently so that the children might be instructed verbally, as well as being shown how to carry on the work.\n\nThe kitchen matron appears quite capable, and I believe serves the food in a better manner than any matron the Principal has yet been able to secure.\n\nThe work in the sewing room appeared to be carried on satisfactorily, although the sewing teacher apparently had very little time for instruction as she herself was busy mending and darned a great deal of the time, due to the fact that a number of the senior girls are kept in the classroom all day. However, I would say that these women are quite capable of carrying on the work over which they have charge.\n\nMrs. Heron, who is supposed to be acting as Matron, is a very capable woman, and I have no hesitation in saying that if she were given a free hand, as matron of the school, that the work would be carried on very satisfactorily.\n\nMr. Ross, the Principal, is, I believe, quite earnest in his endeavours to carry on the work successfully. He appeared to take a different attitude this time to suggestions made, and assured me that they would be carried out. I cannot help but feel that in the matter of hiring help, Mr. Ross is very often willing to try out inexperienced and unpractical men and women, if such\nlabour can be cheaply secured. My own feeling is that a poor officer in such an institution is really expensive at any price, and I believe Mr. Ross could carry on the work of this school with less officers if they were of a proper type and calibre.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMarch 2, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 304-11 of the 16th ultimo, with reference to Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools of the Crooked Lake Agency. I have written to the United Church authorities, asking them to take steps to provide a proper staff at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease make arrangements to install a stand pipe in the Round Lake School, for fire protection, and arrange for more satisfactory exits to the fire escapes, as recommended in your letter and in the inspector's report. Rev. Mr. Ross should see that there are more regular fire drills. Four 5 gallon fire extinguishers are being ordered by the Department.\n\nInstruct Mr. Ross that Mr. Hamilton's advice in connection with a dining room should be followed. The clothes should not be hung up in the dining room. You may purchase cement and heavy timbers for a root house at this school. Ask Mr. Ross to be responsible for the labour. This last mentioned improvement should be effected as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nYou may supply two doors leading from the playrooms, and, if you consider the walls in this part of the building require repainting, you might let me have an estimate of the cost. Instruct Mr. Ross that classroom exercises should not last until 5 o'clock in the evening. 1:30 to 4 o'clock is the recognized period, with a 15 minute recess.\n\nI am hopeful that, with a proper staff, Mr. Ross will be able to move into the MacLay residence, and this will permit of increased dormitory accommodation, which evidently is needed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

With regard to renewing these, I may say as they are in the old part of the building, I would not recommend that any expense be incurred in view of the contemplated reconstruction of this part of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nThe Principal of the Round Lake School has requested kalsomine for the halls, dormitories, office and staff bedrooms of the school. About 60 packages are required at a cost of 5s per package.\n\nThe floor in the front hall is in bad shape and hard to keep clean. It is suggested that if it is not the intention of the Department to repair this floor, a heavy linoleum should be put down over the whole floor, which would greatly improve the appearance of the front entrance. It will require about 200 square feet for this purpose.\n\nThe floor in the sewing-room is in very bad shape and the girls are continually getting splinters in their hands when scrubbing. As this is in the old part of the building I presume the Department would not be in favour of putting down a new floor, but something should be done and I would suggest that a cheap linoleum would overcome the difficulty for the time. There is about 500 square feet to cover.\n\nPaint is required for the wood-work of the play-rooms, halls and office. About 5 gals. will be sufficient.\n\nI beg to enquire whether this material should be paid for out of the school grant or by the Department. In any case, the repairs asked for are badly needed and should be done, and I would be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J.P.B. Ostrander.\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M.

Ostrander, Indian Agent at Broadview, submitting a request by the Principal of the Round Lake School to incur certain expenditures for repairs at that institution. The cost will be about $200.00 and I shall be glad if the Department will advise me whether this expenditure, or any of it, can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

Of course, no building activity will be undertaken this year.

I believe all the wholesale hardware companies handle them, but I have not obtained prices from them. I believe, however, that the price will be about $35.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that a fire started on Sunday last, in the floor of the staff bath-room at the Round Lake School, but by prompt work with the fire extinguishers, the fire was put out with very little damage being done.\n\nI investigated the matter yesterday, and there seems to be no doubt that the fire started by an overheated chimney. The chimney is in good shape and there is no hole in it from which flame could come. Where the floor boards touch the chimney they were all charred and axes had to be used to chop the floor away in order to stop the fire. If this fire had started at night, it is obvious that the result might have been much more serious. The day in question was very cold and the fire in the furnace had been kept going briskly all day. The fire was found about 4.00 o'clock in the afternoon, and apparently the chimney had been getting hotter from the time the first fire was put on in the morning. When I was investigating the matter yesterday, I found that the chimney was so hot that I could not keep my hand on it for any length of time and Mr. Ross informs me that, when the fire started the chimney was much hotter than it was yesterday.\n\nThe chimney in question is the ordinary brick chimney and I do not suppose the furnace carried any more heat than any other furnace in similar circumstances, therefore it would seem that the ordinary single ply brick chimney is not safe with this type of furnace unless the woodwork close to it is protected in some manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter I have today received from the Indian Agent at Roadview, with reference to a fire in the Round Lake School. You will note how it was started and, of course, when the building was erected no woodwork should have been allowed to touch any part of the chimney. I would ask you to sanction the necessary expenditure in having the flooring repaired in such a manner as to obviate the possibility of recurrence of fire from an overheated chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 27, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A U. of the 21st instant, with enclosure, relative to an outbreak of fire at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.

R.J. Ross, Prin. Round Lake School, Stockholm, Sask., for pump and fittings, and Battery, purchased for installation at the school.\n\nThe school authorities had been using a small pressure pump which was obsolete and for which it was impossible to get repairs. A pump of large capacity was purchased to take care of the water needed in case of fire.\n\nEarly in the winter it was found that the batteries at the school could not be charged. The Principal consulted an electrician who advised getting new batteries.\n\nYou will note that in regard to Voucher #1653 the freight charges were paid twice by Mr. Ross, in error. This was pointed out to Mr. Ross when the accounts were sent to this office and a refund of $3.35 was made by the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co Ltd., from whom the pump etc were ordered. The cheque is made out in favor of the Department of Indian Affairs, and to simplify matters the Principal has endorsed the cheque and same is attached to the original Voucher.\n\nI understand the Principal has already written the Department with regard to these accounts and I would recommend that these be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While it is true that the Department would be glad to meet expenses for the pump and fittings and for the electric battery, whenever funds are available, it is customary for principals to make a request to the Indian Agent and for him to correspond with the Department in the matter. If the Department's approval for the expenditure is granted, the accounts should not be paid by the Principal but should be certified to as correct and forwarded to the Department for payment. Please ask Rev.

In this connection it is noted that 30 packages of kalsomine and 5 gallons of paint will be required.

If the Department will sanction the purchase, I will place the order in Regina as what is required is not procurable locally.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nMr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Indian Agent at Broadview, Sask., reports that the 5 h.p. Toronto engine which was installed at the Round Lake Residential School about six years ago for pumping water at the lake has been giving some trouble and requires complete overhauling. The estimated cost of this by the local garage repair man will be about forty dollars. The Agent suggests that there is some doubt whether it would be advisable to spend this amount on an old engine as a smaller engine would be suitable for the purpose and therefore a new one might be purchased.\n\nI cannot agree that the purchase of a new engine is necessary and am of the opinion that the school authorities should bear the cost of the necessary overhauling of the old one. I should be glad if the Department would advise me what it desires should be done under the circumstances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A U. of the 8th instant, and in reply, I have to authorize an expenditure of $40, repairing a gas engine at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.

Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nGeneral Steel Wares, Limited,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 31, 1929.\nI beg to inform you that the 6 h.p. gasoline engine that was installed at the Round Lake Indian Residential School in 1924 is reported to be in bad shape, in fact beyond repair. The jacket was cracked, and the mechanic who went down there to overhaul the engine states that the block is so badly worn it would be a waste of money to repair the engine without getting a new block.\n\nThe reason advanced for the short life of this engine is that it was always overworked. The Agent states he visited the school for the purpose of seeing for himself if it could not be used for a time. While he was there it was started and ran for a time, when a bolt came out of a connecting-rod bearing, with the result that the piston was broken and the connecting-rod bent.\n\nA new engine will have to be supplied, and I may say there is no doubt in my mind that this machinery has been in incompetent hands, and, as has been the case at many other places, the Department is called upon to pay for this inefficiency. The engine that is required will cost $219.20 and I should be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

I would point out that it was only in September, last, that an account to the amount of $49.95 was paid for repairs to the old engine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Stanley Brock Limited, Winnipeg, in connection with a letter I wrote this firm making enquiry as to the probable cost and necessary work required to repair the large power washer at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis machine will require repairing as soon as possible as some of the wood has become so badly rotted that the machine may break down at any time. My object in writing this firm was to obtain an estimate of the probable cost of the repair before asking authority for the expenditure, but apparently they are unable to give this information from Winnipeg. I would therefore request authority for the expenditure and I shall see that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nI might mention that, from my own observation, I would say that the cost of the labour repairing this will be considerably more than the cost of the material and there may be difficulty getting a man to do the work. I would suggest that the cost of the material be met by the Department and the school authorities should be able to arrange for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nInspector Hamilton's Report on the Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, inspected while at the Agency between February 17th and 28th, 1930.\n\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nThe classroom in charge of Mrs. Ross has the senior grades, which are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| III   | 10     |\n| IV    | 12     |\n| V     | 2      |\n| VI    | 4      |\n| VII   | 5      |\n| Total | 33     |\n\nThe children were clean and neatly dressed, and I found the classroom to be well ventilated. The children are making progress in their various grades, and I believe Mrs. Ross to be a capable teacher. The discipline is excellent.\n\nThe junior room is now in charge of Miss Strongrem, who, I understand, is a qualified teacher with some years of experience. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| A     | 9      |\n| B     | 11     |\n| I     | 12     |\n| II    | 16     |\n| Total | 48     |\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe children of this room have been unfortunate during the past few years in having several changes in teachers, consequently progress has been slow.\n\nPrevious to Miss Stromgrem, Miss Afflick was in charge for a couple of months and made excellent progress, so the children got away to a good start. I am pleased to say Miss Stromgrem, who has taken over the work from which Miss Afflick was discharged, is doing splendid work, and I would expect the junior grades to show marked advancement under her supervision. The children were clean and neatly dressed.\n\nThe classrooms need to be kalsomined and painted. At present the walls are very dark and the room has a gloomy appearance. The floors have never been oiled and when swept the dust is very bad. The outside of this building needs to be re-painted.\n\nThe girl's dormitory was bright, clean and well aired. I would again point out that it is overcrowded, and I found that in several cases two girls were obliged to sleep in a single bed. The dormitory will not accommodate any further space for beds.\n\nThe boys' dormitory was also well aired, clean and all beds nicely made.\n\nThe work in the sewing room, laundry and kitchen is all carried on under supervision, and the work is well done.\n\nFire drill is observed, and the children are familiar with their duties in respect to it. A small fire occurred in the girls' washroom a few days ago, but was located in time. I found that the fire extinguisher used was still unfilled and drew the Principal's attention to it.\nto it. I would again mention that I found no water pressure throughout the building, but Mr. Ross explained that the boy who attended to the matter was away hauling hay. It is strange that my visits should happen on days when the pressure is off. I am inclined to believe it is off most of the time and this is a serious matter. The Reverend Principal purchased a 3 H.P. engine after the other one became useless, but I doubt if it is large enough. The old engine was a 5 H.P. one, and I continually had complaints that it was too small. Again I would point out the weak condition of the belts used. These are worn out and should be replaced as they are bound to give way just at a time when most needed.\n\nThe dining room is again in use as a drying room. Lines are fastened to the ceiling and the clothes hung above the children's tables. The place had the smell of a laundry rather than a dining room.\n\nThe floor in the boys' and girls' playroom is badly worn and in places is almost through. I doubt if this floor can be made to last for another year.\n\nThe Mackay house is still empty and Mr. & Mrs. Ross reside in the school. The office used as their apartment was in a more tidy condition than when I last inspected the place.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings I found to be clean and tidy.\n\nThe new Farming Instructor, Mr. A. Young, is a man 50 yrs. of age, and I believe is a good worker and understands farming. He is a man who will be respected and should have no difficulty in handling the boys.\n\nThe laundry\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThe laundry matron, Miss North, is a good officer and her work is satisfactory.\n\nThe sewing matron is Mrs. Friedlien, but I understand her appointment is only temporary as she lives near the school and must return home before spring opens up.\n\nThe kitchen matron, Miss H. Reider, was to arrive March 1st from Winnipeg. I have known Miss Reider for some years, and as she has had previous experience in this line of work, I would expect her to do good work.\n\nMrs. A. Young, the Farming Instructor's wife, is acting matron. She is perhaps physically fit to do the work, but she certainly does not assert herself as matron of an institution.\n\nIn closing, I wish to point out the marked improvement in the physical condition of the children. I was delighted to see the boys and girls in such splendid health, and I have no doubt they receive sufficient wholesome food. The meals served while I was at the school were nicely prepared and there appeared ample for all.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., March 11th, 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Hamilton last month.\n\nThere has no doubt been a great improvement at the Round Lake School since the last inspection, which is pleasing. With reference to the Inspector's remarks about the matter of interior decorating for the classrooms, there is an amount of $700.00 in the Estimates to cover this and I think the work should be done during the summer vacation. With regard to the overcrowding in the girls' dormitory, this should be attended to. It seems to me that the surplus of Protestant children on this reserve should be sent on to the Brandon School. It is certainly a mistake to have two children sleeping in a single bed. You will note what the Inspector says regarding the lack of water pressure throughout the building. It seems to me the time has arrived when the Department should spend some money for the purpose of putting a proper water system in this school.\n\nThe work at the Cowessess School appears to be satisfactory. The fire protection system at this school is in good shape, the Department having spent considerable money this year putting everything around the institution in first-class order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\nOttawa, March 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 304-11 of the 11th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Funds for the interior decorating, at an estimated cost of $700, will be available during the summer, and you may make the arrangements. If this amount is not all required, you will please effect a saving. There has been some correspondence also regarding repairs for the large washer in the laundry. You might let me have your recommendation in this connection. There are no funds specially provided for repairs to the water supply system. You might let the Department have a report and estimate of the cost, at your convenience.\n\nWhen the Brandon School is ready for occupation, the overcrowded conditions at Round lake will be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Head, Sask.,\nAugust 14th, 1930.\n\nMr. W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI phoned you this morning saying that I would be in Regina today, but I was called out on other business and was unable to get there so I am going to send you a list of material for the Broadview Reserve school which I was out to see on Tuesday. The fault which I find in the pressure tank is that it is not pumping any air and is using just a straight water pressure which I will tend to when I go down. Looking over the rest of the plumbing which they showed me I find that the following material is required:\n\n1 cistern pump (pump must be fitted for 1\u00bd\" pipe as this is what the old pump is which is broke)\nThere is 6 lavatories in the school and there is only one of them working. They require:\n5 ball valves complete\n6 rubber tank balls\n6 spud rubber washers\n12 - 2\" rubber fittings washers.\n2 closet seats (these seats are gone all together)\n1 - 1\u00bd\" nickel plated sink bib\n2 pair bath taps\n2 - 1\u00bc\" unions\n\nThe asbestos covering on the boiler which was tore off some time ago was never put on again and it will take 3 sacks of asbestos plaster. The boiler has set fire to the ceiling between the floors which might be caused from a loose brick in the chimney. I will examine the chimney thoroughly when I am their.\n\nOn the kitchen range which they told me about just as I was coming away so I went and had a look at it. I took the name and number of the stove on a separate piece of paper and lost it. I remember the number of the stove was 49-52. It is a McClary Range which has two fire boxes. If they can not make sure of the stove by the number I will get it for them.\n\nThe stove requires:\n\n1 only water front\n1 set of grates\n1 back lining\n1 front and back lining for same stove.\nWhile I was out at the school there was a suggestion made that the flush tanks on the lavatories should be fitted with a clasp and lock to prevent the children from getting in to them, which I don't think would be of any use because they might break the covers if this was done. They asked me if I would mention this to you. So you can just suit yourself about the matter.\n\nI was talking to the man down there and he said that he would help me with the work and it will take from three to four days for one man.\n\nHoping that this will prove to your entire satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. Fred Fox.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to Department No. 108-1-5, dated the 17th March last, I enclose copy of a letter received from Mr. Fred Fox, of Indian Head, indicating the nature of the repairs required to the water supply system at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. Mr. Fox is a thoroughly reliable man and can be depended upon to do the work satisfactorily. I have not been given an estimate of the cost, but if the department will sanction the work it will be done with the least possible expenditure. Please advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 20, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A of the 16th instant, relative to the repairs required to the water supply system at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, and enclosing copy of a communication which you received as to the material and work required.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange to have the repairs required to the water supply system carried out, keeping all expense as low as possible. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nW. M.

INDIAN AGENT OSTRANDER,\nFOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1930, ON THE ROUND\nLAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 108-1-7.\n\nWaterworks are now in good repair but I noted there was only 10 lbs. of water pressure which is not sufficient to raise water to the second floor in case of fire.\n\nThere is an old outside toilet in the girls' playground and it is always filthy and in a bad state of repair. Flies, no doubt, go direct from this to the kitchen. The toilets in the main building are now in repair and this should be disposed of and not used any more.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF W. M. GRAHAM, INDIAN COMMISSIONER,\nREGINA, DATED 13th OCTOBER, 1930, FORWARDING ABOVE REPORT.\n\nOriginal on File 108-1-7.\n\nIt is rarely the case that the reports on the Round Lake School are free from criticism.\n\nIn regard to the matter of the water pressure, I am having this investigated. In regard to the Agent's final paragraph under the head of \"Suggestions\", I am directing him to immediately instruct the Principal to have the girls' outside toilet definitely closed and removed and the environment cleansed.\nSir:-\n\nA few days ago I received a letter from the Agent in charge at Broadview, stating that the front sill of the Principal's residence at the Round Lake School had rotted away. He intimated that it would not be possible to determine what the cost of remedying this condition would be until the actual repair work was set in motion. I wrote him in reply, asking whether the Principal was occupying the residence, and have received an answer to say that he is, but, instead of expending money on repairing the foundation, makes the extravagant request to have the building moved one hundred feet nearer the main building. This, in my opinion, is altogether an unnecessary expenditure. It would make no material difference in case of fire, the possibility of which Mr. Ross is continually harping on as his reason for wishing to spend the night in the main building. As the Agent points out, this would entail the expenditure of a great deal more money than is desirable or necessary. In the first place a new foundation would have to be built at a cost of about $300.00; the moving of it based on the figures of a man who was questioned would be $400.00; and, owing to the condition of the plaster, it would probably be ruined during the process of moving and entail a further expenditure of $200.00 to replace it. Thus, this thoughtless whim of the Principal would involve a sum of about $900.00, and I do not purpose to recommend the suggested moving of the building.\n\nBetween $100.00 and $200.00 might have to be expended in repairs to the sill, and, if the Department will authorize a more closer investigation to determine what may be necessary and the expenditure of the amount mentioned, I will have the work proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW.

November 22nd, 1930.\n\nInspector Murison's Report on Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the Round Lake Indian Residential School in the Crooked Lake Agency, which I inspected on November 7th. This school is under the auspices of the United Church, with the Rev. R. J. Ross as Principal, N. Sinclair, Engineer; H. Gingrich, Farmer; A. Young, Gardener & Fireman; Mrs. Young, Matron; Miss Eva Scoggan, Cook; Miss Jessie Cameron, Seamstress; Miss Mabel McLeod, Laundress; Mrs. Ross, Senior Teacher; Miss Gertie Stromgren, Junior Teacher.\n\nThe school building was found clean throughout the interior, and the outside premises tidier than I have ever found them. This school building has been described so often that the Department are quite familiar with it. The new part of the building was erected some eleven or twelve years ago, a portion of the old school being retained. This older portion is of very little use except for storage purposes, being very hard to heat during the winter months. I consider it a menace to the safety of the school. It looks to me like a regular fire trap. I am of the opinion that it should be torn down and replaced. The newer portion of the school, as you know, was badly planned in the first place, and although it was remodeled and greatly improved, it compares badly with other Indian residential schools.\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nschools with regard to accommodation, comfort and safety from fire.\n\nThe pole fire escapes have been improved by providing larger poles. There is easy access to these escapes from the dormitories, but I suggested to the Principal that a measure of safety might be added by providing a small platform outside the exit on the top floor. Hose pipes connected to the water system are provided on each floor, as well as fire extinguishers. The pupils, I am informed, are given regular weekly fire drill. Water storage is provided by two pressure tanks, one of 1,000 gal., and the other 500 gal. capacity. The water supply is obtained from the lake, and a windmill, as well as a gasoline engine, is provided to operate the pump. The water is pumped into a cistern situated in the basement of the school and from there to the pressure tanks by a separate motor. This plant was in good condition and working satisfactorily at the time of my visit.\n\nThe school is lighted by electricity, and I believe Mr. Sinclair, the engineer, is a good man for the job.\n\nThe exterior of the building has not been re-painted for some time and has a rather dingy looking appearance.\n\nI noted that the floor in the girls' bathroom is broken and should be repaired. The toilets in this bathroom are also in a broken condition and require to be repaired.\n\nThe dormitories\nThe dormitories I found clean and well aired. The boys' dormitory is on the top floor. It contains 31 beds; there are 27 boys in residence, so this dormitory provides ample space for them. The girls' dormitory is on the second floor; there are 46 girls enrolled, and only 41 beds provided. This means that 6 of the smaller girls have to double up with others, which is not a desirable condition. The dormitory has an over-crowded appearance. I examined the mattresses on the beds, and find that at least half of them are in bad shape and should be renewed. These mattresses have been in use for several years.\n\nI noted that some improvements had been made to the laundry since my last visit, but this room is rather small for its purpose. Improvements have been made in recent years to the outbuildings; a good barn, implement shed, as well as an ice house, have been provided. The hen house is very small and is intended to provide accommodation for 60 hens. This is not sufficient for the number of poultry which should be kept at an institution of this kind. The old stone stable is now used as a hog house, and the old horse stable is used for housing loose stock. The superstructure of this old building is in poor condition, and is far from being an ornament to any institution of this kind. The stone work is not in good shape, and I think the whole building would be better torn down and a less unsightly building provided.\n\nThe classroom accommodation is provided in a separate building. This building provides two large.\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nlarge, well aired classrooms, which are well suited for their purpose. These rooms were being re-decorated at the time of my visit. I visited both these classrooms, and both Mrs. Ross and Miss Strongren impressed me as being capable teachers.\n\nA separate residence is provided for the Principal, and is now being occupied by him and his wife. This building is in good condition, with the exception of about 12 ft. of the foundation under the west wall. The sill has rotted, with the result that the wall has sunk some. I am of the opinion that this condition has been caused through faulty workmanship in connection with the window at that end of the building. It is evident that water has leaked from this window down the inside wall, thus rotting the foundation sill. When repairing the foundation, I am of the opinion that it will be necessary to have this window properly re-set. With the exception of this portion, the sills under the rest of the house are in a perfectly sound condition.\n\nFARM\n\nThe farm produced this year 1,500 bus. of wheat. In addition, they had 45 acres of barley and 30 acres of oats, which was a fair crop. This grain was not threshed, but is being chopped in the sheaf and used for feed for the stock. This work is done by a large Letz grinder. This is the first occasion I have seen this class of grinder in operation, and it does very satisfactory work. The straw is chopped and the grain in the heads is ground and all well mixed and blown into the\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\ninto the hay loft. All hay fed to the stock is also cut with this machine, and there is no doubt but that its use conserves feed and the stock obtain more benefit from feed treated in this way.\n\nThe herd now comprises 30 pure bred Holsteins of good quality. These consist of 13 cows, 3 heifers, 1 bull, and 13 calves. They have, in addition, 13 head of grade cattle. There were 12 cows being milked at the time of my visit. These provide ample milk for their requirements. They have 9 hogs and 11 horses. Their garden produced sufficient roots and vegetables for the requirements of the school.\n\nThis school appears to find favour with the Indians, and I am informed that applications for admission have to be refused owing to lack of accommodation. There are 73 enrolled at the present time, and the Principal informs me that he would have no difficulty in securing 120 pupils if the necessary accommodation was provided for that number.\n\nI was present at the mid-day meal, and it was noted that the meal supplied to the children was ample and comprised wholesome food. The children presented a healthy appearance, and I am informed that they have had very little sickness in the school.\n\nIn concluding this report, I may say that I found conditions at this school more satisfactory, in a general way, than I found them on any former occasion.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Boarding Schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nThe Round Lake School was visited by Mr. Murison on the 7th instant. He draws attention to the type of building at that point, which he says has been described to the Department on previous occasions, which is true. He states that it is a regular firetrap. The whole situation here is not good. I have had the waterworks put in shape, and the interior of the school painted, as well as the exterior of the separate classroom. The exterior of the main building has not been painted.\n\nThe Agent has been authorized to make the necessary repairs to the foundation under the west wall of the Principal's residence.\n\nThere seems to be a satisfactory herd of cattle at this school. Mr. Ross does take an interest in stock.\n\nThe Cowessess School was also inspected. The children are reported to be in good shape, and I would gather from the Inspector's remarks that they are getting a good training.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt.

The cost would be about $150.00. In connection with the pigsty, the suggestion is that it be lined with shiplap, and ceiled with the same material and that two roof ventilators be put in. It is just a matter of the thing not having been completed properly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M.

There were 74 pupils in residence out of an enrolment of 76. I was pleased with the appearance of the children; they are bright and healthy looking. I was present when they were having their mid-day meal, which comprised ample and wholesome food, including all the milk they cared to drink. I remember stating in a report on this school some years ago that the children were shy, listless, and backward in appearance, and not answering when spoken to. This condition no longer exists; the children appear natural and bright in their attitude towards visitors. The Principal's wife, Mrs. Ross, who is also the senior teacher, appears to have a great deal of natural ability for training children and forming their character. As time has gone on, I note that the general conditions at this school show improvement.\n\nThe girls receive instruction in sewing, mending, cooking, milking cows, and general domestic work. The boys assist in the care of the stock and the general farm work, under the supervision of a Farming Instructor.\n\nA feature\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (UNITED CHURCH) CONT'D.\n\nA feature at this school is the care of the stock. All feed, including hay and sheaves, is passed through a chopper, and it is evident, from the appearance of the stock, that they derive more benefit from chopped feed than from the coarse hay and sheaves. Twenty-three steers are being grain fed for the market, and are in fine condition. This is an object lesson for the boys, and the Indians on the adjacent reserves have taken a great deal of interest in watching this method of preparing the cattle for the market, which is new to them. Several mentioned the matter to me when I was visiting at the homes.\n\nI found the school building clean and tidy throughout. The engineer, Mr. Sinclair, keeps the equipment in good working order.\n\nWith reference to the fire escapes, there are two exits from the boys' dormitory, one at the north and one at the south end of the main building; the exit at the south end is a pole escape, a short drop to the flat roof of the verandah, and a second pole escape situated at the east end of the verandah to the ground with a 16 ft. drop. At the west end of the building there is a pole escape with a short drop from the dormitory to a platform between the old and new portions of the building; a second pole escape, about 16 ft. in length, takes them to the ground. I am of the opinion that, as these escapes are easy of access, they will meet the situation.\n\nThe girls' dormitory is provided with two fire escapes, one at the north east corner of their dormitory, with access to it through a window; there is a 16 ft. drop.\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (UNITED CHURCH) CONT'D.\n\na 16 ft. drop to the ground and a good pole escape. A second fire escape, with access from a window at the west side, with a 16 ft. drop to the ground, provides an exit at that side of the building. The pole on this escape is a 1\u00bd\" pipe, which is rather small; a 2\" pipe would be more satisfactory. The Agent found fault with the position of these escapes, his view being that two of the poles are situated at the east side of the building, and as the prevailing winds are from the north west, he thought that should a fire occur with the wind in that direction, the two east escapes might be cut off. It would be an easy matter to move the pole from the east side of the verandah, at the front of the building, to the west side. I cannot see that it is necessary to add any more poles than what we have at the present time, other than replacing the west pole escape from the girls' dormitory with a larger size pipe.\n\nI reported quite fully on this school at the end of last November, and may say that conditions have not changed to any extent since that time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., April 4, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report of an inspection made at the two boarding schools in the Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nRegarding the Round Lake School, it is pleasing to note that there has been a decided change at this institution. The children are apparently getting a first-class training in the care of stock and general work. I am glad to note this because there was a time when things were not in good shape at this school. As regards the fire escapes, if the Department consider it necessary to move the East escapes the cost would be about $175.00; the question is, is it necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nBrosview, Sask.,\n7th October, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe two farm boilers at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, used for boiling water for washing clothes, have both commenced leaking and should be replaced. They are burned so thin that they cannot be repaired to last for any length of time. The cost of two new ones will be about $10.00 each.\n\nI beg to request permission for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 13, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, reporting on the condition of the two boilers used for boiling water for washing clothes at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that these boilers are beyond repair and that two new ones are required. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of two new boilers at a cost not exceeding approximately $10 each. You should see that the new boilers obtained are of the size and type required.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nBroadview, Sask.,\nOct 21st, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to enclosed Voucher #723 in favor of The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, for repairs to Generator, I beg to state that the Principal of the Round Lake Indian School forwarded this account through the mail, together with a letter in which he states \"Some time ago our generator refused to function and we sent it in to the company in Winnipeg.\"\n\nI am forwarding the account herewith for consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B. Osstrandner,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, October 28, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a voucher to the amount of $32.73 covering the cost of repairs to generator incurred by the Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as the Principal received no authority to incur this expenditure and as our funds are extremely limited, he should arrange to pay the account from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school. Please instruct the Principal that before undertaking any repairs, the cost of which the Department will be called upon to provide, he should first forward a report to the Department, through your office, stating in detail the nature of the repairs required and the cost of same. A report as to the necessity for the expenditure, together with your recommendation as to whether the Department should provide the funds required for the purpose or not, should accompany the Principal's request. The account which you submitted is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are six 5 gallon pump tank type of fire extinguishers at the Round Lake Residential School which have been in use for four years and I found yesterday that three of these have rusted until they are leaking and useless; the other three will also soon be useless for the same reason. These should be immediately replaced, but I have been wondering if there is some other similar type of fire extinguisher which will not rust and become useless after a time. I consider these are very good extinguishers but they would be better if made of some material which would not rust.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostender,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 5, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will supply for the use of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Stockholm, Sask., the following fire equipment:\n\n6 - 1/2 gallon Thermose fire extinguishers, complete with non-freeze charge.\n\nThese extinguishers should be shipped addressed to Rev. R. J. Ross, Principal, Round Lake Indian Residential School, Stockholm, Sask.\n\nThe above should be supplied at the lowest price charged this Department, and your account, in triplicate, should be forwarded to Mr. J. P. B. Ostrander, Indian Agent, Broadview, Sask. This account should cover the cost of the extinguishers F.O.B. Stockholm, Sask. We are informing Mr. Ostrander of the order placed with you, and he is being requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify the account and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nIn connection with the fire equipment at this school, I wish to inform you that 6 - 5 gallon pump tank extinguishers were ordered from your firm four years ago, and our Agent states it was found, upon a recent examination, that three of these have rusted until they are leaking and useless and the other three will also soon be useless for the same reason. We are not aware whether these extinguishers have received proper care from the staff, although definite instructions are issued from time to time regarding the keeping of the extinguishers in good condition. It is considered that the life of an extinguisher of the type mentioned should exceed four years, and I would like to have your opinion relative to the length of time the 5 gallon pump tank type would be serviceable, with proper care.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.

(RG 10, Volume 6332, file 661-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, informing the Department that the 6 - 5 gallon pump tank fire extinguishers which were supplied some four years ago for the use of the Round Lake Indian Residential School have rusted and, at present, 3 are useless and the other 3 will soon be in the same condition. The Department cannot understand, if proper care was taken, why these extinguishers should be in their present condition. You might state if the school authorities ever overhauled these extinguishers and had them recharged. You should ascertain the facts from the Principal and report to the Department regarding the matter.\n\nAs it is necessary that there be a supply of serviceable extinguishers on hand, the Department is today placing an order with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd., Toronto, to ship, addressed to the Principal, 6 - 1\u00bd gallon Thermene extinguishers, complete with non-freeze charges. The above Company have been requested to forward their account, in triplicate, to you covering the cost F.O.B. Stockholm, Sask. When these extinguishers are received, the Principal should accept delivery and see that they are distributed at strategic points throughout the school. You should certify the account and forward same, in duplicate, to the Department, retaining one copy on file in your office.\n\nThe Thermene extinguishers are of the non-freeze type. They can be used for wood, textile and rubbish fires, and where oils, grease and inflammable liquids are concerned. Please advise the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Indian Agent at Broadview, advising me that the well at the Round Lake Residential School now fails to supply water for requirements. It was sunk on the shore of the lake and the water level being very low, there is consequently no seepage into the well notwithstanding that recently it was dug a foot deeper and the pump line lowered about nine inches. Quick sand has filled the bottom of the well and as this is drawn into the cylinder of the pump it wears out the pump leather. Some steps must be taken to secure an adequate water supply, as at present there is not sufficient in the storage tank for fire protection. The Agent on a former occasion drew attention to a spring in the hill on the opposite side of the lake, and now draws attention to it again as a surer source of supply, pointing out also that it is situated high enough up the hill to enable the water to be piped to the school by gravity. This would be an expensive undertaking as it is three quarters of a mile distant. If this supply were tapped, it would be necessary to build a reservoir at the spring and cover it tightly to keep out contamination. In his earlier letter, the Agent suggests that the cost would be probably $2,500.00. I do not know whether this is a careful estimate, but the suggestion should be given consideration, as many wells have been sunk in the vicinity of the school without securing a permanent supply, and in the long run the expenditure of this sum might prove less costly.\n\nI shall be glad to have the views of the Department on the subject and instructions to take the necessary steps to furnish an adequate water supply for this school. Prompt action should be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 7, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11 A U of the 29th ultimo, with reference to failure of the present water supply at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I regret there are no funds for expensive improvements, and I wish to suggest that the school management be requested to continue whatever temporary arrangements they have made for a week or two. At some schools, where a similar situation has arisen, the difficulty has already been removed by the fall rains. Do you think there is a good prospect of such relief in the case of the Round Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

The above company write as follows:\n\n\"We note with interest your remarks regarding the condition of the 5 gallon pump tanks, which, you state, have been in service for a period of approximately four years.

In this connection I have to say that we are requesting our local Indian Agent, Mr. J. P. B.

I may say that there is no possibility of the volume of the water in the lake being increased this fall by rains. The possibility of rain fall now is remote. It would appear that a nearby well is being sunk and it is hoped that a spring has been struck. If this is so, this source of supply may be developed.

This has been a severe drain on the funds, of course, and I have no doubt that the Reverend Principal is having some difficulty.\n\nThe lighting plant had suddenly ceased to function and it was necessary to take immediate action and this circumstance partly accounts for the fact that the expenditure was incurred without Departmental sanction. There is no doubt that the expenditure was necessary, but the Reverend Principal is aware that the Department frowns upon acts of this kind. He has asked, however, that the unusual circumstances be given consideration in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, he has not done so, and I have not yet returned the remaining five.\n\nI might also mention that, at the time I first wrote the Department in connection with these, three of them were out of order and I thought it probable that the other three would soon be out of order, also. They are still in good order, however, and I think it a rather useless expense to return them when they will give good service at the school. Although we have recently received six new ones there are many places where it would be advisable to place the three extra ones as this school has many dangerous corners.\n\nOf the two which are useless and available for return to the company, one is rusted and leaking slightly at the bottom, the other has gone around the gump, at the top, and neither is in nearly as bad shape as the one which is missing. However I am writing the Reverend Principal today telling him to pack and ship the two useless extinguishers, shipping charges collect, to the company at Toronto.

These windings became entangled with the field coils, tearing them, and it was necessary for the mechanic to rewind these four field coils, as well as the Armature windings.\n\nReceipt from the Fairbanks-Morse Co.

Delco-Light Standard Battery will cost the Department $160.82, including freight to Stockholm. This is a discount of 20% on factory list.\n\nI would recommend that I be instructed to make the purchase from the Delco light people as they have supplied us with many batteries and are on the preferred list.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 6, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 304-11A U of the 2nd instant, informing the Department that the batteries in use with the lighting plant at the Round Lake Indian Residential School are now worn out and will have to be replaced.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may obtain new batteries of the type as mentioned in your letter from the Delco Light Company, Regina, at the cost stated by you, and have same forwarded to the school. After the batteries have been supplied, please forward an account, in duplicate, certified in the usual manner, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools of the Crooked Lake Agency, inspected between January 11th and 26th, 1932.\n\nROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\n\nThe Senior room is in charge of Mrs. Ross, and the grade range from 4 to 8. The roll calls for 35, and the register shows good attendance.\n\nThe children are bright, responsive and appear well along in their respective grades. They were well dressed and neat in personal appearance.\n\nMiss Stromgren is in charge of the junior room with 34 enrolled. The grades range from 1 to 3, and I found the children bright and attentive. Miss Stromgren is a qualified teacher, and her manner and personality quickly win the confidence of the little ones. The classroom was well aired, tidy and clean.\n\nThe girls' dormitory is bright and the windows are so arranged that plenty of fresh air is at all times available. The beds were all neatly made, and the bedding clean. The girls are provided with night gowns. This dormitory, as pointed out in a previous report, is overcrowded.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA \u2014 Sask.\ncrowded, and in five beds two sleep in a bed. The beds are all single and consequently this arrangement is very unsatisfactory. At present there are 46 girls housed in the dormitory.\n\nThe boys sleep on the top floor, and as there are only 30 in attendance they have plenty of room. The beds were neatly made and the bedding clean.\n\nBoth dormitories I found to be tidy and exceedingly clean. No doors leading to the fire escapes are locked.\n\nThe kitchen is now in charge of Miss North who is rendering excellent service. The meals are well cooked, tasty and nicely served. Miss North has a good manner with the girls, and her department, although one of the hardest, is well managed.\n\nThe meals served are as follows:\n\n**Breakfast** - Porridge every day except Sunday.\n\n**Sunday** - Corn-flakes or puffed rice; brown and white bread, butter and milk.\n\n**Dinner** - Potatoes, meat or fish, bread, desert varies - puddings, stewed fruits, Sunday - Pie or tart; milk always.\n\n**Supper** - varies - Baked beans, fried or baked potatoes, macaroni and tomatoes or cheese. Soup is sometimes served; also cold meats and eggs. Stewed fruit is served. Cake four times a week, raisin buns twice, and cookies once. Jelly is served on Sunday. Bread & butter and milk always.\n\nThe girls are taught bread making; also butter making.\n\nMiss McLeod is matron in charge of the laundry. At the time of my visit she was on leave due to sickness. The laundry is small, badly cramped and is poorly ventilated. In cold weather the drying of the clothes is a big problem as no drying room is provided, which necessitates hanging the clothes in the...\nclothes in the children's dining room, and in a vacant room in the old building.\n\nThe sewing room is supervised by Miss Donnelly, and is in the old building. The place is cold and drafty, necessitating a box stove to be used in order to keep it fit to work in. The old building is in poor shape and the plaster is ready to fall from the ceiling in several places. An attempt to take any of it down would perhaps result in most of the ceiling plaster falling, so that up to the present nothing has been done. This old wing is past repairing and as it now exists is a real fire trap.\n\nThe playrooms were clean and tidy, but the floors are practically worn through and very rough. New floors are needed.\n\nThe building throughout was in the best condition I have been privileged to see it, and I believe this is largely due to the close supervision of the matron, Mrs. Therien. She has only been at the school a few months, but appears to have the work well in hand and she is respected both by the staff and children.\n\nThe plumbing throughout the school was in working order and the boiler room clean. Mr. Sinclair, who is in charge of this work appears to be a fair mechanic and I believe is rendering good service.\n\nFire drill is observed regularly and the children get out in less than two minutes. Extinguishers are placed in prominent places throughout the building and the fire hose are in good repair. The fire escape on the front of the boys' dormitory leads out over a sloping ledge of the roof, which in a rush might easily be the cause of an accident. A small platform on which the boys could step out would improve conditions, especially in case of the small children.\n\nThe water supply\nThe water supply would be of little help should a fire occur. At present by careful management a fair pressure is maintained, but I understand that before the Christmas holidays even this could not be accomplished. Should the lake return to its normal level the difficulty would be overcome, but if the dry seasons continue it might be necessary to extend the intake further into the lake.\n\nThese children all go home for Christmas holidays and I found that several were late returning; some a day, others three or four days. This holiday breaks in on the year's work, entails a thorough cleaning of the children on their return and often is the cause of sickness. The Principal stated he would willingly give Christmas dinner to all the parents rather than dismiss the children. A number of the parents at the Assiniboine Agency stated they did not wish the children to come home, but when some came it was hard to refuse the others. Since the holidays two or three run-aways have occurred, the only apparent cause being that the children were homesick after the holiday.\n\nThe cattle I found in good condition. These cattle are all tested for T.B. and are free of the disease. The school appears to have plenty of milk, and it is served at all the meals. The barns and outbuildings were tidy. The girls as well as the boys are taught milking.\n\nThe root cellar was completed last fall and should serve splendidly in the keeping of vegetables. It is dug out of the bank, lined with lumber, and covered by poles, straw and earth. The front is well protected and double doors are used at the entrance. A carload of potatoes were shipped in by the Principal and were in good condition.\n\nThe poultry house is now in use. Mr. Ross has secured some very fine Barred Rock birds and has now a good start for next\nstart for next year.\n\nHay is purchased from the Indians and it is hauled down a very steep hill to the valley where the school is situated. Mr. Ross has been warned not to allow the boys to drive loads of hay down this hill as the road is narrow and upsetting might mean a drop of anything from 40 to 100 feet. In spite of this the Indians complain that it still goes on, and that the boys are allowed to ride down. I instructed Mr. Ross that he should not allow the boys to drive down or even ride on the load.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ross now reside in the residence supplied, and Mrs. Therien apparently assumes the duties of matron.\n\nAt present this school has one pupil over the allotted number, making 76, and I learned that 18 of these pupils are from the Assiniboine Agency. In visiting the Indian homes on the Crooked Lake Agency I found that a number of children of school age are not in residence. The parents claim there is no room and are unwilling to send them to any other school. The Assiniboine Agency children might be accommodated in another United Church school in September, thus allowing plenty of room at Round Lake for all of the Crooked Lake pupils; This would be placing no hardship either on the parents or children, as already they are away from their parents.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., February 3rd, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the two residential schools in the Crooked Lake Agency, inspected by Mr. Hamilton.\n\nThe report on conditions at the Round Lake Indian Residential School is favourable. The children seem to be well cared for, and are receiving good food. The building is old and is difficult to keep at the proper temperature. With reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the floors in the playrooms, there is an item of $300.00 in the Estimates to re-floor these rooms, but I question whether this amount will be sufficient.\n\nConditions at the Cowessess Indian Residential School are reported to be good, which, of course, is pleasing. There is nothing in connection with this school which requires any special comment from me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 304-11 of the third instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the Round Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is pleased to note that the general conditions at this school are satisfactory and that the children appear to be well cared for and are receiving good food.\n\nRegarding the fire escape on the front of the boys' dormitory, I have to request that you will arrange to have a small platform erected, in order to prevent accident. It is noted, from the Inspector's report, that this fire escape leads out over a sloping ledge of the roof and that the erection of a small platform on which the boys could step out would improve conditions. It is thought that the school authorities would be able to arrange to do this work if any material required were supplied. The Department will leave this matter in your hands, to see that the condition regarding the present exit to the fire escape is remedied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

It is considered that there was a certain amount of neglect on the part of the staff in allowing this condition to arise. I would suggest that the school authorities take the matter up with a local plumber, with a view to having the film which has encrusted the bowls and filled the traps at the outlet removed.

You may therefore advise the Reverend Principal accordingly and he should arrange with the watchman to carry on duties continuously throughout the year.

I may say it is considered necessary that the night watchman's services be continuous at this school, and, as you were informed by official letter of April 27th, last, a grant towards his salary throughout the entire year is allowed.

Ostender\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\n\nOctober 24th, 1933\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to request authority to renew the smoke stack of the steam boiler at the Round Lake Residential School with 14 gauge heavy black iron, wire netting and asbestos cement at a cost of $17.00. This is the figure quoted by Messrs. Wagg, Wilson Co. Ltd. of Regina whose representative recently visited the school to look over the heating plant at the request of the Revd. Principal.\n\nI may say that this firm have quoted $108.50 for rebuilding and re-arranging the heating plant in the class room building of the same school and while it would be a good thing to overhaul this heating plant I do not consider it absolutely essential at the present time but the renewal of the smoke stack of the steam boiler is imperative as its present condition is dangerous, and it is located in such a position in the building as to make it necessary for the work to be of the best material possible.\n\nWhile the representative of the aforementioned Company was at the school he examined the crack in the steam boiler and suggested using a can of solder seal costing $5.00. This has been used and voucher will be forwarded in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostender\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, requesting authority to renew the smoke stack of the steam boiler at the Round Lake Indian Residential School with 14 gauge heavy black iron, wire netting and asbestos cement, at a cost of $43. The Department will approve of this work being done. We will also approve of the action taken by you in supplying a can of solder seal at a cost of $8.00, for the purpose of repairing the crack in the steam boiler. I am enclosing an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure required - $43 in renewing the smoke stack and $8 to cover the cost of the solder. Please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the above work. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1101.\n\nWith reference to the rebuilding and rearranging of the heating plant in the classroom building, the Department will have no funds to cover the cost of having this work carried out. It is noted that it is not absolutely essential at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nJ.P.B.

P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Mr. J.D. Sutherland visited the Round Lake Residential School recently his attention was drawn to the condition of the floors in the two playrooms and he requested me to obtain prices on the different kinds of flooring for consideration by the Department. Below I have given the total floor area to be covered and the approximate cost of the different kinds of flooring:\n\n1500 feet to be covered, this will require the following quantities:\n\n3 in. e.g. fir flooring, No. 1 quality, 2000 ft. $120.00\n13/16 X 1 1/4 in. maple flooring, No. 1 quality, 2144 ft. \u2014 275.00\n13/16 X 1 1/4 in. plain oak flooring, No. 1 quality, 2144 ft. \u2014 395.00\n\nWhile hardwood flooring would no doubt make a much better job and would wear longer, I do not know that the extra cost as compared with fir flooring is justified. I have no doubt that fir flooring, if well laid, would last nearly ten years and the building in which the flooring is to be laid will certainly not last 20 years, therefore it would seem that it would not be wise to spend the extra money required for hardwood.\n\nThe above prices are for material only, the school authorities could take care of the labour of laying the floor.\n\nRegarding beaver board for the walls of these rooms, I would say that the cost would be approximately $40.00 to cover the walls all the way around to a height of 4 feet. Material for cupboards in these rooms would cost approximately $50.00. Therefore the total cost of material for floors, walls and cupboards would be approximately $220.00, using fir flooring, or $375.00 using maple flooring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.F.B. Ostronder,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the floors and walls of the two playrooms at the Round Lake Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost of the flooring and beaver board required.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is considered that it would be satisfactory to supply fir flooring, and, if same is well laid, it would last for a number of years. The Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase, from firms in the area, to receive consideration, of 2,000 feet No. 1 quality fir flooring. It is noted the cost of the flooring will be $120. You may also arrange for the purchase of the quantity of beaver board required for the walls of the playrooms, to a cost not exceeding the sum of $40. Further, you may make purchase of the lumber and other material required for new cupboards in these rooms, to an amount not exceeding $60. I enclose an itemized certificate authorizing the expenditure for the supply of the flooring, beaver board, and material for cupboards, to the amount of $220. The total expenditure should not exceed this figure. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 1126.\n\nIt is to be understood that the school authorities will provide the cost of the labour in connection with the laying of the flooring and installing the beaver board on the walls. You should take this matter up with the principal and arrange for the purchase and delivery of the material at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B.

Engine would cost more but would give more satisfactory results and would be cheaper and more satisfactory in the long run, as it is a known fact that the life of an overworked engine is considerably shortened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. F. R. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 31, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, forwarding accounts covering the cost of general repairs made to the engine of the lighting and power plant at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that payment of this account, covering the cost of repairs, will be made in due course.\n\nWith reference to your recommendation, that the school be supplied with a 12 H. P. engine for the operation of the electric light plant, I have to say it is considered that, if a new engine is supplied, one of much less horse power would be sufficient. The Department is not aware as to the horse power of the engine at present in use, but it is noted that the accounts which you forwarded are for repairs to a 3 H. P. type, \"Z\" engine. Please discuss the matter with the Principal and state if an engine of not more than 5 or 6 H.P. would not be satisfactory to operate the lighting and power plant.\n\nIt may be possible to provide funds from the current year's Appropriation, and I would therefore request an early reply, in order that, if authorized, accounts could reach the Department in time for payment before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nCrooked Lake Agency\nBroadview Sask.\nFebruary 6th, 1934\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter 108-1-5 of the 31st. ult. I beg to say that the engine at the Round Lake I.R. School is required to operate all the machinery viz:- pump, lighting plant and washing machine, which are often operated at the same time and while a 5 or 6 H.P. engine will do the work satisfactorily for a time, if funds were available to procure an engine of a higher H.P., its life would be considerably longer as it would not be overstrained.\n\nThe Revd. Principal is away in the East at the present time and I have been unable to get in touch with him but I believe I know the circumstances as well as he does.\n\nIf the Department however decide to furnish a 5 or 6 H.P. engine it will no doubt do for the present and it is badly needed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nFeb. 15, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the request for a new gasoline engine for the Round Lake Indian Residential School, I would ask you to kindly furnish me with a rough sketch showing the location of the laundry machinery, the well, and the lighting plant with relation to each other.\n\nI understand that the one gasoline engine is at present used for operating all of this equipment. It might be more economical and satisfactory to provide separate engines. Kindly state the power required to operate the pump, the type of pump, the power required to operate the lighting plant, and the capacity of the lighting plant, also the power used in running the laundry machinery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I do not think that it will be practical to operate this machinery with two engines chiefly because there is very little room in either the engine room or the laundry for any additional equipment but also because the cost of two small engines and fuel to operate would be greater to operate than that of one engine of somewhat larger capacity.\n\nOne 6 H.P. engine will operate the machinery at full if used at full capacity which consists of a Fairbanks Morse self oiling typhoon pump with a capacity of 2500 gallons per hour and 100 lbs pressure, a generator shunt wound Fairbanks Morse L.H. Type 1\u00bd kilowatt 42 volts and a washer Globe-Wood 36\" x 48\" no partition single geared, end movement, but a drier is needed during the cold weather the clothes are dried in the children's playroom, which is far from satisfactory. This would add considerable strain of operation at the same time.\n\nThe engine now in use, as well as the pump, were purchased out of school funds and at the time the engine was purchased it was only a temporary measure through a break-down on the old engine - a 6 H.P. -\n\nAs stated in my previous letter the life on an engine is shortened by being worked at full capacity and this fact together with the need of further laundry equipment would suggest the desirability of procuring an engine of greater horse power than 6 if possible at the present time.\n\nHowever, as the Department desires to keep the cost as low as possible a 6 H.P. engine will do the work. I may say that the 6 H.P. Lister Engine at the Cowessess I. R. School has given very satisfactory service as its horse power does not seem to be over-rated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 2, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn January, 1933, you were forwarded refills for the fire extinguishers at the Round Lake School.

REGINA, SASK., 30th October, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Ostrander concerning the question of the water supply at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, an adequate supply of suitable water has always been a matter of difficulty at this school. The present supply is being obtained from the lake. There is a spring north of the school. A sample of the water from this spring had been submitted for analysis and the report is that it is very satisfactory to use for drinking purposes. The Reverend Principal, Mr. H. J. Ross, is anxious to have this water piped to the school.\n\nThe distance from the spring to the school is 3600 feet. It would require that number of feet of 2\" pipe which costs 35\u00a2 per foot, and the other necessary pipe, elbows, unions etc., would amount to approximately $50.00. Mr. Ross states that the school would arrange performance of any work which could be done with the tractor or team, but the digging and laying of the pipe would entail a great deal of work. It is estimated that the whole project could be completed for about $2,000.00.\n\nIf the pipe were laid at a sufficient depth to safeguard it from frost, the project if carried out should solve the question of a water supply for some years and should not necessitate much outlay for up-keep as the spring is considerably higher than the school and I think there would be sufficient pressure by natural gravity to insure that no pumping machinery would be necessary.\n\nAs the question has been brought to my attention, I am submitting same to you for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

School reported to me that the washing machine at his school is completely worn out and unfit for further use and requested me to wire the Department for authority to purchase a new one.\n\nI visited the school and found that the machine was in a very poor condition and not fit for further use. I however had the same patched up to do temporarily. The wood in this machine has rotted out and as a result it is almost impossible to get screws or bolts in that will hold it together.\n\nI have taken up with Mr. Foster of Whitewood who has recently done some repairs at that school and he has forwarded to me a cutting of a washing machine which I am enclosing and his letter states as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Please find enclosed a cut of the Canadian Acme Washer which we believe is what you want as it seems much like the old one which we have at the School at the present time.\n\nWe understand that these machines sell at $825.00 F.O.B. factory but there are none in Winnipeg at the present time but we have been fortunate in locating a repossessed machine which has only been out one year and is guaranteed which we would like to instal in working order for $525.00 which will save you approximately $300.00.\n\nSome of the companies which we received information from advised us that two ordinary electric washers would serve your purpose.\n\nIf I could consider this machine it would be possible to make arrangements so that the Indian Agent in Winnipeg could inspect this machine before anything definite was done.\"\n\nSigned W. G. Foster.\n\nIf it is impossible to pay for a new machine before the end of the fiscal year I would be glad to have authority to purchase same immediately after April 1st when I think that arrangements could be made with Mr. Foster to get the machine shown in this cutting installed before that time in case the old machine which has been patched up fails and one is needed urgently. Personally I do not feel inclined to recommend a second hand machine. It may be that the Department could purchase this in the East cheaper than we can get quotations here and in that event I presume arrangements could be made with Mr. Foster to instal it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Foster has had an inquiry for a washing machine from an Indian Mission somewhere near Whitewood and has written us requesting that we quote him a price on this machine.\n\nWe happen to have an exceptionally good reconditioned washer here which was used only one year. It is a 42 x 34\" machine and according to Mr. Foster's first letter, copy of which is attached, this is the size that they require.\n\nWe have for years dealt direct with the Department of Indian Affairs on this laundry equipment and although we have quoted W.G. Foster on the machine and suggested that this would be a good purchase for the Department of Indian Affairs, he has come back with a letter and asked us that in the event that he gets the order, would we be able to give him thirty days as he states it would be very inconvenient for him to pay cash at this time.\n\nWe are writing Mr. Foster that we will be agreeable to this as we feel he is a responsible party. However, we are wondering if you will not be buying this washer yourselves rather than have it go through another dealer.\n\nWould you kindly advise the writer by return mail so that we may be governed accordingly, for it is quite evident that the Indian Mission is right up against it as far as the condition of their present washer is concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 2)\n48 INCH SUPER SIMPLEX IRONER\n\nThe 48 inch Super Simplex is a fully automatic Ironer designed for wherever a considerable amount of ironing has to be done at maximum speed and minimum operating cost.\n\nA slight pressure anywhere along the edge of the feed board actuates the automatic mechanism which quickly applies or releases pressure of the shoe against the roll. The operator is comfortably seated while ironing, avoiding fatigue and substantially increasing production. The two open ends of the roll make it possible to iron any kind of apparel, underwear, lingerie, house dresses - in fact anything, even pieces for which the hand iron has been considered indispensable until now.\n\nThe construction is exceedingly sturdy, insuring steady operation without breakdowns. The heavy end frames, firmly bolted to the shoe, form a rigid framework. The roll of heavy gauge metal is thickly padded to assure uniform ironing throughout its length. The automatic pressure mechanism is particularly rugged and dependable. An auxiliary foot-operated pressure release makes it possible to instantly drop the shoe away from the roll even in the event of electrical failure, line disturbance or blown fuse.\n\nWith the exception of the motor, the 48 inch Super Simplex requires oiling only at infrequent intervals - from two to four months, depending upon its use. A \u00bd HP, constant duty motor is connected to the driving mechanism by an endless belt; mounted on sliding rails it is easily adjusted at any time to maintain correct tension.\n\nGas consumption: 33 cu. ft. per hour. Electric consumption: 3,350 watts per hour. Shipping weight, gas heated: 390 lbs. Shipping weight, electrically heated: 420 lbs.

It is a matter of eighteen miles. Perhaps he would give a lower quotation if the freighting and installation was done by the school authorities but at the present time he has not very complete information in connection with this type of machinery and the roads are very bad. If it is not going to be installed until after April 1st when no doubt roads will be better perhaps Mr. Foster could be given another chance to submit a quotation before final arrangements are made for the purchase of a new machine.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

The United Church has two schools which require a Nightwatchman the year round \u2014 Norway House and Round Lake. We have had four incipient fires at Round Lake and three at Norway House in the five years that I have been associated with the Board of Home Missions, and in no single case did the fire originate in the furnace room. In so far as Round Lake is concerned there would be very little hope of getting the children out with the stairs and other facilities which are available, if the fire had gained any headway. We have some other schools which receive a grant for Nightwatchmen, which are practically fire-proof and have adequate fire escapes, but in these two instances I feel that a general rule has been made to apply, and that it should be rectified at once.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this important matter, I am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKJB:PB\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. R. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nPlease ask for authority to enlarge the girls' dormitory by the addition of two stairways adjoining it, which are not in use. This would give space for six additional beds. The material needed is 120 feet flooring, 10 bushels lime, 75 lineal feet 2x8' and 30 lineal feet 2x6'. We would be willing to do the carpenter work and the plastering. If this is granted, we could accommodate 85 children instead of 75 as at present. There is plenty of room for additional pupils in the boys' dormitory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. L. Rao.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a request from the Principal of the Round Lake School for authority to enlarge the Girl's Dormitory at that school, which is self explanatory insofar as the material required is concerned.\n\nThis is the staircases of the old building which adjoins the present one, and by taking out the wall upstairs it would allow for another five or six beds in the dormitory.\n\nHe has also renewed the request for the floor rugs asked for in my letter of Oct.13th, stating that the school would supply the curtain material asked for at that same time if the Department would reconsider their decision with regard to the rugs and oil-cloth.\n\nMay I have your instructions herein?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.R. McKenzie.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that one of the grates in the furnace below the classroom at the Round Lake Indian Residential School is burnt and twisted so that it cannot be made use of. This is a McLary Famous Magnet Furnace.\n\nAlso in their heating system at the school, the air vent in each of the radiators, 54 in all, have outlived their usefulness and require renewing.\n\nMay I have authority to purchase the grate and also the radiator plugs in question?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A.W.H. McKenzie,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 9, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, requesting authority to renew a grate in the furnace of the classroom at the Round Lake Indian Residential School and also to supply new air vents in the radiators. In reply I have to say the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase of the grates and also the quantity of radiator flues required. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date, regarding the request of the Principal for authority to enlarge the girls' dormitory and to supply the material required. In this connection I would point out that the pupilage provided for at this school is 75. As it appears there is accommodation for that number and also as our funds are extremely limited, it is considered that it would not be necessary to make any enlargement in the dormitory at the present time.\n\nWith reference to your request that reconsideration be given to authorizing the supplying of the floor rugs asked for in your letter of October 18th, last, I have to say that, as you were informed at that time, it is believed that replacement should be made by the school from per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nI wish to refer you to official letters dated September 21st and October 15th, last, regarding the authority granted to carry out several urgent repairs and to supply new batteries. If all the work has been completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.A.W.R. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nINSISTENT demand made upon the Kester Solder Company by its thousands of loyal customers for a better aluminum solder inspired the research that has resulted in Kester Aluminum Solder.\n\nKester has replied with Kester Aluminum Solder (Flux Filled). Pictured at right is the handy home size can that is so easily identified by its striking diamond design. The color combination is black and aluminum. Ten of these cans are packed in an attractive counter display carton.\n\nEach can contains a liberal coil of Kester Aluminum Solder, a generous supply of cleaning material and a complete and comprehensive instruction sheet that describes progressive steps of use written so that even a novice can secure a satisfactory result in aluminum soldering.\n\nThe price of the home unit places it in reach of all. Farmers, homesteaders, mechanics, as well as housewives will welcome this handy package. Larger units are of course available. The one pound spool is shown at right.\n\nWHY KESTER IS FLUX-FILLED\n\nAll common metals oxidize or rust at room temperature; but if they are heated they oxidize much faster. Aluminum, like other metals, is no exception. They too oxidize faster when heated, as they must be for soldering, and unless a flux is used such oxides prevent the solder from sticking properly. Any one who has used ordinary soft solder realizes the importance of a fluxing agent.\n\nIt is true, that certain manufacturers of Aluminum Solder have stated that their product does not require a flux. Since the function of a flux is that of reducing the oxides accumulated on the surface of the metal to be soldered, it is an unquestionable fact that the use of a flux makes the soldering of aluminum a much easier accomplishment.\n\nOther manufacturers have claimed that their aluminum solders contain a flux which is supposedly intermixed with the metal itself. Naturally, anything of the sort is an impossibility, as it is a well known fact that flux and solder will not mix in any manner whatsoever.\n\nIt remained for the Kester Solder Company to be the first to produce Aluminum Solder with an efficient fluxing element sealed within the solder body and make successful aluminum solder a reality.\n\nKESTER INVITES INDUSTRIAL INQUIRIES\n\nManufacturers having aluminum soldering problems are invited to present them to the Industrial Engineering Division of the Kester Solder Company for our assistance.\n\nKESTER SOLDER COMPANY\n\nCored Solder Originators\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 NEWARK, U.S.A.\n\nBRANTFORD, CANADA\nKESTER ALUMINUM SOLDER (FLUX-FILLED)\n\nINSISTENT demand made upon the Kester Solder Company by its loyal customers for a usable aluminum solder has led them to such that has resulted in Kester Aluminum Solder.\n\nKester has replied with Kester Aluminum Solder (Flux Filled).

As a result, the appropriation for this purpose has been completely assigned, and the amount at our disposal only enables us to provide the salary of a night watchman from October 1st to April 30th.

Having beaver board on the wall permits the use of thumb tacks in hanging the school work for display purposes, at present they have to use small nails owing to the plastered wall.\n\nThe blackboards in the class room are also showing signs of wear which can be remedied by the use of Hyloplate to cover the surface of each and which would put them in first class shape.\n\nMay I have authority to purchase these two articles for the class rooms there?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben A.W.H.

Principal of the Round Lake School writes as follows:\n\n\"Our engineer noticed a discharge on Saturday on the switchboard of the generator when no lights were on. He investigated and found a short in an upstairs back room used as a store room. It was just where the cord entered the ceiling. The insulation had perished with age and the swinging of the cord when turning on the switch had evidently cracked it and thus caused the short. I regard this matter of sufficient importance to report it. This discovery has made our engineer more alert than ever.\"\n\nInformation passed on for your instructions please.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEben A. W. R. McKenzie\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the short circuit discovered in the wiring at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. It is noted that the engineer at the school is carefully checking the wires in order to avoid short circuits. His action in this regard is very commendable and should be continued.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R.

The water seeps through the sand which acts as a natural filter. During the past winter no water flowed out of the lake. The result was that the well filled slowly. Sometimes we had only enough for our ordinary needs.\n\nWhen the diggers were sinking the well, they encountered quicksand and were not able to make the well as deep as they had intended. I see no other way of getting a greater supply of water from this well, a supply sufficient at all times for the fire hoses should the need arise to use them, except by enlarging the diameter of the well.\n\nI think this work should be done by next fall and that the cost, if the work is done by local well-diggers, should not exceed Fifty Dollars.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.J.

As they are at present both dormitories land on the balcony and from there have to use the one fire escape. This would mean steel pole rings and railings.\n\nIn the laundry, one of the stoves has given out and is described as Excelsior Cooker No.25, McLarys with galvanized square clothes boiler to fit. They require two of these boilers, both the same size.\n\nThe mattresses in the boys dormitory are in very poor condition. Is this a customary replacement by the Department or are the school authorities to look after it?\n\nSubmitted for your consideration and instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may authorize the Principal to proceed with this work when weather conditions are suitable.\n\nIn connection with the other items mentioned in your letter I may say that in our current year's appropriation an amount of $500.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Round Lake School. Deducting the $50.00 authorized for repairs to the well leaves a balance of $400.00 available. With reference to the new fire escape which you consider should be placed on the building please let me have an estimate of its cost and full particulars regarding the material required in order that the matter may be placed before our Purchasing Agent.\n\nIn the fourth paragraph of your letter you state that a new stove is required for the laundry. Can this be secured at the price mentioned in your estimates, namely $26.00?\n\nRegarding the 72 mattresses please let me know the length and width of these.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. A. W. R.

(RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nExtract from letter dated July 6, 1938, received from Dr. J. J. WALL.\n\nIt is with respect to the fire hazard at night in four of our Schools. They are Sandy Bay, Man., Round Lake and Cowessess of Broadview, Sask., and lastly and especially Hobema, Alta. In any of these institutions, should I sleep there, I always have the flash-light, overcoat, socks and gloves available and prepared for a sudden dive into the winter night. This fear in these four places certainly has not become an obsession but it has started to bother my conscience.\n\nI know how foolish it would be in these hard times to imagine that funds are available for proper reconstruction. But is it not possible to get proper escape apparatus installed. Every second for evacuation time must be conserved. I am not frightened so much of the flames at night but I am fearful of the superheated gases developing and flooding the halls. Only a partial lung-ful of this and a person is out. All the fire fighting equipment possible will not avail such a case. That was my experience years ago at the Royal Victoria in Montreal when we had that terrible movie fire which took so many children. It was not the flames, as I recollect, none were even scorched.\n\nMy belief is that this problem can be solved in preparing proper escapes. Iced poles of iron, narrow snow or ice filled metal stairs on the outside possibly open to a wall of flames from some window it passes will only add to the panic at night. Poor lighting over these meager affairs will not assist.\n\nThe panic in the children when a real fire does break will be stupendous. The stoical Indian in such case is a figment on the part of certain popular authors.\n\nDont be sore at me, Phil., as I am prepared to lay a two to one bet up to $100 bucks that in case of such an eventuality in any of the four, happening in winter between ten at night and four in the morning, the mortality will exceed...\nthirty per cent.\n\nThe ideal thing would be an inspection of each by an officer, like the Chief of the Montreal brigade, who has had plenty of experience dealing with such institutional hazards. His first consideration would be to figure the route the fire and gases would take so that adequate methods and routes of escape can be instituted. Steel fire doors would undoubtedly be installed on each floor above the first. Steel tower-like escapes as on the Kent Street School at Ottawa would replace at strategic points the old dangerous poles and narrow stairs. Lists of pupils to utilize each escape would be posted at all times and each child's name checked from list as it passes by a responsible guardian. Many of the children otherwise, in the event of a genuine alarm will, if not watched, take refuge in a clothes closet or under its bed.\n\nNight watchman was a step in the right direction but much can happen in the winter when he is punching in the outbuildings and barn and the time he returns to the school.\n\nMuch as I hate to bring your attention to this whole question in these four places, please understand it is not done so with any sense of butting in. It is for these poor kiddies sake, many of whom one becomes attached in his duties. In case also, should any catastrophe arise, we all shall be scourged properly at any investigation especially at the hands of politically conscious lawyers who cynically will give little credit to those who really and truly have the fullest interests of these tots at heart.\nSIMMONS LIMITED\nWINNIPEG\n\nDATE July 26, 1938.\n\nSOLD TO Dominion Government,\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nINVOICE 8425\nS.D.

School, the Revd. Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"In getting our Gurney furnace ready for the winter, we found that two of the sections, 2nd and 4th from the front, are leaking and should be replaced. The number on the furnace seems to be 106-425. If there are gaskets we would need gaskets for four sections. We need also the water glass assembly (the glass and two valves).\n\nWhen we ordered the dryer last fall, we expected it to be delivered in time to be installed before the cold weather arrived. When it came the weather was too cold to install it as we would have to let the fires out in order to do so. We set it up in the spring but did not need to use it during the summer. To have it work properly we will need a return pipe back to the furnace. We will also need lumber enough to close up three windows. When we estimated the cost of this dryer, we set the figure at $200.00 or less. The dryer itself cost about $120.00 or so. We would still be within the estimate if we got the pipe and lumber. We should have 100 feet one inch galvanized pipe, 8 elbows, 4 couplings, 1 union, 1 valve or tap so that we can shut it off, 1 reducer from 2\" to 1\", and 1 reducer from 1\" to 1/2\". 100 feet of drop siding and 100 feet of rough lumber would close up the windows and a couple of small doors in the room. We have the nails and paper for the job.\n\nWe are nearly half through with painting the school buildings and find that it is taking much more paint than we estimated. We will need 30 gallons French Gray Paint and 5 gallons White Outside Paint and 3 gallons Shingle Paint, permanent, enamel, to finish the job. We should also have 4\" paint brushes, and one each of 2\" and 1\" paint brushes. We would also have 3 gallons tar to patch the rubberoid roofing, and a sheet of galvanized tin for patching around the chimneys.\n\nWe will need at one for the principal's residence one bag of cement to stop the leak in the cement cistern, one plank 2 x 10 and 15 feet long to make a step at the back door and a bag of plaster to repair walls and roofs.\"\n\nWith regard to the paint as it is for finishing the job if allowed might I suggest that the Revd. Principal orders this and then he would be able to specify exactly what is wanted in this case.\n\nMay the necessary authority please be granted as he requests for these repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed credit memorandum has been received from the Sherwin-Williams Company. We do not appear to have received recently any account for paint supplied to the Round Lake School. Possibly you have made some purchases as authorized by official letter of September 16 but have not yet forwarded the account. If so, the amount credited for paint returned should be deducted from the account and a copy of the credit memorandum attached to your voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nE.A.W.R. McKenzie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to advise that a new Principal has arrived at the Round Lake I. R. School in the person of Mr. Huston. He has taken up his residence in the principal's residence which is apart from the school building.\n\nHe asks if the Department will authorise some repairs now to at least make it habitable.\n\nThis house has been unoccupied for several years as Mr. Ross lived in the school, and is in a very bad state of repair. The plaster in every room needs replastering, the chimney needs rebuilding from the roof up, each window leaks water to the inside and there are not sufficient storm windows for the house. The foundation requires refacing around the basement windows. These are urgent repairs to make the house habitable but only temporary as the whole outside of the building and roof badly need repainting.\n\nOut of the appropriation of $850.00 the sum of $480.00 has been vouchered for and with another approx. $160.00 for that authorised there should be a balance of about $270.00 out of the original appropriation.\n\nI would think that it would cost in the neighborhood of $300.00 to make it fit to carry on through the winter but it is almost impossible to fill out a form 374 for this work as it really needs an estimate from a competent builder.\n\nThe new Principal has no other place than this house to live in and it is not fit to live there as it is at present and asks that authority may be granted as soon as possible to get a competent estimate of it and proceed with the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEben.

At that time there was a possibility that the weather might turn cold and the Agent requested authority to purchase the additional quantity of paint necessary in order that the painting could be completed at the earliest possible date. He was, therefore, authorized at that time to purchase the additional quantity covered by the enclosed account.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A.

BAILEY\n\nI attach account for $154.35 in favour of the Sherwin-Williams Company covering the cost of paint and material for the Round Lake Residential School.\n\nA quantity of paint for this school was ordered in February, 1938 (your order No. 2956).\n\nHowever, on September 10 the Indian Agent advised that due to the fact that the building had not been painted for many years it was found that more paint was needed than had been previously supplied. At that time there was a possibility that the weather might turn cold and the Agent requested authority to purchase the additional quantity of paint necessary in order that the painting could be completed at the earliest possible date. He was, therefore, authorized at that time to purchase the additional quantity covered by the enclosed account.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR. A.

When the engineer tried to repair the pipe he found it so badly rusted that anything he did to it only made the leak greater. We had to immediately let the fire out, keep letting water into the furnace to replace what leaked out until the furnace cooled and replace the old pipe with new pipe which we were able to get in Stockholm. Fortunately for us the day was mild and we suffered no inconvenience.\n\nYou will find enclosed four copies of the invoice for the new pipe etc.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.J.

Mr. Huston, Principal of the above referred to school, asking if it is possible to have the work on his dwelling done this season. He points out that the house in its present condition is very cold and unfit for habitation during the winter. He states that last year they had to use Arctic robes brought from the north on their beds at night, but this provided no solution for the cold during the day.\n\nHis recommendation is to cover all over the outside with an imitation brick. This material is a heavy tar, paper and sand mixture made to look like bricks. The testimonies of people in Whitewood who are using it seem to indicate that it is 100% satisfactory.\n\nHe states there is yet time to have this done this season. He also states that they have an excellent furnace but it has no effect under present conditions.\n\nI may say that on my last visit to this school I went through this house and found conditions are as outlined by the Principal. The necessary work to have this house made habitable this winter would be the outside insulation and the providing of 16 storm windows, at a total cost of about $580.00.\n\nI would therefore recommend that this work be done if funds are available. Failing this, the Principal will have to get rooms in town for his family.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos.

R. School.\n\nI find the outside construction very poor. It consists of the following:\u2014 1 inch lumber, paper and siding. The paper has perished giving no resistance to wind or cold.\n\nThe inside is plastered right to the studs.\n\nThe floors are of one thickness. There is no sub-floor as is customary in home construction.\n\nThere is no insulating in any part of the house.\n\nThe furnace is not doing the heating it should for the reason that there are only 2 cold air pipes 12\" in diameter for the whole of the house, none from the upstairs at all. There should be at least two double headers from the upstairs and two more from the ground floor to get results from the furnace.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned, W. R. Webb.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant to Inspector Dr. Robertson concerning the matter of the necessary repairs to the house of the Reverend Principal of the Round Lake I.R. School in order to make it habitable, the complaint being it was impossible to keep warm in the winter. This afternoon on the instructions of Dr. Robertson visited this school with Mr. W. Webb of Broadview and thoroughly went into the whole matter.\n\nThere are several causes for the cold the most important being that whatever was done satisfaction would not be achieved until the furnace was altered. At present there is not sufficient cold air shafts and as a consequence the cold air stays stationary and does not give the hot air a chance to circulate. To remedy this more cold air shafts would have to be put in and the whole affair remodelled at a cost of $50.00.\n\nThe inside walls are too thin and the paper used as building paper when the house was built is perished and there is no resistance for the cold from the walls.\n\nThe top part of the house around the eaves and roof has no insulation whatever which also again does not prevent the cold from coming in.\n\nThe casings around the windows and doors outside are worn out and need renewing.\n\nThe main ground floor is only ordinary flooring with no subfloor and this should be reinforced over the present floor with an oak flooring.\n\nI may say that within the last two days the plants have already frozen in the house.\n\nI do not know what appropriation the Department have to spend on this house but the Reverend Principal has asked me to convey his wishes that the whole of these repairs be authorised and give him a house in which he can live and also that the Department were authority for the work to proceed at once as winter seems to have set in already as snow is on the ground and last night it was down nearly zero.\n\nI am enclosing a booklet showing on page 2 the Perth Blend insulated siding proposed to put on the outside of the house.\n\nI am also enclosing copy of Mr. Webb's letter on the matter and form 37\u00bd enumerating material required and cost of labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilfred J.

Churning, pumping water and cream separating will no longer be time- and muscle-taking jobs.\n\nFrom one job to another this chore boy will work its way into the favor of every one in the family and you'll be surprised at the low cost for fuel and oil.\n\nThe following pages tell about the John Deere line of engines, the enclosed engines that oil themselves.\n\nYou are sure to be impressed with their advanced design, their safety and convenience. Built to the John Deere high standard of quality, you are assured of a faithful servant which will give you many years of low-cost and satisfactory service.\nSir:\n\nThe Revd. Principal of Round Lake I.R. School writes as follows:\n\n\"The 1\u00bd horsepower engine that pumps the water for the school residence has absolutely gone haywire. We have had to haul water in barrels for kitchen and laundry purposes and our toilets for lack of water have been out of commission. If the building caught fire we would have nothing but the hand fire extinguishers with which to combat it. It is really a very bad predicament to be in.\n\nThe engine that has served our needs in this capacity is so old that when we called up the international People for parts it out dated all their records. This is one engine for the safety and welfare of the children and school property should be in A.I. condition.\n\nYou will note I have enclosed a folder descriptive of the type engine we require. George Lamont Ford Agent in Whitewood has them in stock and would supply same for around ninety dollars and would no doubt give us ten dollars for the old engine.\n\nWould you kindly see this matter is dealt with as soon as possible as it represents the vital part of our water system which is according to my best knowledge a responsibility of the department. It would be a terrible thing if a fire broke out in the school similar to the one we had last year and we had no water pressure to cope with it. We found in combating the fire last year that it was the water and not the fire extinguishers that saved the day.

We have had to haul water in barrels for kitchen and laundry purposes and our toilets for lack of water have been out of commission.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRegina, Feb.15, 1940.\n\nRev. A.G. Huston,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Res. School,\nStockholm, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have now received a report from our sanitary Officer, Mr. J.E. Hockley, in connection with the plumbing system at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe report is very discouraging. Mr. Hockley states that in his opinion the system is in such bad condition it cannot be improved short of complete replacement. I quote from Mr. Hockley's report: \"The system is in a very poor state of repair, and in my opinion requires replacing and major over-hauling. There are only four clean-outs in the entire building, all visible stacks, drains, and waste pipes are full of holes which have been plugged with wooden pegs. The holes have been bored from time to time to permit the insertion of rods for clearing obstructions. Ceilings and walls even to the third floor show stain and plaster breakage due to leakage of pipes or from overflowing fixtures.\n\nThe waste pipes, stacks and floor drains are heavily corroded. One length of 1/2 inch pipe shown to me was so heavily corroded that there was only about 1 inch opening remaining. Fixtures, particularly closet bowl water seal chambers were so heavily corroded the services of a plumber was necessary to clear them. One closet was completely plugged.\n\nIn the basement a two inch pipe was carried from the laundry tub waste up to and along the ceiling to the soil stack, then downward and connected to the stack near the floor level. This was apparently supposed to be a vent.\n\nA four inch stack rising through the dining-room ceiling terminates in the boy's playroom. At one time a water closet was connected to it at this point, but the water closet has been removed, and the stack has been reduced to a two inch pipe and apparently carried into the ceiling above and is deflected a few feet and is carried through the boys' and girls' dormitories as a vent.\n\nAs shown in the sketches submitted, there is only one staff bathroom which contains one water closet, and there are a total of five water closets in three different rooms for the pupils. No separate accommodation has been provided for the male members of the staff.\n\nThe septic tank contained about four feet of sludge and has not been cleaned out for a considerable length of time. At various points along the drain from the building to the septic tank and between the septic tank and absorption field, the pipe had to be broken to enable the operators to insert the cleaning rods so that obstructions could be removed. The discharge pipe from the septic tank was apparently solidly plugged and some of the tile drains in the absorption field are completely plugged and not operating. Furthermore, the sewer pipe to the septic was reduced from six inches to four inches where it enters the tank, the siphon had to be broken into so that it could be cleaned and obstructions removed. The liquid level in the septic tank had at one time risen to a height several feet above the inlet and outlet pipes with the\nresult that sewage backed up into the building.\"\n\nIt is quite obvious that the plumbing system at the school is in a very bad condition, and it seems to me that it was not properly installed in the first place. Furthermore, there are said to be seventy to eighty pupils, yet there are only five water closets and no urinals for the boys. In addition, the water closets are located at various points in the building with not more than two in any one location.\n\nIt is also evident that insufficient attention has been given to the operation of the septic tank. No system of sewage treatment will eliminate solids or convert them entirely to a liquid form. Consequently, the resulting sludge must be removed from treatment units periodically. The septic tank at the school is scarcely large enough for the requirements, but regardless of the size it could not function properly unless the sludge is removed before it accumulates to a depth in excess of about two feet. Cleaning operations may have to be carried out two or three times a year or oftener.\n\nI trust that this matter will be brought to the attention of the proper authorities and that early action will be taken to correct the many faulty conditions in the plumbing system. If such action is not taken, it may be necessary to close off the water waste system entirely.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.G. Schaeffer, B.Sc.,\nSanitary Engineer.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

BAILEY\n\nThe attached account covers the cost of a new engine for pumping the water at the Round Lake School. Purchase of this was authorized as it was immediately required. In this regard I quote from a letter received from the Acting Indian Agent on December 20, 1939:\n\n\"The 1\u00bd horsepower engine that pumps the water for the school residence has absolutely gone hay wire. We have had to haul water in barrels for kitchen and laundry purposes and our toilets for lack of water have been out of commission. If the building caught fire we would have nothing but the hand fire extinguishers with which to combat it. It is really a very bad predicament to be in.\n\n\"The engine that has served our needs in this capacity is so old that when we called up the international people for parts it out dated all their records. This is one engine for the safety and welfare of the children and school property should be in A.I. condition.\n\n\"You will note I have enclosed a folder descriptive of the type engine we require. George Lamont Fort Agent in Whitewood has them in stock and would supply same for around ninety dollars.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant a cheque will go forward shortly to Mr. George V. Lamont in payment of the stationary engine supplied to the Round Lake Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. A.

You will observe that the building is old and is in a poor state of repair.\n\nIt would appear that to carry out major repairs to any of the services, without including general repairs to the whole building, would be uneconomical. It is understood, however, that the Department of Public Health of the Province of Saskatchewan will demand some action in regard to the plumbing.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of work involved for both repairs and new work would be approximately as follows:\n\nPlumbing system ............ $1,250.00\nElectrical system .......... 550.00\nGeneral repairs to structure other than the above ....... 1,100.00\nContingencies ............... 500.00\nTotal ......................... $3,400.00\n\nWould you kindly forward a copy of the report to the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch for his information.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

Havens,\nhis successor at the Crooked Lake Agency, I carried out\na thorough inspection of the School and found conditions\nto be as follows:\n\nThe building is a frame structure consisting\nof three stories and basement which has fallen into a\nvery bad state of repair. Approximately one-half of the\nbuilding has been in service for forty years, the re-\nmainder having been erected as an addition in 1918.\n\nFoundation walls, basement floor, heating\nsystem, plaster work, wood floors, window frames and sash,\nand interior trim, are all in need of repair, while the\nplumbing and electric wiring systems, upon which I was\nspecially instructed to report, have depreciated to the\npoint of requiring almost complete replacement.\n\nWith reference to the plumbing, it is evident\nthat this division of work was poorly installed initially.\nClean-out access fittings were omitted from soil stacks\nand waste lines, and when these became blocked by heavy\nwaste matter, corrosion and alkaline deposits, access has\nbeen obtained by drilling the pipes to accommodate clean-\ning rods. The holes thus created have been filled by\nwooden blocks which gradually decay and from time to time\ndrop out completely permitting the passage of waste matter\nand sewer gas. Flaws, holes or cracks in soil lines are\nviolations of the Provincial Health Regulations, and it is\nunderstood that the Provincial Department of Public Health\nhas already indicated that they will insist on the replace-\nment of all defective plumbing.\n\nThe School is occupied by seventy-five pupils,\nforty girls and thirty-five boys, as well as a teaching\nand non-professional staff of fourteen. The girls are\nserved by three W.C.'s, one in their recreation room toilet\nand two in the dormitory toilets. The boys are served by\ntwo W.C.'s, both in their dormitory toilet. The whole\nschool staff, both male and female, is at present served by\none bathroom.\n\nNo new plumbing work should be considered which\ndid not include one additional W.C., (four in all) in each\nof the following locations:\n\n(1) Girls recreation room toilet.\n(2) Girls dormitory toilet.\n(3) Boys recreation room toilet.\n(4) Boys dormitory toilet.\nAn additional bathroom for the male staff is also absolutely necessary. A suggested location adjacent to the School workshop was pointed out to the Indian Agent. The bathroom now serving the whole staff could thus be released for the use of the female staff alone.\n\nMany of the fittings belonging to the plumbing fixtures are broken or missing and should be replaced. Connections between the fixtures and soil lines are faulty, in many cases allowing the escape of soil content which has saturated the adjacent floors. All plumbing fixtures should be removed, cleaned and re-set.\n\nThe septic tank when viewed was functioning satisfactorily but since it receives toilet, kitchen and laundry waste, will eventually cause trouble. An additional four-inch vitrified tile drain, eighty-five feet in length, to carry off laundry and kitchen waste to the river, without passing through the septic tank, would eliminate trouble in this regard. Most of the hot and cold water lines are heavily corroded and should be replaced.\n\nWith reference to the electric wiring system I may say that this is of the knob and tube type and is in a badly depreciated condition. There are no permanent lighting fixtures, lighting being provided by drop cords and sockets from the outlets.

It will require considerable repair work to restore the electrical system to a satisfactory condition.\n\nThe steam heating system appears to have sufficient capacity and the boiler and equipment is functioning satisfactorily.

(RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 4)\nOttawa, July 19, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School,\nCrooked Lake Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Melville, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe main building at this school was built approximately 40 years ago by the Presbyterian Church. The Department purchased the buildings and land (approximately 400 acres) at this place in the fiscal year 1922-23, at a total cost of $7,152.46. Following the purchase of the building, considerable money was spent in repairing it and in the erection of an outside classroom, barn and other outbuildings.\n\nThe Round Lake School is now conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. In the Crooked Lake Agency there is also the Comessass Residential School, conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. About one-half the population of the Crooked Lake Agency are adherents of the United Church of Canada and the remainder are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe Round Lake Residential School has an authorized enrolment of 75 pupils.\n\nA few months ago the Sanitary Engineer of the Department of Public Health, Province of Saskatchewan, visited this school and reported very unfavourably on the plumbing system. He pointed out that in his opinion the whole plumbing system would have to be replaced.\n\nArrangements were made to have Mr. Buck, Architect of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, visit\nthis school and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his report.\n\nAs you will note, Mr. Buck's report indicates that the main building is in very bad condition and to place it in anything like satisfactory shape there would be required a much larger expenditure than that suggested by Mr. Buck. An amount of $3,000.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. Of this amount it has been found necessary to expend $65.00 for a new pump and consequently $2,935.00 is still available.\n\nOn two occasions the officials of this Branch have discussed with Mr. Buck the situation at Round Lake and after considering the matter from all angles it is felt that if it is decided to make any repairs we should confine our efforts to replacing the plumbing system only, at an approximate cost of $1,250.00, and leave the other repairs mentioned in Mr. Buck's report until more funds are available.\n\nThe other alternative is to close the school immediately.\n\nLast week Reverend Dr. Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, visited this Branch and the condition of the Round Lake School was fully discussed with him. He had recently been at Round Lake and he agreed that the school required very extensive repairs. He also admitted that it looked like a waste of money to spend any large sum on repairing it. Dr. Dorey expressed the opinion that a new residential school was absolutely required and that, due to the fact that the United Church population was scattered, it would not be feasible to operate one or more day schools. He felt, however, that the Department should make some endeavour to effect the most necessary repairs in order to obviate the necessity of closing the school.\n\nI hesitate to make any definite recommendation in this matter and submit the above for the decision of the Minister. If there is any other information that is required, I will endeavour to supply it.\n\nDirector.\nList of Material for Machine Shop 20 x 50\n\nBy Mr. Webb\n\nBroadview, Sask.\n\n21 1/2 cubic yards of concrete\n\n30 1/2 x 12 anchor bolts\n\n860 lin ft 2x4 plates\n\n140 pieces 2x4 9 ft wall studding\n\n32 = 2x8 6 ft first carpenter shop\n\n302 ft 1x8 shiplap floor\n\n1700 ft 1/2 x 6 level siding\n\n1575 ft 1x8 shiplap outside wall\n\n1800 = inside\n\n1100 = loft floor\n\n26 pieces 2x8 20 ceiling joists\n\n24 = 2x4 8 ft roof sheathing\n\n24 = 1x8 10 center ties\n\n52 2x4 14 rafters\n\n3400 1x8 shiplap roof boards\n\n240 m #1 shingles\n\n108 lin ft 1x6 edge boards\n\n4 1x6 10 corner boards shelving\n\n4 1x5 10\n6 Door frames\n6 Doors\n14 Window frames\n14 Windows\n34 ft carpenter's work bench 30\" wide\n40 ft masonry\n12 rolls tar paper\n114 ft chimney brick\n1 Coal oven forge\n2 Chimney flues\nflashing\n5 kgs of nails\n7 pairs of door hinges\n7 fasteners\n\nPaints for outside only; windows both side also done\n\n17 gal body paint\nModern roof\n\nAll labour, materials and boarding of workmen would put cost of this building at fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDr. Thos. Robertson;  \nInspector of Indian Agencies,  \nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson;\n\nAt long last I am going to put into writing a description of the type of building I feel would enable us to give the Indian boys under our supervision more adequate training in vocational work. Enclosed you will also find the contractor's estimate on costs, also a diagram of building.\n\nBuilding 20' X 50' divided into two rooms, carpenter shop 20' X 20' and a machine shop 20' X 30'. Underneath the outer wall there would be a cement foundation one foot high and one foot wide. The floor in the carpenter shop could be made from heavy two inch lumber while that in the machine shop would be made of cement except that portion just inside the big door which would be left without a floor to admit a tractor with lugs. This building could be covered on the outside, roof as well as walls, with corrugated sheet metal. Plenty of windows, two foot high that can slide up and down and be inserted in all four walls. Small sufficient light and the work benches could be installed underneath the windows. The building itself could be lined on the inside of the studding with shiplap and some type of insulating material could be used between the studding. Instead of a ceiling there could be placed a floor on top of the ceiling joist this would provide a place for seasoning lumber.\n\nDuring the months December to March inclusive local carpenters would be glad to accept steady indoor employment and a man could be hired to give the boys daily instruction in the repair of wagons and sleighs. The boys under his direction could in a heated workshop of this type repair all the furniture, make wagon tongues, neck yokes, whipple-trees. In fact all our repairs and necessities in wood-work could be handled there. What the school would save would hire the staff carpenter and the boys themselves would get the training. Besides all this we have our six hundred acre bush from which we could obtain our poplar lumber for the manufacture of home furnishings. Imagine what a difference it should make in the homes on the reserves if we could produce furniture, beds, cupboards, chairs, and tables well made and nicely painted at prices far below even the cost of second-hand furniture. Furthermore the boys would benefit by the training and the parents themselves would prize the furniture not alone for its usefulness but as a product made by their own boy.\n\nIn the heated machine shop every piece of machinery on the farm even to the engines could be gone over in the slack time during the Winter months. The boys could do all this under the direction of our mechanic. It would save us money as well as precious time in the Summer and the boys would learn how to repair and re-assemble the very things they are going to be working with when they leave school.\n\nThe cost of a building of this type should not be great. It will be little more than a shell in structure. The walls will only be nine feet high and no expensive lumber or materials will be required to complete its construction.\n\nAfter nine years experience among Indians in various parts of Canada I am convinced that the emphasis we are now placing upon vocational training in their education comes the nearest to anything yet attempted in preparing the graduates for life on the Reserve. In a former letter I stated that a boy or girl whose academic training ended at grade four yet was supplemented by a practical knowledge in the art of doing things stood better equipped for life as they would find it than he or she who had nothing more to show than a grade eight certificate. After all only about five percent of the graduates will ever be able to capitalize on a purely academic education. The others whether they like it or not will go back to the Reserves or to the neighboring towns and farms for the making of their livelihood. If we think we should be aware of this and seek to train them in useful arts. If we do this the graduate instead of feeling like one emerging from a sheltered cloister will know what he is better prepared to meet life than he could otherwise have been apart from the school.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 4)\nThe Indian Residential School in order to justify its existence must adjust itself to meet these new demands. This type of school was built originally to hasten the civilizing process and to isolate each new generation from the trachoma and tuberculosis infecting the old. The school has been a great factor in hastening this process and one might say that work is almost accomplished. The new character of this school is an advanced step. We are now faced with the task of making citizens and in preparing each boy and girl for the business of making a livelihood in a world entirely different from that which their fathers knew.\n\nIf we can face this task the Residential school will reveal it is only yet in its prime but if it fails then we might as well confess Old Age has overtaken us. Two things are needed however; Vision and the ability to see it realized. A principal is not worthy of his position if he lacks this first requirement. The Board of Directors are expected to supply the second. That rest with the Department. They have the ability to enable me to realize the type of building I have visioned for this school. If they will support me in the same fine spirit as in the past I feel sure they will have every reason to feel my visions do meet a real issue.\n\nTrusting that you are well and wishing you the very best throughout the New Year, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"A.

Dated July 6th, '40.\n\nYour letter regarding the prospects for a vocational training building was greatly appreciated. I note what you say with reference to the amount of repairs under consideration for this school and realize the folly of hoping for any extra should this work be undertaken.\n\nIt may seem rather a rash question but when would one know for certain the intention of the Department? Our school as you know is small and when crowded with the children it is difficult to accommodate more. I was wondering if there was any way this work could be undertaken, could be done before the children returned from their holidays. Considering the extent of repairs that may be carried out I feel certain that the workmen as well as the children would benefit by this work being done in the absence of the latter. In fact I know from our experience with workmen last Autumn that we would be unable to get down to any kind of routine until they took their departure.\n\nThanking you for your invitation to call and trusting you may get down our way in the near future, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

On receipt of your telegram we secured competitive prices and purchased a 3 H.P. I.H.C. High Speed engine but it was not at all suitable for the work and was returned. What is needed is a 57 H.P. self-oiling engine costing $346.08.\n\nThe engine is used generates the power, keeps up the water pressure and runs the laundry. The original engine was a 7 H.P. but the one now in use is a makeshift engine of several borrowed parts from other engines, to keep things going, when the other engines are needed the parts have to be put back.\n\nI regret the necessity of asking for the larger engine. At the time our letter was written the Rev. Principal thought that a new 3 H.P. engine would be sufficient and was anxious to avoid unnecessary expense to the Department. However when the 3 H.P. engine was installed it was quite evident that it could not generate electricity and keep up the water pressure at the same time, as a result it would not afford the necessary protection in case of fire.\n\nI would recommend for your consideration the larger engine. The above quotations include belts and pulleys costing $57.03, from the Fairbanks-Morse Co.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 7th, 1940.\n\nMr. W. J. D.

As you are aware, this work was only in addition to what was stated as necessary by our Architect in his report of May 3rd last in connection with the Residential Building. The original portion of this building, which houses the pupils and staff was erected in 1886 and enlarged in 1918 to its present size. In addition to the Residential Building there is a separate Classroom Building which was erected in 1925 and a Principal's Residence.\n\nWhile the authorized repairs were being carried out on the Residential Building, our engineer obtained data covering other work necessary on all three buildings. From this data the additional repairs required, together with estimated costs, have been summarized as follows:\n\nResidential Building\n\nNew fir floors for girls' dormitory and recreation rooms ......................... $350.00\n\nNew fir floor and repairs to plaster boys' recreation room ....................... 150.00\n\nRepairs to plaster and redecorating walls pupils' dining room .................... 50.00\n\nRepairs to V Joint ceiling and walls in laundry .................................. 50.00\n\nRepairs to floor joists, plastering repairs and whitewashing basement of original portion of building ...................... 100.00\n\nNew floor, new windows, repairs to plastering main floor, east wing, original portion of building ..................... $1,100.00\n\nRepairs to plastering male staff quarters original portion of building ........... $50.00\n\nContingencies and supervision .................. 150.00\n\nTotal estimated cost .................. $1,000.00\n\nJ.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDay School Building\n\nRepairs to roof ......................... $ 25.00\n\nPrincipal's Residence\n\nThis residence has no water supply or plumbing. The installation of these services, including 3 piece bath room, kitchen sink, range, hot water tank, stone septic tank with siphon, and field tile, all necessary piping valves and accessories is estimated to cost ........ $15.00\n\nContingencies and supervision .......... $5.00\n\nTotal estimated cost .................... $ 900.00\n\nSewage System\n\nRecent work at the school included the installation of new drainage tile to the septic tank inlet and a new drain diverting kitchen and laundry waste from passing through the septic tank. The existing drain from the junction with the new drain to the river consisting of 4\" field tile should be replaced with 6\" sewer tile. This item is estimated to cost approximately ....................... $25.00\n\nContingencies and supervision .......... $5.00\n\nTotal estimated cost .................... $ 250.00\n\nI may say that all of the above work will be necessary in the near future if the school is to be maintained in any degree of structural efficiency. You will note that the total estimated cost of the work involved amounts to $2,175.00.\n\nIt is understood that the Indian Affairs Branch gave consideration to abandonment of the school due to its age and depreciated condition, but that a decision was finally reached to have it remain in operation. Under the circumstances it is recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch be advised that the work listed above should be undertaken whenever the necessary funds can be made available in future years.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Buck, Architect for our Engineering and Construction Service, estimated that $3,400 would be required for certain necessary replacements and renovations in the above building.\n\nIn August last the Minister authorized plumbing repairs in the amount of $1,250. When the work was under way and various pipes were uncovered, it was found that an additional $550 was required, so that work to an approximate value of $1,800 was undertaken.\n\nWhile this work was under way, our Field Engineer obtained information on other work that would be necessary on the Residential Building as well as on the Day School Building and Principal's Residence. Attached herewith is a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, dated December 26, outlining the work necessary, with an estimated cost of $2,175, and suggesting that it be undertaken when funds are available.\n\nDirector.\nDecember 20, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Indian Round Lake Residential School,\nStockholm, Saskatchewan\n\nWith reference to alterations and repairs authorized to be carried out by this Service on the Residential Building at the above, I may say that the work was executed during October and November under the supervision of Engineer Snelson of our Banff office.\n\nAs you are aware the work included repairs and replacements to the plumbing and drainage system, the addition of a number of plumbing fixtures, and the installation complete of a male staff bathroom, which items were estimated to cost approximately $1,250.00.\n\nDuring operations Mr. Snelson uncovered additional defective plumbing and heating work, which involved an additional expenditure of $550.00.\n\nUpon completion of his duties at the school, Mr. Snelson reported under date of the 27th ultimo as follows:\n\n(a) All corroded and mutilated soil, vent, and water piping was replaced, new soil pipe and extra cleanouts were installed where required, vent pipes system was corrected, to comply with Provincial regulations.\n\n(b) Existing plumbing fixtures were repaired, one water closet and tank replaced, four new water closets installed, and missing fittings and accessories replaced on existing basins and bath tubs.\n\n(c) Complete new male staff bathroom was installed including plumbing fixtures, partitions with door and trim, radiator and sky light.\n\n(d) Kitchen and laundry waste was diverted from passing through the septic tank by means of new tile drain.\n\n(e) The steam heating plant was overhauled. Heating mains were cleaned and reconnected. Radiators were inspected, repaired and fitted with new valves and accessories, where necessary. A new smoke pipe was installed on the boiler. The jacket heater on the domestic hot water system was taken down, thoroughly cleaned, and reset.\n\n(f) Pressure tank and pump were disconnected, cleaned and reconnected.\n\n(g)------\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n(g) Cutting and patching was carried out in connection with the repairs and replacements.\n\nThe total cost involved in carrying out the work was approximately $1,800.00. As soon as all the accounts in connection with this project are received, a statement of the final cost will be forwarded for your information.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nJanuary 6, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nIn further reference to my memorandum of January 3, regarding plumbing and heating fixtures in the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Stockholm, Saskatchewan, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer, dated December 20, which contains a full report on the alterations and repairs to the plumbing and drainage system, made under the direction of Engineer Snelson during October and November last.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 8, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch with regard to additional work that should be done at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. You will understand, of course, that due to present conditions it is impossible for us to consider making these improvements immediately but they will receive further consideration as funds are available.\n\nSome of the matters requiring attention are:\n\n(a) New flooring, new windows, repairs to plastering main floor, east wing.\n\n(b) Repairs to plastering male staff quarters.\n\n(c) Repairs to roof of day school building.\n\n(d) Installation of new drainage tile to the septic tank inlet and a new drain diverting kitchen and laundry waste from passing through the septic tank.\n\nIf the Department supplied the material for the work mentioned above would it be possible for the school staff to do the necessary work without expense to the Department? As you are aware conditions are so unsatisfactory at the present time that it is impossible for me to state when funds will be available to provide both material and labour. If, however, the\n\nRev. A.C. Huston,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nschool could look after the labour it would be of considerable assistance and permit our using our funds for material only. The report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch also mentioned that there is no water supply or plumbing in the Principal's residence. Please let me know the approximate date of the erection of this building, also its general condition. Unless the building is in fairly good condition it is doubtful if it would be advisable to incur the very heavy expenditure that would be necessary to install modern plumbing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The estimated cost of this is $250.00.\n\nRegarding the condition of the road from the main highway to the school, it is obvious that the three miles should be gravelled, and this would cost possibly $3,000.00, allowing 1,000 cu. yds. per mile at $3.00 per cu. yd. However only two miles of this road are on the reserve, and if the Indian Affairs Branch can provide funds to improve their section, it is suggested that an effort be made to have the Province or Municipality undertake to gravel the remainder of the road.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWater is pumped by a windmill from a well 6' x 10' x 15 ft. deep located 100 feet north from the bank of the DuPage River where it flows out of Round Lake. The well is cobbled with plank and contained water to a depth of four feet on October 31st, 1940. The soil between the well and the waters of the lake is mostly sand and gravel. On the above date the surface of the water in the well was 0.5 feet higher than the water surface of the lake. The water surface of Round Lake is eight feet lower than the high water marks on the bridge, pointed out to me by an Indian who had lived in the vicinity for some fifteen years. The elevation of the lake is between two and three feet lower than it was three years ago.\n\nHowever, I would anticipate no shortage of water or work to be done on this intake system for many years to come, as undoubtedly the well receives seepage from the higher hills to the northward as well as from the lake.\n\nThere is also located in the pump-house a Myers pump connected to a new John Deere 1\u00bd H.P. gas engine. This is used when there is not enough wind to operate the windmill or to augment the windmill pump supply when necessary. The water is pumped from the well 400 feet through 1\u00bd\" galvanized pipe to a large concrete cistern under the basement floor of the boiler room. I was informed that this cistern would hold 5000 gallons.\n\nFrom this cistern the water is pumped directly into the two pressure tanks which have a combined capacity when entirely filled with water of (1000+500) 1500 gallons. The pump is a Fairbanks-Morse Typhon with a capacity of 2500 gallons per hour at 100 pounds per square inch pressure. It was new in 1920 and is in good condition. The pump is run by a belt from a 6 H.P. engine. As mentioned in an accompanying report, the water pipes from the pump to the services in the building were cleaned and are now in satisfactory condition. Each floor of the building has a fire hose and rack. All floors are well equipped with fire extinguishers. There is a fire alarm system in the building and a night watchman. I would consider the fire protection of this building as satisfactory. It is not anticipated that any further expenditures on the water system in this building will be necessary for some considerable time.\n\nPower is generated by a \"Standard\" Dynamo, volts 40, Amps. 25, Kilowatts 1.0, shunt wound, speed 500 R.P.M., Serial Number 151668. Built by Robbins and Myers of Springfield, Ohio, U.S.A. The Switchboard is Fairbanks-Morse. Fair condition. Switches in perfect working order. Insulation in good condition. Wiring throughout building; in fair condition but may need some occasional repairs. A new engine has just been purchased by the school to run this dynamo and also the pump but not both at the same time.\n\nThe sewage system as far as the outlet from the septic tank has just been relaid with new materials and may be considered as in excellent condition. There are now in place, 310 linear feet of 4\" field tile between the outlet of the septic tank and the river. This should be replaced with six inch sewer tile as soon as convenient. It will cost approximately $150.00 for tile and $90.00 for labour and engineering, say a total of $240.00.\nThe Round Lake School is located three miles westerly and up the Capelle valley from a junction with the main North and South Highway between Stochholm and Whitewood. This junction is approximately twelve miles south of Stochholm and fourteen miles north of Whitewood. The road from the junction to the school is clay and not gravelled. It is almost impassable in wet weather. The main highway is gravelled. A road winds southerly from the school buildings. The southern side of the valley is wooded, cottonwood, birch; the northern side is mostly bare.\n\nI enclose herewith forms M-40; S.M-1-40; W-1-40.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Engineer.\n\nBennet, Alberta,\nDecember 3rd, 1940.\n30th January, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated January 16th, attached to which is a copy of a report by Mr. Snelson, dated December 3rd, which are self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Snelson's recommendation that 310 feet of 4\" tile from the septic tank to the river should be replaced by 6\" sewer pipe, and that the work should be undertaken next summer, is concurred in.\n\nWith regard to the condition of the road from the main highway to the school, I would suggest that gravel be placed on the highway within the Reserve next summer if funds are available, and that the improvement of the portion of the highway outside the Reserve be taken up with the Province or Municipality.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your memorandum of January 30 enclosing copy of a report by Mr. Snelson on the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nAn endeavour will be made to provide funds for replacing the tile in the sewage disposal system but it will not be possible to consider expending the amount that you state would be necessary to repair the road from the main highway to the school.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to direct your attention to official letter of the 8th ultimo to which no reply has yet been received.

Huston,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nStockholm, Sask.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch in which they advise that when Mr. Snelson inspected the Round Lake School last fall he considered that the sewage disposal system, which now consists of 4\" field tile, should be replaced by 6\" sewer pipe. He estimates the cost of the material at approximately $160.00 and the labour at $90.00.\n\nPlease let me know at what season of the year you consider this work should be done.\n\nI am not yet certain what amount will be available in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1941-42 but it is hoped to be able to provide the funds for the work recommended by Mr. Snelson.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nmany thanks for your letter of enquiry dated January the eighth. The repairs listed under sections (A) and (D) are absolutely essential. Those under (B) and (C) are only minor. We will be glad to supply the labor if you can forward the materials. We have been asking year after year for the materials included under section (A). This has to do with the sewing room which under present conditions is hardly fit for domestic animals much less as a place where little children have to spend hour by hour.\n\nIn the recommendation of the Survey and Engineering Branch I note the suggestions for the principal's residence. Naturally I should fall hard for such prospects. Normally I would put the sight of so many old buildings with a thousand gaping sores make me feel ashamed to anticipate what relatively speaking would be a luxury. Mrs. Huston and I agreed that the pressing necessities must first be met and if sacrifice on our part will help toward that end we will count it a pleasure.\n\nYear after year we have tried to induce the department to give us the materials for a poultry house. Our desire was to provide every child in the school with an egg ration. Personally I fail to see anything wrong with an idea of that kind. We believed in it so thoroughly last summer that we produced the hens and got the walls for the house 20x40 erected. That was all we could afford so we put a straw roof on it. We have two or three buildings about the place with straw roofs, bye and bye our institution will present the appearance of a bohemian barnyard. You will have to read the sign at the entrance twice to make sure its a government institution. You see my point. When its bath tubs and running water versus properly shingled roofs give me the latter.\n\nWould it not be within reason and within the range of what may still be possible even in these difficult times for one to request a few shingles and some common lumber. We need ten thousand of shingles and three thousand of lumber to complete the poultry house. If you can grant us the materials we will provide the labor. Trusting I may hear from you. I remain, Yours sincerely,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our funds are extremely limited but I wrote to the Principal of the school and in reply he states that if the Department supplies the material the school management is prepared to provide the labour without cost to the Department.\n\nThe matters requiring particular attention are as follows:\n\n(a) New flooring, new windows, repairs to plastering main floor, east wing.\n\n(b) Installation of new drainage tile to the septic tank inlet and a new drain diverting kitchen and laundry waste from passing through the septic tank.\n\nWith regard to (a) please consult the Principal and forward, at the earliest possible date, complete details regarding the material that is required. You will understand that specific information must be supplied in order to permit our Purchasing Branch to secure the material at once so that its cost may be paid from the current year's appropriation.\n\nWith regard to (b) I wrote to you on the 3rd instant. I realize that it may not be possible to do this work at the present season of the year but the material could be bought now. Six inch sewer pipe is required and definite information should be supplied regarding the type of pipe needed.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should be aware of the Departmental regulations which require three copies of the account and also the certification of the Indian Agent.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the refills required for the fire extinguishers and have them recharged immediately.\n\nPlease let me know the number and size of the fire extinguishers at this school, also the number of additional ones which you think should be supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter no. 108-15 of the 15th ultimo, re work to be done at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to report that the following material is required.\n\n(a) 750 ft. no. 1 Flooring $87.55\nMaterial for making 2 rooms into one and making floor level 12.50\nnails for above 2.00\nnew windows are not necessary, but 6 new window sills and stools 3.80\nmaterial for repapering 130 sq. yd. 15.00\n15 bags of plaster and lime @ $1.00 $90.85\n\n(b) 110 ft. of 6\" Cast Iron Sewer Pipe from the school to the septic tank and 390 ft. of 6\" Fire Clay Sewer Pipe from the septic tank to the outlet. (See rough plan.)\n\n6\" Cast Iron Soil Pipe costs 90\u00a2 per foot and 6\" Fire Clay Sewer Pipe 46\u00a2 per foot F.O.B. Whitewood. A 6\" Clay Y Pipe is needed @ $1.70. It is proposed that the school staff perform this work in July when the children are on holidays.\n\nThe new drain diverting the kitchen and laundry waste from passing through the septic tank was installed last fall.\n\nWith regard to the hen house an estimate of the material required is enclosed at a cost of $150.00, the present building is cement walls, good windows with a straw roof. The roof suggested is a peak roof with ventilators at each end and two jacks in the roof to draw off the foul air. This work is all very much needed and should be done if possible in the near future.\n\nI trust that the above is the information that you require, but feel that the Surveys and Engineering branch would be in a position to say whether 110 feet of cast iron pipe is necessary from the school to the septic tank, there is a roadway over this part.\n\nYour Obedient servant,\n\nW.

Kerley,\nIndian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Wood Furnace at the Round Lake Day School.\n\nThe furnace in the Round Lake Day School is an old #416A Famous Magnet manufactured by the McClary Co., Winnipeg, Manitoba, with a 4' 6\" fire box. The fire box and the drums are all burnt out and is now beyond repair. This furnace has been patched up several times and has been unsatisfactory for several years. On real cold days last winter school had to be cancelled as the building could not be properly heated. A new furnace is urgently needed for the coming winter.\n\nThis item is in the 1941-42 estimates, would the Department purchase a new wood furnace with a 4' 6\" fire box to heat this building containing 19200 cubic feet, consisting of 2 classrooms and cloakrooms.\n\nThe labour for the installation would be about $20.00 plus any new material needed in connecting the present two hot and three cold air ducts. The nearest available tinsmith is Mr. F. Garland of Whitewood, Sask.\n\nIf possible this work should be done during the summer vacation, so that the school could be cleaned after the installation of the furnace. The school rooms were painted during the Easter vacation and are now black with the smoke from the old furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. J. D.

Also I have listed the cost of labor.\n\nThe labor listed does not include the cost of repairing plaster that might have to be removed.\n\nThe Principal has mentioned to me about the heavy voltage loss at his residence, and I find that the line used to carry the power is no. 10 which is too small a wire for such a distance and no. 4 would be required to reduce the voltage drop. However I am listing the cost to make this alteration if you think it should be altered.\n\nTrusting that you find the labor and material listed satisfactory, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Kendrick\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: File No. 108-1-5, October 30th 1941.\n\nWith reference to the above noted letter, I beg to forward herewith the estimate for material and labour received from Mr. A. Kendrick for the repairs at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, after he had consulted Mr. Carpenter, Inspector of The Saskatchewan Power Commission.\n\nThe total cost as listed is $207.15, the item of $78.60 for 1200 ft. of #4 wire leading to the Principal's Residence is not in Mr. Kendrick's opinion absolutely necessary or dangerous, but Mr. Huston requested him to include this, as though there is plenty of power generated at the school, the wires to the house being too small there is a heavy voltage loss, and the lighting not satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Indian Agent Kerley was instructed to consult Mr. Arthur R. Kendrick, Mariieval, Sask., with regard to the repairs that were necessary, and Mr. Kendrick has submitted a tender of $199.15 covering both material and labour.

Kendrick, Marieval, Sask., with reference to the electric light system at the Round Lake Residential School, Whitewood, Sask., in which he writes as follows:\n\n\"After making a final inspection of the Round Lake Indian School electric light system, I find that they have not got a cutout on the switch board, and any time the engine might stop when there is no attendant around, the batteries will discharge through the generator, running the generator as a motor. Not only does this prove harmful to the batteries due to the high rate of discharge, but also might injure the generator.\"\n\n\"It would cost $10.60 to install an automatic cutout with the proper type designed for that load.\"\n\nI am forwarding this information for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.D.

At the Round Lake School there is no Chapel and the present arrangement is to hold Church in the classrooms of the school, which are in a separate building from the main school building. To provide seating accommodation it is necessary to carry out benches that are used by the children in the dining room and the Principal was wondering whether our Branch would furnish him with collapsible chairs. He claims these would cost $2.25 each and could be piled up in the back end of the school during the week and set up to be used for Sunday Church Service. Mr. Huston wants 100 chairs, which would mean $225.00.\n\nIf our Branch will not agree to this Mr. Huston would like to know if he could be given a grant and he would take up a collection amongst the employees and donate something himself for the purpose of getting the chairs in question.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

I have the report of Inspector Auckland which states that the boiler is in very poor condition.

Mr. Huston has written us and is very anxious that these should be replaced as should further trouble develop the school would be without heating facilities. This boiler has been giving trouble the last few years, several sections have been replaced but still it is giving trouble. I am enclosing quotation on a new boiler from the North-West Foundry Co., Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., which Mr. Huston forwarded with his letter.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI attach copy of a letter from Indian Agent Kerley, also a copy of letter from the Gurney North-West Foundry Company, with reference to the Round Lake Residential School.\n\nNo provision for a new boiler at this school was made in the current year's appropriation, nor was any request for a new boiler contained in the estimates forwarded by Indian Agent Kerley for the fiscal year 1943-44. You will, therefore, appreciate that it is impossible for the Department, at the present time, to give favourable consideration to this request.\n\nIn addition, it would take months to secure a new boiler and possibly, due to present conditions, it would not be possible to do so. I should, therefore, appreciate your discussing the matter fully with the Agent and the Principal of the Round Lake School at the first opportunity, with a view to ascertaining if the present boiler could be repaired in such a manner as to make it last for the duration of the war.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 108-1-5 of the 8th instant regarding the boiler in the Round Lake School, Crooked Lake Agency.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of this I got in touch with Mr. Huston, the Principal, and I am herewith quoting his letter in part:\n\n\"Last Autumn we had to repair one. This will give you an idea what was involved. It was a centre section. All other sections from the front to that one had to be removed before the one needing repair could be taken out. When each weighs about one thousand pounds it is easy to see it was no little task. Then we had to get the broken one out of the cellar, up a narrow staircase, load it on a truck, take it to Rocanville a distance of sixty miles, return for it in four days time, put it back in the furnace, replace and connect the other sections and then reputty the whole exterior of the furnace with asbestos cement. The repair job cost $26.00 and involved travelling a total mileage of 240 miles with a truck. Then a short time after all this the same section cracked again but in another place. If a break should occur in the Winter with roads blocked we could not use our truck as we did last Autumn. Anyway mileage restrictions would prohibit us going with the truck to the only man within a reasonable radius.\"\n\nMr. Huston also makes a good suggestion that when the school closes for summer holidays we send an experienced furnace man to check over the boiler and bring about any repairs that may be needed in order to make it last for another year if possible.\n\nYou will understand the reason the Principal did not place this in the Estimates. It was impossible for him to see from the outside whether there was anything wrong with the boiler or not and it was not until fires were put on in the Fall that the section in question cracked.\n\nThe Chief Inspector of Steam Boilers, and I believe you have a copy of his report, had the following to say:\n\n\"I am in receipt of your letter of the 13th, regarding the condition of the heating boilers...........\"\n\"condition of the heating boilers at the Round Lake Indian Residential School. I have the report of Inspector Auckland, which states that the boiler is in very poor condition. Two sections are cracked and leaking and there is likely to be trouble with others due to accumulation of scale. I note that one section has been welded, but that it has cracked again.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Inspector that a new boiler is necessary.\"\n\nI would therefore suggest that if this boiler lasts out through the Winter an experienced man be sent there next Summer and you people can either make the arrangements there or I will endeavour to get the nearest man available to the school. I quite realize that we would have to wait a long time for the boiler and the only thing is to try to repair it so that it will last for the duration. The Principal states the way the roads are now if there was a break in the boiler the only solution would be to send the children home. However, we hope this can be avoided.\n\nM.

This washer embodies mechanical features and workmanship found in no other washer of this class.\n\nTo obtain its highest efficiency, certain important instructions should be followed to insure proper installation, operation and maintenance.\n\nRead and carefully follow the instructions contained in this bulletin and preserve it for future reference.\n\nPrior to shipment each Globe Washer is completely assembled and tested under power for a given period, which assures that the machine is in perfect condition when it leaves the factory.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n1.\u2014The washer, as received by you, requires no assembling except in the larger diameter belted motor types; the machine is then shipped with the top shaft and supporting brackets removed and must be reassembled.\n\n2.\u2014Gutter.\u2014The washer is usually placed over a gutter. When a gutter cannot be provided the washer may be set on a substantial concrete floor. A curb at least four inches high around the machine should be provided to direct the water to the drain connection.\n\n3.\u2014Concrete Floor.\u2014Should be provided to withstand the weight of the machine fully loaded, which is approximately 125 pounds per square foot, based on the overall floor space occupied by the washer.\n\n4.\u2014Piping.\u2014The piping required for each size of Globe Washer is specified in the table. When connections are being made, care should be taken not to strain or spring any of the pipes located on the washer.\n\n5.\u2014Dimensions.\n\n| WOOD CASE | FLOOR SPACE | SHIPPING WEIGHT |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|\n|           | End Header  | Elevated Header| Belted Motor Drive|\n| Size of   | Width       | Length        | Height       | Width       | Length        | Height       | End Header | Elev.

A leveling lug is provided on each foot and the machine should be leveled at each end. Lengthwise level is determined by placing a spirit level on the intermediate driving shaft. Where necessary, sheet metal shims may be placed under the feet of the machine until it can be used to obtain level. Improper alignment may cause broken gears, undue strain and noisy operation.\n\nWashers having a center leg may be leveled in the same manner as described above with this exception, that before leveling, the cap is removed from the center bearing and the center leg is shimmed up so that the bearing fits the shaft properly. The leg is then leveled transversally; the usual grouting process is completed and the bearing cap replaced.\n\nBy using the above method, care being taken that the center bearing fits the shaft and that the shaft is not drawn out of level by the bearing, a quiet running machine is assured.\n\nPlate No. 1\nThe American Globe Wood Washer\nBelted Motor Drive\n### WOOD CASE\n\n#### INNER CYLINDER\n\n| Size of Washer | Compartments | Vertical Partitions | Cylinder Doors | Tub Doors | Gearing | Diameter (In.) | Speed End Header (r.p.m.) | Speed Elev.

The line shaft pulley should be straight face, of correct diameter and width.\n\n**Drive Shaft Pulley.** In addition to having the washer set perfectly level, it is also essential that the pulleys on the belt-driven machines are parallel with the line shaft.\n\nIf otherwise the belts will not shift properly. This will eventually cause the belts to wear and be reduced in width, resulting in improper timing of the shifter, which if not corrected, will cause the clothes being washed, to become tangled and torn.\n\nTo determine the diameter of the pulley to be placed on the line shaft to operate header pulleys at speed indicated, proceed as follows:\n\n(a) Multiply the diameter (in inches) of the header pulleys by the number of revolutions stamped on one of them.\n\n(b) Divide this product by the number of revolutions per minute of the line shaft and the results will be the correct diameter of the pulley to operate the pulleys on the machine at their rated speed. If this answer is an odd size in pulleys use the next lower pulley size.\n\n**Example**\u2014Pulley required to operate a 36-inch Globe Washer elevated header when line shaft rotates at 200 r. p. m.\n\n\\[ \\text{16 inches (diameter of pulley on header)} \\times 210 \\text{ r. p. m.

(r. p. m. of line shaft)} = 16.8 \\text{ inches}. \\]\n\nCorrect diameter pulley to use on line shaft, 16-inch diameter.\n\nThe worm of the reversing header is driven by one of the loose pulleys known as the worm pulley. This pulley must operate continuously in the direction of the arrow stamped on it. The belt which drives the worm pulley must, therefore, be wide enough so that when it is shifted over to the tight pulley on the header, it is still sufficiently lapped over the loose worm pulley to drive it. This belt is therefore 1/4-inch wider than the other, and its location on the header may be determined by the size of the loops of the belt sifter. In crossing one of the belts for the reverse drive of the cylinder, be sure not to change the direction of rotation of the worm pulley from that indicated by the arrow stamped on its face.\n\n8. **Gear Lock.** For holding the cylinder door opening in a safe and secure position while loading and unloading, a gear lock is furnished on all machines.\n\nOn machines under 64 inches in length, this device is equipped with an eccentric lock which by means of a lever may be brought in mesh with main gear when machine comes to a stop.\n\n---\n\nPlate No. 2\n\nThe American Globe Wood Washer\n\nEnd Header\nGear Lock and Spotting.\u2014Machines 64 inches in length and longer are equipped with a Hand Wheel Worm Gear Lock. This device is equipped with a worm, which may be lowered into mesh with the main gear after the machine comes to a dead stop, by means of a lever. This spotting is accomplished by turning the hand-wheel to right or left, bringing the cylinder door to the proper position.\n\n9.

Terminals, properly tagged, are provided for connection of the service leads.\n\nA wiring diagram is provided, being pasted inside the enclosing case of the control switch.\n\nOPERATION\n\n1. After the machine has been set up and piping connected, lubricate it thoroughly according to instructions given in paragraph on lubrication. The machine is now ready for operation. Before starting, however, familiarize yourself with the following features:\n\n2. Belt Shifter.\u2014By means of a weighted lever attached to the shifter slide on the header, the belts may be shifted from the tight to the loose pulleys. On the elevated header and belted motor driven type washers an extension on this weighted lever is provided to bring the control within reach of the operator.\n\nTo start the cylinder:\n(a) Be sure the gear lock, or on larger machines the worm lock, for main gear is released.\n(b) Be sure the cylinder doors are closed and the door latches have entered the pockets provided for them.\n(c) Throw the weighted lever forward until it engages with the cam bracket. As the cam bracket moves to the right or left the weighted lever will engage with the slot in the cam bracket and one of the belts will be shifted to the drive pulley.\n\nTo stop the machine:\n(a) Throw the weighted lever backward and at the same time move it toward the slot in the stop for slide. This disengages the cam and shifts the belts to the loose pulleys.\n(b) To spot the cylinder the belts may be slowly shifted on and off the tight pulley until the cylinder door is in proper position for unloading.\n(c) Always lock the main gear when loading or unloading the washer and when the machine is idle.\n\nThe motor on belted motor drive is controlled by a switch located on the machine. The motor should be stopped when the machine is idle for any length of time, but not between loads.\n\n3. Cleaning.\u2014The inside cylinder and case should be cleaned before being placed in regular operation. This is to remove any foreign matter which may have collected on the staves of the cylinder or case and also to take up leaks due to the drying of the wood.\n\nThe following method of cleaning is suggested:\n(a) Loosen all hoops on outside case before any water has been admitted to the case. This will prevent many broken hoop lugs and bulged cases.\n(b) Fill the case with cold water until six inches shows in water gauge glass. Run machine for five minutes and discharge.\n(c) Fill with the same amount of hot or cold water as before, add several pounds of a good washing compound, turn on steam until water is brought to a boil, allow to run for fifteen minutes and discharge.\n(d) Again fill the machine to the same height, heating water as before and run for five minutes. Discharge and fill with cold water, run for five minutes and discharge.\n(e) Draw hoops tight and machine is ready for operation.\n\n4. Load.\u2014The maximum load of dry laundry work should not exceed the number of pounds for the various sizes as follows:\n\n| Size       | Pounds | Size       | Pounds |\n|------------|--------|------------|--------|\n| 30 x 30\"   | 35     | 36 x 72\"   | 135    |\n| 30 x 36\"   | 40     | 36 x 84\"   | 160    |\n| 30 x 48\"   | 55     | 36 x 96\"   | 185    |\n| 30 x 54\"   | 60     | 40 x 54\"   | 125    |\n| 36 x 36\"   | 70     | 40 x 64\"   | 145    |\n| 36 x 48\"   | 90     | 40 x 72\"   | 160    |\n| 36 x 54\"   | 100    | 40 x 84\"   | 185    |\n| 36 x 64\"   | 120    | 40 x 96\"   | 210    |\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMAINTENANCE\n\n1.\u2014To properly maintain the Globe Washer, the machine should be carefully inspected at least once every two weeks.\n\n(a)\u2014A level should be placed over the leveling lugs to determine if the machine is still in true alignment, as it frequently happens that a foundation will settle and in this way throw the machine out of line. If the machine is found to be out of level the alignment should be corrected in the same manner as when being installed.\n\n(b)\u2014All loose bolts and screws should be tightened.\n\n(c)\u2014All bearings should be properly lubricated. (See paragraph on Lubrication.)\n\n2.\u2014Belted Motor Driven Washer.\u2014Before starting the washer inspect the oiling devices of the motor. Two oil reservoirs are provided, one near each end of the motor shaft. Be sure that the oil ring of the ring oiled motor bearings rides on the motor shaft, and that this ring turns when the motor is running. Use a good grade of medium motor oil, filling the oil reservoir to its proper level when motor is not running.\n\nAfter the motor has been in operation for one week it is recommended that the drainage plugs located at the bottom of each motor bearing oil reservoir be removed and old oil drained off. Replace the drainage plugs, sealing them in place with red lead or shellac to prevent leakage and refill the reservoir with fresh oil. Keep the oil reservoirs well supplied with oil at all times.\n\nShould the motor bearings become badly worn, replace them promptly to avoid damaging the rotor, armature or field coils of the motor.\n\nKeep an extra set of motor bearings on hand.\n\nCylinder bearings, drive and intermediate shaft bearings and all other points on the washer should be lubricated as described in the following paragraphs.\n\nKeep all bearings clean and well lubricated at all times.\n\n3.\u2014Motor Temperature.\u2014The motor on the motor driven type performs, as regards to the temperature rise, in accordance with the fundamental physical law, viz.: When one form of energy is transferred into another, the resultants are first, motion; second, heat.\n\nThe motors applied to Globe Washers operate with safety at a temperature rise up to 40\u00b0 Centigrade or 72\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Therefore, if the heating limit is in question, measure the temperature rise before assuming that the motor is running at an excessive temperature. This may be obtained by the following method:\n\nFirst \u2014Use either a Fahrenheit or Centigrade thermometer.\n\nSecond \u2014Read the temperature of the room.\n\nThird \u2014Place the bulb of thermometer on the laminations of the Alternating Current motor or the Commutator of the Direct Current motor and hold until the maximum temperature is reached.\n\nFourth \u2014Subtract the two readings and the result is the temperature rise of motor.\n\nExample\u2014Motor Lamination or Commutator Temperature. 176\u00b0F = 80\u00b0C\n\nTemperature of room 104\u00b0F = 40\u00b0C\n\nTemperature rise of motor 72\u00b0F or 40\u00b0C\n\nLUBRICATION\n\n1.\u2014Clean the machine thoroughly before lubricating, making sure that no oil holes or grease cups have become clogged.\n\nOil reservoirs or grease cups are provided for all drive shafts and cylinder bearings and should be filled regularly with the proper lubricant.\n\nKEEP ALL DRIVING GEARS WELL LUBRICATED.\n\n2.\u2014Header.\u2014The loose pulleys are lubricated by grease cups mounted on their hubs. A drive shaft bearing located outside of the header requires frequent lubrication. Keep all bearings of the belt shifting mechanism well lubricated. The worm and worm wheel should be well lubricated.\n3.\u2014Lubricants.\u2014The following lubricants, or their equivalents are recommended:\n\nDrive and Intermediate Shaft Bearings, Cylinder Bearings and all Oil Holes:\n- Gargoyle D. T. E. Heavy Oil\n- Polarine Heavy Oil\n\nVacuum Oil Company,\nStandard Oil Company.\n\nGears, Worm and Worm Wheel:\n- Standard Gear Shield Grease\n\nStandard Oil Company.\n\nGrease Cups:\n- Arctic Grease No. 4\n- Voco Grease AA No. 4\n\nStandard Oil Company,\nVacuum Oil Company.\n\nMotor Bearings:\n- Gargoyle D. T. E. Light\n- Renown Engine Oil\n\nVacuum Oil Company,\nStandard Oil Company.\n\nSUPERVISION\n\nThe Globe Washer, though low in price, is of rugged construction and is the result of years of experience in washer manufacture.\n\nIn its simple design are found the essential factors necessary to give efficiency and long life. The safety of the load and the operator has had careful consideration.\n\nNo machine will take care of itself indefinitely. It is, therefore, suggested that regular inspection of the washer be made at frequent intervals, and that after the washer has been installed this bulletin be handed to a responsible employee charged with the maintenance, proper operation and lubrication of the washer.\n\nPlate No. 3\nThe American Globe Metal Case Washer\nBelted Motor Drive\nKEEPING AN EQUIPMENT RECORD\u2014A SUGGESTION\n\nOne of the most important factors in the successful operation of any business is an accurate record of the equipment. In case of fire, such a record would give a complete and accurate inventory of the entire equipment and enable the laundryowner to obtain an equitable settlement of his insurance claims. Without it, the statement of equipment loss would only be an estimate and the loss would not be fully covered.\n\nA record of this kind need not be expensive\u2014a simple effective system can be installed at a negligible cost. The first step would be the assigning of an equipment number for each machine. This number should appear on the machine in the form of a metal tag or plate and be securely fastened to the machine. A standard 4 x 6\" Card drawer with cards similar to the one illustrated on Plate No. 4, would be sufficient to take care of this system. Each card should carry the equipment number, name of machine, serial number of machine, original cost (which should include freight, drayage and labor incidental to its installation).\n\nAs repair parts are ordered for the machine, they should be charged against the machine under \"Maintenance,\" and a full copy of the invoice, including the part number, should be entered on the card. The American Laundry Machinery Company's invoices always show part numbers which are extremely valuable to the laundryowner in that he can order repairs understandingly and in that way obtain prompt service.\n\nOne of the many advantages of keeping such records is that the cost of maintaining each piece of equipment may be ascertained at a glance.\n\nAs we all know, there is a point where the cost of repairs (including the time the machine is shut down awaiting such repairs) is such that it is more economical to discard the machine and replace it with a new one and this card will enable the laundryowner to tell quickly and accurately when this time arrives.\n\nFor the convenience of the laundryowner who feels that the number of machines in his plant does not warrant the starting of a card system, we are incorporating on this page a full size 4 x 6\" card on which the person in charge of repairs can enter same and then the entire bulletin can be filed as a record. This has the advantage of having all information regarding maintenance and repairs in one place.\n\n| NAME OF MACHINE | EQUIPMENT NUMBER | SERIAL NUMBER | SIZE | DATE PURCHASED | COST (INCLUDING FREIGHT, DRAYAGE AND INSTALLATION) $ |\n|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| PART NO.        | DATE             | COST          | PART NO. | DATE | COST |\n\nPlate No. 4\nEquipment Record Card\nWHEN ORDERING REPAIR PARTS ALWAYS SPECIFY:\n\nFirst \u2014 How to ship\u2014Express, parcel post or freight.\n\nSecond \u2014 Quantity of parts required.\n\nThird \u2014 The number of parts wanted as shown on repair parts plate.\n\nFourth \u2014 Always give Bulletin number, i.e. Bulletin No. 7-B.\n\nFifth \u2014 The name of part wanted as given in Index and description of repair parts.\n\nSixth \u2014 Length and diameter of inner cylinder.\n\nSeventh \u2014 Type of washer as shown by illustrations on preceding pages, viz.: Belted Motor Driven, Belt Driven Elevated Header or End Header.\n\nEighth \u2014 Complete serial number on name-plate on machine for which repair parts are wanted.\n\nNinth \u2014 When ordering gears give diameter, number of teeth, width of face and bore. When ordering pulleys give diameter, width of face and bore.\n\nExample of proper wording of repair Order:\n\nShip by Express: One Repair part No. 37, Bulletin No. 7-B, wide Belt Loop for 36 x 54\" American Globe Washer, Belt Driven End Header, Serial No. 1215\u00bd-M-0000.\n\nShould the part required have a number cast or stamped on it, give this number in addition to the above. Too much information cannot be given and it may aid in filling the order promptly.\n\nINDEX AND DESCRIPTION OF REPAIR PARTS\n\nDRAWING ON PRECEDING PAGE\n\n| Repair Number | Name of Part                                      |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 1             | Frame for Elevated Drive (state right or left).   |\n| 2             | Trunnion Bearing, Elevated Drive.                 |\n| 3             | Cylinder Gear.                                    |\n| 4             | Shifter Rod Supporting Bracket.                   |\n| 5             | Shifter Rod Pivot Head.                          |\n| 6             | Shifter Rod Pivot Head.                          |\n| 7             | Cylinder Gear Cover (state right or left).       |\n| 8             | Intermediate Gear Cover (state right or left).    |\n| 9             | Intermediate Shaft.                              |\n| 10            | Intermediate Shaft Cap.                          |\n| 11            | Intermediate Gear.                               |\n| 12            | Drive Pinion.                                     |\n| 13            | Drive Shaft (Elevated Header).                    |\n| 14            | Drive Shaft Cap.                                 |\n| 15            | Drive Shaft Pinning.                             |\n| 16            | Shifter Rod for Header.                          |\n| 17            | Shifter Block.                                   |\n| 18            | Shifter Slide.                                   |\n| 19            | Slide Cap\u2014Left Hand.                            |\n| 20            | Stop for Slider.                                 |\n| 21            | Strap for Cam Bracket.                           |\n| 22            | Lever Ball\u2014End Drive.                            |\n| 23            | Slide Cap\u2014Right Hand.                            |\n| 24            | Cam Bracket.                                     |\n| 25            | Pad for Cam Bracket.                             |\n| 26            | Worm Gear.                                       |\n| 27            | Shifter Bracket or Frame.                        |\n| 28            | Worm.                                            |\n| 29            | Worm Gear Pin.                                   |\n| 30            | Tight Pulley.                                    |\n| 31            | Tight Pulley.                                    |\n| 32            | Clutch Pulley.                                   |\n| 33            | Front Cap for Pulley Bracket.                    |\n| 34            | Pulley Bracket.                                  |\n| 35            | Rear Cap for Pulley Bracket.                     |\n| 36            | Narrow Belt Loop.                                |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Otherwise it will involve heavy expense in shipping the machine to the factory.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention that a letter was written from this office, our File No. 304-11 A.U., on the 4th instant in connection with the washing machine at the Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI am surprised that we have not heard from you by this time. I have a letter from Mr. Huston, the Principal, this morning, and by the tone of his letter he is about ready to throw up his hands and I do not blame him. You can imagine what it is to be short handed and have between children and staff somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 people, and all of the washing having to be done by hand. Also, Mr. Huston informs me last week the jacket heater at the school cracked. This heater heated the water for washing and bathing purposes, in fact it heated all of the hot water for the school. Mr. Huston drove about 200 miles to different towns trying to get the crack in the heater welded but was unsuccessful.\n\nI can assure you the situation is bad when they have neither hot water at the school with the exception of what can be heated on the stove, nor a washing machine, causing everything to be done by hand, and as Mr. Huston will be coming to the city this coming week I telephoned some of the firms here. We can procure a heater and I would like to have authority for this.\n\nI would also like to know what is going to be done about the washing machines. If you were to ask me I would get all of the children out of the school and then put dynamite under it because it has been nothing but a bill of expense from beginning to end. However, you are not asking my advice on the matter so I do not suppose it will be blown up.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, May 24, 1943.\n\nMr. M. Christianson, General Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nRe: Washing machine,\nRound Lake Residential School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 22, in which you express surprise that you have not received information with respect to the purchase or repair of the marginally noted washing machine.\n\nThe records here indicate that this matter was first brought to the attention of the Department in a letter dated Regina, May 4 and signed by John Reichman. This letter reached the Records office on May 7 and the Training Division on May 8. On May 10 we communicated with Mr. E. A. Guillaume, of the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company, Limited, Toronto, in an attempt to discover if machines of this type were available or if repairs to the machine now in operation could be undertaken. In order to avoid delay, however, a requisition for a new machine was sent forward to the Purchasing Agent. The Chief of the Training Division informed you, in a letter of May 21, that parts for this machine could be secured at a cost of $151.00. You will note, therefore, that despite the limited staff at our disposal here, this matter was handled promptly and certainly in a way that should not give rise to surprise on your part.\n\nWe are sorry to note that you have not indicated the size or the approximate cost of the new heater that may be required at this school. As your letter seems to indicate, however, that an emergency exists, you are authorized to secure a heater, if a heater of the type required is available.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sirs:\n\nI wish to inform you that we have an Indian Boarding School down at Round Lake which is 17 miles north of Whitewood. The power washing machine there is an antiquated one that had been furnished a few years ago by some firm in Montreal and is beyond repair. Therefore you can imagine what state the School is in where there are 100 people in residence.\n\nWe have a 7 h.p. gasoline engine which provides the power for the washing machine, and I would like to know what one of your washing machines that would be suitable would cost. Also, would the 7 h.p. engine be sufficient to run it in the event we purchased one of your machines.\n\nThis, of course, has to be submitted to our Branch at Ottawa first but I thought I had better try to get all of the information I possibly could.\n\nYou will get this letter in the morning and I wish you would write to me, giving any information you might have as I want to receive your reply by Saturday morning without fail. If you can do this it would be very much appreciated.\n\nI might say that Mr. Brock was in here to see me two or three months ago.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nMessrs. Stanley Brock Limited,\nLaundry Machinery,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRegarding the washing machine at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, upon receipt of your letter No. 108-1-5 of the 21st instant, I immediately got in touch with the Principal, Mr. Huston. Mr. Huston then got in touch with Mr. Kerley and asked him to take Mr. Webb, of the firm of Webb and Wellbelove, Broadview, down to the school to ascertain if it would be possible to repair the machine or not, promising to pay Mr. Webb for his time.\n\nMr. Huston was in the office here the day before yesterday and advised me Mr. Webb had told him the matter of repairing the washing machine is absolutely hopeless and since Mr. Webb is a practical man and a good carpenter and mechanic I think we can pretty well take his advice.\n\nAfter hearing the above I got in touch with Stanley Brock Limited, of Winnipeg, and I am herewith attaching copy of my letter to them and also their reply. You will note that the machines they have in mind can be purchased for $325.00 and I would think that this is the only solution. Therefore, if possible, I would ask that an order be placed for the machine in question unless our Branch has something better to suggest.\n\nI am also attaching pamphlet illustrating the Canadian Globe Wood Washer sent to me by Stanley Brock and Company of Winnipeg.

I have already made arrangements with the Regina Plumbing & Heating Company to send a good experienced man down there on Monday morning to examine the heating plant.\n\nI hope that we will be able to repair it, but I am just doubtful. One of the difficulties there is that they use terribly hard water and the pipes corrode in a short time, and in all probability there are sections of this boiler that are corroded so badly that no water is passing through them at all. However, I have told Mr. Robertson, the Manager of this firm, that we want this plant to be fixed if at all possible. We will know in a few days and I shall advise you immediately.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nLast winter I had a letter from the School Branch asking me to have the furnace at the Round Lake Indian Residential School repaired during the summer time.\n\nLast week I visited this institution and I wrote you on the 18th instant. I will admit that I am not a furnace man; however, I was anxious to see it before we took any steps to have it repaired, and that is one reason that I called at the school. As I advised you in my letter of the 18th instant, I had arranged with the Regina Plumbing & Heating Limited to send an experienced man down there to have a look at the boiler, and I am herewith attaching his report. I had a talk with Mr. Robertson before sending the man down and told him how anxious you were to have this boiler repaired instead of replaced. I also had a talk with Mr. Robertson and the man that he sent down there. They came over to the office just as I was leaving for Kamsack last Tuesday. You will note from Mr. Robertson's letter, which is attached herewith, that he does not recommend spending any money on this boiler, because in all probability it would go out of commission during the coming winter and leave the school without any heat. I saw the boiler myself and everything they say about it is correct; in fact it is in terrible shape.\n\nAs soon as I get the bill from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited for sending a man down there it will also be forwarded, and the next thing is what is to be done to replace this furnace.\n\nM.

We thought we would wait a rainy day before we would call the men from the hay for such a task as removing the old washer and installing the new.\n\nMr. Kerley was here to-day with the Auditor and we undertook to investigate the washer and to tell you truthfully it is not what one might expect for $525.00. The mechanical part of course is newly painted and its difficult to determine its condition until it is in operation for awhile. The wooden sections are constructed mainly of fir lumber with the addition of four or five pieces of hardwood. Mr. Webb of Broadview when called to give an estimate on costs about two months ago suggest Cyprus as the ideal lumber for the job but doubted if such could be procured under existing circumstance.\n\nThe workmanship with the lumber used had certainly not been the best. Indeed I would say it lacked what you would expect to find from the hand of an experienced and particular workman. The washer is smaller than our former one. Indeed I would say that one should be able to secure its like in the neighbourhood of two hundred and fifty dollars.\n\nNow of course we have to place all this criticism over against the fact of war. We have to have a washer. The war is on. It is impossible to get a new one and what can we do about it. There seems to be no alternative. However I do feel that it would not hurt to bring all this to the notice of the company. They will soon be looking about for post-war business and I would say that unless they have a monopoly of the washer business that they are putting themselves in the way of losing business. You could consult Mr. Kerley as to his opinion and I will let the washer stand until I hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 5)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am herewith forwarding a letter received from Mr. A.G. Huston, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, Whitewood. I have not the time to make a copy.\n\nThis letter speaks for itself and you will note Mr. Huston does not think very much of the new tumbler for the washing machine that he has received from The Stanley Brock Limited Company.\n\nM.

Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant,\nenclosing letter received from Mr. Huston regarding\nthe reconditioned washer recently forwarded to the\nRound Lake Residential School.\n\nIt is rather interesting to note that, in\nspite of the complaints we had received regarding\nour delay in supplying this machine, the school\napparently on July 15 had not yet put it in use.\n\nAs far as Mr. Huston's comments regarding\nthe machine are concerned, we go back again to the\nrequest for immediate delivery. It would be impossible\nto get a new machine for four or five months. The\nreconditioned one that we supplied could be obtained\nimmediately and carries the same one-year guarantee\nregarding any defective part as a new machine.\nBesides, Mr. Huston is slightly out on the cost of\nthe machine, as it was only $475.00, not $525.00.\n\nI trust that when the school management\nhas this machine installed it will give satisfaction.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am herewith forwarding copy of a letter received from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited, Regina, Saskatchewan. This is a quotation on a heating plant for the Round Lake Indian Residential School and you will note the price quoted is $2,050.00.\n\nYou will further note they state: \"It is understood that the Department will transport our material and equipment from Whitewood to school.\" I told this company that the school had a truck and no doubt would transport their things from the station to Whitewood and return free of charge.\n\nIn my opinion the above quotation is a very high price. Of course it is not right for me to say this without explaining that probably the price is alright the way things are situated at the present time. However, I wish to draw to your attention a letter received from The Gurney North West Foundry Company Limited, of 80 Lombard Avenue E., Winnipeg, Manitoba, by Mr. Huston, quoting $1167.00 on one heating plant and $1307.00 on another. In their quotation this company say nothing about installation so the prices quoted by the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company might be alright for all I know. They are reputed to be a reliable firm here in the city.\n\nThis is all the information I can give you on the matter.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa,\nJuly 27, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. M. Christianson, Gen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Scarth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing quotation from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited on a heating plant for the Round Lake Residential School. As you state in your letter, the price appears very high and, incidentally, the equipment on which they are quoting has an approximate shipping weight of 10,050 lbs. It would be appreciated if you would forward us the quotation that the Principal has received from the Gurney North West Foundry Company Limited, Winnipeg. I presume that this quotation gives definite information regarding the type of equipment on which their quotation is based.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRegina, July 29th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 108-1-5 of the 27th instant regarding the quotation from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company Limited.\n\nMr. Huston, the Principal of the Round Lake School, was in the office here today and I am attaching herewith copy of a letter he received from the Gurney North-West Foundary Company Limited, 80 Lombard Ave., E., Winnipeg. He informed me this was the only quotation that he had received in this connection.\n\nYou will realize that the Gurney North-West Foundary Company are only quoting on this steam boiler F.O.B. Winnipeg whereas the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company quoted on the installation and everything. Also, I have just learned that the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company are the only ones here on the Approved List. I called up the proper authorities to get this information yesterday.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 108-1-5 of the 26th instant regarding Mr. Huston's remarks in connection with the washing machine at the school.\n\nIn reply I might say I talked this matter over with him when he was in the office this afternoon and the reason the machine was not installed was that it did not arrive there until July 15th and the children are all away. In addition to this they are busy putting up hay. However, the first rainy day that comes along they are going to install the washing machine and send the other one to Winnipeg, so everything in that line is O.K.\n\nYou will be receiving a letter in a day or so regarding today's request from Mr. Huston.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\nExtract from letter dated July 29, 1943, received from Globelite Batteries Limited, 146 Alexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nOur Regina representative has recently completed an inspection trip to several Indian residential schools and agencies in Saskatchewan and reports to us as follows:\n\nRound Lake Indian Residential School\n\nBattery worn out and would recommend immediate replacement. Present battery is 16 cell, 32 volt Globelite type W15 installed August 1939. The load at this school is far too heavy for a 32 volt plant and should be replaced with 110 volt plant. Would suggest that if another 32 volt battery is purchased, the department install at least a Globelite type W21 of 450 ampere hours.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that Mr. A.C. Huston, Principal of the Round Lake Indian Residential School, was in the office yesterday. He informed me the batteries at the school were out of commission and that he had previously been in touch with the Globelite Batteries Limited here in the city. As a result Mr. Hinkel, the Manager of this firm had gone down to the Round Lake School and examined the batteries in question.\n\nWhile Mr. Huston was here I contacted Mr. Hinkel and had him come over to the office. He informed me that the batteries at the school had been too small from the beginning and they had been carrying too big a load for their size. In his opinion this was the reason for their break-down. I then asked Mr. Hinkel to write me a letter quoting a price on a new set of batteries and I am attaching his letter herewith. You will note that the cost of new batteries will be $229.12 F.O.B. Regina.\n\nI presume some action will have to be taken because if nothing is done the school will have no lighting when the pupils return for the Fall term.\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nP.S. I think the batteries were purchased for $4.00 a set.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nFile No. 108-1-5\n\nAugust 7, 1943.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Round Lake Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-482\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg., Searth & Victoria, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo and previous correspondence, regarding the boiler at the Round Lake Residential School, the Surveys & Engineering Branch is being requested to examine the boiler and make a report regarding what they consider is necessary. We are advising the Surveys & Engineering Branch that Mr. Kerley would be willing to meet their representative at Stockholm and drive him to the school.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Purchasing Branch is being requested to purchase a new set of batteries for the Round Lake School. We are probably going to have some trouble in securing authority for these due to the fact that the last set was only supplied in 1939. Apparently the school management does not make any strenuous efforts to care for the batteries in the manner in which they should be looked after. In the event of a new set being supplied, you should make certain that they will receive proper attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Round Lake Indian Residential School, Crooked Lake Indian Agency, 15 miles from Stockholm, Sask.\n\nWithin the last few weeks we have had considerable correspondence with Mr. Christianson regarding the necessity of providing a new boiler at the above-mentioned school. For your information I enclose a letter dated June 23, 1943, from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited. You will note from this that the firm mentioned does not consider it possible to repair the present boiler. Subsequently Mr. Christianson has forwarded copy of a letter dated July 14, from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited, offering to furnish and install a boiler for $2,050.00.\n\nIn one of his communications Mr. Christianson stated that prices had also been secured from the Gurney North-West Foundry Company Limited, Winnipeg. We recently obtained a copy of the letter from that firm and I also enclose this for your information. Apparently the principal of the school secured this quotation last December, but we only received it recently from Mr. Christianson.\n\nIf the boiler is in the condition that it is stated to be by the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited, it would appear that a new boiler is necessary and, if so, it will have to be purchased at the earliest possible date, in order to have it available when the heating season commences. I should, therefore, appreciate your arranging to have one of your officials visit the school at the earliest possible\ndate and make a definite recommendation regarding what should be done.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, Broadview, Saskatchewan, is the Indian Agent. He could arrange to meet your representative at Stockholm and drive him to the school.\n\nDirector.\nAugust 16, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe: Battery for Round Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe last set of batteries was purchased by the Principal of the School in September, 1939, and was guaranteed for seven years, provided the daily discharge did not exceed 1750 watt hours per day. You have submitted with requisition information that this set of batteries did not last quite four years, because it was \"excessively overloaded.\"\n\nThe replacement battery called for on your requisition - Globelite, type W 21 - provides for a daily discharge of 2500 watt hours per day, but the manufacturers cannot assume responsibility unless a battery of proper capacity is ordered. We would, therefore, need to know the average and daily peak consumption in watt hours per day, or the number and wattage of lamps, and the average time these are used per day. Likewise, please advise what laundry or other machinery is operated on the battery circuit.\n\nIf the total daily consumption exceeds 2500 watt hours per day, it might be well to consider using a small gasoline engine for the machinery, and using the battery for lighting service only.\n\nH.

In view of the equipment situation today Mr. Cow feels certain that Mr. Robertson would not suggest a new boiler unless, in his opinion, it was really needed.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch, therefore, recommends acceptance of the enclosed tender from the Regina Plumbing and Heating Limited. This is only a copy of the tender received from the firm. Apparently the original is in Mr. Christianson's office, as he forwarded this copy to us.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch suggest that a written guarantee be obtained from the firm to the effect that should any part of the installation, either materials or workmanship, prove unsatisfactory within one year of completion the same would be rectified at the contractor's expense.\nIt would be appreciated if you could place this order immediately, as it will probably take most of the month to install the new boiler and heating will probably be required at the school by that time.\n\nR.A.

This morning when I arrived here from the Crooked Lake Agency I called Mr. Robertson, Manager of the Regina Plumbing and Heating Company and he informed me he had been awarded the contract for installing the heating plant in the Round Lake School by the Purchasing Agent at Ottawa, Mr. Davidson. Upon receiving it Mr. Robertson had immediately got in touch with the Gurney North-West Foundry Company Limited, of Toronto and received a wire from them to the effect that they would not guarantee to deliver the heating plant required for the Round Lake School under five or six months' time. Therefore we would probably get the furnace on April 1st next.\n\nMr. Robertson is of the opinion that if our Branch got in touch with the Gurney Foundry Company in Toronto and explained to them how urgent this boiler is needed they might be able to do better than they have promised. Therefore if you think this feasible I would ask you to get in touch with these people because something has got to be done to protect the children at the School before the Winter sets in.\n\nWould you kindly advise me as soon as possible.\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6333, file 661-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the thirteenth addressed to Stockholm received today. Our post-office address is now Whitewood, Sask. Only the odd folder now comes to Stockholm, consequently we go there very seldom. Whitewood is on the main line of the C.P.R., and unlike Stockholm it has a doctor and a bank. In the future will you please address all mail to us, Whitewood, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will find enclosed copies of purchase order #5185. I regret you had to write concerning this. Early in July I developed sciatic pains which eventually confined me to bed. Several local doctors had a chance to give advice and after having accumulated enough drugs to set up a drug store I finally followed the instructions of a city surgeon and went to Winnipeg. I had to travel by train and ambulance. Under the skilled hands of two specialists I had a ruptured disc removed from my spine. All pain ceased and since then I have been progressing wonderfully in health. I do like to relate all this out of sheer gratitude for the restoration of my health but under present circumstances I tell it hoping it may prove a worthy alibi for my neglect in tending to the above matter.\n\nDuring the time when I was in the hospital the school was inspected by a representative from your Department. I can never understand why these men come unannounced. It would have meant a great deal to me to have had the opportunity of talking with him. You see our schools are so isolated in some instances that we are out of touch with sources of inspiration and help. In my own case I welcome inspectors and regret that we have so few of them, but they may find by suddenly dropping in on a school is not half so important as what they could contribute by contacting the principal and staff, learning their aims and problems and giving them, in turn, to feel that there is after all a direct line of interest between the Department at Ottawa and the local work.\n\nMr. Butchart for example is your auditor and yet he is more than that. He affords us a very helpful social contact with your office. To be sure we appreciate his business like manner and we know that all your representatives must come for business reasons but we do feel that they all can if given the opportunity render another service equally as important.\n\nTrust my letter may be interpreted in the kindly spirit in which it was written. I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

OSTRANDER,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.,\ndated October 22, 1945.\n\nThe only fire escape which had been in operation on the west side of the building, being that part of the building which is most likely to afford a means of escape from the dormitories, if there was a fire, had been eliminated by building at the foot of it an outer porch over the door to the boys' play room. I was annoyed when I saw this on my visit to the school on September 5th and drew Mr. Card's attention to it. He said he would have it moved to another window on the same side of the building where it would not have interference from the porch. The fire escape had not been moved when I again visited the school on October 10th.\n\nThe broken panes of glass at the time of my visit on September 5th ran into dozens. Every building on the premises had some broken windows and some of them had many. None of these had been repaired on October 10th, in fact I believe even more had been added to the number in a little over a month. The school grounds are receiving no attention whatever and there are tall weeds in front of the main school building which have been growing all summer, and were still there on October 10th.\n\nAll the buildings of the school needed painting but broken boards here and there and other damage resulting from carelessness and lack of discipline with the children have rendered the buildings unsightly and unfit for painting until considerable repair work has been done. The flooring of the boys' play room had dangerous holes in it and many boards of the flooring ready to break through at any moment. Mr. Kerley, the Agent, informed me that there has been flooring at the school for some months for repairs to these floors but nothing has been done to repair them. Some of the dormitory floors are practically worn through in spots, also, and much repair work is needed.\nOttawa, November 6, 1945.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent,\nIndian Agent, Broadview, Sask.\n\nI have a letter from Inspector Ostrander regarding his recent inspection of the Round Lake School. He reports as follows regarding the fire escape:\n\n\"The only fire escape which had been in operation on the west side of the building, being that part of the building which is most likely to afford a means of escape from the dormitories, if there was a fire, had been eliminated by building at the foot of it an outer porch over the door to the boys' play room. I was annoyed when I saw this on my visit to the school on September 5th and drew Mr. Card's attention to it. He said he would have it moved to another window on the same side of the building, where it would not have interference from the porch. The fire escape had not been moved when I again visited the school on October 10th\".\n\nPlease let me know if it has been moved since October 10th. If not, you should arrange with the Principal to have the work done immediately.\n\nThe Inspector also refers to the fact that the flooring in the boys' playroom requires immediate repairs. Birch flooring was ordered on our purchase order No. 5428, a copy of which was sent to you in September. If this lumber has reached the school, you should arrange with the Principal to have the work done immediately. Please let me hear from you when the above-mentioned repairs have been carried out.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nThe jacket heater at the Round Lake School is damaged beyond repair and needs replacing at once.\n\nAs I consider that the damage to this piece of equipment must have resulted from mishandling by the school authorities, it having been installed only about two years, I have informed the Principal that I will not recommend that the Department pay for the new one.\n\nHe has agreed to pay for the new one from school funds but is unable to locate one anywhere in this province. The damaged jacket heater is called a Viking heater. It is No. V50 and was supplied to the Department from Warden-King Limited, Montreal. The Principal of the School asks that the same type of heater be purchased and shipped to him at Stockholm, Saskatchewan, and he will pay the total cost in connection therewith.\n\nJ.P.B.

I sent the necessary piping from\nBroadview to Whitewood on Nov. 23rd. As it was impossible\nto get 28 ft. in one length I had two lengths welded and\nmade a smooth joint. The Principal was notified, but the\npipe is still in Whitewood. His attitude appears to be\nthat this is all unnecessary. He stated that any fires\nhad always started on the other side of the building. I\npointed out to him that a fire might start anywhere and there\nwas no such thing as too many fire escapes in a building of\nthis kind. He also makes the excuse of not having enough\nhelp at the school. He seemed reluctant to move the porch\nand would prefer to extend a wooden platform along the side\nof the building beyond the porch. I pointed out that this\nwould not be a safe arrangement as the platform should be\nof metal construction and not too long.\n\nAs regards the 2800 ft. of flooring authorized on\nPurchase Order 5422, being unable to purchase birch\nflooring, edge grain fir was sent to the school on Nov. 28th,\nand no attempt has been made as yet to lay this. Instead\nof being put in the school it was stored in the loft of the\ncow barn.\n\nA saving of over $200.00 was effected by the\nsubstitution of this flooring. Would it be possible to\nget authority to hire men and see that the fire escape\nis constructed and the flooring laid in the boys' playroom\nand girls' dormitory.\n\n(Over)\nThere appears to be a lack of co-operation on the part of the Principal, even after the Department has purchased the necessary materials for urgent and necessary work.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 6th ultimo, No. 108-1-5, addressed to Mr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent, Crooked Lake Agency, copy of which was sent to this office, in connection with the fire escape and the flooring in the boys' playroom in the Round Lake Indian Residential School, I am now enclosing copy of a letter received from Mr. Kerley referring to lack of co-operation on the part of the Principal of the school in carrying out this very necessary work.\n\nI cannot understand the attitude of the Reverend Mr. Card, the Principal, in these matters. The floor in the boys' playroom is actually dangerous and might easily be the cause of a broken leg or some other injury while the boys are playing on the floor in its present condition. To store this flooring in the loft of the cow barn as soon as it was received instead of taking immediate steps to lay it would almost indicate that Mr. Card is not interested in the welfare of the pupils.\n\nMuch worse, in my opinion, is his failure to remedy the dangerous condition of the fire escapes. The building is an old frame building with poor heating arrangements and it would burn very quickly if a fire started. The only fire escapes in operation are in parts of the building where a fire is almost sure to start, making it very important to have a useful fire escape on the other side of the building. To have eliminated this fire escape, as I reported, subsequently taking no action to remedy the situation even after being supplied with good material, is inexcusable.\n\nI think the Church Authorities should be informed, in no uncertain terms, that Mr. Card must comply with the Department's instructions where they relate to the health and welfare of the children, as well as the care of the buildings immediately. Failing this he should be replaced by someone willing to assume some responsibility to promptly complete repairs for improvements where the welfare of the children is concerned.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, December 12, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, I note that the work which you consider necessary at the Round Lake Residential School has not yet been done. As you suggest, I will take up the matter with the Church Authorities and point out to them the lack of co-operation displayed by the Principal.\n\nHowever, from your reports, it is evident that the change in the fire escape and the flooring of the boys' playroom should be done immediately, and you may authorize Mr. Indian Agent Kerley to proceed with this work as soon as he can obtain labour. If he requires an accountable cheque for the labour, he should make application for same.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe Purchase Order No. 6564\n\nThe vendors, Crane Limited, Regina, Sask., advise that they cannot supply the V-30 tank heater, 500 gallon capacity, but that they can furnish a V-22 heater, which will heat 350 gallons.\n\nKindly advise if the latter may be supplied.\n\nH.J.

We sought advice only to learn that it could not be cleared.\n\nWe took up the matter with Mr. Kerley, Indian Agent and Mr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Affairs only to be informed that, since our heater had lasted so short a time, viz., something over two years\u2014the School would be responsible for the purchase of the new heater.\n\nShortly afterward I was in Regina and called at the Office. I discussed the matter further and offered to make payment out of our School funds if a heater could be located. Mr. Ostrander agreed to take the matter in hand with the result that a heater was shipped from Crane Limited, Regina and we made payment for same.\n\nOur supply of water is pumped from the lake and is very high in alkali content. So much so, that the Company supplying water softening systems sent back a negative report when asked to supply a softening system.\n\nThe new heater is a size smaller and much lower in cost than the former but I believe that, with care it can be made to serve for a longer period.\n\nEnclosed are two copies of Invoice, one of them being receipted. I trust that the Department may see fit to reimburse the School for this expense since we have further financial problems to present under separate cover.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should simply have certified the account and sent it forward to this office for payment.\n\nThe account includes an item of $2.18 for freight from Regina to Whitewood.

Gard,\nPrincipal,\nRound Lake Indian Residential School,\nWHITEWOOD, Saskatchewan.\nROUND LAKE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. Phelan:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I wrote letter of August 25th, copy of which is enclosed, I had been here as Principal only a short time. It was my first experience in Indian work and there was no one to coach me or give me instruction in proper procedure when new equipment or major repairs were necessary. Hence I erred in the matter of the plumbing.\n\nAfter I wrote on August 27th last year the situation became worse. Finally I contacted Steele & Lang Ltd. of Yorkton and asked them to examine our XXXXXX plumbing and list our needs. This was done and we were notified that they had a shipment of fixtures and repairs coming in soon and could take care of our needs. They requested our reply by return of mail in order that they could take care of our needs.\n\nRather face the winter with conditions in the building as they were I asked them to come right along.\n\nThe work was done in November and the account dated November 30th. This account reached Mr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies but was not satisfactory and was returned for further details. Again it was sent to Mr. Ostrander and again returned. This time with the suggestion that we at Round Lake School pay the account with the possibility that the account may receive official approval at a later date.\n\nThis is impossible in our present state of finances. In the year 1945 this school received in Government grant the sum of $9806.37 as compared to $12,802.62 in 1944. It is true that the average attendance of pupils was lower but the difference was only 4 per cent whereas the Government grants for 1945 was some 22 percent less. The figures are tabulated on a separate sheet.\n\nIf you can direct me in regard to this account of Steele & Lang Limited in order that it might be certified by the Regina Office it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFOR ROUND LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nJ. A. Card\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to the matter of the account of Messrs. Steele and Lang Limited, of Yorkton, for plumbing at the Round Lake Indian Residential School, and your letter of the 18th instant, No. 108-1-5.\n\nI am returning herewith letter of Reverend J.A. Card to the Department dated March 11th; copy of Mr. Card's letter to the Department dated August 27th, 1945; my letter addressed to Mr. Card dated March 5th, 1946; the account of Messrs. Steele and Lang totalling $456.83 with Crooked Lake Indian Agency Voucher No. 383, and Indian Agent Kerley's letter to the Department dated January 23rd last.\n\nAlso enclosed is a statement prepared by Messrs. Steele and Lang showing the details of the charge of $114.05 for labour. This statement now shows 7 hours overtime at $1.05 whereas the original account showed 9 hours overtime at the same rate. Apparently the number of hours of overtime was altered to more closely agree with the original amount shown for labour as $114.10. There is also a difference of .05\u00a2 in the total charge for labour and I have amended the voucher accordingly from $456.83 to $456.83.\n\nThere is no doubt that these repairs were very badly needed and notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Card engaged the services of the plumbers in a rather unusual manner I would now recommend that the account be paid as rendered.\n\nI am enclosing receipt for $10.40 and $8.56, as well as prepaid freight bill for $2.67. With reference to that part of Department letter which refers to charge of $14.82 for two trips by car to the school this is for 148.2 miles at .10\u00a2 a mile and is a fair charge.\n\nJ.P.B.

Purchasing Agent.\nCrooked Lake Agency,\nBroadview, Sask.,\nDec. 14th, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nBoth the Principals of the two Residential Schools here have requested that the grant for the nightwatchman be made for the 10 month school year instead of for the seven winter months as at present. Owing to the fire hazard at these schools they have been keeping a man since the opening of the school year September 1st and intend to keep him on until June 30th, 1947. While they feel that the Department should pay for the full ten months they are prepared if necessary to pay for the remaining five months out of their per capita grant. They have also requested that the amount be raised from $40.00 per month to $60.00 per month as at present it is impossible to secure suitable men for $40.00 per month.\n\nI consider these requests reasonable and recommend them for your consideration. Round Lake School is certainly a grave fire hazard and though the conditions at Cowessess School are better the risk is still considerable.\n\nW.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, 21 December 1946.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent,\nBROADVIEW, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, it is regretted that no provision is made in our appropriation for allowing an increased grant towards the salary of the night watchmen at certain Indian residential schools nor for providing any payment for night watchmen for a period longer than that now allowed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 6 January 1947.\n\nMr. W.J.D.

To make a good job it would certainly require two coats of paint over the whole surface including the blackboards. The plaster that needs repairing is 40 square feet in different patches on the ceiling, this was caused several years ago when the roof was leaking. The steps in question are badly worn and the best way is to construct new ones.\n\nAttached is a requisition for the decoration and necessary repairs, the quotation is from Messrs Webb & Melanson, of Broadview, Sask. They are willing to do the work a little later on when the roads are opened up again, (It can be done before the 31st of March). I might add that Webb & Melanson are Veterans and have been doing this kind of work on various schools in this district for the past year.\n\nW. J. D. Kerley,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. W.J.D. Kerley, Indian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th inst., you may accept the tender of Messrs.

Kerley, Indian Agent,\nBroadview, Sask.\n\nRe Purchase Order 12870\n\nThe above was issued on August 9th, 1946, and forwarded to Chalmers Bros., Broadview, Sask. This order covered the items requested on your requisition of August 1st.\n\nWe have not yet received the account covering the cost of the paint and if it has been delivered the account should be certified and forwarded to this office.
