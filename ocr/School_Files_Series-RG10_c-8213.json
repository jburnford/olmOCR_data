H. Bennett, Esq., M.P.,\nMidland, Ont.\nRe Ryerson School Specifications.\n\nOn receipt of same I immediately passed them on to several local contractors. Since then I have had several enquiries from prospective tenderers that they are not very clear as to the heating specification, and would ask you to look over same and explain a little more fully. For instance you will notice only one hot air pipe from furnace to school room on north side and two cold air ducts on the south side, which the heating men claim is not enough to heat that space. Then there are two registers in the hall way. Please specify whether they are both hot or cold or one of each. I presume they are both hot.\n\nThe furnace has lots of capacity but it doesn't seem to be properly distributed. If this can be fixed up I can let the tenderers in town know before they put in their bids, as I do not think there will be any from places outside of Parry Sound Town.\n\nI would also recommend that the whole basement be excavated, as it would not cost any more than to take earth put. You will notice that the centre wall will cost more than by putting the south outside wall down to the full depth, and have a running beam in centre on brick piers.\n\nThe full size basement is almost necessary for storing fuel etc. It might also be added that bell from old school be hung in new tower as it would be cheaper when construction work is going on.\n\nThe building will face East.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6158, file 423-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, June 1st, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Registers shown on the floor plan are all warm air, two in cloak-rooms, two in class-room floor, one in class-room walls in addition to the register in living quarters.\n\nThe cold air is shown in basement plan one inlet from front and opening shown to be carried to ground floor. The cold air face is not marked on the plan, but is to be put in.\n\nThe other matter referred to will be taken up when contract is let. The tenderers might state the cost of additional excavation.\n\nThere are enquiries from a great many quarters and several plans have been sent out from here, so it will not be wise to assume that tenders will only be received from Parry Sound.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nJUN 4 1915\nARCHITECT.\nPARIPAN\n\nFOR PAINTING EVERYTHING\n\nIN SIXTY DIFFERENT SHADES\n\nPARIPAN has the reputation of having been washed for 10 to 20 years without being renewed. Because of its artistic value and durability it has been used on the best residences in the world, including the Royal Apartments at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace, etc.; such hospitals as London Hospital, the New King's College Hospital of London, England, etc., and it was used exclusively on the new Toronto General Hospital,\n\nbecause\n\nTHE MORE YOU WASH IT THE BETTER IT LOOKS\n\nPARIPAN flat, or with gloss sublime,\nEndures like a rock in every clime,\nTrue British Paint, no rival it boasts.\nThe more you wash it the better it looks.\n\nSTURGEONS LIMITED\n\nTORONTO\n\nAGENT:\n\"The more you wash it the better it looks.\"\n\nPARIPAN is not just an Enamel, but a Lacquer Enamel. The Glossy has an exceptionally brilliant surface. The Flat has a dull silk sheen which makes it \"the acme of artistic decoration.\" Both are equally washable.\n\nThe cost of Paripan when compared with ordinary paint should be about 15 per cent. more for three-coat work. We recommend for best work four-coat process.\n\nThe following figures on a recent contract are an interesting study:\n\nThree-coat work of Paripan was called for on a small job on a hospital. The lowest tender was $975. As the trustees did not wish to go to this expense they called for three coats of good oil enamel paint. The lowest tender was $890. Taking the life of paint as 7 years and Paripan as at least 14 years, the paint bill on the above figures would be for 14 years as follows:\n\nPaint, $1,780; Paripan, $975.\n\nNote.\u2014Not only would the saving be large, but during the 14 years there would be a washable surface; the place would be cleanly and the appearance would be all that could be desired.\n\nSUGGESTION FOR DECORATING YOUR HOUSE WITH PARIPAN PROCESS\n\nRemember that bright and cheerful paint work adds 50 per cent. to the home. You cannot get light-colored paint in the ordinary way that will wash down. Specify and see you get Paripan Glossy or Flat; they will wash and wear for an indefinite time and retain their color.\n\nINTERIOR.\n\nBEDROOMS.\u2014Woodwork in Glossy, white or cream; plaster walls in Flat tint to suit furniture, etc.\n\nBATHROOMS AND KITCHENS.\u2014Woodwork in Glossy, white, cream or grey; walls and ceiling in light shade of blue or green.\n\nRECEPTION, DRAWING ROOMS AND HALLS.\u2014Panels of deep Flat color, filling in with very light Flat tints to match woodwork in Flat or Glossy.\n\nEXTERIOR.\n\nWOODWORK.\u2014Finished entirely with the Glossy light colors and trim of a deep color.\nWHERE AND HOW TO USE \"PARIPAN\"\n\nParipan is recommended for all classes of work. It is used on wood, metal of all kinds, plaster and stone, inside or outside.\n\nSpecifications will be furnished for treating any work on request, but the following may be taken as a basis:\n\nFor interior plaster, ceilings, doors and woodwork, metal, or any new surface\u2014Two coats of Paripan Filler or undercoat (the second coat tinted with some of the Glossy or Flat color) if colors are to be used for final coat; then one or two coats of Glossy or Flat Paripan, according to finish desired. The Filler or undercoat is given to prepare a good base for the finish\u2014a glance will tell you if another coat is needed. Naturally the better the base the better the finish.\n\nFor Old Surfaces\u2014One or two coats of either Glossy or Dull. This must depend on the condition of surface to be treated and if the same color is to be applied again. If a light color is to be applied to an old dark color, then base of ordinary filler, mixed with a little of the finishing color (Glossy or Flat) should be applied before putting on Glossy or Dull.\n\nFor exterior work, new metal or wood\u2014Two coats Paripan Filler and two coats of Glossy Paripan.\n\nStropping.\u2014This should be done with Paripan Filler, softened if necessary, with a little dry white lead. Putty should not be used on any account.\n\nPlaster walls and ceilings must be perfectly dry and clean before any paint is put on, or the free lime and moisture will change the color and cause the material to flake off. If necessary to treat before plaster is in proper condition, give one or two coats of Paripan Filler tinted. This treatment is more satisfactory than distempering, as the Filler will do for many years when the wall is to be finished with Paripan Glossy or Flat.\n\nBIG BEN, Houses of Parliament, London, England\u2014one of England's most famous landmarks\u2014is treated with Paripan. The photograph shows the clock face being painted. Note the size of the men.\nA FEW HINTS WHEN PARIPANNING.\n\nOpen tin as per instructions on tin.\nStir thoroughly; remove skin, if any; be careful to get no loose hairs on work; give 24 hours between each coat (except the second which should be applied final coat (it may be necessary to rub surface down to obtain this).\nDo not put on a thick coat: work it out well on surface when applying. The result is worth the extra care.\nUse a clean, dry, brush or bristle paint roller. On a short or semi-gloss surface, add a small proportion of Glossy to Paripan Flat. See that the surface on which you intend putting Paripan is thoroughly clean. All grease and dirt must be removed and see that no dust is around.\n\nWASHING PARIPAN\n\nOnly cold water and sponge. If surface is very greasy use a little soap. Do not scrape washing lightly.\nDry the glossy surface with a soft cloth and polish with a dust-free leather to increase gloss. The Flat should be dried with a dabbing motion, not by rubbing forwards and backwards, as this creates gloss.\n\nOn any points that may arise, please write us and we will give you full information.\n\nNote the reflection of light on this corridor in the Bournemouth Royal Victoria Hospital in England.\n\nParipan was used because it can be washed down indefinitely with soap and water. \"The more you wash it the better it looks.\"\n\nA FEW FACTS ABOUT PARIPAN.\n\nThere are 16 acres of Paripanned walls in the London Hospital, England.\n\nThe English Navy gave one order for Paripan amounting to 5,643 gallons.\n\nDr. Eyre, of Guy's Hospital, London, Eng., states by personal experience that Paripanned surface bacteria can be removed owing to the polish and evenness of the surface.\n\nVerandahs and outside woodwork when treated with Paripan can be washed down and should not require recoating for 7 to 10 years.\n\nParipan has been used on some of the finest Canadian homes, clubs and public buildings.\n\nParipan was one of the first enamels made in England over 40 years ago.\n\nParipan is used on railway coaches, motor cars, yachts, etc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6158, file 423-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\"The more you wash it the better it looks.\"\n\nPARIPAN PRODUCTS\n\nCOVERING CAPACITY\n\nPARIPAN GLOSSY.\u20141 gallon covers 810 square feet.\n\nPARIPAN FLAT.\u201416 lbs. cover 810 square feet.\n\nPARIPAN FILLER (or Undercoating).\u201416 lbs. cover 810 square feet.\n\nThese covering capacities may be relied upon.\n\nGlossy is supplied in \u00bd, \u00bc, \u00bd and 1-gal. cans, in various colors, ready for use. Note the wonderful covering capacity. It dries from the base upwards, is absolutely waterproof, tough and elastic, besides being so brilliant that it has a surface like glass. It is improved by washing, and in fact \"the more you wash it the better it looks.\"\n\nParipan Flat is supplied in various packages, 8 and 16-lb. tins, ready for use. This is a beautiful material, equally washable as the Glossy. It has a beautiful dull sheen which is particularly fine. The use of our Flat Paripan avoids the old method of rubbing down the Glossy to obtain a Flat finish.\n\nParipan Filler, or undercoating, is supplied in 7, 14 and 100-lb. packages. It is recommended to use this exclusively under Paripan Glossy or Flat, as it forms a hard, non-absorbent base and throws the finishing coat out well. It is also recommended to use Paripan Filler in place of white lead for general purposes, as it is a better obscurer and goes much further. For the sake of comparison, 9 lbs. of Filler are generally reckoned to be equal to a gallon of white lead and oil paint.\n\nC.V.C. CLEANER AND POLISHER.\u2014If you have a good piece of furniture so dirty that you cannot see the finish\u2014dirty paint or varnish work\u2014put some C.V.C. on a flannel and rub it gently; it will remove the dirt and marks etc. When dirt is removed, rub lightly with a soft rag and it will bring up the finish and add to the lustre.\n\nIf you polish your floors, your furniture, your paintwork, etc., with C.V.C., you will keep it clean, and at the same time improve the finish you have on it.\nPREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF DISEASE THROUGH WALL CONTAMINATION FROM BREATH\n\nVide \"The Times\" Report (August 14th, 1906) of Dr. Murray Gordon's investigation into impurities of the atmosphere of the House of Commons, and Report to Local Government Board, 1902-3, re investigation in Schoolrooms.\n\nPARIPAN: THE REMEDY\nCHEAP, EFFICIENT, PERMANENT\n\nTHE Government Investigations as to the spread of disease, such as epidemics of diphtheria in schools, and of influenza in the House of Commons, have proved that the cause is attributable to bacterially-contaminated moisture, projected from the mouth when speaking.\n\nExperiments show that persons infected with, or convalescent from contagious infectious diseases, and carrying bacilli in the mucus membrane of the mouth and throat, can infect others at a distance of 40 feet! A specially prepared plate having been placed upon the Cabinet Minister's box in the House of Commons, a speaker's throat was inoculated with a special, but harmless and easily recognized bacillus (B. prodigious); subsequent examination proving that no less than 83 colonies of this particular bacillus had been formed upon the prepared test-plate, and this from the mouth and throat of one speaker only!\n\nHOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, BARRACKS, WORKHOUSES\n\nA heavy responsibility is therefore shown to rest on those in control of buildings where numbers of human beings congregate, to employ a material upon the walls and ceilings which will permit of their being easily and frequently freed from infectious deposits arising from condensation of breath, or projection of particles.\n\n\"Prevention is better than cure,\" and for such purposes Paripan is better than any Paint or varnish.\n\nIf the act of speaking by one person in a great chamber such as the House of Commons can cause 83 colonies of bacilli to be formed upon a small plate within it, how great must be the possible area of contamination in a room or ward say of 60 ft. x 40 ft. x 20 ft. (the walls and ceiling of which would have a surface of some 6,400 square feet!) when occupied by a large number of persons.\n\nIf these walls be finished with Paripan the cost of keeping them clean and free from infection is but very small, and can be constantly repeated.

Emulsions of pathogenic microbes including those of plague, cholera, typhoid, diphtheria etc., were applied on the paripanised surfaces of plates, tables etc., and there allowed to dry. It was subsequently found that owing to the polish and evenness of the surface, nearly all the bacteria could be removed by vigorously rubbing the infected area with cotton wool in a primitive manner, thus killing all the infecting microorganisms. As the surface of Paripan is unaffected by the disinfectants in ordinary use (carbolic acid, 5% lysol, 4% mercuric perchloride) it is possible to remove the deposit of paripan from surfaces from which some can be removed although the preparation after its application to walls etc., can be in no way regarded as an active antiseptic. (Note: In this connection it should be observed that Alcohol or hydrochloric acid concentrations will destroy the high polish of even surface of Paripan).\n\nParipan is extensively used here in Guy's Hospital and its durability is evidenced by the present condition of the walls of one of our isolation wards, which were coated with this preparation upwards of six years ago.\n\nI am, Gentlemen,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nM.D., F.R.S.E., D.P.H.\n\nBacteriologist to Guy's Hospital and Lecturer on Bacteriology in the Guy's Hospital Medical School, etc.\n\nThe above Report is intended for the use of Architects, Doctors, Surgeons, and others directly interested in Sanitary Conditions in Hospitals, Infirmarys, and other Public Buildings, and is not for circulation among the general public.\nGeneral Duncan C.

The water runs through the cement at rear and in at rear door of basement and keeps the cement floor wet all the time.\n\nI have been wanting him to remedy it and he has done nothing yet. It has been drying up some since the weather has been dry. Also the bell he put does not work yet. He has promised to go over and fix it several times. Of course the 10% held back will bring him to time.\n\nCertificate No.2 for balance coming to him as per contract, less 10%, with extras on the building as follows:\n\n- 50 ft. 4 in. tile drain: $22.50\n- Roofing outside basement area: $7.50\n- Moving old bell to new building: $6.00\n\nTotal: $36.00\n\nIf the Department insists there may be a balance kept off contract for difference between 1/2 hard wood floor specified and the 1\" floor allowed to be used.\n\nThat may be arranged before the final payment.\n\nTrusting this may meet with your approval.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It will be necessary for the contractor to make good the walls and basement entrance so as to prevent access of surface water to the basement either through the walls or floors.\n\nProviding the concrete used in the walls and floor is of the proportions specified, water should not come through them under ordinary circumstances such as exist there.\n\nThe difference in values between the 1\" and 1\u00bd\" hardwood flooring should be deducted, the value probably being about $15.00. This, however, will be left to your judgment.\n\nThe amount paid on the last certificate was $630.00.

I instructed the caretaker to get it cleaned out at once and ask your authority to have the walls white washed. I would think the cost probably $25.00. I have asked a local painter to have a look at it and give me a price which I shall submit to the Department.

If you consider it necessary, you may have the walls white washed and you should have the broken windows replaced and the sashes repainted.

Original on 160370-25F.\n\nONTARIO\n\nNo woodshed.\n\n==================\n\nREMARKS.\n\nThis building is very modern but there is no well and the nearest available well is some distance away. It is uncovered and the cattle drink out of it.\n\nI would strongly recommend a well near the building. It is difficult to teach cleanliness when we cannot practice it.\n\nAdelaide McIntosh\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 14, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nMiss McIntosh, teacher of the Ryerson Indian School, in her report for the year ended the 31st of December last, states as follows: \"This building is very modern, but there is no well and the nearest available well is some distance away. It is uncovered and the cattle drink out of it. I would strongly recommend a well near the building. It is difficult to teach cleanliness when we cannot practice it.\"\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to state how far the well is from the school and who owns it; also whether one could be dug close to the school, and, if so, what the probable cost would be.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report to you that the well is about 300 yards from the school. It is very hard to estimate what a well would cost as the school is quite high above the lake and unless we happened to strike a spring we might have to go very deep. I would think a fair estimate would be $75.00. The present well is first class spring water and the distance of 300 yards is not very far but I think it might be boxed in and a pump put in. To box it in would cost $10.00, a pump $25.00. I think this would be alright in the meantime.\n\nI would like to get authority to level off school grounds and fence in same. Put two cement walks into the school from road and one to teachers house, total cost probably $125.00.\n\nI have spoken to the truant officer and he says he is doing all he can to encourage attendance. During sugar making time there are always some absentees.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 11th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in reference to spring well at Ryerson School, and in reply to request that you will inform me if the spring is on a higher or lower level than the school; also state provided this is higher, if the ground is such that water can be carried to this school by gravitation. A sketch showing this, also school lot with position of building and the proposed sidewalks with dimensions should be sent that this may be of record here when the matter is being given consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report on above letter re well etc., at Ryerson School, Parry Island. It is about 275 yards from the school and on about a level with the school room floor and would be no use for gravitation. The school stands on a level with the highest surroundings and about 60 feet above the lake level. The teacher would like very much to have it in the school grounds but as I said before it would cost $75.00 or more. I am enclosing a sketch showing school grounds and buildings and about what should be enclosed by a wire fence, some 40 rods and about 500 square feet of cement walks. The walks would cost about $100.00 and the fencing $75.00.\n\nI am,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 9, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 2nd instant in reference to Ryerson school, and in reply to say that the Department approves of the building of fences around the school grounds with an additional fence dividing the rear yard as shown on the amended plan enclosed, also the building of concrete walks and curb for well and providing a pump. A fence should also be placed around the pump if this is required to protect it and render the surroundings sanitary.\n\nBefore commencing this work you should inform the Department whether this can be most economically done by tender or by day labour, the materials being purchased by you and delivered at the school.\n\nOn receipt of this information here, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq., Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Supt.,\nParry Sound,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had a man over from Parry Sound and he gave me a price which I thought was too high. I am enclosing his tender and if Department think it alright the best time to do the work is when the school holidays are on. If you think the price is too high I can get some more tenders but labor and materials are all very high here at present.\n\nI am Your Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 30, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 25th instant enclosing tender for fencing and concrete work at Ryerson School, Parry Island, and in reply to inform you that a temporary fence should be put around the spring to prevent contamination of the spring. The other work will be deferred until it can be completed at a reasonable price.\n\nYou will no doubt be able to arrange for the building of the fence around spring with a member of the band, provided wire and a gate are furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlexander Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nClosed.

I would think it might cost $100.00 and would recommend same as it is much needed near the school.\n\nAlex Logan, Indian Supt.\nOttawa, September 29, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to the minute of the meeting of the council of the Parry Island Band, held on the 2nd instant, recommending that a well be dug for the Ryerson Indian Day School I beg to say that you should obtain a price for the digging of this well. You should decide whether it would be cheaper to have the well drilled or dug and the price for doing the work should be for the method thought best by you to be used in obtaining a good water supply. If an outfit for drilling can be obtained, it might be cheaper to have work done in that manner. However, you will be able to decide this point and, as soon as the cost of the work is ascertained, the Department will be in a position to consider this request. The price submitted by you should also cover the cost of the pump and equipment. It is understood that, if this work is authorized, the cost will be paid from the funds of the Parry Island Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst.

Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to make further report re well at Ryerson School, Parry Island and may say that I have gone into the matter with D.L. King, school caretaker, who is the only Indian there who can be depended upon to do any work of this kind and think the most suitable and likely place to get water is about seventy-five yards in front of school house. The well will have to be twelve feet deep at least and as it will be sand it will be necessary to stone it up, and with a platform on top. The cost would be $55.00. A pump would cost from $15.00 to $25.00, altogether about $75.00. Of course as you know it is hard to get an exact estimate, but my idea is to get a good well and have it in a place where a number of the Indians can use it and the more it is used the better.

The Department could not approve of any expenditure for the purpose in excess of approximately $75.00 to $90.00. It is understood that an exact estimate of the cost of digging the well cannot be given, as this will depend upon the depth required to be excavated. You should see that the work is properly performed and stoned up with a platform on top and that the pump is properly installed. The Department will leave this matter in your hands and you should arrange to have the work done as cheaply as possible. You should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the work can be done before the winter season.\n\nAs soon as the work is completed you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the labour and also the cost of the pump.

Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to inform you that the Spence Indian Day School is badly in need of repair inside and outside. The plaster is peeling off and the walls and ceiling require a thorough clean-up.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the local Indian agent and he tells me that he could put the house in good shape for approximately $150.00. This is too nice a school to be allowed to fall into disrepair. I would also like to have about 20 tons of gravel put down in front of the schoolhouse to prevent mud from being tracked into the school. The total transaction including the gravel should not exceed $175.00.

You may arrange with a local painter to do the work during the summer vacation.\n\nWe will also approve of having approximately 20 loads of gravel put down in front of the schoolhouse, in order to level up the entrance to the building and make it dry.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expense of the above authorized work. The account should show the cost of any material, such as paint, etc., separately from the amount charged for the labour. A separate voucher should also be forwarded for the expenditure incurred in supplying the gravel and spreading it in front of the school building. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the work completed when considered timely by you. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and the total expenditure for the painting and cleaning of the school building and the supplying of the gravel should not exceed your estimate of approximately $125.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I think that the cause of this is on account of the lowering of the water in the lake. We hit rock and no water. Enclosed please find also bill for repairs on pump.\n\nThere should be a new well dug near the shore of the lake, about 50 yards from the school on the Bay Bay side of the school.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the approval of the Dept.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 4th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing accounts in payment for the work performed on the well at the Ryerson Indian Day School. Cheques in payment of these accounts have been sent. We note that this well is of no use, as no water can be obtained from it.\n\nRelative to your request for authority to dig a new well near the shore of the lake, I shall be pleased if you will state approximately the cost of this work, also whether you would advise that the well be dug at the present time, or whether it would be advisable to wait until next Spring. Please also state what arrangements you can make for the labour, or how you purpose having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nReplying to yours of the 4th inst., 22-3-5, I have to report that I have gone over the ground for the proposed well very carefully along with the Indian in charge of repairs on the dock at Parry Island. It is expected that we will encounter quicksand in digging the well and it is thought that the best time to dig would be as soon as work on the dock is completed. To make a job worth while and a credit to the Dept., it will take three men between three and five days to complete the well.\n\nWhat I purpose doing is to dig deep enough so that the well will not go dry even should the lake drop other four feet, crib with with stone, there is plenty of rock handy, and put the pump in. In the Spring of the year, put a cement coping over the well to keep out surface water. To fix it up for immediate use, the cost would be the labour of three men for five days at three dollars making a total of forty-five dollars, if possible, and it is possible that the work might be done in three days.\n\nI will endeavour to have it done as cheaply as possible.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 11, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, stating the approximate cost of having a well dug at the Ryerson Indian Day School, and also how you propose having the work carried out.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange to have the work in digging this well carried out at a time considered by you most advantageous to do so. We note that it will take 3 men from 3 to 5 days to complete the work. If a pump is required, you may arrange for the purchase of same.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the amount due for the labour employed and for any other expenses incurred. Please endeavour to keep the total cost of the work down to the lowest possible point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to report that the basement of the Ryerson Indian Day School, Parry Island, is flooded by water. I was advised on Sunday that the drain was stopped and the water was rising. I gave instructions to the caretaker, Mathew King, to get the poles and wires his father, the late D. L. King, had for the purpose of clearing the drain. Mathew has been working at it off and on since Sunday. I have made an inspection as far as possible and have come to the conclusion that, as the same thing happened last spring, the drain should be opened up and cement-jointed, also the connection from the rain pipes should be cemented, that is where the rain pipe enters the tile. This, I think is the cause of the trouble, as these connections have been open and the possibility is that some rubbish has slipped down this part of the drain. There are three of such connections. Yesterday and today, there was a pungent odour in the school and as the water is up to the furnace door, no fire could be put in the furnace, accordingly, there is no school being held.\n\nPlease instruct if I can go ahead and open up the drain and have the tile fixed with cement at all the connections, as soon as possible. If the weather keeps mild, school will be held tomorrow. I am leaving on the 2:55 A.M. for Gibson to meet Mr. McGloon and may be away for a day or two. Should you wire instructions to repair the drain, my stenographer will attend to the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir:\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJMD/RD\n\nIndian Affairs.

Your consideration in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nI have to state that on examining the back door platform, that in my endeavour to keep down expenses of repairs I had mentioned that we would put in a wooden gutter to carry the water off the back door platform. I find that this will not do, and that it will be necessary for me to put a covering over the platform in the form of a porch. I found on looking around that there was one bundle of shingles and what would be required would be about 150 feet of one inch lumber, tongue and groove, and five pieces of scantling, 2 x 4 dressed. This, I think, would be the cheapest way of getting this thing fixed up for a number of years.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would grant the requisition for this.\nI presume there is no use in asking for the interior of the teacher's house to be calsoined just now. It has been some time since this was done. If it is at all possible I would like to have it done between this and Christmas. If there is not sufficient funds we will have to let the matter ride until next March.\n\nI have had a letter from Miss Emily Donald. She seems to be fitting in all right at Moose Point, and had 12 in attendance on the first day.\n\nI met Mrs. Munson and child and Miss O'Meara and went with them north. I could not go with Miss O'Meara to the school as I had to go on to Lower French with Mrs. Munson. There is a requisition for School Material in this mail to you, for Mrs. Munson's School, Lower French, and I would be very grateful if you would pass this requisition as soon as possible. All the things mentioned are absolutely necessary, except the shelving for books. There was shelving for books made in the form of a shelf, which was not there when I looked around the place, nor mentioned in the inventory left by the teacher. I will make enquiries about this in the near future and find out what has become of it.\n\nI am a little up against it today, not feeling very good, but expect to be able to get around and make a trip up north to see Miss O'Meara, when I shall also go to Lower French and make enquiries about this shelf. I would like to state that I believe Mrs. Munson will fit in at Lower French all right. She appeared to make a good impression on the members of the Band who were at the station and with the white people whom she came in contact with.\n\nI should also state that the seats in the boat and the knees for same have to be fixed up, and I gave instructions to the caretaker to go ahead and make the best job possible. You will remember, Mr. Ferrier, this boat was second hand when it was bought.\nWe will try to make it do this season, but I am very much afraid that we will have to get another boat for next spring, but if possible I will try and make it do for another year.\n\nMrs. Munson seems will pleased with her school.\n\nWith kind regards to the staff, and you and yours.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMD/EM\nOttawa, September 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, reporting on your visit of inspection to the Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the 6 Beacon Gate to Reading, 6 Beacon Primers and Teacher's Manual which the teacher informed you he had not received, I have to say that it was necessary to obtain these texts from the publishers in New York, and it is hoped that Mr. Bolton will receive them at an early date.\n\nRegarding your recommendation as to the best means of carrying the water off the back door platform, the Department will approve of you arranging to put a cover, in the form of a porch, over the platform, and you may purchase the lumber, etc., required, in having this work carried out. Please keep all expense as low as possible, and forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials and for any labour employed.\n\nThe Department has no funds to provide for the kalsomining of the interior of the teacher's house at the present time.\n\nYou will be written in a separate communication regarding the furnishing of the supplies asked for by Mrs. Munson, teacher of the Lower French River Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that you have authorized the caretaker to make sufficient repairs to the boat at the Mazanetawan School to place it in serviceable condition during the present season.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that the teachers who have been engaged this year for the schools in your Agency appear satisfactory to you. It is hoped that they will all meet with success during the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

That is the request for wash basins and washstands, pails for water, drinking cups, towels, soap and requisition sheets. It seems to me silly for Mr. Bolton to put on his requisition sheet, \"Requisition Sheets.\" I did not notice it when he was here last night or I would have drawn his attention to it. He can get all the requisition sheets he requires here.\n\nThe children of this school are not the same as in the other outlying Reserves and should be made to wash at home. The drinking cups and pails, I do not think are necessary. When Miss Smiley was in this school, to keep down scabby mouths she had them bring their own drinking vessels and in many cases provided glass pickle jars for this purpose. The reason for this order, is because of an article in the local paper written by the Missionary preacher on Parry Island, about the well ordered arrangement at Moose Deer Point School regarding the washing and teeth drill, that is practised there.\nMoose Deer Point School is out of the way and is necessary to insist on this as the mothers are not so up to date as the mothers on Parry Island. In any case I don't approve of this request being granted as I think it is just a fad on the part of the teacher.\n\nNo. 1. Sheet I have marked \"Seats for rear desks\" and have initialed same. This means that the rear desks of the school require to be used but there are no seats for them. This is a good thing to have. I have told the teacher that I have been trying to keep down expenses and to get along as best he can until after March, however he has put it in his requisition and as it is necessary for the school, I have put in my remarks so the Department will understand what is meant.\n\nOn Sheet No. 1, the items \"Kindergarten tables and chairs\" I don't approve of. I have signed my initials to same. I think there is a lot of unnecessary fluff attached to the kindergarten work that the children are getting here. I don't think it is necessary to go to the expense of getting tables and chairs. I certainly don't approve of it under the present circumstances. I would like to get a little progress in the three R's in this school more than anything else.\n\nI am very much of the opinion of the Inspector Mr. Moore, I don't know what his report was but I agree with him whatever it is, after conversation I had with him.\n\nFor the information of the Department I might say that Mr. Bolton has kindly consented to fill in and take the service of the Anglican Church at Depot Harbour, on Sundays, which is about three miles from where he is. I am pleased with him doing this,\nbut being cursed or blessed with an insight into human nature I am afraid it will be a case of swelled head for Mr. Bolton. I am satisfied it is only a passing phase as I know the people in this district very well, and you can do anything you like coming into this district, until after you are tried out, then you are allowed to wither and die if you are that kind.\n\nTrusting this will give the Department an idea just how the case stands regarding this requisition.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD, EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 15, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Ryerson Indian Day School for classroom supplies and supplies for the use of the school and residence. I have noted your remarks regarding several of the requests made by the teacher. A requisition is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 50 Lbs. sweeping compound\n- 1 Broom\n- 2 Sauce pans\n- 6 Cups and saucers\n- 6 Tumblers\n- 1 Water dipper\n- 1 Blind, Green, 56\" x 26\"\n- 10 Lbs. chloride lime for toilets\n\nAfter the above purchases have been made, you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the kindergarten tables and chairs, wash basins and stands, drinking cups and towels.\n\nRegarding the 5 rear seats asked for, I have to say that the Department is of opinion that the desks at present in use were purchased from the E. N. Moyer Co., Ltd., Toronto, in 1915. If the desks were obtained from that firm, they will likely bear the stamp of the manufacturer - W. F. Vilas Company. You should ascertain the size of the desks for which the rear seats are required, and you may place an order with the E. N. Moyer Company, Toronto, for the 5 extra rear seats required. You should furnish them with full shipping directions and request them to forward you their account, in duplicate, covering the cost F.O.B. point of delivery. After this equipment is received, if in good condition, you should certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Ferrier, Esq.\nSupt. Indian Education Canada,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nThis is to thank you for sending the teachers' cheques. I received them all except Mrs. English's and have been wondering if it is possible that this cheque might have gone to some other agency. I do know that Mrs. English needs her cheque in the worst way, and if it has not been sent out, I would appreciate it very much if you would send it along as soon as possible.\n\nI was examining the well at Parry Island and am sorry to state but it is true, we will require to have some lumber to build a covering over the well, a little building 6 x 6 x 7, of rough lumber, and which should not cost any more, for materials, building and transportation, than $15.00. They have tried having this well left open but it is no good, the Indians come and use it, and the result is that it is liable to be broken.\n\nI have to get planking eight pieces 2 x 8 for the platform, and thought when we had to get that we might just as well get more rough boards and 2 x 4's and put a cover on the well. A padlock will also be required to keep the well under lock and key for the teacher's use. I would be very glad if I could have this done and I will guarantee it will be done as cheap as anywhere in Canada.\n\nPlease let me know about this, Mr. Ferrier, as soon as you can, as we have the pump now and I am anxious to have this thing fixed up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $15. You may also purchase a padlock, with key.\n\nWhen this well house is completed, you should place the key in the possession of the teacher and forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the materials and for the labour.\n\nThis work should be completed during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The one in use at present was installed in 1915 and is burned out past repair. The building is very badly in need of paint. This should be done as soon as possible otherwise it will deteriorate rapidly. The interior of the residence and classroom also needs painting. The front steps of the residence are badly worn and should be replaced.\n\nThos. H. Cookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, May 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Parry Sound Agency, states that a new furnace is required for next winter's use in the Ryerson Indian Day School, as the present one is burned out and past repair. He also recommends that the school building be painted, both inside and outside.\n\nI would request that, in due time, you furnish an estimate of the cost of installing a new furnace of a type considered satisfactory by you to properly heat the building. I may add that, as our Appropriation this year has been so considerably reduced, we will have no funds to carry out the painting or redecorating required at any of the Indian day schools this year.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the front steps of the residence are badly worn and should be repaired. I would request that you give an estimate of the cost of repairing or replacing these steps.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. M.

As the carpenter is not doing very much just now, I would suggest that the Department give permission for this work to be done right away.\n\nI will endeavour to have the estimate of the cost of the furnace submitted to the Department for their consideration, some time this week.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the installing of a new furnace in the Ryerson Indian Day School and repairing of the steps of the residence.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the steps, I have to say that you may arrange to have this work carried out at the present time. You should arrange for the purchase of any material. It is noted that the cost will not exceed approximately $10. After the repairs have been completed, please forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour.\n\nIt is noted that you will submit an estimate of the cost of the furnace at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I had Mr. Marwood\nput a fire on and went over the radiators in the\nschool and teacher's house, and find that the new\nfurnace sends up heat very much more quickly than\nthe old one did.\n\nI examined the old furnace. It is all\ncracked and broken up, and it is scrap. I do not know\nof any person who is buying scrap around here at the\npresent time, but owing to it being on the Island\nit is going to be a hard job to turn the scrap\ninto money, but if possible I will do so.\nThere are about 1300 bricks or parts of bricks.\nThese bricks are cement ones and in the taking down\nof the furnace they were pretty nearly all broken\nin two, and the lime adheres to the bricks that were\nnot broken, and it is going to be a pretty hard\njob to make a sale of them.\nIn the meantime, I have them piled at the back of the teacher's house and if it is possible to make a sale of them I shall do so. So far as I can see it is all scrap but if it is possible to turn it into money I shall do so, and whatever I get for it I shall send to the Department.\n\nI trust that a cheque will be sent forward to Mr. Marwood as soon as possible. Mr. Marwood has taken over the Plumbing and Heating business of Wm. Beatty Company here, and would appreciate it if you would send on the cheque as soon as possible.\n\nI consider this is a very good job.

He will pay $12.00 for the brick.\n\nThis, I think, is the best that I can do, for this brick is part cement and is decreasing in value the longer it stays outside, as it crumbles away.\n\nI would recommend that this offer be accepted.

This water has been bothering them for a day or two but we thought it would seep away however it appears that we will have to open up the drain.\n\nThe weather is raw and cold and there is no fire in the furnace so I sent word to the teacher to let the children go, and put a man on the job to find out what the trouble is. I do not think it is necessary to open up all the drain and I have instructed the man how to try and find out the trouble.\n\nWe will endeavour to get the drain fixed as soon as possible so that the children can come back to school with as little delay as possible.\n\nTrusting the Department approve of my actions.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M./A.K.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nSir:\n\nFollowing mine of April 11th, T-5524 re the obstruction in the drain from the teacher's house at the Ryerson Indian Day School, Stephen Partridge whom I have had looking the situation over informs me that the pipes are a solid block of ice and it may take some time before they will thaw out. I do not think it advisable to open up the drain as I think in the natural course of events the ice will thaw sufficient in the pipes to let the water get away. The weather is moderating somewhat.\n\nIn the meantime I have instructed the teacher to hold school in the hall where the children are quite comfortable. If it is the wish of the Department that I should open up the drain and have the ice knocked out of the pipes I shall do so, but I do not think this will be necessary as it will thaw sufficient in a day or so to allow the accumulated water in the cellar to get away.\n\nI am very much puzzled about the way this drain has been stopped up under the present occupants of the school. It never gave any trouble before. I expect to be at Parry Island in a day or so paying, and I am going to look the matter up and see if there is any way whereby we could force the ice out. I think it would be an expense to open up the drain and the possibilities are that\nthey might smash some of the pipes trying to get the ice out.\n\nI have had Stephen Partridge working on this for one day, but will not send in his bill for the work until I have word from the Department that they approve of my actions in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your T-5534 of the 19th instant, with reference to the drain at the Ryerson Indian Day School.

Fenn, Parry Sound, Ont., for Supplies for Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated April 5th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of April 23rd, 22-3-5, re the painting of the school buildings and teachers houses at Ryerson, Shawanaga, and Lower French Indian Day schools, I have visited the reserves recently and following are the conclusions I have come to:\n\nThe Lower French School and teacher's residence can get along nicely with nothing done to the interior but they are badly in need of painting outside. I think it would be arranged to have some of the Indians paint the buildings on the outside at Lower French. I have not much faith in the Indians painting as they make it patchy, but there are one or two white people there that I could get to do this satisfactorily. The Department could pay the paint and pay them by the wages for the job, holding them down to a certain number of days.\n\nAs to the Ryerson school, it will be necessary to do some plastering, calsoining, and painting of the ceiling of the school, calsoining and painting of the doors and wainscoting in the interior of the house.\n\nIn the Shawanaga Teacher's house, the plaster is in very bad shape. Where there are only a few places that are broken there is quite a lot of the ceiling and walls cracked and when the plastering would start it might turn out to be a big job, that is, where the workmen would start out to do one yard of plastering it might turn out to be ten yards.\n\nThe man doing the plastering could do the calsoining. There is some work to be done on the verandah of the teachers house at Shawanaga. I have a requisition for this, but was leaving the whole job to be done at the one time.\nThe tradesman doing the Ryerson teacher's house could do the Shawanaga teacher's house, too.\n\nIf the Department approves of my suggestions I will get a tradesman to look over the work. I think I can get it done at a reasonable price at the present time as the men are in need of work. It would not be advisable to get Indian labour to do this work as they do not know anything about plastering and would only make a mess of the job.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Daly\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your T-5167, which has just been received, I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department is not prepared to incur any expenditure in painting the Lower French River Indian Day School and teacher's residence this year.\n\nWith reference to the plastering, kalsomining and interior painting required at the Ryerson and Shawanaga Schools, you may have a tradesman look over this work and obtain a price from him. This information should be forwarded to the Department and the expenditure required at each school should be stated separately. You should, also, give the name and address of the tradesman whom you recommend be given the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nMay 21, 1935,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of May 13th, 22-3-5, with reference to the plastering, kalsomining and interior painting required at the Ryerson and Shawanaga Schools, according to the Department's instructions I have interviewed a tradesman, Mr. Percy Emes of Parry Sound, who is a good tradesman, and will do the job correctly. This man was recommended by Col. Arthur.\n\nHe will do the work on time, the department supplying the material. This I think is the cheapest way to get this thing done. I know Mr. Emes to be a real decent fellow and I think he will give satisfaction. He charges 60\u00a2 an hour for himself and 30\u00a2 for his labour. Mr. Emes will not make an estimate as he thinks it would not be fair, he might charge too much. I would recommend that this man's offer to do the work, be accepted.\n\nTrusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJMD/EK.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 25th, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, please let me know the approximate length of time that will be required to do the work at the Ryerson and Shawanaga Indian Day Schools. Our funds are limited and we require a fairly accurate estimate of the cost before a definite decision can be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nJohn M. Daly, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ont.\nParry Sound, Ont.,\nMay 29th, 1935,\n\nT-6190\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to yours of May 25th, 22-3-5, re the approximate length of time that would be required to do the work at the Ryerson and Shawanaga Indian Day Schools, I have to state that the approximate wages for Shawanaga would be about, $43.20, and about the same for the Ryerson Indian Day School.\n\nThe material would have to be supplied by the Department, which would not exceed $20.00, or the approximate cost for the two jobs and travelling expenses would be somewhere around $146.40. If possible we will keep within this. There will be no charges except for actual work done.\n\nTrusting this is the information required and that the Department will give permission for the work to be done as it is very necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\n\nJMD/BK.\nOttawa, June 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, stating the approximate length of time that would be required to carry out the plastering, kalsomining and interior painting necessary at the Ryerson and Shawanaga Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may purchase the materials required, from firms on the approved list, and arrange with Percy Emes, of Parry Sound, to perform the work. You should forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the materials for each school, separately, and also returns of the labour, in triplicate, for each school. These returns should show the number of days employed and the rate paid per day or per hour.\n\nPlease have this work carried out during the coming summer holidays and see that a satisfactory job is completed at each of the schools. It is noted that the cost for the two jobs, including travelling expenses, will be, approximately, $146.40. You should see that all expense in connection with the work is kept as low as possible, having in view the completing of a satisfactory job.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

G. Slaght, K.C., M.P. for Parry Sound District, he talked to me about the painting of the Shawanaga Indian Day School and in the course of conversation I explained to him that there are two other schools to paint, one Parry Island and the other Lower French.\n\nWe talked of Widow Wm. Fritsche, who has a man by the name of Nurnberg employed to do the painting, and I explained to Mr. Slaght that Nurnberg had painted my house and made a good job of it and I was sure that he would make a first class job of the school at the price quoted. Mr. Slaght asked me if it was satisfactory for me to have Mrs. Fritsche get the contract with Nurnberg to do the work for her, and I told him that I was satisfied that we would get a better job done on the schools than has ever been done before. He advised me to go ahead and get the work done as the weather is suitable.\n\nI might explain to the Department that this is the first time I have ever been interviewed by the member for the District in connection with work, and I would appreciate it very much if the Department will advise me that Mrs. Wm. Fritsche can have the contracts for the schools as follows:\n\n- Parry Island - $200.00\n- Lower French - $230.00\n- Shawanaga - $230.00\n\nI am perfectly satisfied that I can get a good job done.\nfor this money. I should state that these schools have been long overdue for painting and I am anxious to see that the best possible job will be done on a two coat job.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would say if I can go ahead and get the painting done.\n\nThere is a lot of painting being done in this section of the country at the present time and as one of these schools is out of the way I would like to have them all done by the end of August, if possible.\n\nThe consideration of the Department in this matter by return mail, if possible, will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) John M. Daly,\nAgent.\n\nJMD/EK.\nOttawa, July 16, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the painting of three Indian Day Schools in the Parry Sound agency, viz.: Shawanaga, Lower French River and Ryerson (Parry Island).\n\nYou were written yesterday, regarding the painting of the exterior of the Shawanaga Indian Day School and teacher's residence.\n\nThe Department will approve of you making the same arrangements for the purchase of materials and for the carrying out of the work at the Lower French and Parry Island Schools as in the case at Shawanaga. You should arrange for the purchase of the materials, paints, oils, etc., from the McKinley Hardware Company, Parry Sound, or other firms on the approved list, and the work can be performed by Mr. Nurnberg, in the employ of Mr. Wm. Fritsche. It is understood that Indian labour will be utilized to assist Mr. F. Nurnberg in carrying out the work.\n\nI may say that the funds provided for the painting at each of these schools are as follows:\n\nShawanaga - $230.00\nLower French - $230.00\nRyerson (Parry Island) - $200.00\n\nThe total cost of material and labour at each school should not exceed the amount provided. After all work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the paint, etc., and returns, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated.\n\nIt is noted that the Federal member for the constituency approves of the work being carried out as stated above. The matter of colours of paint and the work to be done for the funds provided will be left in your hands.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. M.

In my opinion, it would be useless to fix the wall around the stairway without fixing the portion of the main wall which is broken.\n\nI also find that the shingles are half off the roof of one lavatory, and that the steps leading to one of the school entrances, are in very bad condition. There are also three panes of glass out of the basement windows.\n\nThese three last items mentioned, would not cost very much. The main expense would be the cement work.\n\nI would be glad if you would give this matter your consideration and advise me.\n\nThanking you, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG. M. TAYLOR,\n(Acting) Indian Agent,\nPARKY SOUND, ONTARIO.\n\nGM: BNG\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJuly 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may arrange for the necessary repairs to the wall of the Ryerson Indian Day School, also repairs required to the toilet and entrance steps. The three panes of glass in the basement windows may be replaced.\n\nThe cost of the above should be kept as low as possible.\n\nIn future you should give an estimate of the cost of any repairs which you suggest be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nG.

Some of these estimates may appear high but the fact is that various repairs which were put off during the war years have accumulated.\n\nThe largest amount is for the Gibson Day School, the bulk of which is for fencing the school grounds and the erection of two new toilets. Authority was granted last year for these toilets to the amount of $112.00. I was unable to proceed with the work last year due to both the shortage of material and labour. I propose, if possible, to have it done this summer but a review of the situation shows the costs to be considerably increased due to prices of both material and labour.\n\nI would be glad to have these costs for the various schools passed if at all possible but should it not be possible to pass on the amounts requested because of non-inclusion in the estimates, you might indicate what amounts would be available for expenditure on the various schools and I will have as much as possible completed this year and the balance next year. Your prompt attention to this will be appreciated as I would like to have the work completed during the summer holidays.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nOttawa, July 15th, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin, Indian Agent,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the\n10th instant, the Department approves an expend-\niture of $216.00 for material and labour in\nmaking necessary repairs to the school and teacher's\nresidence on the Ryerson Reserve.\n\nBernard F.

Hardwood flooring requires to be laid where the teacher's platform was taken out last year and the porch on the building needs considerable repair.\n\nAt the Lower French School the woodshed has collapsed and will require to be rebuild entirely. There is also some work to be done on the foundation of the school proper.\n\nAt the Ryerson School on Parry Island the kitchen drain has blocked up on various occasions with the result that the cellar has been flooded for lengthy periods. I believe that the drain will have to be dug up throughout its whole length and replaced.\n\nIf these expenditures are possible, I would be obliged if you would give me an accountable advance of $350.00 to pay for labour. Materials may all be purchased locally and the work will be done in all cases by Indian labour with the exception of the windows for the Shawanaga School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Samuel Devlin\nIndian Superintendent.\n| DATE       | ARTICLES                  | FOLIO | DEBIT AMOUNT | CREDIT AMOUNT | TOTAL |\n|------------|---------------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|-------|\n| May 8th    | To I master no 8 padlock  | 1     | 35           |               |       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Devlin,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nRyerson Indian Day School.\n\nThe Estimates for 1949/50 have now been approved by the Treasury Board and we are in a position to advise you that we have the sum of $14,000.00 to spend on the erection of a one-room school and attached teacher's residence at the above school. This is intended to be a new building, preferably in the same school yard, and would not be an addition to the present school.\n\nPlease find attached the following documents:\n\n(a) Information Report to be completed by you on this project (three copies are to be filled, one for your files and two to be mailed here).\n\n(b) A blueprint, plan 836.\n\nWe feel that this school will be quite satisfactory for your purposes at Ryerson and the only change will have to be the provision of electricity. We are writing to the Hydro Electric Commission for the preparation of a lighting plan for this type of building. I presume, from previous correspondence, that you will wish to have tenders called for the erection of this building. However, your knowledge of local conditions will be necessary to advise the Department in this regard. It is\npresumed that there will be sufficient space in the present school yard for the new building. In orienting this building, please note that it is designed to face in a southerly direction, but that the wall of windows could be faced towards the east. I would suggest that you send in a small sketch of how you propose to locate the school on the present property. You should also indicate whether additional land will be required.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n1. Name: School Parry Island Day School No. 2. Agency: Parry Sound\n\n3. Type of Day School (including Plan No.): One room school with attached teacher's residence. Plan No. 158.\n\n4. Recommendation for method of constructing school (e.g., Day Labour, Prefabrication, Contract): Day Labour.\n\n5. If day labour, list names and addresses of firms supplying following requirements (for information of Departmental Purchasing Agent):\n   (a) Bricks, lime, etc.: Beaver Lumber Co., Parry Sound\n      G.F. Jacklin, Parry Sound\n   (b) Lumber: Beaver Lumber Co., Parry Sound\n      G.F. Jacklin, Parry Sound\n   (c) Millwork: Beaver Lumber Co., Parry Sound\n      G.F. Jacklin, Parry Sound\n   (d) Hardware: Wm. Beatty Co., Parry Sound\n      McMillan Hardware, Parry Sound\n   (e) Heating; Plumbing; Electrical (see #10)\n\n6. If day labour, give name, address and rate per hour of foreman-carpenter recommended:\n   Christopher Junkin, Parry Sound\n   Rate: $1.50 per hour\n\n7. If by tender, give names of local newspapers in which you recommend we advertise:\n\n8. Give complete details as to shipping instructions for supplies to this school:\n   c/o Indian Unit, Parry Sound, Ont.\n\n9. The first step in the construction of any School is the location of water. Have you had a well dug, and if so, with what success?\n   All already dug close to school building. Intend to have it cleaned out and samples analysed.\n\n10. Normally we do not provide one and two room Day Schools with electricity or running water unless hydro is available in the immediate vicinity of the school. Please state if hydro is available for this project.\n    Will be able to have it installed.\n\n11. What type of fuel would you recommend:\n    Wood.\n\n12. What steps, if any, will be necessary to secure title to the selected school site?\n    Arrangements to purchase site from Indian owner and am submitting tentative agreement of sale.\n\n13. Has an official of the Education Division assisted you in selecting this site?\n    Regional Supervisor Norris agreed with me on site.\n\n14. Have you oriented the proposed school on the site? Yes.\n    Remember: 1. The \"Wall of windows\" is designed by the Architects to face SOUTH\n    2. Elevation should insure adequate drainage.\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 27 with reference to the proposed new school building on the Perry Island Reserve. The Regional Supervisor, Mr. Morris was recently a visitor here and we looked over the proposed site for this building and he agreed with me that it would be the most satisfactory location. This location will be directly across the main Reserve road from the old school and is high enough to insure drainage. The site, however, is in the ownership of an Indian, Gilbert Tabobandung and I have arranged to purchase from him one acre of land at a price of $25.00. I am enclosing a tentative agreement of sale and would be obliged if you would have the proper document drawn up and submitted to me for his signature. Gilbert Tabobandung holds approximately five acres of land, having a frontage on the road of approximately 416 feet and a depth of 625 feet. This was allotted to him by resolution of the Perry Island Band Council dated August 6, 1942. I am enclosing a sketch showing the location also two copies of the information report.\n\nThere is a well at present close to the new school location and which will be on the land which it is proposed to purchase. It is my intention to have this well cleaned out and the water tested.\n\nI am recommending that the building be erected by day labour and can obtain the services of a foreman carpenter whom I believe to be an exceptionally good man and have seen him at work in charge of other buildings. There are only one or two contractors in town who might be interested in putting up this building on the basis of tender and I have not much confidence in their work and believe that we would get a much better job done in the manner I have suggested and at perhaps...\nless cost. I can very strongly recommend the man whom I have selected and whose name is Christopher Junck, a resident of Parry Sound. He will hold himself open for a few weeks and I would be pleased if final arrangements could be completed as soon as possible so that we may go ahead with the work and have the school, if possible, ready to open for the fall term.\n\nNo electricity is at present available on the Reserve but the Band Council have recently signed a resolution requesting that the Hydro Electric Power Commission extend their services to the Parry Island Reserve and I am taking this up with the Commission.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nMay 27, 1949.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ont.\n\nRyerson Indian Day School\n\nYour letter of May 10 has arrived, and the necessary action has been taken:\n\n1. A memorandum has been sent to the Deputy Minister requesting approval for the hiring of Mr. Christopher Junck of Parry Sound, Ont., as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\n2. A request has been sent to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for all the materials required for the construction of a one-room Indian Day School and residence, Plan 388. We have mentioned all the firms included on your information report.\n\n3. You should proceed to have the well cleaned and tested as soon as possible, as it is most important to have a satisfactory supply of water before proceeding with construction.\n\n4. As it will take approximately three weeks to one month before building materials start arriving, I do not feel you will be able to do much more than the excavation before the end of June. The cement usually takes at least three weeks.\n\nIf the cement arrives and Purchase Orders have not been issued for the lumber, then wire me and we can arrange for an authority for local purchase of the form lumber required for the foundation. Then Mr. Junck can at least proceed with this part of the building.\n5. When the building has been started, please write me immediately, and I will send you a set of blueprints and specifications covering the installation of electrical wiring in this building. You can then obtain tenders from local electricians for wiring the building as it is erected. It will be cheaper to have it done then than to wait until next year when Hydro is available.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, May 27, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Ryerson Indian Day School\nParry Sound Indian Agency, Ont.\n\nIncluded in our 1949-50 Estimates is the sum of $14,000.00 for the erection of a one-room school and teachersage on the Ryerson Reserve, Parry Sound, Ont. This is to be a second classroom to the school already erected there. Mr. Indian Superintendent Devlin has recommended that this building be erected by day labour using a foreman-carpenter and local Indians. In his letter to the Department recommending that we employ Mr. Christopher Junck of Parry Sound, Ontario, at the rate of $1.50 per hour, Mr. Devlin makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am recommending that the building be erected by day labour and can obtain the services of a foreman carpenter whom I believe to be an exceptionally good man and have seen him at work in charge of other buildings.

This is to be a second classroom to the school already erected there. Mr. Indian Superintendent Devlin has recommended that this building be erected by day labour using a foreman-carpenter and local Indians. In his letter to the Department recommending that we employ Mr. Christopher Junck of Parry Sound, Ontario, at the rate of $1.50 per hour, Mr. Devlin makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am recommending that the building be erected by day labour and can obtain the services of a foreman carpenter whom I believe to be an exceptionally good man and have seen him at work in charge of other buildings. There are only one or two contractors in town who might be interested in putting up this building on the basis of tender and I have not much confidence in their work and believe that we would get a much better job done in the manner I have suggested and at perhaps less cost. I can very strongly recommend the man whom I have selected and whose name is Christopher Junck, a resident of Parry Sound. He will hold himself open for a few weeks and I would be pleased if final arrangements could be completed as soon as possible so that we may go ahead with the work and have the school, if possible, ready to open for the fall term.\"\nI would recommend, therefore, that you approve the erection of this one-room school by day labour and the employment of Mr. Christopher Junck of Parry Sound, Ontario, as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister\n\n[T.R.T.

These repairs are considerably overdue and I would like to get them done if possible during the summer holidays.\n\nIn order to do this, it might be necessary to employ other than Indian labour for the bulk of the work as at this time of the year the majority of the Indians are absent from the Reserves on their summer vocation as tourist guides.\n\nAs will be seen from the schedule, the materials required will amount to $535.00 and the labour I have estimated at $490.00. The materials may be purchased locally and if you approve of these repairs, I would wish to have an accountable advance of $490.00 as soon as possible to take care of the labour charges.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nRyerson Indian Day School.\n\nReshingling roof\n\nMaterial\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Shingles      | 20 sq. | 175.00 |\n| Valleys       |        | 15.00  |\n| Ridge Roll    |        | 10.00  |\n| Felt paper    |        | 15.00  |\n| Total Material|        | 215.00 |\n\nLabour\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 125.00 |\n| Total Labour | 340.00 |\n\nRepairs to Vestibule\n\nNew doors, door frames, flooring, etc.\n\nMaterial\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 90.00 |\n\nLabour\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 75.00 |\n| Total Labour | 165.00 |\n\nPainting Outside\n\nMaterial\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 60.00 |\n\nLabour\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 140.00 |\n| Total Labour | 200.00 |\n\nShawanage Day School\n\nReshingling roof\n\nMaterial\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 120.00 |\n\nLabour\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 75.00 |\n| Total Labour | 195.00 |\n\nPainting Outside\n\nMaterial\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 50.00 |\n\nLabour\n\n| Item | Cost |\n|------|------|\n|      | 75.00 |\n| Total Labour | 125.00 |\nJuly 15, 1949.\n\nMr. Samuel Devlin,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing statement regarding repairs to the Ryerson and Shawanaga Indian Day Schools. It is noted that you estimate the cost of the materials will be $535.00 and the labour $490.00.\n\nIn order to comply with departmental purchasing regulations, it will be necessary for you to forward a requisition for the materials required so that they may be purchased from the Departmental Purchasing Agent. The requisition should contain specific information regarding the quantities and types of material necessary, and if you have any prices from local merchants you should also attach them for the guidance of the Departmental Purchasing Agent. When we receive the requisition for submission to the Departmental Purchasing Agent, we will arrange to forward you an accountable advance for labour.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMcN\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nEducation Division.\n\nI am in receipt of your telegram of yesterday's date with reference to material for the new school on Ferry Island. The Beaver Lumber Company are prepared to give a complete quotation but were unable to do so in the first instance as they had not been supplied with a blueprint. I have a copy of this blueprint which I will let them have temporarily so that they may complete their estimate.\n\nC. F. Jacklin are not prepared to quote on the entire bill but will send you in a quotation on the items which they can supply.\n\nI understand that the cement has been ordered from the Canada Cement Company and as this is the first item on our building program, I would be obliged if this could be sent forward immediately. I am endeavouring to hold a couple of key men here for the job and have so far been able to keep them occupied in preparing the ground work and making excavations but these are now completed.\n\nSamuel Devlin,\nIndian Superintendent.\nE4\nSee me\nwith POS\nthis school\nSend the following message, subject to the conditions on the back thereof, which are hereby agreed to.\n\nFile: 423-5 (E.l)\n\nMr. S.

Devlin,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nParry Sound, Ontario.\n\nThis refers to your letter of July 29th in connection with your voucher 456 for Credit Voucher amounting to $241.75.\n\nWhen your Labour Returns for the week ending July 9th and 16th were received, a Credit Voucher for $249.00, being the gross salary paid was made up and forwarded to Treasury for payment. This voucher has now been paid.\n\nWhen your voucher was received, the case was brought to the attention of Treasury officials and it was noted that on your voucher you did not include the Income Tax deductions and Employers' Share of the Unemployment Insurance. We, on the other hand showed the Income Tax Deductions but not the Employers' share of the Unemployment Insurance.\n\nThe Treasury Branch are requesting that for every vouchered labour return you pay the Unemployment Insurance, both employers and employees share; and the Income Tax which should be sent to the local Income Tax Office, and then prepare a voucher for the amount of the Gross Salary paid plus the employers share of the Unemployment Insurance. Also quote the cheque number sent to the Income Tax office.\nThis means that in the case of these two pay lists the voucher should have read for $149.70, as the voucher for $149. has been put through. In order to keep the books straight you should place another voucher for 70\u00a2 to clean up the Employers share of the Unemployment Insurance providing the employee concerned has had his stamp placed in a book. If the latter has not been done it should be done and your bookkeeping that far will be complete.\n\nTrusting this information will assist you in keeping your books in order and in agreement with Treasury records.\n\nBernard F.

Bonin\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians residing at Long Lake Region are very desirous to have a school for the benefit of their children at the said place. The children of school age number between 10 and 20 residing at the same place. It seems to me very desirable to have a school open for them there, they are willing to let the school at their own expense, provided the government furnish them with boards and shingles for the building. Mr. John Black will probably be able to build the house himself and teach school to those children if the Department is willing to appoint him for the purpose. I hope that you will do all in your power to have a school opened there.\n\nI remain your humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMissionary Priest.\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose communication from the Rev Father Dugas asking on behalf of the Indians at Sandy Point on Lake Nepigon, to have a School erected at that Place.\n\nYou will notice the Rev Father says that there are, from 15 to 20 Children of School age.\n\nHe says also that the Indians are willing to furnish their own time and also the Logs for the Sides of the building, providing they be furnished with the Lumber for the Floor and the Roof.\n\nThis would cost about as follows:\n\n1\" Boards $30.00\n2\"x4's 5.00\nShingles 10.00\nFreight 15.00\n\nTotal $60.00\n\nShould you feel disposed to grant them this expenditure, and that of a teacher you may let me hear from you.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nEuclid Bonin\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 11, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ult., enclosing a communication from the Rev. Father Hogan asking for the establishment of a school at Sandy Point, on Lake Nipigon, and in reply I beg to say that the Department cannot identify this place. You will, therefore, be good enough to furnish a sketch showing the position of the locality so that it may be identified on the map.\n\nYou should also state what band of Indians are resident there. The Department is under the impression that there are some stragglers from the Red Rock band, who have located in this vicinity. The census returns do not show any Indians belonging to Sandy Point.\n\nUpon receipt of this information the application will be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nShield Bonin, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nMAP OF NEPIGON RIVER\n\nPUBLISHED BY WM.

McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI beg to report that the Indians of Sand Point Lake Nepigon\u2014as reported last year again ask that a school be opened at their village, they have from 15 to 20 children who will attend.\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 23, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th ult., which only reached the Department on the 15th inst., I beg to say that for reasons already advanced on two previous occasions the Department is not prepared to open a school for the Indians of the Red Rock band residing at Sand Point.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nNeil McDeugall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nFor some time I have had correspondence with the Indians at Sand Point re establishment of a School.\n\nSome months ago I told them that if they got out logs for the building and gave their labor free that the Dept. would likely furnish the flooring, roofing, windows, doors and nails. Last week they wrote to the effect that they were commencing to cut the logs for a building 18' x 26'. I wrote them that the building should be 20' x 30'.\n\nKindly advise if I may purchase the material required. Should the Indians give their labor free.\n\nThere are more children at Sand Point the year around than at any other Village in the agency except Mountain Road.\n\nThere are between 20 and 30 children of school age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.R. Brown\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Brown, Port Arthur, requests that the Department supply flooring, roofing, windows, doors and nails to the Indians of the Sand Point Reserve to enable them to complete a log school building which they intend to erect. The Indians intend to get out the logs and do the entire labour free.\n\nSand Point is situated on Orient Bay, Lake Nipigon, near the Ontario Government fishing station. It is in the centre of a tourist region. The Agent states that there are between 20 and 30 children of school age. Mr. Paget informed me that while he was there last summer he was frequently asked by Americans why the Government did not provide a school for the Indian children who are running wild around the place. He states that a school is urgently required for the Indians of this reserve.\n\nThe Agent has not furnished an estimate of the cost of supplying the above material, but I would like to advise that he be authorized to purchase the flooring, roofing, windows, doors and nails required, and also that he oversee and be responsible for the carrying out of this work.\n\nIf the school is erected, it will be necessary to supply desks and equipment and also pay the salary of a teacher. These Indians are members of the Red Rock Band and have no funds of their own. The cost of the material now asked for and the equipment of the school could be provided for out of the current year's estimates.\nOttawa, April 17, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant informing the Department that the Indians of Sand Point Reserve intend to erect a building for a day school and requesting that the Department assist them by furnishing the flooring, roofing, windows, doors and nails required.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department recognizes the need of a school for the Indian children at Sand Point and is pleased that the Indians are taking steps to erect a suitable building for school purposes.\n\nThe Department will pay the cost of the flooring, roofing, windows, doors and nails required and you may take the necessary steps to purchase this material and have it delivered at the site of the new school. Before making the purchases, however, you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers handling these supplies and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price in each case. In making these purchases you should be guided in all respects by the requirements of the War Purchasing Commission. You should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred, together with the quotations received by you. The Department agrees with you that dimensions of the building should be twenty by thirty feet to accommodate the number of children of school age. It is to be distinctly understood that the labour required in the erection of the building is to be performed by the Indians free of any charge. You should oversee the work from time to time as it progresses and see that it is being carried on and completed according to your instructions. The Department will be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to the progress that is being made.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nmade in the erection of the building.\n\nAs soon as the building is ready for occupation\nthe question of providing desks and equipment and the engaging\nof a teacher's services will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nThe School for Sand Point.\n\nI have just had an interview with John Fitzback and he would sell his house for $500.00.\n\nThis house could be used as a school and for living quarters for the teacher and would be cheaper than supplying material for a new building.\n\nThis house is situated on land just outside of the Sand Point Reserve and Fitzback's right to it is a squatters right only. However, I would recommend the purchase as the building would be suitable for school purposes for a few years and it could be used any time it is decided to erect a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 26, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you recommend that the house of John Fitzback be purchased for the sum of $500.00 and fitted up as a school and living quarters for the teacher at Sand Point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as this house is not situated on an Indian reserve, the Department cannot consider its purchase. If, however, Fitzback will consent to lease this house at a reasonable rental, the Department would be disposed to lease the same for school purposes for a year. If the results attained by that time would warrant the building of a school on the reserve this matter would then receive consideration. You should take the necessary steps to see whether you can rent this house and inform the Department as to the amount of rent required. It can then be fitted up and used for school purposes and Mrs. McLaren, who is at present teaching at the Mission Bay School, can be transferred there as teacher.\n\nIf you succeed in obtaining the house you should state what would be required in the way of having a class-room fitted up for school purposes, also, if desks are required, whether suitable ones for the purpose could not be made at the place. It is considered that the Indians themselves should perform any labour required in having the house fitted up for school purposes.\n\nI may point out that no reply was received from you to official letter of April 17th, last, regarding the erection of a building for school purposes by the Indians, towards which the Department authorized you to purchase, flooring, roofing, windows, nails, etc., required. You should state why these instructions were not carried out.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 36th ultimo and note that house belonging to John Fitchback cannot be purchased. I will ascertain if this house can be rented or bought.\n\nIf this building is rented desks can be shipped from the Bay Flats School and store chairs etc., can be brought from the Grand Bay camp. The Indians did not erect a building as they claimed that they could not obtain horses to draw the logs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 6, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in reference to the renting of the house from John Fitzback for school purposes at Sand Point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as soon as you have been able to come to an arrangement with Fitzback, which should be submitted for the consideration of the Department, further instructions will be sent you regarding the fitting up of the house. You should give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nRe School for Band Point.\n\nI have been unable to get a reply from John Fitzgibb since I informed him that I refused to purchase his house on account of it not being situated on the land.\n\nIt is not likely that he will rent the house as he is anxious to sell.\n\nIf the Department is not prepared to purchase this house I would purchase it from Fitzgibb provided that the Department would rent it from me at ten dollars per month until it is considered advisable to build.\n\nIt is advisable to open a school at Sand Point without further delay as this has developed into a permanent settlement by a large number of Indians. It is also during the last few years there has been a great increase in the number of Indians living there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.R. Brown\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6159, file 424-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nRe School for Sand Point.\n\nI have been unable to get a reply from John Fitzgibbon since I informed him that he refused to purchase his house on account of it not being situated on the cleared land.\n\nIt is not likely that he will rent the house as he is anxious to sell. If the Department is not prepared to purchase this house I would purchase it from Fitzgibbon provided that the Department would rent it from me at ten dollars per month until it is considered advisable to build.\n\nIt is advisable to open a school at Sand Point without further delay as this has developed into a permanent settlement for a large number of Indians.

As it is desired to open the school at Sand Point as soon as possible, you should complete your arrangements to purchase the house. It should then be fitted up by you for school purposes.\n\nIt is noted by your letter of the 9th instant that you intend to have the desks in the Pays Plat School shipped from that point to provide seating accommodation at Sand Point. You may arrange as soon as the building is ready to have the desks transferred and also purchase a stove, chairs, etc., required. Before making the purchase of the stove, chairs, etc., you should obtain competitive prices for these articles and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred, to which should be attached a memorandum showing the quotations received by you.\n\nWith reference to the rent, you should furnish vouchers from time to time covering the amount due, when payment will be made.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of August 26th, last, Mrs. McLaren, who is at present teaching at the Mission Bay School, can be transferred to Sand Point as teacher when the school is ready for occupation.\n\nYou should furnish the size of any blackboards required and these will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nW. R. Brown, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOffice, and also a requisition should be forwarded for the school material required, such as stationery, books, etc., and these will also be forwarded.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you as soon as you have become the owner of the house and have it ready for school purposes, which it is hoped you will be able to do at an early date.\n\nMrs. McLaren will be allowed salary at the same rate as she received at Mission Bay, namely, $500.00 per annum, with bonus additional.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sparks, D.O.H.\nDistrict No.7\n\nSubject: Visit to \"Sand Point\"\nBand of Indians, Lake Nipigon\nThunder Bay District.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 14th instant, re \"Complaint sent to the Indian Agent, Port Arthur,\" I have the honour to advise that, on the 15th inst., I visited the \"Sand Point\" Band of Indians located on the shores of Lake Nipigon about two miles from Macdiarmid. I was accompanied on this visit by R.C.M.P. Constable W.M. Campbell who is stationed at Nipigon, Ontario.\n\nThere are approximately 12 houses at Sand Point, also a few tents and tepees; and the number of Indians is said to be from 75 to 100. The surroundings are about the same as are found in any Indian village, and I do not see how a higher standard of cleanliness can be enforced unless a R.C.M.P. Constable visits the place about once weekly throughout the year.\n\nThe attached school inspection report will indicate that the present school building is a mere makeshift; and I would say that the majority of the school children were in a deplorable dirty condition. The teacher told me that her work is most discouraging as the children remain away from school if she endeavours to exercise the slightest authority over them. The names of 37 children appear on the school-roll (15 boys and 12 girls). 14 of these (6 boys and 8 girls) were present at school and were inspected on June 15/31. Four were excluded from school until discharging sores and other skin affections were cured (one other child not on the roll being forbidden to attend school for the same reason) and I may say that so many children has \"mite\" in their hair that if they had been excluded for this reason the school would be practically deserted.\n\nOf 13 absences from school, four were inspected, and one child Michel Metamagosis age 6 years, was found to have a large chronic discharging ulcer on the left index finger, which was swollen to about twice or three times its normal size. This child's left eye was also infected, and discharging pus; and on the left side of his neck was a discharging gland. He was in a most wretched condition and should immediately be removed to a hospital (I was told afterwards that one had been in the same condition as his left hand but I neglected to look at his feet). Five other children (pre-school age or names not on school-roll) were inspected. A child Harry Metamagosis, age 3 years (brother of Michel M.) was found to be suffering from pustular conjunctivitis affecting both eyes. This child will likely become totally blind if the condition is not treated properly, and he should immediately be sent to a hospital. The parents should be compelled to submit to examination to determine whether or not they show evidence of venereal disease.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs should engage with one of the doctors at Nipigon or Jolliet to visit Sand Point once a week to inspect the school and endeavour to clear up the discharging sores and skin affections from which so many of the children are suffering. It is apparently impossible to change the habits of Indians, but something may be done with the children if they are enabled to attend school in a clean and attractive building, also if they are compelled to be present at school, and to be clean during the time they are there. The school curriculum should devote as much time to elementary personal and home hygiene as is devoted to reading, spelling etc. For the obvious need of these people is the practical application of knowledge regarding cleanliness, both of the person and in the home whether it be tent or house. As Dr. Robertson truly states \"the Indians suffer unspeakable evils from lack of sanitary education\" and if the children were allowed to grow to adult life careless and ignorant of the most elementary rules of decent living, their condition will become worse instead of better.\n\nYesterday\nYesterday, the 16th, I saw Mr. W.R. Brown, Indian Agent at Port Arthur and I gave him an outline of conditions as I found them at Sand Point. I also attach for your information a copy of some written recommendations which I have today sent to Agent Brown.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. G.L.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indians Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFebruary 15th, 1926.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, has discussed the day school situation at Pic, Sand Point, Herbert and Gull Bay. At one time or another schools were in operation at all four of these Reserves. Mr. Burk is of the opinion that there will be an agitation for the reopening of these schools. He considers it advisable to experiment with one Reserve, and suggests Pic as the most promising. A summer school might be granted here, as there is an old schoolhouse. Books would be required and, if the work was continued during the winter months, arrangements would have to be made to put the building in good shape.\n\nI have not suggested to Mr. Burk that he advocate commencing a school at Pic, but if the demand is strong enough we might favourably consider the matter.\nSir,\n\nFor your information and consideration I beg to report that while on a recent inspection of the Sand Point Indian Reserve I found that there are in the neighbourhood of about 30 children of school age and the members of the Band are very anxious that a school be opened at that point by the Department and they assured me that they would insist that the children would faithfully attend the same.\n\nShould the Department consider the opening of a school on this Reserve, a building could be rented for the time being, as a temporary summer school. There are old desks there which could be used for the present and I feel sure that it would be appreciated if a school was opened, as the parents are very anxious to have the children educated, but do not care for them to be sent from home to a boarding school.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the reopening of a school on the Sand Point Indian Reserve during the coming summer and stating the arrangements that could be made for carrying on the work.\n\nAs stated in our letter relative to the reopening of the Pic School, our funds are limited and unless we have definite assurance that it is urgent that the school be opened, we could not undertake the providing of the funds required this year for the purpose.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear further from you as to the urgency for the reopening of this school, or whether you would recommend that the matter remain in abeyance during the coming summer or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\u2014 Referring to your file No.9-10-I, relating to the re-opening of the Sand Point Indian Reserve summer school, I beg to advise that I have taken this matter up with the Rev Joseph Couture., S.J., of Nipigon and we are of the opinion that the matter be held in abeyance until next year.\n\nRev Father Couture suggests that when the school is re-opened, a Roman Catholic teacher be procured from Spanish, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa., Ont.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, informing the Department that, after taking the matter up with the Rev. Joseph Couture, you are of the opinion that the reopening of the school on the Sand Point Indian Reserve can be held in abeyance until next year. No further action need be taken by you relative to this school at the present time.\n\nWe have noted the suggestion made by Father Couture regarding the appointment of a Roman Catholic teacher when this school is reopened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nToronto, March 7th, 1927.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to state that information has been received to the effect that there are thirty-seven children of school age who are of Indian parentage and are located on Sand Point Indian Reserve in the neighbourhood of MacDiarmid on the shores of Lake Nipigon. These children are not provided with school accommodation. Would you be kind enough to inform the Department whether their status entitles them to the provision of school accommodation through the Department of Indian Affairs?\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nSchools Branch,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the Deputy Minister, Department of Education, Toronto, relative to the need of establishing school facilities for the Indian children residing on the Sand Point Indian Reserve, in the neighbourhood of MacDiarmid.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to your letter of April 29, 1926, and previous correspondence. The Department will be pleased to have a report from you as to whether you would advise that a school be re-opened at this point and, if so, whether it would be possible to rent a suitable building with a view to giving this school a trial during the coming summer.\n\nIf the activity proved a success and the parents saw that their children attended regularly, the question of the erection of a building could then receive consideration. Would the Indians get out and how the logs required and do the work in putting up the building, providing the Department save them rations during the time they were doing the work and also if the necessary finishing materials, such as windows, doors, shingles, hardware, etc., were supplied?\n\nThis matter should receive your consideration, but, in the meantime, I would be pleased to hear whether you would recommend that the school be re-opened this summer if a rented building can be obtained. We understand from your letter above referred to that there are old desks at this point, which could be used for the present and which would be satisfactory until a new building is erected. Any suggestions you have to make regarding the advisability of re-opening the school will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJames O. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, March 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the providing of school facilities for the Indian children residing on the Sand Point Indian Reserve, in the neighbourhood of Macdiarmid.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a school was conducted at this point for two years previous to July, 1922, at which time it was closed. Our experience with day schools on the outlying reserves in the Thunder Bay district has not been satisfactory, owing to the lack of interest by the parents and the irregular attendance.\n\nWe are communicating with the local Indian Agent at Fort Arthur, requesting him to state whether a suitable building could be obtained in which to conduct classroom work at Sand Point and if he would advise that the school be re-opened. Should he recommend the re-opening of the school, favourable consideration will be given to providing the expenditure required for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.H.U. Colquhoun, Esq., B.A., LL.D.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th inst., file number 9-10-1, relative to the possibility of reopening and establishing a Day School on the Sand Point Indian Reserve. On a recent visit to this Reserve the same question was introduced as referred to in my letter of April 29, 1926, namely that a School be opened this summer.\n\nReferring to the second paragraph of your letter, I may state that there is a suitable building that can be rented for this purpose. This can be fixed temporarily with the old desks.\n\nIf the School proves a success the Band will cut the timber and hew the logs and do the necessary carpenter work in building the School, if the Department provide rations.\n\nI would recommend the advisability of re-opening a School at this point as soon as possible, as I feel sure that the children would attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, relative to the reopening of a day school on the Sand Point Indian Reserve. In this connection it is noted that you recommend the advisability of reopening this school as soon as possible, that a suitable building for carrying on the classroom work can be rented and that there are a sufficient number of desks on hand.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department will approve of this school being given a trial, its continuance to depend upon the attendance of the Indian children, and the success achieved in the work. It will be necessary to obtain the services of a qualified teacher, and I have to request that you will endeavor to secure the services of a teacher who would be satisfactory to carry on the work. This matter should receive your early attention and you should forward the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you. If you can obtain a teacher, you should then arrange for the rental of a building and have it fitted up for classroom work. If you forward a list of the material required for classroom work, the same will receive attention. No unnecessary expense should be incurred in the fitting up of the building secured. If the school is opened, it should be conducted throughout the summer months. After the school has been in operation for a period of, say, 6 months, we would then be in a position to decide, from the results achieved, as to whether it should be continued in operation, and the erection of a suitable building could be considered. It is noted that, if the school proves a success, the members of the Band would cut the timber, saw the logs and do the necessary carpenter's work in the erection of a new school building, providing the department supply them with rations during the period they are engaged in the work.\n\nPlease give the matter of obtaining a teacher and the rental of the building your prompt attention. I shall be pleased to hear at a later date regarding the teacher secured and the building rented.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nToronto, March 24th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March 10th with reference to educational facilities for Indian children at the Sand Point Indian Reserve, and note that you are communicating with your local Indian Agent with a view to the securing of a suitable building and the re-opening of a school for Indian children at this Reserve.\n\nOur Inspector Williams of Fort Arthur reported under date of February 28th, 1927, that there are thirty-seven children there of school age without school facilities.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter regarding the reopening of the Sand Point Indian Day School I beg to advise I have just been informed by the Chief of the above noted Band there is no accommodation for a teacher on this Reserve, as the only house suitable to accommodate the teacher was recently destroyed by fire. It will, therefore, be necessary to provide the teacher with a suitable house, which can be rented for $15.00 per month.\n\nWould you kindly advise me by return mail, or wire, if I may have the necessary authority to purchase the furniture, cooking utensils, etc., when a teacher has been secured for this school? No unnecessary expense will be involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nWaterloo Co.,\nGuelph, Ont.,\nApril 24/27.\n\nMr. J. G.

Would you kindly advise me if this application would be accepted by the Department?\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T.

F. MacKENZIE.\nOttawa, May 3rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters of the 30th ultimo, relative to the reopening of the Indian day school at Sand Point, and enclosing an application for the position as teacher, and also requesting authority to rent a suitable house for the teacher's use. In this connection I have to confirm the following night letter to you of today's date:\n\n\"Arrange rental of buildings for school purposes and for teacher's accommodation Sand Point and have them both fitted up. Supply furniture, cooking utensils, etc., absolutely necessary. Keep all expense low as possible. Offer Miss McAteer, 1 Waterloo Ave., Guelph, position at $65 per teaching month, informing her concerning nature of position.\"\n\nYou should make early arrangements for the renting of the building referred to in your letter of March 15th, last, and have it fitted up for classroom purposes. You should arrange to have the old desks which are on hand placed in this building.\n\nYou should also arrange for the rent of suitable accommodation for the teacher. We note that you estimate the same can be acquired for $15 per month. As advised by our telegram you may arrange for the purchase of a reasonable quantity of furniture, cooking utensils, etc. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. As it is intended that this school will be kept in operation for a period of approximately six months only, it will not be necessary for you to obtain any large supply of furnishings for the teacher.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Genevieve McAteer as teacher, and will allow her salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month. As instructed by our wire, you should inform her fully concerning the nature of the position, the period school will be kept in operation, that the school is only being conducted on trial and any other information she may require.\n\nIt will, no doubt, be necessary to forward a supply of classroom material, and I shall be pleased if you will have the teacher prepare and forward a requisition for what is needed, when same will be sent from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nIt is hoped that the Indian parents will take advantage of the facilities offered and see that their children attend school regularly, as the continuing of this work will depend entirely upon the success achieved during the coming summer. Please give the matter of arranging for the starting of this school your early attention and forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. S. Hawk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 23rd inst., file number 9-10-1, relative to reopening the Indian Day School at the Sand Point Indian Reserve, and requesting me to rent a suitable house for the teacher and to furnish her with cooking utensils. In reply I beg to advise I was very fortunate in being able to rent two suitable buildings, one for the teacher's residence and the other for the classroom. Both buildings are situated in the middle of the Reserve. This property is fenced in, and is suitable for children's recreation grounds.\n\nReferring to the 4th paragraph of your letter I did not think it advisable to rent the first building for the teacher's residence as I was told it had been previously occupied by a tubercular family. Consequently I rented the above two buildings at a rental of $50.00 per month for each building. The owner is willing to sell the property and the two buildings for $300.00, and will be satisfied to take a rental of $50.00 per month until the property is sold up. The two buildings could not be replaced for less than 7 or $800.00.\n\nReferring to the 5th paragraph of your letter I wish to advise that Miss Genevieve McAteer started teaching on the 17th of this month. I personally visited all the families on this Reserve, and the parents promised to see that their children attend school regularly. I think that the Department will be able to keep this school open as a permanent one, as I feel positive the attendance will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJ. G. Bark,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, informing the Department that Miss Genevieve McAlteer began duties as teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School on the 17th instant. It is also noted that you have been able to obtain a suitable house for the teacher's living quarters and a house in which to carry on classroom work - both buildings being centrally located and the grounds fenced and suitable for children's recreation.\n\nThe Department approves of the renting of the buildings referred to for the sum of $25 per month, each, and will pay the rental at that rate for a period of six months. It is understood that, at the end of that time, the amount paid as rental will cover the full purchase price of the buildings, viz.: $300. You should prepare and forward from time to time properly certified vouchers for the rent due, and, when the 6 months' period has elapsed, you should prepare and forward, in duplicate, a Quit Claim Deed (blank forms for the purpose enclosed) for the transfer from the owner to the Department of the two buildings with the grounds surrounding same. A proper description of the plot of land should be filled in in the deed.\n\nThe continuing of the school permanently will depend upon the success achieved during the first 6 months it is in operation. It is hoped there will be a full and regular attendance of all Indian children of school age and that the teacher will meet with every success in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

There are only two small stores here, and prices are beyond reason\u2014two prices for everything.\n\nPlease accept my resignation unless you can increase my salary at least $5.00 per month.\n\nKindly send my first month's cheque in care of your office, as I am nearly out of funds.\n\nIf my request is not granted will teach until June 30th.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Genevieve McAteer,\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nJune, 10, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe enclosed letter, which is self-explanatory, was just received today from Miss Genevieve McAteer, teacher at the Sand Point Indian Day School. As you will note the teacher complains about the price of merchandise at that point. I advised her that provisions could be purchased at Port Arthur at a very much cheaper price and advised her to send me in an order which would be placed with a wholesale company in Port Arthur, and her merchandise could be shipped direct to Sand Point.\n\nAs you will note the teacher is asking for an increase of $5.00 per month, and she will resign if the Department does not grant her this wish. Personally I would not recommend granting this increase and would recommend accepting her resignation.\n\nMiss McAteer advises me if the Department do not grant her request she would teach until June 30th, but would like to receive her first month's cheque by the 17th of this month. Her cheque could be sent in care of this office.\n\nI have a great number of applications on file and it would be a very easy matter to secure a new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G.

If she does not agree to remain after the end of the present month, you may engage the services of another teacher to succeed her. I note that you have a number of applications on file, and it is hoped, if Miss McAteer resigns, you will be able to nominate a teacher to succeed her, to begin duties on or about July 1st, next. If a new teacher is secured, you should forward the name, qualifications and experience for the approval of the department. Please ascertain from Miss McAteer whether she will remain or not.

We note the difficulty in obtaining food supplies at Sand Point, but it is understood that you could arrange to have provisions purchased at Port Arthur at a much cheaper price by placing your order with a wholesale firm, and the supplies would be shipped direct to you at Sand Point. If you do not care to remain as teacher after the end of the present month at the salary allowed, you should inform Mr. Agent Burk, who has been instructed, in the event of your resigning, to obtain the services of another teacher.\n\nA cheque in payment of your salary for the month ending the 17th instant has been sent in care of Mr. Agent Burk.

It is hoped, however, that you will be able to return and resume duties at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn preparing your return showing attendance, days taught, etc., for the current quarter, you should state definitely thereon the dates between which the school was closed owing to your mother's illness, and consideration will then be given to payment of your salary during the period of your absence.\n\nA cheque for the salary due for the month of October, last, is being sent you under separate cover.

The Department presumes that you are advertising for a teacher for the Sand Point Indian Day School. It is thought that it should not have been necessary to advertise as the services of a suitable teacher could be secured by making inquiry or consulting the Separate School Inspector, as instructed by official letter of January 21st last.\n\nIt is understood that Miss Drury was giving up her duties as teacher from February 28th last and, if you have any applications on hand in answer to your advertisement, you should forward them at once for the consideration of the Department.

The priest informed me she was very much liked by the Indians and was doing good work. Under the circumstances I immediately communicated with her and unfortunately just recently received a reply informing me she could not accept the vacancy.\n\nUnder the circumstances I advertised in \"The Globe\", and wish to advise I am enclosing herewith several applications. The Inspector, Mr. McDonald, just called at this office, and favours the application of Miss Cassie Troy of the R.R. 3, Mount Forest, Ontario.

I decided to write you.\n\nTeach the Indian Day School at Sand Point Reserve near Mac Donald Ont. and I only get $85 per month. I asked Mr. Burk to ask you to raise my salary to $95 per month, as I am a qualified teacher, hold a second class professional teacher's certificate of Ontario qualifications and I have over 15 years' experience.\n\nNow I wish you to raise my salary to $95 per month, as I have...\nA very lonely life on the Reserve, away from all white people, and many inconveniences.\n\nUnderstand you pay $85 to teachers who hold no certificates. Whatever the teacher at Gull Bay and also at Squaw Bay get the same salary as I do, and they hold no certificates whatever only permits.\n\nNow as life on the Reserve is very lonely and many inconveniences, I really cannot teach for such a low salary. So please write me immediately and let me know if you are willing to pay me $95 per month.\n\nThanking you for your kindness and hoping to hear from you very soon.\n\n(Signed) Carrie Troy\n\nR.R. 3,\nMount Forest,\nOntario.\nOttawa, August 21st, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. Agent Burk, Port Arthur, forwarded your request on the 10th instant, and he was informed by official letter of the 15th instant that the Department would approve of an increase of $5 per month in your salary from the last of September, next. This will make your salary from that date at the rate of $90 per teaching month. There are many demands and our funds are limited.

I spoke with Mr. Bush, the agent at Port Arthur, asking him to write you and ask you to raise my salary to $100 per month.\n\nI feel that I cannot afford to teach any longer for $90 per month, as the cost of provisions here are very high, and considering all inconveniences, loneliness etc., I feel that $100 per month is not too much, as some...\nA qualified teacher and have over fifteen (15) years' experience.\n\nI doubt you have heard from Mr. Bask by this time. So please write me immediately and let me know.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am sincerely,\n\n(Miss) Cassie Troy,\nMac Diarmid,\nOntario\nTeacher at Indian Day School.\nOttawa, March 12, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, requesting an increase in your salary as teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that we are communicating with Mr. Agent Burk, as it is necessary that his recommendation be received before favourable consideration can be given. As soon as his reply is received, he will be advised as to what increase in salary, if any, can be allowed.\n\nI may add that the Department desires that all requests of this nature be dealt with through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Miss Troy has been doing splendid work and is appreciated by the Indians. I am sure she would be hard to replace.\n\nThe Sand Point Indian Reserve is very isolated and consequently it would be very difficult to replace Miss Troy if she resigns.\n\nUnder the existing circumstances I would strongly recommend an increase of $10.00 in her salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In this connection it is noted that you recommend an increase of $10 per teaching month. The Department will approve of an increase in salary at the above rate from the first of April, next, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This will make Miss Troy's salary from that date at the rate of $100 per teaching month. I have to request that you will inform her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The Department approves of the appointment of Miss Troy as teacher at Mission Bay, with salary at the rate of $100 per teaching month.

As you will no doubt remember the Department transferred Miss Hamer from the Gull Bay School to Sand Point.\n\nOn a recent visit to Sand Point I find that Miss Hamer is doing good work amongst the Indians. She not only administers drugs and Cod Liver Oil to them, but also has arranged to give the school children, under her supervision, a weekly bath. Miss Ings, our Field Matron, is extremely pleased with her activities.\n\nUnder the circumstances would it not be possible to increase this teacher's salary to $100.00 per teaching month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In commenting upon the cleanliness of Indian children, the writer takes into consideration the fact that the children are Indians. What might be satisfactory to the writer, however, falls far below Miss Hamer's ideals, and so she personally superintends the bathing of her pupils. She also visits Indian homes, dressing sores and suggesting sanitary precautions. I do not recall any school that I have visited having a lay teacher in charge that has impressed me so pleasurably. I was glad to hear that the Department had made her an allowance for her social work among the Indians, because I believe, salary, etc., being anywhere near approximately equal, she would sooner teach in an Indian school than in a white one.\n\nMost of the children attending Sand Point School live close at hand, but Miss Hamer finds that they are badly underfed. She would like to give them something hot at dinner time.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nTravelling Nurse Ings informs me that she received a very poor reception from Miss Hamer, teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School, upon the occasion of her last visit. She asked me not to take any action, however, until after her second visit, and, if there is any unpleasantness then, she will report.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of November 17th, 9-10-1, regarding Miss Hamer's request to be transferred from Sand Point Day School to another Indian school. In this respect I wish to state there is a married woman teaching at the Pic Indian Day School, Mrs. McDonnell. Her husband is living at Peninsula, which is approximately 40 miles west of the Pic Reserve. I have received considerable complaints regarding Mrs. McDonnell teaching at this school, as her husband is an operator on the C.P.R. and is able to support his family.\n\nMr. Greening and myself have both discussed this matter recently and will be pleased to advise at a later date if we consider it advisable to secure another teacher for the Pic School at the close of the present term.\n\nWith reference to Miss Hamer's teaching qualifications I wish to state Mr. Greening has advised me she is doing very satisfactory work. She is also one the best welfare workers in the Agency. I will be pleased to advise you at an early date regarding her transfer to the Pic Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Buck,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nYou may possibly be wondering why the teacher at Sand Point was anxious to secure a transfer to some other school, especially in view of the fact that her services have been quite satisfactory to Mr. Burk and myself.\n\nBut, as you know, (and as the Department, I am glad to feel, desires), the missionaries take a great interest in these little schools, and are particularly glad that the teachers act as catechists and set an example, in a religious way, both by action and precept.\n\nPoor Miss Hamer happens to be the daughter of a mixed marriage, and her piety is not so fervent as might be hoped; or, at least, the missionary thinks that it is not, which amounts to the same thing. When the missionary gets into the average Indian village, all are agog, and the teacher is the first to get to church in the morning. Poor Miss Hamer, unfortunately, has managed to be ignorant of the Father's vis (she says she cannot hear the church bell when he rings it) and has failed, on a number of occasions, to turn up to mass in the morning. Hence she is persona non grata to the good Father, which is too bad, because she is really interested in Indians.\n\nThe situation will clear itself up in due course, because the attendance at Sand Point has fallen so low that the school will most likely have to be closed next summer. Miss Hamer will then be looking for a school. I am very favourably disposed to her, myself, and, if Lacourci\u00e8re resigns his job at Whitefish Bay (Kenora) at the end of the year, I have asked Mr. Edwards to keep Miss Hamer in mind. Or, if Miss Lavallee quits Birch Island at the end of the year, you might like to give Miss Hamer that position.\n\nI have spoken to a good many people about this young lady. Above all, she would like to be employed as a field matron, organizing the Indian women into sewing circles and the like. In such work she would be an outstanding success, I should think.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Greening:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant regarding the request of Miss Violet Hamer, teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School, to be transferred to another school, and stating the reason why a change should be made.\n\nThe Department has already had correspondence regarding this matter and, should there be a vacancy at either the Whitefish Bay School in the Kenora Agency, or in the Birch Island School in the Manitowaning Agency, favourable consideration will be given to the transfer of Miss Hamer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. J. Greening, Esq., B.A., B.Paed.,\nInspector of Separate Schools,\n438 Robinson St.,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nNipigon, Ontario, April 14th, 1932.\n\nREPORT.\n\nRe: Frank Esquiega - Indian - Sand Point Indian Reserve - Bitten by ferocious dog.\n\nFirst Report:\n\nActing upon instructions from Corporal Bebb F.H., N.C.O., in charge of the Nipigon Detachment, on the 13th inst., I left our patrol post C.N.R. to Stevedors on route to the Sand Point Indian Reserve.\n\nInformation had been received from Peter Esquiega, by telegram, to the effect that a ferocious dog had bitten his son Frank, age about 18 years, and he requested that we come at once and get a doctor.\n\nArriving at the Indian Reserve I learned that the dog who attacked and bit the above named was owned by Miss Violet Hamer, the Indian schoolteacher.\n\nOn making enquiries in regard to the incident I learned that Miss Hamer was coming across the lake to the Indian Reserve with the dog and small sleigh, on seeing another dog, the dog of Miss Hamer's bolted with her, whereupon she called for the assistance of the above named who was in the vicinity.\n\nF. Esquiega grabbed the dog by the harness and led it about 15 yards when the dog attacked him from the rear, sinking his tusks into his left leg above the ankle. On turning upon the dog to try and protect himself, the dog bit both of his hands, however he managed to grab his collar and shake him off.\n\nDuring this affair Miss Hamer got frightened and ran away to a house, at the present time F. Esquiega is lying in bed with the wounds from the dog.\n\nSteve Nockwingus a reliable Indian on this Reserve stated that this dog of Miss Hamer's was dangerous to be at large and the children were afraid of the dog, he considered that this dog was a nuisance, and had attacked several of the Indians in the past, but succeeded in scaring them.\n\nJerry Belanger states that he has been attacked by this same dog, and grabbed by the hand but did not cut the flesh on account of him having very thick mitts on.\n\nAntoine Bouchard Jr. states that Miss Hamer's dog attacked him about one month ago, but being able to ward the dog off with a stick he was not hurt.\n\nAmelia Bouchard states that the same dog ran after her and she was only able to reach the house for safety when it caught the back of her skirt.\n\nAntonette Nockwingus states one day she was going to the school, when the dog chased after her and if it had not been for some boys who chased the dog off with sticks and stones he probably would have attacked her.\n\nMargaret Nockwingus states she was knocked down by the dog and gave her a great shock and made her terrified.\nUpon investigating the poor attendance at the school I found that this dog was the cause of it, as the Indian women were afraid to let the children go to school for fear of being bitten.\n\nDuring my visit to this Indian Reserve on the 1st March, last, in company with Peter Bouchard this dog attacked the leader of our dogtrain, and in attempting to drive it off it grabbed my wrist, and owing to the thick mitts I was wearing I only received a small cut.\n\nI told Miss Hamer that the dog would be better destroyed to save any further trouble, and that I intended doing this for the sake and safety of the Indians and children on that Indian Reserve; as it was considered a dangerous and ferocious animal to be at large, this dog was known to be running loose most of the time on the Reserve.\n\nAlthough Miss Hamer did not wish to have the animal destroyed, I saw that the dog was shot before leaving, and that it was carried into the bush for burial.\n\nI returned to the Detachment at 11.00 a.m. of the 14th inst.\n\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M.P., Police,\nManitoba District.\n\nSir, I could not get in touch with J.J. Turk - Indian Agent on account of him being on patrol to the Grand Bay Indian Reserve on Lake Nipigon. However, I telephoned Doctor J.C. Gillis, Indian Doctor at Fort William who stated he would telegraph Macdonald and have Frank Squioge put on the train for the hospital.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nNipigon Detachment\n\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nForwarded for your information, 18-4-32.\n\nAlthough this action of Const. Gilbank's may appear to have been somewhat arbitrary, still it was justified; the dog in question was evidently dangerous, and certainly had no right to be running loose on an Indian Reserve.\n\nInspector\nA.H.L. Mellor, for\nO.O., Manitoba District.\n\nM/B The Commissioner,\nR.C.M.P., Police,\nOttawa, Ont. Forwarded for your information, 18-4-32. Further report to follow.\n\nInspector\nA.H.L.

Please let me have your recommendation in the near future. You might discuss this with Mr. Separate School Inspector Greening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. F. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th inst., with reference to the Sand Point School being moved to Grand Bay during the summer months, and the question of transferring Miss Hamer to Grand Bay Reserve, I beg to state I have discussed this matter with Mr. Greening, the Separate School Inspector, who advised Miss Hamer was being transferred to another Indian Day School not in this Agency.\n\nMr. Greening will undoubtedly communicate with you regarding the teacher's transfer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 20, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to my letter of the 27th ultimo and to your 330-6A of the 28th idem., concerning the teaching services for the Grand Bay Indian Day School on September first. There is now some doubt that a suitable transfer can be effected for Miss Hamer, and I have written to Mr. Separate School Inspector Greening, asking him if it is impossible for her to continue her services at Grand Bay. Will you please let me know without delay whether you believe it is necessary to transfer her from this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Greening's Report on his inspection of the SAND POINT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on June 10, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 9-10-6.\n\nI am distinctly disappointed in the work done by this school during the past year. The Indian parents have plainly failed to cooperate with the teacher. Attendance has been poor, and some of the children are very neglected. Two of them (one the Chief's son) seemed to be attending school while suffering from scabies.\n\nWhatever may be the representations made to the Department at Ottawa, it is the considered opinion of Mr. Agent Burke and myself that the advantage being taken by the Indians at Sand Point of this school most decidedly does not warrant the expenditure being made.\n\nIt would be much better to close the Sand Point School at the end of the present term, and open a school at Grand Bay next autumn. In company with Mr. Agent Burk the Inspector called in at Grand Bay. There is a partially completed residence that would do admirably for a school until the building at Sand Point can be brought over the lake.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st instant, in regard to Miss Hamer.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Burk, so that this letter contains the views of both of us.\n\nThere is no doubt that Miss Hamer is \"in wrong\" with the Indians at Sand Point. It may be partly her own fault, as her tongue has not always been too carefully bridled, but there is certainly no doubt that her zeal in seeing that the children get to school and attend in a clean condition has helped to make the situation worse. As I have already told you, she is \"non grata\" with the Missionaries, (I have never been able to find out why, but I suspect that she has been talking too much), and it would be altogether inadvisable to send her to Grand Bay. It would militate decidedly against its success. If Miss Hamer is to be given another school, it had better be out of this Agency, because Mr. Burk tell me that, Father Hingston having heard that she was likely to be sent to Hobert, wrote him to ask that such move be not put through.\n\nI have given the young lady a good talking to, and Mr. Burk tells me that he thinks she will take it to heart. Miss Hamer has done good work among the Indians, and has always been genuinely interested in them. I asked Mr. Burk particularly if he thought she ought to be let out altogether, or whether he thought that her past services warranted another school. He thinks that she deserves consideration, but he does not want to send her to Grand Bay or to Hobert. I should, myself, be inclined to give her a chance, but if Father Hingston does not want her at Hobert, there may be similar objections to her being sent to any Jesuit mission. You might like to give her another chance, or you might decide not to bother with her any more. I have, personally, no interest in her other than a belief that she is capable of good work as a teacher if she is acceptable otherwise.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication, dated the 30th ultimo, from Mr. Inspector Greening, with reference to Miss Violet Hamer, who has been teaching at the Sand Point Indian Day School. Mr. Greening writes that you concur in his opinion. At the present time, there is no vacancy at a Catholic school, which would be suitable for her, and you will please send word to her that her services are not required on September first. Inform her that, if she is desirous of re-entering Indian work, she should write direct to the Department.\n\nA copy of this letter is being directed to Mr. Greening, for his information and guidance. If either you or he have any suitable nominees for the vacancy at Grand Bay for September first, please inform me without delay. The Department has on file the names of many qualified applicants. I was speaking to a young man in my office yesterday who has one year's experience in Indian work. He was quite willing to consider Grand Bay, but no steps towards an appointment will be made until I again hear from you or Mr. Greening. I refer to Mr. Bernard Joyce, who taught at the Spanish Indian Residential School during the past academic year. He will be remembered by Mr. Greening. He has had to make way for a teacher who is in Holy Orders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. G.

Burd\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6159, file 424-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter enclosed from Mr. Burt, Sagamore Agent at Port Arthur, advising that my services no longer required.\n\nThis is a serious matter and I feel that owing to circumstances I am entitled to some consideration.\n\nIn the first place, I knew positively that when this was written Robert was vacant, and I asked for his school. Mr. Burt refused me, and I cannot understand his attitude.\n\nLast year Rev. Dr. Cartier wanted to move me\u2014was going at Sand Point\u2014petitioned 13 families out of 14\u2014asking that I be left at this school. I wrote Mr. Ferrier for a transfer\u2014and he replied that he had none\u2014but asked that I remain at Sand Point.\n\nI have served Dept. and Indians faithfully for three years. At Sag Bay and Sand Point. My whole life has been given over to the work during my time as teacher here\u2014twenty-four hours per day\u2014I have been ready to work for these people.\n\nNursing the sick\u2014and dying\u2014hours at a time\u2014caring for expectant mothers & babies\u2014& supporting...\nI sent children to hospital in winter, handing out drugs and clothing, and rations, besides teaching all day. Last winter I formed a club and under my supervision all children were clothed and windows dressed as well. This necessitated my being up from 7 a.m. until 12 midnight for over 3 weeks. I have gone down in health in two years, and only recently the doctor advised a rest, but I am forced to work. This year my father & mother are my hands to support and I feel that after three years in the bush among Indians, I am attacked by wolf and hate to leave because of some personal grudge the priest may have, who only visits the reserve at the most every 3 months, and then only for a few hours\u2014never calling at the school or giving any attention to the moral welfare of teacher or children. But we feel the need of spiritual guidance and are unable to receive it.\n\nIt would be obliged if you can see your way to look into this thing. I am unable to do anything. You have my records for teaching which Mr. Greening advised were satisfactory, that in itself should be proof of my earnestness of purpose.\n\nWill take a school of any denomination as far north and as isolated as you can find anywhere and would be pleased to have the opportunity of proving.\nThat I am turn over good work of any kind.\n\nHave been off for holidays the month and would be prepared to return again.\n\nPraying that you will give this consideration and believing in the Dept's fairness to an honest worker.\n\nBelieving me,\n\nRespectfully,\n\nT.S. Hamner\n\nP.S. Have the late Mr. Service's letter on hand in which he asked me to continue at Sand Point.\n\nIf you have any other kind of work that you feel might be fitted for Sand Point, I believe that Sand Point has every chance to make a very fine and have done practically everything an Indian Agent can do - Sales, field, matron, record service work.\n\nW.S.\nOttawa, August 25, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, and, in reply, have to inform you that at the present time there is no vacancy for a teacher in a Catholic Indian school to which you could be appointed. I might say that favourable consideration will be given to your application when the services of a teacher are required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss V. H. Hamer,\nMacdiarmid,\nOnt.\nNovember 3rd, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Burk,\n\nYour letter of October 17th, regarding the services of Miss Homer as Field Matron, was referred to me, and I may say that this was the first notification I had received of the fact that Miss Homer's services have been paid for from medical appropriation.\n\nWhen Miss Homer was notified by letter of August 25th, that there was no vacancy in which she could be placed as teacher, it was taken for granted that her services were dispensed with. However, I understand a cheque for $13.50 has been sent to her for the month of October as her name was included in your pay list. Before the November pay list is made up I would appreciate it if you will let me have your views regarding retaining the services of Miss Homer, particularly in view of the fact that she is not living on an Indian Reserve, and it is not our practice to provide Field Matron service for Indians who may be passing through small towns such as MacDiarmid.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your suggestions as I must confess I am quite in the dark as to why Miss Homer's services should be continued.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\n\nS. L. Stone, M.B.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\nOttawa, July 14, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nInspector Greening, in his report on the McIntyre Bay Indian Day School, dated June 23, 1938, states that there are only five pupils enrolled at this school and that five pupils were present on the day of the inspection.\n\nI should like to have from you an explanation with respect to the comparatively small enrolment at this school, in view of the fact that there were 18 enrolled when the Inspector made his last inspection on October 8, 1938. I should add also that it is not the intention of the Department to keep schools open and in operation with an enrolment of five pupils. This is a matter that should be discussed with the teacher in charge and with the Indian parents. The taxpayers of Canada simply cannot afford to employ Indian day school teachers to take charge of schools with such small enrolments.\n\nYou might report on this matter just as soon as you can conveniently do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, in connection with Inspector Greening's report on the McIntyre Bay Indian Day school dated June 23rd, 1939, I beg to report that project on this reserve has been closed for some time and in consequence the large majority of the families on this reserve moved to Gull Bay reserve to cut pulpwood. They were also engaged on other pulpwood work on Lake Nipigon.\n\nFor the Department's information, I may say that I just received a communication from the McIntyre Bay reserve advising that the majority of the families have now moved back and are now working at the Breakwater construction and other work on the reservation. It is anticipated the band will have permanent work on this reserve in the very near future consequently attendance will be back to normal by the time school opens on September 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At that time you were under the impression that the operation of a school would be necessary. As you have not written it is presumed that the Indians are not residing on the reserve permanently. I should appreciate having a specific report from you regarding the situation on this reserve, particularly as concerns the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We will allow salary at the same rate as was paid Miss McAteer, viz. $55 per teaching month. Please give this matter your early attention and forward the name, qualifications and experience of any applicants for the position for the approval of the Department.\n\nYou should also inform Miss McAteer that her services are being discontinued. She was paid salary to the end of October 31st, 1927. If there is any balance due her for the time she taught before leaving the school in November, I shall be pleased to have a statement from you as to the number of days taught by her, in order that any balance can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Duggan, Annan, Ont., has the better qualifications, and you may offer the position as teacher of the Sand Point School to her, at a salary of $55 per teaching month. We note that Miss Duggan has a permanent second class certificate, and three years' teaching experience. You should arrange with her to begin duties as soon as considered timely by you to have this school reopened. In writing Miss Duggan offering her the position, you should give her as full information as possible regarding living conditions and any supplies it may be necessary for her to take in with her.\n\nIf for any reason Miss Duggan is unable to accept, you may offer the position to Miss Kathleen G. O'Hara, who holds a second class certificate, and has had teaching experience. You should take the necessary action as soon as possible in communicating with the above named teachers in the order mentioned. It is hoped that Miss Duggan will accept. Please inform the Department later as to whether she accepts the position at Sand Point or not, and, if so, the date upon which she begins duties.\n\nWe note you have advised Miss McAteer, the former teacher, that her services are discontinued.\n\nThe applications which you forwarded are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I received a reply the very next day.\nthe 3rd of Jan., saying\nthat a cheque for $253.00\nhad been mailed to\nme in Maclean and\nOut on December 27th\n1928.\nNow Mr. Revell says,\nno such mail for\nme came to that\nPost office and he\nor has been in charge\nof that post office, and\nyou please look it up\nfor me at once. I think\nmaybe it had after all been mailed to your office. The cheques that I have cashed so far are two in number. One I had cashed in a bank in Fort William by Mr. Carlson and the other I had cashed in the Hudson Bay store on the reserve here so it should not be very hard to\ntrace the next one if they sent it and any one got it by mistake but I think there has been a mistake in forwarding it. Hope however that you will look after it very soon for me.\n\nI am enclosing my resignation for this school. I was married during the holiday.

Mr. Burk informs me that it was duly signed and sent to Ottawa.\n\nI have heretofore not received any cheque for that Quarter yet, nor the smaller cheque for quarter work for the same period. As some considerable time has elapsed, I fear that this has been overlooked.

Mr. Burk arrived here by the same boat as your letter, so the matter is now cleared up. The misunderstanding arose because the Bank failed to notify me of the receipt of this cheque, and Mr. Burk, on his last visit here, said he knew nothing of it. Previously all cheques have come to me at this address.\n\nI regret having troubled you with this matter. According to the statement of the Bank and Mr. Burk, there would appear to be outstanding now only the smaller cheque for quarter services from April - July 1933 which has not yet been received.

So far, I have not received the duplicate cheque either.\n\nI am informed by Mr. Burk, Indian agent, that he forwarded cheques, presumably including the above, to Macdiarmid. However, I have now received all the mail from Macdiarmid Post Office and there is no cheque among it. I am therefore writing you in the hope of tracing this cheque. It would be too bad, if after all the trouble of getting people to sign a bond for a loss which was not my fault, since I never even saw the cheque, the duplicate should also be lost! Moreover from April to the end of September is a long time, and the absence of this money is causing my family very grave inconvenience.\n\nMay I ask you to try and trace this cheque, and to send it & subsequent cheques (for part of July) direct to me at Callander?\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Thos. Harris.\nOttawa, September 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, I beg to say that our records show that a duplicate cheque for $35 was forwarded to Mr. Agent Burk on August 31st, last. I am, therefore, writing to him in connection with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. T. Haines, Esq.,\nCallander,\nOnt.\nOttawa, September 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from A. T. Haines regarding his April salary cheque. You forwarded the necessary Bond of Indemnity signed by Mr. Haines with your letter of August 16th, last, and a duplicate cheque for $5 was issued by the Department and sent to you on August 31st. If you have received this cheque, you should forward it at once to Mr. A. T. Haines, Callander, Ont. If you have not received it, you should advise the Department immediately.\n\nMr. Haines also enquires regarding the amount due him for the first part of July, during which he taught at the Grand Bay School. In payment of his services for this period a cheque for $42.50 was issued in his favour and sent to you at the end of July. Please let the Department know if you have any record of having received this latter cheque, and, if so, what disposition was made of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. B. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th inst., No. 9-10-3, and note that you have received a letter from A. T. Haines, regarding his salary for April. In reply I wish to state the duplicate cheque for $85.00 was forwarded to this office and also one for $42.50 for his July salary. Both these cheques were sent in care of Mr. R. P. Mills, storekeeper, at MacDiarmid. When the cheques were forwarded to MacDiarmid it was presumed he would return there enroute to the McIntyre Indian Day School.\n\nI have written to Mr. Haines informing him that the cheques were sent in care of Mr. Mills.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCallander,\nOnt.\nOct. 1, '34.\n\nT.R.L MacInnes Esq.,\nActing Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to thank you for your letter of Oct. 27th, and not that you have communicated with Mr. Burk regarding the missing cheque. May I say that I also wrote to Mr. Burk, who said that he had forwarded it to Macdiarmid. I have however been in touch with the Post Office there and had all mail to date forwarded, but no cheque has arrived. Inasmuch as this is the second one that has been held up, it would seem that there is a very unsatisfactory mail system there.\n\nFurther, when sending in the duplicate I gave my address as Callander Ont. I did the same on my form for the first half of July, and so far, I have not received either the salary or janitor cheque for that period. I do not understand why these cheques should have to be sent to Macdiarmid, when the proper address has been furnished. As you will readily understand, this very unnecessary delay causes the utmost inconvenience and discomfort to a man who is dependent on his salary. I hope therefore, that it may soon be rectified.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Thos. Haines\n\nA. Thos Haines, (M.A.)\nLate of Grand Sorrel.\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. Burk, Indian Agent, Port Arthur, that he received the duplicate cheque for $55 and also the cheque for $42.50 for your July salary. He forwarded both these cheques in care of Mr. R. P. Mills, Storekeeper, Macdiarmid. It is noted that you have been in touch with the post office at Macdiarmid and were informed that no cheque had arrived. No doubt, these cheques are held in the office of Mr. R. P. Mills, and you should communicate with him. The delay in receipt by you of these cheques is regretted.\n\nRegarding payment of your services as janitor, I have to say that a cheque to the amount of $17.50 for the period ending July 15th, last, was sent you in care of Mr. Agent Burke, Port Arthur. We have no information regarding the address to which he forwarded this cheque.\n\nAfter you have communicated with Mr. Mills at Macdiarmid, I should be pleased to be advised of the result of your enquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A letter to Mr. J.G. Burk, Indian Agent of Port Arthur, merely elicited the same information with reference to these cheques that your letter contains.\n\nLetters sent to the postmaster and to Mr. Mills well over a week ago have brought no word, not even a reply, to date. I am sure that you will appreciate the inconvenience, not say hardship, caused by the hold up of this money, dating as it does from last April & last July.\n\nInasmuch as my address at Callander was clearly given, it would seem that the Department and its agent should have sent these direct to me at Callander and not sent them to MacIsamid when I was not there, this especially in view of the loss of the first April cheque at that same point. There is very evidently a grave laxity there.\n\nI would suggest, in view of all the circumstances that the Dept. could solve the whole matter in the simplest and most expeditious manner, namely, by cancelling both the duplicate April cheque and the one for July, and then issue one new cheque for the two amounts, and remit same to me at this address, and so end this very embarrassing delay and suspense.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Haines, in which he states that he has not yet received the duplicate cheque issued in payment of his April salary nor the cheque for the amount due him for the period he taught the Grand Bay Indian Day School during the month of July. In your letter of the 29th ultimo, you stated that both these cheques had been forwarded to Mr. Haines in care of Mr. R. P. Mills, Storekeeper, Macdiarmid. In his letter of the 14th instant, Mr. Haines states that, although he had written a week previously to both the postmaster at Macdiarmid and Mr. Mills, he has received no reply.\n\nThe Department regrets that Mr. Haines has been inconvenienced by the non-receipt of these cheques and I have, therefore, to request that you will get in touch with Mr. Mills immediately and arrange for the prompt forwarding of the cheques to Mr. Haines. The Department will expect to hear from you in the near future that such arrangements have been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. G.

Please let me have an immediate reply to my letter of the 17th ultimo.\n\nI am today in receipt of another letter dated the 11th instant from Mr. Haines, in which he states that he has not yet received these cheques. The Department cannot understand why there has been so much delay in forwarding these cheques to Mr. Haines. It has caused us considerable inconvenience and has resulted in a great deal of correspondence.\n\nWhen replying, you should state why you sent the cheques to Mr. Mills in the first place and you should also advise the approximate date on which Mr. Haines will receive these two cheques.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In reply I regret your letter of the 17th ultimo was misplaced and consequently was not answered.\n\nI wish to state I have communicated with Mr. Mills at MacDiarmid and asked him to forward the cheques to the Bank of Montreal, at Port Arthur, where they will be placed to Mr. Haines' account. The Bank of Montreal phoned me several times and advised that Mr. Haines has overdrawn his account and suggested that the cheques be forwarded to the Bank and deposited in his account.\n\nFor the Department's information I may say Mr. Haines has incurred considerable debts at the store of which Mr. Mills is manager.

Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent,\nIndian Education Dept.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter under date of Nov. 20th. I beg to state that I am still without cheques for salary due. Mr. Burk's reply as quoted by you, does not help me any. With regard to his statement re. my financial affairs, the facts are these: Mr. Mills is merely the local manager for J.H. Beamish \"Fairway Stores\". I have dealt with these stores through this and other branches for years and have spent some hundreds of dollars there without ever owing them a cent. Owing to non receipt of my cheque, when I left I obtained from Mr. Mills my account which was $104. This amount I told him I would remit as soon as I got my cheques, which he said would be agreeable to him. My indebtedness to the bank is the sum of $5, notice of which I have before me. You will readily see that if I had my cheques, I should be able to meet both these obligations and have a small balance which I sorely need. There is nothing in this to justify Mr. Mills in unlawfully holding up my cheques. The only communication I received from him was a suggestion that I should give him power of attorney to deduct what he thought proper from my cheques. This is not the proper method of procedure and would leave it open for him to revise my account in any way that occurred to him. Immediately I receive my cheques I am prepared to settle my obligations as stated, and should I fail to do so (which I have\nnever yet done, he would have an obvious remedy.\n\nThe point is that I have not yet received cheques for salary dating back as far as last April, and I should be glad of the assistance of the Department in collecting this money which is wrongfully withheld. I have never before encountered such unwarrantable and unBritish procedure, and should be glad to know what steps you suggest I should take. I know that if such a thing happened in England, I could take legal action and recover the amount plus interest and damages for unlawful detention. This I am loth to do, but will you tell me if there is any other way in which I can conclude this annoying business?\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Bark last week, in which he stated that he had asked that my cheques should be forwarded to my credit in my bank, and had been promised that that should be done immediately.\n\nIt has, however, not been done, and I am still minus salary due for last April and July. I think you will agree that it is high time this matter was settled, and in view of the near advent of Christmas, I need the settlement. Having taken advice on the matter, I am informed that there are two possible courses open:\n\n1. To sue the Macdonald Postmaster for illegal and unlawful detention of these cheques, together with interest and damages.\n2. To get the Indian Dept. to notify the Bank that payment of these cheques is cancelled, and issue me direct a new cheque for the total due.\n\nI am not anxious to tread the road of litigation, but it is necessary that I should obtain the money so long withheld. I therefore appeal to you to stop these cheques and issue me a new one for the total due, so that I may have it before Christmas.\n\nIn view of the fact that this is money earned, I do not think my request is unreasonable, and I would point out that if the department had sent my cheques to the address I gave on my form (Callander) as they did when I was in Macdonald, the situation would never have arisen.\n\nThe position now is, that I have not yet received my wages for work.\ndone, and that repeated correspondence, involving many letters to various people involved, at some expense and considerable worry has not produced any effect.\n\nI have therefore no alternative but to try other methods to recover that which is my just due, but before doing so, I would ask the Department once again to simplify matters and save trouble, by paying me the amount due, and cancelling the cheques that have never reached me, and which were sent to an address where I was not.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of an expedited settlement,\n\nyours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The buildings are still answering the purpose of a temporary school and residence, but are not suitable for permanent buildings. Mr. F. H. Paget, Chief Accountant, of our Department, inspected these two buildings last summer and could vouch for their inadequacy as permanent school buildings. On my last visit to this Reserve the majority of the Indians had left for their trapping grounds leaving their wives and children on the Reserve to take advantage of the school.\n\nAs this school has proved to be a success I would recommend the construction of a new school and residence next spring on the Sand Point Reserve.\n\nG.

The Lake is 96 miles long, by 45 miles wide, and I am sure you would enjoy the scenery and the outing would, no doubt, do you worlds of good. At the same time you would be able to personally inspect each Reserve on Lake Nipigon and realise how we are up against it in this Agency without schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI hope you will excuse my long delay in writing to thank you for your kind efforts and success in getting the necessary grant for the Pic Indian Day School.

On completion of the two above mentioned schools the mixer could be shipped to our warehouse and kept in storage for future work.\n\nThe Indians in this Agency and especially on Lake Winnipeg are hunters and do very little building, consequently they would be very slow workers. Under the circumstances I would recommend that the Department purchase a small Wettlaufer Mixer, which holds 3 cubic feet and costs $265.00.\n\nIf the above meets with the Department's approval I would strongly recommend that one be ordered immediately and shipped to Port Arthur.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

In order to successfully drain the basement I would strongly recommend that authority be granted immediately to proceed with this work.\n\nAn early will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is noted that it will require 100 feet of tile, at a cost of approximately 60 cents per foot and $15 for the labour. You should arrange to have this drain installed, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed. It is hoped that when this drain is installed it will overcome any future difficulty in keeping the cellar under the teacher's residence portion of the building in a dry condition.\n\nPlease forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the tile for the drain and the labour in having same installed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI just returned from Lake Nipigon on my last tour of inspection before freezeup. Mr. Greening, the R.C. School Inspector, was rather anxious to inspect the Lake Nipigon schools before the freezeup. We were certainly very lucky as we encountered a terrific hail and snowstorm 15 minutes after we tied up at the dock. Mr. Greening certainly was frightfully sick going up the lake, as the weather was very rough, but I must confess once he reached dry land and consumed a few cups of tea he was as lively as a cricket.\n\nMr. Greening seems to be a very fine fellow and I am sure is a very good school inspector. He was very favourably impressed with the good work Miss Hemer is doing at Sand Point not only in school hours but also socially.\n\nThe classroom at Sand Point and also the kitchen and bedroom really should be kalsomined. I was just wondering if it would be possible to stretch a point and order a furnace for Sand Point. A kalsomining furnace would really pay for itself in a few years, as you burn approximately twice the amount of fuel with box stoves and this combined with the features that the classroom should be kalsomined every year when stoves are used, and the everlasting dragging in wood and fixing fires which undoubtedly disturbs the pupils, would more than counterbalance the expense of the furnace.\n\nIf the Department would consider a furnace for Sand Point we could get one installed for a very reasonable figure. At this time of year when the plumbers and tinsmiths are not rushed a furnace could be installed for approximately $300.00. If you could possibly see your way clear to authorize this expenditure I can assure you it will be very much appreciated.\n\nWeather is much colder at the Head of the Lakes and is hard on one's coal bin.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (R5 10, Volume 6159, file 424-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, reporting on your inspection in company with Mr. Greening, Separate School Inspector, of the Sand Point Indian Day School, and requesting that a wood burning furnace be installed and the kitchen and bedroom of the teacher's residence kalsomined.\n\nIn reply it is regretted that there are no funds available during the balance of the present fiscal year to provide the cost of installing a furnace or to renovate the teacher's living quarters. It will, therefore, not be possible to authorize the expenditure required for the above purposes this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF SEPARATE SCHOOL INSPECTOR GREENING, DATED NOVEMBER 24, 1930, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SAND POINT INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 9-10-6.\n\nIt is, perhaps, not within the writer's province to criticize, but it has always struck him as decidedly odd, upon entering a school up-to-the-minute in every other respect, to see shabby old stove pipes stretching out crazily over the ceiling. But at no time has the contrast struck him so forcibly as when visiting Sand Point after having been at Gull Bay. In the latter, a hot air furnace heats the school and residence very comfortably, the objectional stove pipe is eliminated, and the classroom is a joy to the eye. At Sand Point, a room, with exactly the same potentialities, has an ugly wood stove right in the middle of a splendid classroom. Apart from the aesthetic side, I think it would be an advantage to change the heating of Sand Point from stoves to furnace. In fuel, alone, a furnace should pay for itself in ten years at the most. If one were to include the replacing of stove pipes and the frequent calsomining resultant upon smoky little stoves, I believe the cost of installation would be covered in half that time. And precious moments would not be wasted while trying to recall the attention of the students from the, (to them, entrancing) sight of a fellow student putting some more wood on the stove.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: F.W.

This work, with the exception of oiling the floors, will have to stand over this year. You may, however, arrange to have the floors thoroughly scrubbed, and, when dry, given a coat of oil. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred for this purpose, and when the work is completed, you should forward separate accounts covering the expenditure in the purchase of the oil and for the work in having same applied at each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Burk - Indian Agent to make a general investigation at the Sand Point Indian Reserve, and also to ascertain if Indian Constable T. Bouchard had removed his horse barn off the school property situated 20 feet from the school. He had been told by the agent last winter and also at treaty time to remove this barn, so I was requested to give Bouchard a reasonable period to remove same.\n\nOn the 15th inst I proceeded by car via Macdiarmid, and by boat to the Sand Point Indian Reserve.\n\nI learned at the reserve that four old people were having quite a bit of sickness, but not in a serious condition.\n\nSeveral families were away picking blueberries, and the Indians present were mostly catching fish for food, and as a supply for the coming winter. On information received from the Indian Agent I informed them that the Department would supply them with a reasonable amount of salt and salt kegs to put up fish for the winter if they only applied for same. Most of the Indians at this reserve are living under destitute circumstances throughout the year.\n\nOn interviewing Indian Constable Tom Bouchard in regards to the horse barn, he stated that he had not removed it and showed me where it was, and said he did not intend moving it until he was paid for his time. On giving him a definite period until the 15th October to remove the barn, he became very insolent and said he would see Burk the Indian Agent about it.\n\nThis barn is a danger to the health of the children at the school. Indian Bouchard has now been given definite instructions to remove the barn. He is a very poor Indian Constable, and if he does not remove this barn by the 15th October I would recommend that this Indian lose his appointment and another Indian appointed at that reserve instead. The Department would then have to pay other Indians to move the barn.\n\nI returned to detachment at Nipigon at noon of the 16th inst.\n\nThe Officer Commanding\nR.C.M.P.

These vouchers should be sent through you.\n\nWith reference to the teacher, the Department approves of Miss Fuller being placed in charge of this school, which should be opened as soon as possible.\n\nA register and a supply of quarterly return forms are being sent you under separate cover, and upon receipt of these returns, properly filled in, payment of the grant will be made.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Approximately 15 acres of ground has been cleared and from 8 to 10 acres will be planted in the near future.\n\nFor the Department's information there are approximately 22 children on this Reserve who should be attending school. The majority of the families have moved from the Sand Point Reserve to better their living conditions at Grand Bay.\n\nThe school on the Sand Point Reserve should be moved to Grand Bay. I have had an expert inspect the school and find it can be sawed and moved in 3 separate pieces. A large scow could be obtained and the school moved from Sand Point to Grand Bay for approximately $300.00. I would strongly recommend the school being moved during the summer holidays, as there will be approximately 25 to 30 children should attend school at Grand Bay.\n\nFor the Department's information I may state I have spent a great deal of time in order to make Grand Bay a success, and trust the Department will approve of the above proposition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I note your estimate of $300 in this connection and that the Indians will work for rations only. Is this $300 to include the cost of the rations? You might let me have detailed information regarding the cost of the whole move.\n\nThe Department approves of the moving of this school, but, before you take any action, please let me have the information requested, so that definite instructions can be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I have been advised from very good authority the approximate cost would not exceed $400.00 or $500.00 to move the school from Sand Point to Grand Bay Reserve.\n\nIf the Department approves of the above the school could be moved during the summer vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

One of the moving contractors in Port Arthur, advised he could not take the contract under $300.00. However, I have made the necessary arrangements to secure a large Caterpillar tractor at $5.00 per day, and have been waiting for the proper thickness of ice to start moving.\n\nWith reference to your 3rd paragraph I can assure you that $450.00 is without doubt an exceptionally low figure for such a large undertaking.\n\nIn conclusion I may say if all goes well I expect to have the school moved to the Grand Bay Reserve, a distance of 45 miles by the end of next month. With reference to the cost of moving the school, which I figure will cost approximately $450.00, I hope to keep within my estimates, and if all goes well I am quite convinced we can move the school for approximately $450.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We have some good Indians who could operate the tractor. A tractor is certainly a great thing to clear and cultivate land, and as conditions are at the present time, if we do not get down to farming, I am afraid the Indians will be a great burden on the Department, especially as they are creating a large game sanctuary in this Agency.\n\nIf you think you are going to have any spare funds I would certainly appreciate a supply of clothing, consisting of underwear, top shirts, flannel, kersey, men's and boys' pants, and socks. I am doing my utmost to keep the coat down in the Agency, but really conditions are becoming quite serious. I would suggest that MacInnes write to Corporal F.

I was frightfully worried, and did not know what to do about the school. In the first place I got in touch with a house mover who advised he would move the school for $200.00, if the department would pay the cost of the tractor, to and from the Reserve, and also feed the men. Counting the freight rate on the tractor and equipment, and feeding of the men, and his contract price of $200.00 would bring the price up to approximately $1400.00. I considered I could not the school for $450.00. I did not, however, figure on using $1400.00 on food supplies to build a temporary school, and make a grade from the beach to allow the school to be pulled from the beach to the Reserve.\n\nThen I first made enquiries regarding the freight rates on the tractor I was advised I could ship it for $65.00. I was flabbergasted when I found out I had to pay $150.00, nor did I figure paying $50.00 insurance on the tractor, and $50.00 for timbers. I figured we could cut timbers at our sawmill, but the moving contractor advised green timbers cannot be used. Consequently I was obliged to purchase 4 10 x 10 timbers, 80 feet long, at a cost of approximately $40.00. I did not figure the cost of labour involved in fixing the school permanently on the Reserve, that is time and labour involved in building a foundation, etc., which all costs money.\n\nI am attaching herewith the approximate cost of moving the school and do hope we will be able to get extra funds. Moving this school is a big undertaking, but when you consider the school cost approximately $5000.00, and is only going to pack and ruin, it is a very good investment.\n\nWith reference to my official letter enclosed, regarding the tractor, I really believe it would be a very good investment. The tractor\nI considered this cost too high, and consequently made the above arrangements.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if the Department would advise if it will be possible to secure additional funds to have the building moved. The school cost approximately $3000.00 and is practically new. For the Department's information I may say that the majority of the families from Sand Point have moved to the new Reserve at Grand Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to previous correspondence of June 4th, 1932, and your reply of June 7th, File No. u-9-5, regarding the moving of the Sand Point Indian Day School to the Grand Bay Reserve, which I figured would cost approximately $450.00.\n\nFor the Department's information I may say I spent $149.99 for supplies to compensate Indians for work performed in clearing right-of-way on the Grand Bay reserve for the purpose of moving the school from the ice onto the Reserve; also considerable expense was involved in grading the ground from the beach to the Reserve, and putting a small bridge over a slight ravine on the Reserve where the school would have to pass over. We also constructed a temporary residence on the Grand Bay Reserve for the teacher, which was included in the supplies amounting to $149.99. I do not believe this expenditure should have been charged to the moving expenses.\n\nFor the Department's information I may state I got in touch with the C.N.R. Freight Department and advised them I was anticipating shipping a 10 ton tractor and equipment. I was informed the freight would be $60.00 one way. Yesterday when the tractor was loaded with moving equipment, the total weight amounted to 12,000 one way, which was extremely high. I did everything possible to have the rate reduced, but was unable to meet with any success. It will cost approximately $100.00 to have the tractor shipped back to Port Arthur, and about $100.00 for supervision, $50.00 for new 10 x 10 timbers, $25.00 for rental of tractor, $25.00 for the man to drive the tractor, $50.00 for insurance\u2014total including supplies mentioned above $225.00.\n\nWhen I first sent in my estimate of $450.00 I did not figure on $50.00 insurance on the tractor, and the freight rate, as previously stated, was exceptionally high.\n\nReferring to previous correspondence you will note I obtained a figure from a moving contractor to move this school for $800.00. This did not include freight on tractor, and moving equipment which would be paid by the Department, or the board of the man.\nOttawa, March 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, regarding the moving of the Sand Point Indian Day School building to the Grand Bay Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department considers that there has been delay on your part in having this work completed and also with regard to the extra cost over your first estimate. In your letter dated May 25th, you stated that this school could be moved for approximately $300 by using a large scow, plus the sum of $200 for rations to the Indian labourers who perform the work, and that the work could be carried out during the past summer holidays. You received the necessary authority by official letter dated June 7th, last. Our appropriation for the purpose will lapse at the end of the present month, and we have no funds provided in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for this work. The Department now notes that, besides the amount that was paid for supplies to the Indians, viz., $149.99, a further amount of $603 will be required to do the work. In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter eleventh may move school to Grand Bay provided work can be done next week and accounts reach here by end of month.

F. MACKENZIE.\n\nCHG. DEPT. I.A.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., No. 4-2-5, regarding the moving of 2nd and Point School. In reply I wish to state it was my intention at the time of receiving authorization to move this school by snow. When the snow was moved from the skids I discovered it was too old to undertake this exceptionally large load. It would have been necessary to tear down the building, and to rebuild it. This would have entailed a great deal of expense. Consequently I interviewed Chambers, McQuillan, & McCaffrey, who did a great deal of towing on Lake Nipigon in the winter months during construction. They advised me if the services of a competent house mover could be obtained this building could be easily moved on the ice. I obtained a contract price of $3000.00 from Frank Love, who advised he could move the building from any point on the lake, and set it up on a wooden foundation for $2000.00, on condition that the Department supply tractor, and pay freight charges on same. This charge appeared excessive.\n\nI then got in touch with Mr. P. Carlow, a man with a great deal of experience in moving houses, who advised he would undertake the work, supply all equipment consisting of house jack, sleighs, pulleys, cables, etc., for $6.00 per day\u2014total amount not to exceed $1200.00. I again interviewed the above mentioned firm, who informed me they considered this arrangement should be satisfactory. They advised me not to undertake the work myself.\n\nIt was my intention to move the school in February, but owing to the severe weather, it was impossible to do so. I was travelling on Lake Nipigon from February 1st to 10th, during which time the temperature average was 40 degrees below zero, with strong winds.\n\nUpon my return to MacBride on February 10th, I got in touch with Captain McKay, who is winter fishing on Lake Nipigon, and asked him to send word when he considered she was fit to commence operations. I received word on March 5th, advising that the lake was in good condition for moving, with approximately 8\" of snow. The equipment\nThe Secretary\n\nwas loaded on the car the following day. Mr. Carlough and the tractor driver left for Sand Point on the 9th. I followed on March 11th.\n\nUnfortunately we encountered most unfavourable weather, with exceptionally heavy snow fall, and very strong winds. Within 6 days over 28 inches of snow fell, and drifted so hard it would actually hold the 10 ton tractor. It was at this time, upon the advice of the tractor driver, that I sent a night letter to the department asking if it would be possible to purchase a small tractor to assist. The purchase of a small tractor had been approved in official letter of August 17, 1932 for the Quill Bay Reserve, and could be transferred easily to Quill Bay\u201440 miles distant.\n\nIt was necessary to employ extra Indian labour for shovelling snow. We made very good progress the first two days until we got out to the open lake, where the snow had drifted. After several days attempt to continue moving, I considered it unwise to go on, as we were moving only a few hundred feet each day. We worked constantly from daylight until dark.\n\nI returned to MacDiarmid, leaving the building, packed upon skids, with a watchman in charge. The ice was tested several hundred feet from the school, and was found to be 32 inches of solid blue ice. I consulted several reliable men at MacDiarmid, who agreed with my opinion that the school is perfectly safe for the present, and can be easily moved immediately the snow melts.\n\nFor the information of the Department 3 cars of hay were conveyed on sleighs from MacDiarmid to the Quill Bay Reserve, a distance of 72 miles, where there was a depth of 12 inches of snow water on the ice.\n\nI considered it advisable to ship the heavy 10 ton tractor to Fort Arthur, as the charge of retaining same was too much. The school can be moved by 2 teams of horses, or a smaller tractor, when there is no snow.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say that I regret this delay, but feel I have done my utmost to move this school at the least possible cost. I also have the assurance that the Grand Bay Indians will give such\nThe Secretary,\n\nFurther assistance as is necessary without remuneration. It is not considered at present that the snow on Lake Nipigon will melt until the 2nd week in April, and navigation open before the middle of May. I am keeping in constant touch with Macdonald, and will leave immediately word is received that the snow has melted.\n\nAs a last resort, I will have the Indians take the building apart in sections, and remove to a near by island to be taken across in the summer. This, however, is not anticipated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. G. Buck,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, reporting the difficulty met with in moving the Sand Point Indian Day School building to the Grand Bay reserve and enclosing photos showing the work in progress.\n\nThe Department has noted the exceptional weather conditions and the heavy snow which has interfered with the work. It is hoped that you will use every effort to have this building moved to its future site on the Grand Bay reserve and that there will be no danger of loss, owing to a sudden change in weather and the ice becoming unsafe to bear the weight of the building.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands to have the work of completing the removal of the building carried out at the lowest expense and as early as weather conditions permit. It is thought that there are certain accounts in this connection, which you could forward, in order that payment can be made before our books close for the present fiscal year. It is noted that you considered it advisable to ship the heavy tractor to Port Arthur. Accounts for freight charges on the tractor, for any other expenses in connection therewith and for any labour to date could be forwarded, in triplicate, properly certified. All these accounts should be dealt with previous to the end of the present month, and, if received by the 6th of April next, they could be paid from this year's Appropriation. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nI note you have the assurance that the Grand Bay Indians will give the necessary assistance in the moving of the building, without remuneration. I would urge that you use your utmost endeavour to have the school moved to Grand Bay without resorting to the necessity of taking the building apart and removing it to a near island to be taken across in the summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We actually purchased 10 barrels, but as we did not use the latter 2 barrels, I charged same to the Grand Bay Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the attached invoice for food amounting to $11.49 I beg to advise these supplies were purchased for the watchman.\n\nWith reference to supplies purchased on April 14th and 19th amounting to $112.98, which includes spark plugs and Nohtloil, I wish to state we fed 10 men, 4 meals per day for 11 days, which amounted to 480 meals. The balance of food on hand we distributed to the Indians when we completed the moving of the school.\n\nA further letter will be mailed today giving a full report in connection with the moving of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The account, as you will note, amounts to $164.28.\n\nUnfortunately I am unable, at the present time, to send in the balance of the accounts which should not exceed $30.00 to $40.00 covering the rental of the cable and also moving equipment.\n\nFor the Department's information I may say we were obliged to move the school a second time to a better site, as on the first site the ground proved to be quicksand, and we were unable to excavate for a basement. The new site is in sandy ground, and is much better. We are still retaining the moving equipment, consisting of jacks, cables, etc., which will have to be returned to Fort Arthur. The approximate cost of putting the school in good condition, kalsomining, and doing minor repairs, should not exceed $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6159, file 424-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, July 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 30th ultimo and the 4th instant, enclosing vouchers in connection with the expenditure incurred in moving the Sand Point Indian Day School to Grand Bay. Cheques in payment of these accounts will be issued in due course.\n\nIt is noted that there will be further accounts rendered which, you state, should not exceed a total of from thirty to forty dollars. I would request that you render all accounts in connection with the moving of this school as soon as possible. The expenditure in this matter has been greatly in excess of the first estimate submitted by you. In your letter dated June 4, 1932, you stated the cost of moving this building from Sand Point to Grand Bay would not exceed, approximately, $500.00, while the total expenditure to date has been in the vicinity of $1,300. In view of the need for strict economy and the necessity of making a great reduction in our Appropriation, it is doubtful, if we had been aware that the cost would be so high, if authority would have been granted to move the building.\n\nIt is noted, when the building arrived at Grand Bay, that it was necessary to move it to a better site. It is considered a proper site should have been selected for the building before it was moved.\n\nYou should endeavour to have this building placed on a satisfactory foundation and all the moving equipment returned to Port Arthur. You may incur an expenditure not exceeding a sum of $50.00 in putting the school in good condition and carrying out minor repairs. There will be no funds available for calculating or decorating. After the work of placing the building in good condition has been completed, you should forward an account, properly certified and in triplicate, covering the expenditure, which should not exceed the above authorized amount.\n\nIt is hoped that this building will be ready for occupation when the schools re-open after the present summer holidays. You might also inform the Department regarding the teacher who will conduct the classroom work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, July 13th., 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Payment of Insurance Premium on Tractor,\nVote 201, 1932-33\n\nIndian Affairs cheque No. 5547 for $50.00 was issued on April 15th last in payment of the A.G. McLean Agency account for insurance on a ten ton tractor used for moving the Indian school across Lake Nipigon.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to Order in Council of July 5, 1881, as amended by Order in Council of June 16, 1927, prescribing regulations regarding insurance of government property. In view of these regulations will you please inform me why a policy was effected in this case.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAuditor General.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReceived to file\n& return to\nMr. Stanley\nOttawa, July 17th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant requesting information concerning the payment of an insurance premium on a ten ton tractor used for moving the Indian School across Lake Nipigon.\n\nReference has been made to the Orders-in-Council quoted by you, and it is found that these refer to the placing of insurance on Government property, whilst the question under review does not involve Government property, but was to cover private property in the form of a ten ton tractor which was rented by our Agent for the purpose of moving the school referred to above.\n\nThe tractor was rented from Donald A. Clark, of Port Arthur, Ontario, whose account therefor was paid by cheque number 6015, dated 28th June last.\n\nFor your information I beg to quote the following paragraph from our Agent's letter of the 4th April last:\n\n\"For the Department's information I may say I was compelled to insure the tractor, as the owner would not allow the heavy tractor to go over the ice until it had been insured.\"\n\nI trust the above information explains the matter to your satisfaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Auditor General,\nConfederation Building,\nOTTAWA,\nOntario.\nReferring to your letter of July 11th, No. 9-9-5, regarding the Sand Point School building which was moved to McIntyre Bay, I beg to report I overlooked the necessity of constructing a chimney and also the providing of a cement foundation for same. At present an improvised chimney built by the foreman is in use, but will not be sufficiently safe to use during the winter months.\n\nI am extremely pleased to report that this building has been put in first class condition by the Indians\u2014floors scraped and varnished, walls kalsomined, a splendid foundation constructed, and the school and residence has the appearance of a newly constructed building.\n\nThe cost of constructing a new chimney and foundation for same would be approximately $75.00 to $100.00. As this Band have not sufficient funds to cover the cost of building this chimney, I would recommend an additional grant to cover this expenditure, as I feel it is absolutely essential to the safety of the building. I would appreciate it very much if you would inform me at your earliest convenience regarding this matter. I may say this will be the last expenditure required for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 12, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the Sand Point School building which was moved to McIntyre Bay, I beg to say that there are no funds available at the present time for the additional work asked for in your letter. The cost of this building has already exceeded considerably the original estimate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nOttawa, November 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to conversation with you during your recent visit to the Department, regarding the need of renewing the chimney and painting the exterior of the Grand Bay Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have this work carried out at the earliest convenient time. You should arrange for the purchase of all materials from firms on the list to receive consideration. Any labour, as far as possible, should be carried out by Indians. If necessary to engage the services of a bricklayer, other than an Indian, you may do so.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, please obtain accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials, and time sheets, also in triplicate, for the labour employed. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing the expenditure in the purchase of the materials and for the labour in performing the above mentioned work, to the amount of $175. The Department will be pleased if you can effect any saving in this amount. Please state on each copy of your voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E.R.

The foreman advised he has blocked the corners up repeatedly, but owing to the nature of the soil he states the only remedy is to put in a cement foundation. The approximately cost of building a basement, and putting in tile for a drain under the school, would not exceed $300.00.\n\nI would appreciate the necessary authority to carry out this work, which is urgently required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should arrange for the purchase of the cement and other materials required, from firms on the approved list. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible, under the charge of a competent foreman.\n\nIt is noted, you estimate the cost should not exceed the sum of $300. I enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to that amount. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of all materials. You should also keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour employed. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward the accounts for the material and for the labour. You should state, on each copy of the accounts, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 3428.\n\nThe Department expects you to see that a satisfactory job is completed in the installing of the foundation and putting in the tile for drain. Please see that all costs are kept as low as possible. This work should be carried out during the present summer holidays.

MacDiarmid.\n\nThe cost of handling from MacDiarmid to the school, not charging transportation by boat will be $10.00. There is also the cost of excavating and building forms and labour, and as the season is getting on I have decided it would be better to postpone this work until next year. I have included, however, $500.00 in the estimates for the construction of a basement next year.\n\nWould it be possible to use the $300.00 to install a hot air furnace in the McIntyre School? The classroom is heated by a large Queen heater and the residence is heated by a box stove. Both these stoves quite frequently smoke and discolour the walls. If a furnace was installed this would not happen.\n\nI trust the Department will authorize the installing of this furnace which can be put in immediately. The cost will be approximately $300.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, in which you advise that you had been unable to install the foundation and drain under the Grand Bay (McIntyre Bay) Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a furnace at this school. Recent orders have been issued to curtail expenditure as far as possible, and, as you have been unable to have the foundation and drain installed, the encumbrance requisition has been cancelled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If you remember, a certain amount had been allotted for provision of a basement, but the amount was not enough to do the job. Mr. Burk and I think that it would be much better in every way if the money were spent for a furnace. You said that you thought it would be all right to go ahead, but in that it would be well for Mr. Burk to secure covering authority.\n\nI wrote him to that effect, and, as the season for navigation is drawing to a close, Mr. Burk went ahead with his arrangements to get the material up to McIntyre Bay before freeze-up.\n\nImagine our dismay when the official letter came from Ottawa turning down the project.\n\nIt struck me that, perhaps, the letter may have gone to some other official, or had not been connected in your office with the matter we had talked over.\n\nCould you offer any advice upon the matter as it now stands? Any assistance in our embarrassment would be appreciated.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Following your visit, Mr. Burk wrote the Department, but as there is no foundation under the Grand Bay Indian Day School, the Department did not consider it advisable to supply a furnace. In addition, orders have recently been issued to curtail expenditure as far as possible during the balance of the fiscal year. Under these circumstances, Mr. Burk was advised that the Department was not prepared to authorize the installation of a furnace.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Greening, Esq.,\n288 Harrington Ave.,\nFort Arthur, Ont.\nSir:\n\nAttention Educational Branch\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th inst., No. 9-9-5, which I received on my return to the City. I note in the second paragraph the Department is not prepared to authorize the furnace in the McIntyre Indian Day School.\n\nFor the Department's information I may say I received a letter from Inspector Greening advising me he had interviewed the Department, and that authorization would be granted to install this furnace; consequently considerable work has been done enlarging the basement, and cribbing the walls with timber. This has been done gratis.\n\nThe teacher will be exceptionally disappointed if the furnace is not installed.\n\nI trust the Department will reconsider their decision, especially as this is such an isolated spot, and Miss Fex is doing such good social service work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

G. Burke,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the first instant, with reference to the proposed construction of a cement basement and installation of a furnace at the McIntyre Bay Indian Day School.\n\nNo special provision was made for the above expenditure in the current year's Appropriation, but when you were written on April 15th, last, it was hoped that funds could be made available. However, during the past few months there have been so many unexpected demands on our Appropriation that it is now found impossible to proceed with the work at the McIntyre Bay School.\n\nWhen preparing your Estimates for the fiscal year 1937-38, you may include an item covering the work you recommend at McIntyre Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Burk, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nPort Arthur, Ont.,\nDec. 5, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to our verbal telephone conversation of recent date, may I draw your attention to the appropriation of $900.00 to install a new furnace and construct a basement at the McIntyre Bay Indian Day School. For your information, I may say, that owing to the fact that the school is located near a weeping bank which has been gradually falling in, I was informed by an engineer that it would be better to wait until the fall of the year, as the summer rains would make any excavating impossible, and to ascertain just how far the bank would fall in during the summer months. Consequently, I decided to postpone the building of the basement until the Fall.\n\nI may say, that I secured a contract from the C.N.Rly for from 5000 to 10,000 ties to be cut on the new timber limit, adjacent to the McIntyre Bay reservation but as this limit was cancelled, the contract also had to be cancelled. I would strongly recommend that authorization be granted to build the basement under the school as in this way we will be able to create work for the band.\n\nIn conclusion, I might add, that the grant was secured for this work in 1935 also, but was also cancelled.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to installing a new furnace and constructing a basement at the McIntyre Bay Indian Day School.\n\nOur appropriation for the current fiscal year is completely assigned and, consequently, it is not possible to authorize the expenditure that would be required for the above purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

In reply I beg to advise I was very fortunate in being able to rent two suitable buildings, one for the teacher's residence and the other for the classroom. Both buildings are situated in the middle of the reserve. This property is fenced in and is suitable for children's recreation grounds.\n\nI rented the above two buildings at a rental of $25.00 per month for each building. The owner is willing to sell the property and the two buildings for $300.00, and will be satisfied to take a rental of $50.00 per month until the property is paid up. The two buildings could not be replaced for less than seven or eight hundred dollars.\nOttawa, May 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, informing the Department that Miss Genevieve McAteer began duties as teacher of the Sand Point Indian Bay School on the 17th instant. It is also noted that you have been able to obtain a suitable house for the teacher's living quarters and a house in which to carry on classroom work - both buildings being centrally located and the grounds fenced and suitable for children's recreation.\n\nThe Department approves of the renting of the buildings referred to for the sum of $25 per month each, and will pay the rental at that rate for a period of six months. It is understood that, at the end of that time, the amount paid as rental will cover the full purchase price of the buildings, viz.: $300. You should prepare and forward from time to time properly certified vouchers for the rent due, and, when the 6 months' period has elapsed, you should prepare and forward, in duplicate, a quit claim deed (blank forms for the purpose enclosed) for the transfer from the owner to the Department of the two buildings with the grounds surrounding same. A proper description of the plot of land should be filled in in the deed.\n\nThe continuing of the school permanently will depend upon the success achieved during the first 6 months it is in operation. It is hoped there will be a full and regular attendance of all Indian children of school age and that the teacher will meet with every success in her work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Chargeable to Sand Point Indian Day School Expense.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 9-10-1 dated May 23rd, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 1\nWith reference to my letter of the 23rd ultimo and your reply of the 25th, your file number 9-10-1, regarding two buildings purchased on the Sand Point Indian Reserve to be used as a teacher's residence and the other for a schoolroom, I beg to advise I have just received word from Mr. J. Nicholson informing me that he is now willing to sell the house and a large woodshed for $250.00. This also includes a first class canoe which the teacher could use when going to and from MacDiarmid where the nearest postoffice is located\u2014a distance of approximately two or three miles.\n\nPersonally I would recommend the Department purchasing the woodshed, as it only is only a few hundred feet behind the schoolhouse, and would be very useful for storing wood. As the road from the Reserve to MacDiarmid is very wet I would consider it advisable to purchase the canoe also.\n\nThe building purchased for the school is just a very few feet from the residence. This building was purchased from Mr. Nicholson's son for $100.00. I have already advised him that he would receive two months rent at $50.00 per month until the building was paid for, when a quit claim deed will be filled out and sent to the Department.\n\nMr. Nicholson Sr. expects to build a new house at MacDiarmid and would like to be paid in full for his property. Personally I would recommend the Department purchasing this building as the same could not be erected under six or seven hundred dollars.\n\nIf the Department favours the purchase of this building the cheque could be sent to Mr. Nicholson, MacDiarmid, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith vouchers covering the rental of the schoolhouse and the purchase of the school residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, June 25th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the purchase from Mr. J. Nicholson, Sr., of a house owned by him on the Sand Point Indian Reserve to be used as a teacher's residence, and also for the purchase of a woodshed and canoe for the sum of $50.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that Mr. Paget, of this Department, will inspect this house, and report as to the advisability of purchasing same, on the occasion of his coming visit to Sand Point. The matter of the purchase will, therefore, not receive consideration until after Mr. Paget's report is received.\n\nYou will be advised in a separate communication regarding the purchase of the building for classroom purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G.

Nicholson Sr., of a suitable house for the teacher's residence on the Sand Point Indian Reserve, valued at $250.00. Would you kindly advise if Mr. Paget approves of this purchase, and if so, to send a cheque in care of this office as soon as possible as Mr. Nicholson has communicated with me several times, as the gentlemen is very anxious to make a settlement.\n\nAn early reply will be very much appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. G. Burk,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is cheque for $250.00 in favour of J.

Burk Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Arthur, Ont.\nSir,\n\nOn Saturday, September 24th, I received a wire from Miss McAtter, teacher of the Sand Point Indian Day School, advising me that Mr. Nicholson had removed all his furniture from the school house. When the house was purchased from Mr. Nicholson we were informed the furniture would possibly be left in until next Spring, as he expected to go north to the Hudson Bay Company. Unfortunately he has changed his mind and has removed his furniture from the school residence.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend purchasing the following supplies immediately:\n\n1 Dining Room suite.\n2 Stoves, 1 for school residence and 1 for school house.\n1 Small Carpet.\n1 Plain Rocking Chair.\n22 Stove Pipes.\n1 Small Lounge for the Sitting Room.\n2 Lamps.\n1 Teacher's Desk.\n1 Galvanized casing for roof to run stove pipe through.\n4 Inexpensive Pictures.\n2 Wash Basins, 1 for school house and 1 for school residence.\n1 Wash Tub.\n1 Wash Board.\nSufficient wall paper to paper the teacher's residence.\n\nAs these supplies are required immediately I would be very pleased if you would reply by return mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should prepare and forward from time to time properly certified vouchers for the rent due, and, when the 6 months' period has elapsed, you should prepare and forward, in duplicate, a Quit Claim Deed (blank form for the purpose enclosed) for the transfer from the owner to the Department of the two buildings with the grounds surrounding same.

Miss Ruxton has been over two years in charge of this school and the reports from the Public School Inspector are quite commendatory. There are two other schools on the reserve, one taught by Mr. Wallace and the other by Mrs. Robb, each of whom receives a salary of $500.00. These three are among the best Indian schools in the province both in respect to equipment and work performed. Miss Ruxton's qualifications, an expired Third Class Certificate, are practically equivalent to those of Mr. Wallace, but Mrs. Robb is the holder of a Second Class Certificate.

The attendance is not large, 13 boys and 5 girls. I found on visiting this school I was informed by the teacher, Miss Ruxton, that there were no more children of school age in the vicinity of this school. I may say that this school would accommodate at least 50 pupils.

Miss Ruxton herself, however, might wish for a change and I have to inform you that there is at present a vacancy at the Walpole Island No. 1 School at the front of the island, where there is good accommodation and the salary is the same as at present paid Miss Ruxton, viz., $500.00.

Sir,\n\nThe Indians of the Saugeen Reserve have represented to the Department that they wish a change of teacher in the village school, which is now in charge of Miss Ruxton. The reason advanced is that Miss Ruxton is not of the same religious persuasion as the majority of the members. The Department in dealing with this matter in the first place advised the Agent that it did not consider this a valid reason. According to the reports of the Public School Inspector Miss Ruxton has been doing very good work at this school and she has said that she wishes to retain the position at least for this term.\n\nMiss Ruxton has been in charge of this school since December 6, 1909, and it is only two months ago that they made any objection to her religion and it would hardly be fair to her to dispense with her services summarily on religious grounds only.\n\nThe Department would like to have your views as to the advisability of meeting the request of the Indians for a change.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. D. Sharpe,\nSaugeen, Ont.\nSouthampton Sept 23rd 1913\n\nYour letter No. 1537979.\n\nThe trouble in regard to Miss Maclean started in the Indian Council Act in the Church. As a church we are strong and can get along all right with the help we have. I have heard a few say they would like the teacher to train the children for Christmas entertainments etc. That is all I have ever heard, and that not at any church meeting. Your Indians know the Indian Act pretty well, so they think that would be a good scheme for a change.\n\nThis letter is to be private please. You have the Agent and the School Inspector to look after school matters so please don't refer the Indians to this letter.\n\nVery truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are two only - a boy and a girl. The teacher in the Indian school gave them some slight punishment, and for this the parents, influenced by Chief Mandawab, the grandfather, took them from their own school, and sent them to the white school, which is barely half a mile from the Indian school. The average attendance at the Indian school is 16, average attendance at the white school 13. The Indian school is large, one of the finest schools in the County, the white school is small. The case is similar to many schools, where parents or grandparents champion the cause of their children, instead of giving them to understand clearly their proper relation to school and teacher. The teacher in the Indian school is doing good work, and would not be unfairly unkind or unjust to any pupil.\n\nJohn McCool,\nInspector.\n\nWalkerton, October 27th, 1913.\n\nNote - Indian School in question is called Saugeen Indian School -\nWhite School is No. 13 Armadale - address of both.\n\nChippawa Hill.\nTORONTO,\nOctober 23rd, 1913.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am directed by the Minister of Education to inform you that enquiries are being made regarding the matter to which you refer, so that it may be understood what the conditions are regarding the Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Minister of Education.\n\nA.

M. Mandowomb as their father is dead and their mother is married again. The Chief claims that he has always sent his own children to this school and paid a fee for doing so and as he informs me that he got permission from one of the Trustees of the School to send them he thinks that he has a right to do so and refuses to send them to the Indian School as he does not like the teacher Miss Burton.

Be good enough to ascertain the feeling of the trustees on this point and advise the Department and also, if possible, whether Mr. Fraser has any valid objections to these children attending the school, as their presence should not contaminate any of the white pupils.

There is nothing about those children as far as I know that would justify anybody objecting to their going to any school.

Their presence does not interfere in any way with the efficiency of the school and there is nothing about these children personally that would justify anybody in objecting to their going to any school.

If you are unable to obtain a teacher through the efforts of yourself and the Inspector, you may advertise for one for the French Bay School, and also for the Saugeen Village School.\n\nIf teachers having, at least, second class professional qualifications are obtained, the Department will allow salary at the rate of $800 per annum, which will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nThe name, qualifications and experience of all applicants should be submitted to the Department for consideration and approval before the appointment is made.\n\nThe matter of obtaining teachers for both the French Bay and Saugeen Village Schools should receive your early attention, in order that teachers can be obtained in time to begin duties when the schools re-open after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of December 6th (No. 31-2-1) has been received. As the time is running rather short, would it not be well for the Indian Department or myself to advertise? I have noted the fact that the Indian Department has promised me that the Indian Department will provide a man and I have written to send him, but have not yet heard from him whether he would take the school or not. The first trouble with some of the teachers in Indian schools I have advised, is that they look upon the poor Indians as a curse for their comfort and convenience; it is quite right to be comfortable, but often the enthusiasm in the work and interest in the children are not strong enough to make them work. Whether we can keep Mr. Smith's school to be work quite a commendable interest in the pupils and I trust to have gained their confidence and goodwill.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn McCool\nOttawa, December 13th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the obtaining of the services of a teacher for the Saugeen Village Indian Day School, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming Christmas holidays.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to inform you that an advertisement for a teacher has been placed in \"The Globe\" and \"The Daily Star\", Toronto. Applications in reply will be received up to the 15th instant. I may say that we have already received a number of applications. These will be given due consideration after the 15th instant, and it is hoped to obtain the services of a qualified and satisfactory teacher for this school.\n\nYou will be advised of the name, qualifications, and so forth, of the teacher appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Applications must be in by Dec 15th. As experience in such work is necessary I might say Mr Watson taught in B.C near Vernon some few years ago where there were many Indians at that time. He was also principal of public school in Fernie for about ten years where he had to teach high school work as no college near. He is a patient, thoughtful man, and well qualified for such a position. His wife is capable teaching Domestic science and sewing if fitted, and quite musically inclined.\n\nMr Watson has not been teaching for some time, except privately, at times helped some pupils along in piano. She owns gifts I should say. Amongst circumstances he would gladly have adequate work of that kind.\n\nHis address is - F.J.

I enclose receipt in account for the same amounting to $30.00 (Recommended payment of same).\n\nIn this connection I would inform the Dept. that when the platform of the well refused to go down again I found that the capping was very badly decayed and I had to have it patched in order to prevent the earth from falling into the well. It will be necessary to have a new cistern in the near future. I would suggest that it be done in the dry season and that it be brickled.

The Pump top appears to be good but the Cylinder is split and the head is perhaps worn out. I cannot tell until it is examined by a Pump Manufacturer. The cabling of the well as stated in above letter above referred to, is decaying, and owing to some places, it appears to be newly cabled. If allowed to remain in its present condition much longer, it will cost more to have it redug than to dig a new well.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the work be done this fall.\n\nThe estimate cost-\n\nSecretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

Cribbing it with brick including platform will cost about $40.00.\n\nThe well cannot be cribbed with stone as it is only 5 ft inside the old cribbing. It takes 18 inches for one stone wall three feet for the walls, which would leave the well too small for a man to work in.

I had a Furnace Man from Southampton examine it last summer and his advice was that it was useless expenditure as it would not be a success as the old furnace is almost worn out and as it is in one corner of the basement it is difficult to make it heat the school in cold weather. My advice would be to make it do another year and have it taken out and a new furnace put in and put in a different place.

Scott\nAgent\n\n14/11/18\nVillage School.\u2014 The school is a good one, the children are bright and are advancing under Miss Ruxton.\n\nThe furnace of this school is worn out. The castings on the inside are burned out. The furnace was made by Smead, Dowd & Co. of Toronto. Mr. Stout says he has tried to get new castings but the patterns are destroyed and it is impossible to get new ones. The heating system should be installed in a different way, as it is sometimes three o'clock before the back of the room is warm.\n\nI would recommend that 1/12 of an acre be leased or purchased from the Herny property, which adjoins the school, for school garden purposes. Miss Ruxton is anxious to undertake this work and I think she would make a success of it. It should be ploughed and fenced this fall, and five or six loads of well rotted manure worked in in the spring.\nOttawa, June 26, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the old Smead-Dowd furnace in the village school, Saugeen agency, is now obsolete and beyond reasonable condition for repair, and as new sanitary and up to date heating system is advisable in the interests of the school, it will be necessary to have a resolution of the band authorizing the expenditure from the funds, at the same time a resolution should be passed to provide for the additions and changes to the Scotch Settlement school so that there will be no delay in awarding contract once the tenders have been received and approved by Council.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

D. Scott\nAgent\n\nSecretary Dept\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 22, 1916.\n\nSirs:\n\nIt is found necessary to remove from the Saugueen Indian Village School (Southampton, Ont.) the obsolete Smead-Dowyd heating and ventilating system and to replace with a modern bricked-in wood burning system of sufficient capacity to satisfactorily heat and ventilate this school.\n\nIn connection with this the Department would request that you will have your nearest representative inspect this building with a view of providing a rough plan of the heating and ventilation which you would propose to install, using your hot blast furnace style 405 and 505 of sufficient capacity to effectively do the work. Your Tender should include the installing and bricklaying in of the furnace complete with all necessary piping, registers, etc., that may be required to complete this, together with all necessary cutting and repairs of wood and brick work thereof which is made necessary by the installation and in the removal of piping of the present furnace in the walls, partitions, etc.\n\nThe removal of the old Smead-Dowyd system will be undertaken under the direction of the Indian Agent who will remove the furnace with all debris resulting therefrom. It is not however, intended to remove the piping as it is thought a considerable amount of this may be re-used in the proposed installation and where unfit this can easily be disposed of later.\n\nKir-Ben Ltd.,\nAlmonte, Ont.\nIt is intended to complete the installation as soon as possible so that the school work will not be interrupted. I have therefore requested that you will at the earliest possible time forward your tender to the Department for consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

McLean Esq.\nIndian Affairs Dept.\nBooths Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed you will please find tender for the removing of the old furnace in the Indian village school Saugeen, Ontario, near Southampton, and the installing of a new furnace in its place.\n\nWe find on going over this building which the writer did on Tuesday with one of the best heating engineers of the City of Toronto, that when this original heating system was installed, it was as near perfect as could be, but the people in charge of running the system did not understand it and that is the reason of it being burnt out so soon. The trouble has been that they have not been giving the furnace the air it requires, or have they ever fired the furnace, that is, there to heat the ventilating shaft, that forces circulation, and after looking everything over, I think you will always be up against this same proposition, and in figuring out our proposition, we are still going to use the old system, but have added an independent system to circulate from the inside, so that if they shut off the outside air we will still be able to heat the building satisfactorily, and not endanger the burning out of the furnace.\nYou say in your letter to us, that the Indian agent will remove the old furnace. We prefer doing this ourselves, as we expect to use part of the walls that are in use in the present system. I find that on looking over the tinsmith and metal workers in Southampton, and Port Elgin, that their experience in this kind of work has been very limited, and while it will cost a few dollars extra for railroad fare, and hotel expenses, I think it better to handle this from Toronto. There we have men who know how to handle this kind of a job, and finish it in such a way that it is done and no need of going back after the cold weather comes.\n\nFrustrating to be favored with your valued order,\n\nwe are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKIR-BEN LIMITED\n\nVice Pres. and Sales Manager.\nOttawa, August 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 10th inst., with estimate for the installation of heating system in the Scotch Settlement School Saugeen Agency, replacing the obsolete and worn out system now in, and in reply to inform you that your estimate of $250.00 for the doing of the work is approved.

(RG 10, Volume 6160, file 425-5, part 1)\nOttawa, November 7, 1916.\n\nMemorandum for Mr. Scott.\n\nOn October 23, I made an inspection of the village school, Saugeen Agency, in which has been installed a Kir-Ben warm air furnace and ventilating system replacing the Smead-Dowdy system erected with the building.\n\nOn the date of the inspection the weather was very mild and a practical test could not be made to prove its capability. The furnace is however, of the kind and capacity contracted for, and I am of the opinion will give satisfactory results.\n\nIn the placing of the furnaces the supports of bricks under do not appear substantial enough and these should be strengthened by providing a larger and more satisfactory base support. The cost of this will probably be about $10.00 which should be deducted from the amount due the Kir-Ben Company when settling with them, and the cost of additional supports paid for. Certain repairs are necessary to the school including pointed up of stone work, resetting stone cap on chimney, oiling and varnishing of school desks and oiling of floors.\n\nThe school desks should be treated as soon as possible as the woodwork is warping and the joints loosening for lack of this.\n\nThere are in this school 50 single desks in fair condition except for minor repairs and the finishing and varnishing, and the pupils enrolled here are only 24 with an\naverage attendance of only 17, and as desks in excess of their needs are on hand and are required at the Scotch Settlement School on this Reserve, I would recommend that seven of the surplus desks of the required size needed be transferred to the Scotch Settlement School to fill their requirements.\n\nArchitect.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR MCCOOL ON THE SAUGERTY SCHOOL.\n\nA new furnace has been installed with large register in the north wall, as formerly. The teacher complains that the heat strikes her very frequently.

The brick to be firmly laid in cement to ensure entire stability.\n\nThe work should be done as soon as possible and the accounts forwarded here for payment that the cost may be deducted from the heat contract before settlement has been made.\n\nThe work to be done as economically as possible and should not exceed $10.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The cost of this will probably be about $10.00 which should be deducted from the amount due the Kir-Ben Company when settling with them, and the cost of additional supports paid for.\"\n\nRespecting this we respectfully beg to submit as follows:\n\n\"Installation at Saugeen Indian School is O.K. Pilings that Furnace stand on are solid and the same as used in the old furnace.\"\n\nWe are willing and moreover, are anxious that any work done by us shall be correct in every way. In this particular instance we further submit that the work done is correct and we believe that there is a misunderstanding somewhere and shall be pleased to have you look into the matter further.\n\nFurther, this work stands covered by our guarantee.\nMr. J. D. Mohr\u2014\n\nand we respectfully submit that any further bricks underneath the furnace may possibly interfere with the circulation of air as intended by us and that the Department should recognize that they should be responsible for changes that will interfere with the capacity of any Circulating Air space.\n\nWe shall be pleased to hear from you further in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nK/L.\n\nKir-Ben, Limited.\nOttawa, November 30, 1916.\n\nSirs\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 27th instant in reference to the supports under furnace installed at the Village school, Saugeen Agency, and in reply to inform you that the furnace was set up on four loose brick pillars about nine inches in width and one foot in height. The pillars being loosely build would not support the furnace in the event of one or more heavy pieces of wood being thrown into it and jarring same.\n\nThe strengthening of the supporting pillars does not in any way interfere with the circulation of air or decrease its volume or its free and full admission, nor does the strengthening of the piers by increasing the size and casing-in with cement, interfere with the setting of the furnace in any particular, or your guarantee, as this work is necessary to ensure stability and safety only, and cannot be accepted as satisfactory otherwise.\n\nThe installation was inspected from headquarters before being paid for and it was thought better, as the work was necessary, to have this done by the contractor who was making other improvements there, thus lessening the cost to you.\n\nIt is possible, however, that the work has not yet been done and notice can at once be sent to Mr. Stout to hold the same in abeyance if not already completed.\n\nI have, therefore, to request that in the event of your wishing to complete the work yourselves, that you will telegraph me on the receipt of this letter, when instructions in the matter will at once be sent to Mr. Stout.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nKir-Ron, Limited,\nAlmonte,\nOnt.\n\nAsst.

E. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nKir-Ben, Limited,\nAlmonte,\nOnt.\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAnswering your favor of the 11th by Mr. J. D. Holman advise that our Mr. Bennett expects to be in Ottawa early this week but has been delayed and will not now reach there until next week.\n\nMay I have and see you immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nKir-Ben, Limited.\nI have the honor to inform the Deptt. that the furnace installed in the Indian Village School by the Mr. Ben Furnace Co. is not giving satisfaction as it seems almost impossible to heat the school room when the weather is cold. I have tried with the help of the caretaker for 2\u00bd hours and did not get above 50\u00b0 and the teacher had to let some of the small pupils go home whether the fault is with the caretaker or with the furnace I am not prepared to say but I think the Deptt. should advise the Mr. Ben Co. to send their expert here at once and see that the furnace gives satisfaction.\n\nI have the honor to be your obedient servant,\n\nF. A. Scott\nAgent\n\nSecretary Deptt.\nIndian Affairs\nOffice\nGentlemen:\n\nSome months ago I wrote re. the new furnace put into the Sagamook Village School not heating satisfactorily.\n\nYesterday with weather about zero the highest we could get the school was 62\u00b0. This is not fit for pupils to sit in so long, and though I sent them off to run about in the basement to try to keep them warm, some of them are ill after it; in fact I was almost sick myself after being chilled so long. It was only about 20\u00b0 at 9 o'clock.\n\nTo-day the highest we could make it by noon was 62\u00b0. After that the sun aided in putting it higher.\nAs stated in the previous letter, the only register in the room is way up in the wall, and there is no way of getting the children to it. (Of course this should not be necessary if the room were comfortably furnished.) Were the furnace placed near the centre of the room, and registers put in the floor, it might work.\n\nThe old furnace was very unsatisfactory. It took hours to warm the school, and consumed a great deal of wood. This one takes hours to heat up and then does not throw enough.\n\nThe weather was only about 30\u00b0 yesterday so you see how it will be when the thermometer registers 16\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 below zero even more.\n\nThese Indians having been obliged to pay for the furnace, it seems too bad that the children have to suffer from the cold. I have had to send them out to exercise, but this means lost time for the pupils.\n\nHad the Agent Mr. Stout been consulted, he would not have allowed it to be put in as it is, as he was aware of the unsatisfactory place of the old one. The furnace was put into Sunday without him being consulted.\n\nSo otah settlement has a new furnace, which gives good satisfaction and does not require a great amount of fuel.\n\nTrusting this will receive your immediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Robertson Teacher.\nOttawa, January 16, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 12th instant in reference to the furnace in village school, Saugeen Agency, and to inform you that the makers of the furnace have been informed of your statements and notified to at once demonstrate the effectiveness of their furnace, also requested to notify you of the date when this would be done so that you may assist.\n\nThe furnace installed is of a good make of sufficient capacity and should heat the building satisfactorily. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the fault is in the operating rather than in the furnace, and it will be well to have the caretaker manipulate the furnace under the direction of the furnace expert so that there may be no further trouble in the matter.\n\nYou should also inform Mr. Baxter that his letter in this matter has been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. A. Stout, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippawa Hill,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that he, with the assistance of the caretaker, tried to fire up and could not raise the temperature above degrees in zero weather. School cannot be conducted at such temperature and so you guaranteed us to heat the building during zero weather which apparently it is not able to do and as it is necessary to maintain the school, I have asked that you will, at once, demonstrate by heating the building in an satisfactory way the efficiency of the furnace or explain its being insufficient, to provide adequate heat.\n\nBefore demonstrating, it will be well for Mr. T. A. Stout, the Indian Agent at Chippawa, to assist you during the demonstration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nKir-Ben, Limited,\nFurnaces, Etc.,\nAlmonte, Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Departmental letter of the 16th instant, in regard to heating-furnace at village school, Saugeen Agency, wherein you were informed of the intended procedure in respect to the testing of this furnace, I beg to inform you that it has been considered advisable to procure additional information in connection with this, before requesting the Company to make a test of their furnace.\n\nThe information requested is as follows:\n\nWhat kind of fuel is used, and is this dry, seasoned, or green wood?\n\nIs the wood used, maple, beech, birch, oak or soft wood?\n\nIs the building kept heated during the night or is the fire started again in the morning, and if so at what hour?\n\nIs the cold air from outside, shut off during the hours when the school is closed, and the inside cold air used during the night and when the building is unoccupied, or is the outside cold air duct left open at all times? Is the small ventilation heater used at any time, and if so, when?\n\nI have to request that you will forward this information as soon as possible, when the Department will communicate with the manufacturers in reference to their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

The results shown are not satisfactory, and the temperature is certainly not high enough for comfort. It is noted that the temperature is very low at 9 o'clock and rises rapidly during the day. This shows conclusively that the fires are not being properly attended to or the temperature would be maintained at a normal point at all times. It is impossible to heat a class-room the size of the one there with its very high ceiling unless the building is at the right temperature on the opening of the school. The furnace is capable of properly heating the building, it being considerably larger in capacity than is necessary for this purpose. The trouble, therefore, appears in the attention given, and possibly the fuel used is not dry. With reference to this I may say that you were written to on January 24th last, and requested to give certain information with respect to the attention given the furnace and the fuel used. This information should be sent in at once as the Department requires it before communicating with the Kir-Sen people who placed the furnace.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. A. Stout, Esq., Asst.

The fires are said to be renewed each morning between 7 and 8 o'clock and efficiently maintained during the day, and notwithstanding this, the temperature is reported as being too low to enable them to carry on school work, the temperature ranging during the school hours as follows, viz., Feb. 12th, from 20\u00b0 to 55\u00b0; Feb. 13th, from 22\u00b0 to 54\u00b0; Feb. 14th, from 40\u00b0 to 65\u00b0; Feb. 19th from 16\u00b0 to 65\u00b0. From the temperatures shown it must be admitted that furnace is not showing satisfactory results as guaranteed by you, and I have, therefore, to inform you that the Department cannot accept this as being satisfactory, and require that you will efficiently demonstrate its capacity to do the work guaranteed.\n\nIt is now too late to make the test this year owing to the delay of the Agent in answering the Department's enquiry of Jan. 24th last and which reached us on the 12th instant. The test must, therefore, be made during the next Winter in presence of an official of this Department at a suitable date which will be arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It is also necessary to have a certain quantity of dry light wood with which to raise the temperature in the mornings or at other times when a sudden demand for heat is needed.\n\nIt is quite certain that in this school, as in every other, that satisfactory results cannot be obtained without efficient attention, and the lack of this is generally found to be the reason for unsatisfactory heating.\n\nA copy of the Department's letter to the Kir-Ben Company is enclosed for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

When the new furnace was installed last fall it proved even more unsatisfactory than the old one - it being simply impossible to heat the rooms on a severe day.

(RG 10, Volume 6160, file 425-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI beg to report that in September the 19th and 20th I made an inspection of the village school, Saugan Agency, it having been reported that the furnace was not giving satisfactory service.\n\nThe furnace and ventilation system was carefully examined and found in good working condition and amply capable of satisfactorily heating and ventilating the building if given the proper attention, (which it apparently does not get.) There is only one change which might be made to advantage, viz., the lowering of the combined hall and cloak-room registers to floor line, to permit of the children warming and drying their feet there when coming in wet and cold, which might be an advantage for this purpose but would not otherwise change the conditions.\n\nThere are twenty-seven pupils enrolled with an average attendance of sixteen, which is reported as unlikely to be increased. The class-room is 25 x 41' with accommodation for 63 pupils, thus providing considerable more than double the room space required. There are eight large windows in class-room having a combined glass area of about 216 square feet, and without storm-sash to protect the windows from the direct outside temperature, and in addition some of the sash is broken, and in one instance will require a new sash.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI would therefore recommend that storm-sash be provided for all the class-room windows, the damage sash be made good, that one new front door be provided and fixed in position, hall register lowered, and would suggest that as the class-room is more than twice the capacity at present required, (or in the near future) a partition be built, shutting off the unnecessary portion with the consequent saving in fuel which would itself pay the cost of the change in two or three years.\nThe estimated cost of the repairs is as follows:\n\nStorm-sash and repairs to windows, $153.00\nPartitions, 115.00\nFront door and setting 10.00\nChanges to registers, 10.00\n\nTotal $293.00\n\nArchitect.\nOctober 2nd, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that it is considered necessary to provide storm-sash for all class-room windows at the village school, Saugan Indian Reserve, a new sash to replace the broken one; also a new front door, unless this can be repaired economically.\n\nThe storm-sash should be made of 1/4 inch material, glazed with medium sized glass, hinged at top and fastened with proper hook fasteners where required. Ventilation openings should be provided in the bottoms of each sash, the sashes to be painted two good coats before being hung.\n\nPrices should be obtained from persons in the vicinity doing this work and submitted to the Department for consideration that the work may be authorized if the prices are found reasonable.\n\nYou are also authorized to have the registers in hall entrance and boy's cloak-room lowered to the floor height and a tin register box placed in the stack to make this satisfactory. This should be completed as soon as possible, so that the furnace will be ready when required.\n\nWith reference to the ventilation, a hinged door should be placed over the fresh air opening in furnace so that the air in question only may be used during excessively cold weather, the door to be controlled by a chain and pulley set where convenient for this purpose. This work to be done as early and as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. A. Stout, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nChippewa Hill, Ont.\n\nAsst.
