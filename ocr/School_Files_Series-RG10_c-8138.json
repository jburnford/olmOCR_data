Query,\nDirector of Services,\nDept. of Public Printing\nand Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nSchool Supplies - Indian Schools\n\nDear Mr. Query:\n\nFor the past month your Mr. Joly of the Book Unit and our Mr. Trask in charge of requisitions for school supplies, have been meeting to work out a system which will be taken into use when your new International Business Machines equipment is put into operation from April 1, 1950.\n\nYou will recall our conversations of a year ago and will remember that I promised to advise you concerning the relative efficiency of the new system as compared with the old. I believe that we can now report to you that the establishment of this Book Unit has been a wise move and one which has proven beneficial to us. Since the establishment of this Book Unit we have had few complaints from our school inspectors, principals and teachers.\n\nWe are also pleased to report that Mr. Joly has proven to be obliging and cooperative in his dealings with this office. He has shown a genuine interest in our educational problems and has done his best to help when difficult cases have arisen.\n\nOur two officials have worked out a priority system which is very effective and it is hoped that this can be\nincorporated in the new machine system operation as this feature is due to the relative isolation of some of our schools and the inevitable delays which occur in receiving their requisitions.\n\nYou can expect an increase during June, July and August of the number of requisitions sent to the Book Unit from this Division. Our school building programme is naturally aimed at building new schools by September the first. These have to be completely stocked and added to our normal increase in requisitions during the summer months leads to a heavy demand for supplies.\n\nIt is necessary for us to employ during these months two university students to assist in the extra flow of work here. As I have previously mentioned to you, some consideration could be given to hiring university students also in the Book Unit. I believe that requisitions are now being filled within about four weeks. With the closing of the Unit during the installation of the new machines, this will increase the delay to about two months. If we are to give efficient service to our schools, this delay gap must be reduced before the end of June.\n\nIn conclusion may I express my appreciation to you and to your staff for the understanding and cooperation which we have received in the meeting of our mutual problem.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nGeneral Steel Wares Limited,\n6976 Shaughnessy,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nAs per instructions of Mr. W.

It penetrates deeply, sealing the cellulose and hardening the entire surface of old wood so that snow, mud, water, or grime cannot mar the finish. It is easy to apply, requiring no skilled labor and will last many times as long as the best varnish under similar conditions. Seal-O-San takes wax beautifully, keeping the floors attractive and clean, greatly prolonging their usefulness. Write today for folder.\n\nWASHINGTON LABORATORIES\nTHE PERFECT GYMNASIUM FLOOR FINISH\n\nTested, used, and approved by over 5,300 leading basketball coaches who all agree, Seal-O-San gymnasium floor finish is the final and complete solution of the troublesome problem of the gymnasium floor.\n\nAlmost without exception, coaches say there is no other gymnasium floor finish like Seal-O-San. They like it because it produces a non-slippery surface which permits faster team play and reduces danger of accident. They know that a full firing gym team enables them to play better basketball, win more games, and increase gate receipts. Year by year, through sheer merit, it has grown in popularity.\n\nSchool officials like Seal-O-San because, even though admittedly the finest gym floor finish available, it is surprisingly inexpensive. Applied with a wide brush or a lamb's wool mop, it dries without showing lap or brush marks, so the floor can be refinished by the regular janitors or other employees of the school almost as easily as scrubbing a floor. Since no skilled labor is required, application costs are negligible. It can be done quickly, too, without interrupting playing schedules.\n\nJanitors like Seal-O-San because it is so easy to maintain. Scrubbing is entirely eliminated. The penetrating liquid fills every wood cell and seals the floor against dirt or moisture. Rubber burns stay on top and are easily removed.\n\nWrite for more information about Seal-O-San for your gymnasium, and ask for interesting free booklets shown at the right. The Seal-O-San Coaches' Digest and the Seal-O-San Basketball Shot Charts.\n\nFREE\nEIGHT Beautiful COLORS\n\nSeal-O-San Enamel now offers a wide variety of color schemes to add to the attractiveness of walls and floors in school rooms, corridors, factories, service stations, and wherever a wear-resistant finish in gleaming colors is desirable.\n\nFor DISCOLORED FLOORS\n\nStained and unsightly floors require a pigmented product to hide the discolorations. Seal-O-San Enamel with its generous quantity of penetrating pigment will produce a beautiful and uniform color on the most unsightly surface.\n\nFor OLD LINOLEUM\n\nThe life of old cracked linoleum may be greatly prolonged with Seal-O-San Enamel. When the Dark Oak color is chosen, an old floor has the pleasing appearance of a new Battleship Linoleum covering.\n\nfor BASKETBALL FLOORS\n\nThe boundaries of the floor and the center and foul circles of the basketball playing floor may be pleasingly defined and protected by finishing with a suitable color of Seal-O-San Enamel. The balance of the playing floor is greatly beautified and made non-slippery by treating with Seal-O-San (clear) Gymnasium Floor Seal.\n\nSEAL-O-SAN Enamel PRESERVES FLOORS\nYour own men can apply SEAL-O-SAN Enamel\n\nSeal-O-San Enamel is an easily flowing liquid which can be applied rapidly with a wide brush or lambs-wool mop by unskilled men or boys. The liquid covers readily and flows together in drying so there are no lap or brush marks in the finished work.\n\nFloors finished with Seal-O-San Enamel can be maintained easily by going over them with a Cedar-San treated mop. The elimination of pits and crevices provides a surface that does not catch dirt readily and stays clean longer. Write today for more information.\n\nSEAL-O-SAN \"Non-Slippery\" GYM FLOOR FINISH\n\nFor a better playing floor, seal your gymnasium with SEAL-O-SAN Gym Floor Seal. It is designed especially for the quick starts and stops of basketball games. Its non-slippery finish speeds up the game and helps prevent accidents. More than 5,500 coaches in America's leading schools and colleges use SEAL-O-SAN and recommend it highly.\n\nWhen Seal-O-San Enamel is used on the boundaries of the floor and the center and foul circles along with Seal-O-San Gym Floor Finish, the best playing areas are obtained. Super Seal-O-San is another product widely used as a top-coat on gymnasium floors where the finest, most durable playing surface is desired.

Teachers wishing to advance their grade of license usually attend summer school sessions at some Maritime university.\n\nSince 1947, however, we have conducted a summer school to enable permit teachers to qualify for regular license. A permit teacher with a Grade XI standing may obtain a Second Class License on the successful completion of two summer sessions and a professional reading course taken by correspondence during the school year. This, of course, is only a temporary measure during this period of teacher shortage.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(M.

The Grades 1 to 3 are, as you probably know, the only books approved by the Department for use in Ontario, and we have the Canadian Reading Development Series in Grades 4, 5 and 6. However, the Grade 4 Alice and Jerry reader, SINGING WHEELS, makes an excellent Social Studies book, and the 5 and 6 books are certainly of interest. I would be very glad to know how the test comes out at the Six Nations School whenever you have any results.\n\nWe have recently managed to get out our new elementary catalogue, a copy of which I have enclosed, and I am wondering if you would like sufficient copies for each of the Indian schools across the country. We can send any number you like along to you, or mail them out ourselves if you could give us some sort of mailing list. We can do whatever is most convenient for you, and I shall be looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nI was sorry that our chance to see you during the Convention was so limited, though we were extremely pleased that you took the trouble to drop in, and hope that you will come next year for perhaps a little longer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE COPP CLARK CO.

E40296\nMay 23, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Query:\n\nYou are aware that in the next three months we must furnish our Indian schools across the country with sufficient school supplies and textbooks for opening of school on the 5th of September.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that quite a number of items are not being shipped at present mainly due to two reasons: (1) items not in stock due to one reason or another and (2) items are in stock but a billing has not been received from the suppliers consequently the articles cannot be released for shipment until the cost price has been secured.\n\nIn the case of the first group such items as follows are not being shipped:\n\n- Poster paper, 9 x 12\n- Kraft Wrapping paper, 18 x 24\n- Foolscap\n- Scratch pads\n- Paste brushes\n- Indelible pencils\n- Letter Cards\n- Workbooks for Streets and Roads\n- More Streets and Roads\n- Workbooks - More Streets and Roads\n- Pupils' Own Vocabulary Spellers, Book 1\n- Ink erasers\n- Pencil erasers\n- Penholders\n- Blotters, 18 x 24\n- Thumb tacks\n- Transparent adhesive paper tape\n- Teachers' scissors\n- Water color boxes\n- Water color paper, 9 x 12\nFrom this list it will be readily seen that there should be no difficulty securing these, as the suppliers have the stock and are prepared to make immediate delivery. It is respectfully suggested that a check be made and stock replenished at once.\n\nIn the second group the following items have not been released for shipments:\n\n- Our First Book\n- Workbook This is Our Family\n- Natural Science through the Seasons\n- Bailey Writing Book 1\n- \" \" 2\n- Young Explorers Workbooks Young Explorers\n- Water color brushes #5\n- Dictionaries (small)\n\nThe reason for the holding up of the shipments of items in group 2 is difficult to understand, as billings are not forwarded to the Department until such time as your re-organization is in effect. Consequently no reason can be seen for holding up the shipments as by the time you will be in a position to bill the Department you should have the prices on hand. As it is, the shipments are held up at present resulting in additional work for your shipping staff and complaints from the schools.\n\nYour usual co-operation in having this matter rectified would be appreciated. It is also hoped that additional shipping staff will be engaged at 47 Clarence Street for the summer months to clear up the large back log of requisitions by September.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

In fact, it is built according to their specifications, with a slant stream bubbler which has an adequate mouth guard and a supply pipe and drain pipe absolutely independent of each other.\n\nThus all possibility of contamination is eliminated, because the slant stream of water cannot fall back on the bubbling head. Also the drain water can never come in contact with the water in the supply pipe. The stainless steel lining of the water container will never rust. A well insulated area around the water container keeps the water supply cool and fresh. Capacity 10 gallons.\n\nStudy the cross section illustration which shows details of construction.\n\nWith a Sanitary Drinking Fountain, drinking water is no longer a rural school problem.\n\nPrice Freight Paid $85.00\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL SUPPLY LTD.\nBRANDON (P.O.

They are as follows showing their respective prices:\n\nJ.E. Poole Company, Toronto, Ont. .35\u00a2 each\n\nL.A. Reeves Ink Co., Ltd., Toronto. $3.96 a dos.\n\nArtists Supply Co., Ltd., Toronto. .50 less 33 1/3\u00a2\n\nJ.E. Poole's product is put up in very poor boxes which have a tendency to break open in transit. This has happened on different occasions resulting in damage to books and supplies in the case. The Department feels that this product does not suit our needs.\n\nThe other two are similar. The package containing the powder is similar and the products are satisfactory.\n\nL.A. Reeves have their product packed in smaller containers which might have some advantage for shipping and the price is one third cent less. The Department, therefore, requests that future orders for Dry Tempera be placed with L.A. Reeves Ink Co., Toronto.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nMr. R.

Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education\n\nMay 25th, 1950\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWhen writing you on May 22nd, we offered to enclose a sample of the booklet \"Cascorez Paper Craft Project,\" and now enclose same for your examination.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE BORDEN COMPANY, LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nTFD:RN\nEnc.\nCASCOREZ is Borden's new synthetic glue (a polyvinyl acetate resin). It is the ideal household glue because it combines the best features of many kinds of household glues. It is as clean and as easy to use as library paste\u2014but as strong and fast-setting as hot glue.\n\nCASCOREZ has so many other unique properties there is no end of ways to use it. For example, when thinned with a little water, CASCOREZ can be brushed onto paper to give it the appearance, feel and toughness of parchment (see Project No. 4). And when first applied to paper or cardboard, CASCOREZ makes the material soft and pliable so you can tool it like leather (see Project No. 6). Or, use CASCOREZ as a binder, mixing in various fillers, to obtain a mass with good working properties (see Project No. 10).\n\nYou get all these properties\u2014strength, transparency, flexibility\u2014whenever you use CASCOREZ as your general \"fix-it\" glue for home, school and office. Here are a few of its hundreds of uses:\n\nModel building. Sets fast on balsa, paper, other model materials. Makes a durable bond.\n\nFor photo fans. For mounting prints, repairing camera bellows and all wood or fabric equipment. Also for mounting small prints, etc.\n\nBook repairs. Ideal for re-gluing broken book backings. Non-staining. Becomes transparent when set.\n\nKitchen uses. For mounting recipes, fastening shelf edging, labelling jelly jars, etc. See \"Packaging\" below.\n\nHome repairs. Makes strong bonds on furniture, toys, porous pottery, cardboard games, loose tile, linoleum, felt pads, artificial leather, etc.\n\nFor packaging. Makes quick-setting seams on paper or paperboard packages. Makes a strong sealing tape when applied to strip of heavy paper. Ideal for labelling on wood or cardboard. A thin coat of CASCOREZ applied over the label forms a transparent, protective coating.\n\nCOPYRIGHT, 1949, THE BORDEN COMPANY\n\nSnipped Paper Work\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nBY CUTTING a narrow section from the end of a packet of crepe paper and closely snipping one edge with scissors, you will have a length of fringe-like decorative material which can be glued in overlapping layers over a cardboard or paper form for your own designs. Those illustrated are merely indicative of the possibilities and represent a Christmas tree, dog and a small covered paper nut cup which will also hold small items such as buttons, pins, etc. These articles make excellent decorative table pieces and they are also at home on a what-not shelf.\n\nFig. 2 shows the method of winding the snipped paper strip around a form. Wind each turn close together for a short distance ahead of the strip, and overlap each turn so as to prevent the form from showing. When winding over a larger section, use wider laps over the larger curve. Brown crepe paper was used to cover this dog figure and a bit of crepe was glued over the nose. The two cardboard discs which form bases were covered with green construction paper and edged with...\nMaking a Hygroscope\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nWHILE THIS is not as precise as a barometer for foretelling the weather, it will actually indicate the increase in humidity when precipitation is stored together. In addition, it is an attractive piece for a table or shelf and will arouse the curiosity of visitors.\n\nMost of the parts are of heavy cardboard. Draw a figure of a girl like that shown, or copy one from a published illustration. Glue it to cardboard and cut away the background. The indicating arm is loose and held to the body with a common brad pin which serves as a fulcrum. For additional support, glue a cardboard base behind the feet of the figure, and glue supporting pieces to the back (as indicated in Fig. 2) for later gluing to the tree cut-out. Cover the tree with dark green construction paper and glue it to the bright-green, semi-circular base.\nNovelty Box in Hammered Metal Finish\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nThe novel treatment described here for finishing a cardboard novelty box or container can be applied to any number of projects where the appearance of expensive hammered metal is desired. By using CASCOREZ, the treatment is inexpensive and easy.\n\nThe box shown in Fig. 1 can be made in most any size or shape. Fabri cate it from two thicknesses of heavy cardboard, such as strawboard, strengthening and welding the parts together with CASCOREZ. The lid is four plies, the two on the underside being slightly smaller so the lid fits into the top of the box.\n\nGive the top of the lid and sides of the box two heavy coatings of CASCOREZ, allowing each to dry; then immediately cover the surfaces with aluminum foil, pressing it into good contact. The foil should extend beyond the edges so that it can be folded over the edges. Aluminum foil such as used for packing food in CASCOREZ is suitable.\n\nFig. 3 shows how the hammered-metal effect is achieved with a peening hammer. Any similar tool having a smooth rounded surface may also be used. Tap the foil with smart blows to leave an all-over pattern, supporting the opposite side of each\nNovelty Box in Hammered Metal Finish\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nThe novel treatment described here for finishing a cardboard novelty box or container can be applied to any number of small projects where the appearance of expensive hammered metal is desired. By using CASCOREZ, the treatment is inexpensive and easy.\n\nThe box shown in Fig. 1, can be made in most any size or shape. Fabricate it out of heavy cardboard, such as strawboards, strengthening and welding the parts together with CASCOREZ. The lid of four plies, the two on the underside being slightly smaller so the lid fits into the top of the box.\n\nGive the top of the lid and sides of the box two heavy coatings of CASCOREZ, allowing each to dry; then apply one more coat and immediately cover the surfaces with aluminum foil, pressing it into good contact. The foil should be long enough to overlap so that it can be folded over the edges. Aluminum foil such as used for packing food in stores may be suitable.\n\nFig. 3 shows how the hammered-metal effect is achieved with a peening hammer. Any similar tool having a rounded head and smooth face also be used. Tap the foil with smart blows to leave an all-over pattern, supporting the opposite side of each\nParchmentized Book Cover\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nOne of the singular features of CASCOREZ is that it will transform ordinary tissue paper so that it has the appearance, feel and toughness of parchment. This glue may be applied either by brushing or dipping. If the former method is used, be sure to wash off any excess; the extraordinary adhesiveness of CASCOREZ has a tendency to pull any loose bristles from a brush and weld them to the paper being parchmentized. The method calls for the use of equal parts of CASCOREZ and water, well mixed to a thin cream.\n\nFirst make a paper pattern of the book cover. Cut two sheets of white or colored tissue paper a slightly larger size. Lay them on sheets of waxed paper and thoroughly coat them with the thinned mixture. You can set them up one sheet from the waxed papers and lay it in contact with the treated side of the other. Coat the top sheet with CASCOREZ, then pull both from the waxed paper and hang them up.\nDecorative Bottle Holder\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nWith paper and Cascorez Glue you can easily assemble a holder that will make a bottle decorative in any surroundings. The treatment lends itself to many variations, but essentially it consists in making a paper form to fit over the lower part of the bottle and decorating the form with white and colored paper raffia. A length of raffia in contrasting color is then shaped into a narrow ring around the bottle contents and attached with Cascorez to the outside of the holder.\n\nThe raffia is made from strips of crepe paper cut from the end of a packet. The strips should be from one-half inch wide depending mostly on the size of the holder you want to make. They are twisted into raffia, the paper being either before or after being impregnated with two parts of Cascorez and water. In Fig. 3, the latter method is used. Coat up to the end of the strip with Cascorez solution, then twist it, and continue with the remainder of the strip in the same way. The Casco Twist is wound up tightly so that it holds the untreated paper so that it can be twirled rapidly. Use an ordinary spool, clock spring, and to the inside of one of the legs glue the handle from an old water-color brush. Sand off the cut end of the handle at an angle so that it will have a larger gluing surface.\n\nThe form for the holder is made of heavy paper walls and a thick cardboard bottom and is assembled with Cascorez as in Fig. 2. The form should be a slightly loose fit over the bottle; an application of the raffia will make it tighter. Coat the outside of the form with undiluted Cascorez and wind on the raffia. In making the holder illustrated here, the form was entirely covered with closely-wound white raffia, and it was then decorated at top and\nbottom with loosely-wound brown raffia. The name was shaped from red raffia. Shaping of the name should be done while the material is yet quite impressionable and being twisted. It should be noted that the colors of many crepe papers will run when they are moist, therefore when two colors of paper are brought together they should be allowed to dry without shifting. When the box is finished, coat lightly inside and out, with thinned varnish.\n\nHere's why CASCOREZ is best for paper projects:\n\nReady-to-use, no mixing or heating. Spreads easily to a thin, smooth film. Sets fast, almost instantly on porous surfaces. Stronger than the strongest paper or fabric. Waterproofs transparent films. Keeps prints and photographs clean. Will not yellow. If exposed to a little water, it can be applied again. Will not peel off. Forms a transparent, water-resistant coating for covering for albums, maps, etc.\n\nOther CASCOREZ Papercraft Projects\n\n1. Snipped Paper Work. Party Decorations. 2. Weather Fore- cast. 3.

This is easily demonstrated in making a simple paper cigarette case, shown in Fig. 1.\n\nEach of the sides are cut from two thicknesses of heavy cardboard bonded together with CASCOREZ.\n\nMake a paper pattern for the third piece, consisting of several strips of medium-weight paper laminated with CASCOREZ on the inside of each of the three parts with gray or colored construction paper and the outside with heavy-textured cover stock. The latter is obtainable in several colors at printing shops. Apply CASCOREZ liberally so that it will penetrate and make plastic the sections to be tooled, and so that\nthe cover strip will be strengthened for bending to shape.\n\nFig. 2 shows how the tooling is accomplished. Use carbon paper to transfer the design, monogram or other decoration. For stylus use an orange wood maulstick stick. Lubricate the point with paraffin. Hold the stylus near the point and use moderate pressure so that the lines are tooled deeply. Any portion of the design may be stippled by tapping it repeatedly with the point of the stylus.\n\nBend the cover to shape before the cascorez has completely set, then glue the parts together securely. With additional cascorez applied to the inside of the joint for reinforcement. Glue the ends of a strip of the same material to the front edge to serve as a holder when the case is dry. When the case is dry it may be given a gloss with furniture wax if desired.\n\nHere's why cascorez is best for paper projects:\n\n- Ready to use, no mixing, no heating. Spreads easily to a thin film.\n- Sets fast, almost instantly on contact with air.\n- Stronger than the strongest paper or fabric. Dries clear and transparent film - keeps projects clean and bright.\n- Can be painted or varnished; a little water, it can be applied to form a transparent water-resistant coating for covering albums, maps, etc.\n\nOther cascorez papercraft projects:\n\n1.

The paper is molded over another bowl or dish made of glass, aluminum, or wood. The finished paper bowl will almost exactly reproduce the shape of the form because the cascorez reduces the paper somewhat plastic and reinforces it without distortion when it is dry.\n\nIn order to handle the form easily, shape a lump of modeling clay (or plastic weatherstripping putty) which is very adhesive, into a handle which can be pressed to stick to the inside of the form. So that the form will part easily from the mold, paper should dip the outside quickly into melted paraffin. This should leave a thin film of the wax entirely covering the form; if there are any bumps or drippings, remove them with a knife.\n\nOrdinary white or colored construction paper is a very good molding medium. Cut it into a small dish or any shape you wish. Coat both sides of each piece with cascorez and press them in the molded position, as in Fig. 2. By the use of different colors of paper it is possible to work out most any design you desire, from the rim edge of the bowl to the bottom, then apply two or three more layers in the same manner.\n\nAfter the work is dry, merely warm the form and you can twist the paper duplicate free. Remove any bare spots of paper that may appear. If you do not like the design inside the bowl, you can now cover it with another layer. This is\nNovel Paper Shade Pull\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nAn unusual shade pull like that shown in Fig. 1 will give a novel decorative touch to any window. The pull is especially effective at night as the recessed figure of a dog or other animal picks up and reflects the light from inside or outside the house. By using numbers instead of a design, this is an unusual way of showing a house number.\n\nFor each pull you will need four heavy cardboard discs, up to about 2\u00bd\" in diameter. Glue two pairs of discs together with Cascorez Glue to make two thick discs, then with a sharp knife cut from each disc the figure of a dog or other design. Glue a disc of colored construction paper to one side of each disc. The color should harmonize with the color scheme of the room in which the pull is to be used. Punch the paper through the cut-out design, so as to cover the cut edges, and trim away the excess.\n\nFor the remaining side (the back) of each disc, choose a color of paper offering a slight contrast. Coat it evenly with Cascorez, lay one of\nthe discs firmly on it and immediately fill the recess with reflective glass beads. A layer of beads will adhere to the CASCOREZ inside the recess, and you can pour off the excess. Treat the other disc in the same manner. Now glue the two discs together with the design on the outside. Cover the edge with a strip of colored foil paper, then make a smooth finish pull, above the design, for the attachment cord.\n\nThe reflective glass beads are obtainable at shops carrying artists' and sign writers' supplies. They are commonly used in making the reflecting signs which you see along the highways. You have probably wondered how these signs can pick up and reflect stray automobile headlights clearly at night. You will achieve the same effect, on a smaller scale, with your CASCOREZ shade pulls at the windows.\n\n**Paper Silhouette Lamp**\n\nBy Kenneth Murray\n\nWith paper, cardboard and CASCOREZ Glue you can very easily make a silhouette night light like that shown in Fig. 1. It looks much more expensive than it actually costs. Besides being a practical night light that consumes very little current, it is a decorative addition to any room.\n\nLaminate two or three sheets of heavy cardboard together with CASCOREZ, then cut a sheet of black construction paper to the size and a sheet of gray paper to the other. On the gray side, which will be the back of the lamp, trace the outlines and cut-outs of the silhouette, which may be a ship, a dog or most any design which lends itself well to this treatment. Cut out the design with either a sharp knife or a fine coping saw blade.\n\nThe base should in most cases be oval in shape, cut from the same material. Cover the edges with a strip of black paper. To mount the silhouette on the base, as in Fig. 2, use thick cardboard braces at the base and apply generous dabs of CASCOREZ. The miniature lamp is of the miniature frosted type consuming 7\u00bd watts, and it fits in a single Christmas-tree socket which is mounted in one of the cardboard\nbraces as shown. With this mounting in a regulation socket, there is no danger from fire. The lamp generates very little heat. The silhouette is of course most effective when it is placed at or above eye level and within 1 ft. of a wall from which the light can be reflected.\n\nHere's why CASCOREZ is best for paper projects:\n\nReady to use, no mixing, no heating. CASCOREZ Blue film minimizes whitening. Safe for all types of paper. The bond is stronger than the paper itself. Dries to a clear, transparent finish. Easy to use\u2014nest and clean. Thinned with a little water, CASCOREZ is applied by brush or dipping to form a tough, flexible, instant protective covering for all kinds of paper\u2014stamps, etc.\n\nTHE BORDEN COMPANY \u2022 Chemical Division \u2022 350 Madison Ave. \u2022 New York 17, N.Y.\n\nOther CASCOREZ Papercraft Projects\n\n1.

If you don't have enough of them (who does?), or if you'd like designs of your very own, you can make them with very little trouble and expense.\n\nHomemade scatterpins can have all the luster and fineness of manufactured ones. Using CASCOREZ Glue you can accomplish this easily with bits of foil and colored paper.\n\nCoins and Pearl. The back of this pin consists of some discs of black paper, about the size of a dime, laminated together with CASCOREZ. The gold \"coins\", from \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches in diameter, are cut from a piece of gold foil paper and then has been glued to a sheet of heavy black paper for strength. Attach the \"coins\" in overlapping concentric positions with CASCOREZ. The \"pearl\" (a very good simulation, too!) is made by taking a bit of \"Cascorez\" between the thumb and finger and the palm of the opposite hand. After it has taken shape of a ball, allow it to dry before glueing it in the center of the \"circle of coins\".\n\n\"Cas-sculp\" is made as you need it, by mixing CASCOREZ and ordinary corn starch into a thick dough. In making a \"pearl\" you can give it a rose tint with just a touch of red writing ink mixed in. The completed scatterpin will take on a high gloss if you dip it in CASCOREZ (hold it on the point of a common pin), then allow it to dry again and apply a coat of furniture wax.\n\nAmerican Flag. Laminate pieces of thick cardboard together to make the flag about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\). In the left corner glue a small square of blue foil paper, and cover the remainder with alternating narrow strips of black and white paper. When the CASCOREZ has set, cover the back and sides with aluminum foil tape, neatly with the point of a manicure stick to give a hammered-silver effect. Coat the face of the pin evenly with CASCOREZ and sprinkle freely over it some reflective glass beads, which you can secure at a shop selling hardware and sign writers' supplies. After drying, trim off any excess beads. The beads will catch stray rays of light to make the flag shine and stand out especially noticeable at night. Remember that the American Flag is always worn above any other pin, insignia or emblem.\nSilver Moth. The base is cut from cardboard laminated into a thick piece with CASCOREZ. Apply a thick coat of CASCOREZ and shape it with a marquise stick as in Fig. 2. When it is partly dry, cover with aluminum foil using a heavy coat of CASCOREZ. Tap the foil gently with the pointed end of the glue stick to give a hammered-silver effect. Glue two bits of colored foil on the head to give the appearance of eyes.\n\nThese three examples will start you in making designs of your own. Pin backs can be purchased; or you can use small gilded safety pins, or tiny pieces of fine spring wire into the shape of a pin. The pin bases will be held securely by the use of a thick dab of CASCOREZ. Before the pin is ever used in the coat, it would be a good idea to coat them with clear fingernail polish which has been well thinned to the consistency of water.\n\nHere's why CASCOREZ is best for paper projects:\n\nReady to use, no mixing, no heating, spreads evenly, dries fast, almost instantly on other surfaces, strong, flexible, non-staining, paper or cardboard projects keep neat and clean. CASCOREZ can be applied by brush or dipper to give a smooth, even, consistent protective covering for albums, maps, etc.\n\nOther CASCOREZ Papercraft Projects\n\n1.

I think your Department could help him in this matter, as he wants something about Indian Crafts, and I assume also something about present-day activities of Indians would be acceptable.\n\nHe has included some seat work which could be either retained in the book or left out.\n\nPersonally, I think that the book should be illustrated by an artist.\n\nAs far as I can tell from a cursory examination the material is simply written, but I do get the impression that it is presented from the point of view of a non-Indian. In other words, it is a book that tells the non-Indian about the Indian. This may sound a little obscure, but I had in mind a book that would tell the Indians about themselves.\n\nThis point of view could, however, be easily altered by editing. You may want one of your own teachers to go over this, as I think it will need a little simplifying here and there where Mr. Woodley's knowledge of history may take for granted knowledge that the youngster of this grade level does not have.\n\nI hope you will try to visualize the book with illustrations and diagrams. I am sure that it can be made into a useful supplementary book.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J.

I am holding these documents a little longer as I wish to read them again before returning them.\n\nI have just sent the Ms. of my little book, \"The Indian in Canada's Story\", to Mr. C.J. Bustace of J.M. Dent and Sons, Toronto. I sent both the original and a copy, which he will forward to you. I hope that the book will please you. I have had the need of the school in mind when I was preparing the book and have tried to keep the language at the right level and yet to include as much information as young people would be likely to assimilate.\n\nAs you will judge from the list of books which I mention as providing material, I have had to range far and wide for information. Although the book is not large, it has involved a great deal of reading. Often considerable reading only resulted in the discovery of a stray fact or item which I could use. I do not know of any book which gives such a general view of the place of the Indian in Canada's story, hence my title.\n\nI most deeply appreciate the assistance which you have so generously given and shall refer to it in a Preface to the book, which I still have to write.\n\nWith best personal regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nE.C.

The \"Before We Read\" is discarded entirely. \"We Look and See\" is reviewed. \"We Come and Go\" is recommended for extra reading work so is \"We Look and See\". These all make reading difficult for the Indian children to follow as they do not have the background that children for whom this series was prepared. The author of the readers states that \"We Work and Play\" may be used as the initial Pre-Primer for average and superior pupils who are well prepared for reading, since it provides for the basic development of all words including the seventeen introduced in \"We Look and See\".\n\nThe teacher, by using the Teachers Manual, the workbooks provided and the readers can make a success of her reading program. The 100 types of Primary Seatwork which we supply will prove useful. I feel that the Correspondence Course would prove helpful too, however, not essential.\n\nThe Arithmetic as handled in the course is quite good. However, the use of Jolly Numbers, the Jolly Numbers Manual, the Provincial Course of Study and 100 Types of Primary Seatwork should accomplish equal results.\nAs we have not settled on a suitable Printing and Writing book for use in the schools, this course has some useful suggestions that might be worthy of consideration.\n\nThe Social Studies as handled is not new, as a teacher can pick up a library book and read a suitable story, or tell a story on a subject she wants to put across and provides seatwork from suggestions in 100 types of Primary Seatwork and the Curriculum.\n\nSumming up this Correspondence Course deals particularly with reading and as its beginning is too advanced for our schools the whole set is out of line. The stories for Social Studies are quite difficult for our children. The seatwork is outstanding, however, as all books go, this course has some very fine points. The Christmas Program is very well done.\n\nOn the attached letter it is indicated that the cost is $2.00 each. Does that mean $8.00 for the four books, which would be very cheap as the paper and ink alone will cost more than that. On the other hand, the cost may be $2.00 a book, which will make it $8.00 a set.\n\nPersonally, I would be afraid to place these courses in our schools, as the teachers might be inclined to follow it too rigidly and discourage the children or decide that they are not suited and place them in a corner to accumulate dust.\n\nM.F.

These will be The Policeman, The Postman, The Milkman, and Fireman. They are to be followed by the Air Pilot, Engineer, Bus Driver and Sailor.\n\nI have dummy copies of the Postman and Policeman and I am sending these to you, under separate cover, and shall be most interested to get your reaction.\n\nWe have called the whole series CANADIANS ALL! The feature of the series is, of course, that it is Canadian and that it is the first time that photographs have been used in illustrating books of this kind.\n\nI think that books on the Trapper and on the Lumberman would be excellent additions to the series, and our Western Manager agrees that it would be a splendid thing to have an Indian character portray the role of the trapper. I believe you will agree with this.\n\nAs you kindly offered to give us some assistance in preparing this book I would welcome very much receiving the film that you mentioned which portrays the trapper. I presume that we can get stills of any of the pictures that we wish to use?\n\nI am hoping that you may be sufficiently interested in this series to put some of them into your schools. We shall very greatly appreciate your cooperation in helping us to make the trapper book.\n\nBy the way, the price of the Policeman and Postman has not been finally settled, but will probably be 50\u00a2 or 55\u00a2 subject to discount.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

Preston Limited,\n37 Murray St.,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Day\n\nTo payment of material supplied $330.22\n\nNote:\nDuring the past two years this Branch of the Dept. was in a state of confusion from March to the middle of October with the appointment of teachers for Indian day schools, and due to the fact that more and more teachers were applying for Indian schools, great care had to be exercised to pick out the most suitable candidates from a large number of applicants. It was decided that a system would have to be devised to cope with the work. A system that would be easy to handle yet efficient was required.\n\nThe Department requested the Civil Service Commission to send in an efficiency expert to study the problem and install a suitable set-up. Mr. T.J. Brook and Mr. V.J. Layton, Organization and Methods Division of the Civil Service Commission spent considerable time during April and May surveying the Division paying particular attention to the appointing of Indian day school teachers. After the survey was completed these experts decided on a system that would serve our purpose.\n\nTo put the new system into operation as effectively as possible it was necessary to have the exact type of material and additional staff, as it was essential to make the change over at once in order to have it completed before the peak load in June, July and August.\n\nMr. Brook had had dealings with John C. Preston previously and purchased the required materials from this firm. The Civil Service Commission appointed two additional clerks for a period of two months to carry out the change over. As the change over continued under Mr. Brook's and Mr. Layton's supervision it was found that additional materials were required which they purchased as they went along.\n\nIn view of the above, it would be appreciated if these two accounts (one for $176.01 and the other for $154.21) were put through for payment. The goods as received were to the satisfaction of the Civil Service Commission Officials. The prices are fair and just and payment of these accounts is recommended.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| No. 328\u00bd Manila Folders, plain           | 2,000    | $1.75      | $43.50      |\n| Ft. \"ALCO\" Index Tabs                     | 290      | $.25       | $72.50      |\n| Star Stamp                               | 1        | $.81       | $.81        |\n| Stamps - GAS and NON                      | 2        | $2.85      | $2.85       |\n| Sets No. 5/6/25 A-Z 5x8\" Guides           | 6        | $.90       | $5.40       |\n| Safeguard Out Guides                      | 25       | $.90       | $22.50      |\n| Acco Fasteners, #12                      | 1M       | $22.25     | $22.25      |\n\nTotal: $154.21\n\nWHEN REMITTING QUOTE ACCOUNT NO. 0-1561\nTERMS NET 30 DAYS.

However, as you were out of town at the time, I saw him and he mentioned to me about the manuscript on \"The Indians of Canada\". He stated that he had spoken to you two years ago and that you would review it for him.\n\nI have read the manuscript from cover to cover and find it quite interesting. I particularly liked the last section dealing with the Iroquois. For some reason or another the first two sections are most uninteresting to the reader but the third and last section is very well done. It is not the information that makes the reading dull, it is the style. There appears to be considerable difference in the style between the first two sections and the third.\n\nI think the manuscript requires more folk stories, yarns or anything to give spice to the thing.\n\nThe writer unfortunately follows the old pattern of writing a history book. He starts from the long time ago and comes in to Canadian History and stops there.\nI would think he should commence his book with Indians of today and work on arousing the reader's interest in Indians, their habits, religion, livelihood, what the Indian has contributed to the White man, what the White man has contributed to the Indian, where Indians live today, what they are doing, how the Indians have changed from the Indians of the past, where is the athletic and muscular Indian of the past, etc., anything to arouse interest.\n\nThe writer of the book is determined to write a history book and he proceeds to do just that, by means of simple assertive sentences. This does not provide the necessary interest to the reader.\n\nI think the book is quite well done and it appears to have covered considerable subject matter. However, more would be required. The style needs improvement. The Indians of today should be brought into the picture and their contributions should be appreciated.\n\nM.F.

It is possible that this paper might have been a few cents cheaper than the conventional paper; however, it is felt that the saving is very small and irrelevant for we supply only a packet or two to a school.\n\nThe poster paper and folding paper that is considered suitable should be equal to the product supplied by Hendry Division Central Scientific Company Limited.\n\nAs the purchase has been made and the paper supplied and placed in stock, the Department is prepared to accept it. However, no further orders should be placed for this product. We feel that the Department will be receiving a great number of complaints from the teachers, principals and school inspectors on the matter to say the least.\n\nIt would be appreciated and it would save you considerable difficulty if arrangements could be made whereby when quotations and tenders are secured for requirements for school use that the samples and quotations be forwarded to this office for a recommendation or this office be consulted before a tender is accepted.\nIn this way it is felt that embarrassments could be avoided and savings made at the same time.\n\nI would like to hear your views on the matter. You can appreciate the fact that school supplies are of a special category and require the attention of persons closely connected with the people using these supplies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. R. Query,\nDirector of Services,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nStationery Office,\nOttawa.\n\nMFT/HN\nJuly 24, 1950.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have just received your latest Fall and Winter 1950-51 catalogue and on glancing through it, I noticed Steel Utility Cabinets 94HL3614, 94HL3616 and 94H3617.\n\nWe are interested in one of these for use as storage cupboards for stationery in our Indian day schools. However, you list them in white only which is not quite suitable for the purpose intended.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could advise me whether you could arrange to sell us these cabinets in olive green or some other suitable colors for our schools. In the event that this can be arranged, please advise whether we would be required to make quantity purchases, or whether additional charges would be made for the repainting.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

It was decided that a system would have to be devised to cope with the work. A system that would be easy to handle yet efficient was required.\n\nThe Department requested the Civil Service Commission to send an efficiency expert to study the problem and install a suitable set-up. Mr. T.J. Brook and Mr. V.J. Layton, Organization and Methods Division of the Civil Service Commission spent considerable time during April and May surveying the Division paying particular attention to the appointing of Indian day school teachers. After the survey was completed these experts decided on a system that would serve our purpose.\n\nTo put the new system into operation as effectively as possible it was necessary to have the exact type of material and additional staff, as it was essential to make the change over at once in order to have it completed before the peak load in June, July and August.\n\nEXAMINED APPROVED\n\nI CERTIFY that there is an unencumbered balance available.\n\nFOR DEPUTY MINISTER FOR COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY\nOttawa, Ont.,\nJuly 25, 1960.\n\nCitizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs, Education Branch,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRegn. 29684 and 29704.\n\nSince no reply has been received to our letter of April 26th concerning Canadian Spellers requested on the above requisitions, it is presumed that these are no longer required and have, therefore, been cancelled.\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nJ.

She asked that we send a copy of our catalog, which was mailed on July 12, and we hope that it may have reached you by this time. If it has not been received, by all means let us know.\n\nWe have had the pleasure of working with the Education Department of the Office of Indian Affairs here at home over a period of many years, and Mr. W. W. Beatty who is in charge of the work, is well known to us. Probably you have come in contact with him in the discussion of various problems. As you may know, the Department of Education, Office of Indian Affairs, has developed a list of approved or recommended items for the Indian schools here in this country. If you do not have a copy of this list we would be glad to send you one giving the Denoyer-Geppert items that are approved and recommended for use in the Indian schools.\n\nWe do not know whether you have such a list of approved items for the Canadian Indian schools. If you do have such a list, we would like to offer our materials for approval. We sincerely believe that you would find they would give the same satisfactory service that they are regularly providing in the schools of many of your large cities from coast to coast.\n\nIn addition to our catalogs, we have been glad to distribute an envelope containing a number of leaflets on map and globe use, as a service to teachers. We are sending one of these envelopes to you. If you think it would be helpful, and you would like copies sent to key members of your staff in various parts of Canada, just let us know, and we will be glad to send them as required, without obligation or expense of any kind.\n\nAbove all, Mr. Doucet, we want you to feel that we are sincerely interested in working with you in your program, and will be glad to do everything that we can to help with it.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDENOYER-GEPPERT COMPANY\n\nBy\n\nWm.

I have been advised that a large quantity of this paper has recently been purchased.\n\nI am disappointed in the poor quality of this product, and feel that the folding paper in particular is nothing but coloured newsprint.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n200 Queen Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nWe are mailing you today a copy of CHEZ NOUS. This, as you shall see, is the French version of THIS IS OUR HOME, the basic pre-primer in the FAITH AND FREEDOM reading series. CHEZ NOUS has just come from the press and I hastened to get a copy for you since Mr. Robinson of this office requested that you receive it promptly. Robbie is presently in Ottawa and, no doubt, will be seeing you.\n\nYou will find that all the excellent features of THIS IS OUR HOME have been maintained in CHEZ NOUS, even vocabulary control. If anything, I think you will agree with us that the French version seems to be even more lively than its English counterpart.\n\nCHEZ NOUS has been approved by the Minister of Education for basal use in the Province of Ontario and the book is off to a good start in the bilingual schools here. We shall be glad to provide you with any additional information you may require regarding this French edition.\n\nIncidentally, the primer, THIS IS OUR FAMILY, will be coming from the press within a few weeks under the title NOTRE FAMILLE.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRML/sk\nSeptember 13, 1950.\n\nMr. M.G. Cameron,\nChief Cartographer,\nDept. of Mines & Technical Survey,\nLabelle Rd.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Cameron:\n\nPlease prepare ten photostatic copies of the attached and return.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter 1-1-4 (E6) of September 1st, we have much pleasure in quoting prices on all lines of Equipment.\n\nWe are sending you the complete line of Aluminum Alloy furniture pictures, as manufactured by the Educational Supply Association of London, England, this light, almost unbreakable equipment is going over extremely well with the School Boards of B.C., the Department in Victoria have seen it, and really think as we do, that it is the answer to all School furniture problems, it is light, durable, cast in one piece, all chairs and the Primary table have the added feature of stacking.\n\nThe Educational Supply Association as you are probably aware, have been manufacturing School furniture for 70 years, this line is the most commonly used in the Old Country now, and is also being extensively purchased in the U.S.A. which speaks for itself, no one in their wildest dreams ever expected America to buy British School furniture.\n\nWe have shown it to members of your Department here, but they were afraid of the price, however here is something to last a lifetime. We are in a raising market in hardwood which brings this equipment more and more in line.\n\nIf you can get away from the import duty on this equipment, and we are not sure of that, it would be very much cheaper, however the Government would be only taking it out of one pocket and placing it in another.\n\nAs far as wooden equipment is concerned we are in a position to supply everything, and would greatly appreciate being allowed to quote on your needs.\n\nEnclosed are price lists of most lines, Sales Tax is included, and we find by shipping pool car that Edmonton and Calgary have the same rate from here.\nD.

Kidd.\n\nI am sorry that I did not forward this manuscript to you in August as requested but a number of our officials had been reviewing it thus the delay.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOctober 3, 1950.\n\nMr. Bernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager,\nLongmans Green & Co.,\n215 Victoria St.,\nToronto, Ont.,\n\nDear Mr. McEvoy:\n\nI have your letter of September 28th in reference to the manuscript \"The Indians of Canada\" by K. Kidd.\n\nWe are forwarding this manuscript to Mr. Glass at Ashbury College this morning.\n\nOur officials have read the manuscript and their findings can be summed up thus: \"certainly anyone who read this manuscript would acquire a great deal of knowledge about the Indians of this country. However, I do not think it would hold the attention of the juvenile reader as there is far too much detail in it and little, if any, action\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. M.F. Track,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nMr. McEvoy has asked me to write to you and inquire whether the manuscript THE INDIANS OF CANADA by K. Kidd has as yet been forwarded to Mr. Glass at Ashbury College. The author is anxious to have this back in his possession and we have promised to give him definite word as soon as we have heard from you.\n\nWe shall greatly appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRuth Flynn,\nSecretary to Bernard McEvoy\n\nRF/rf\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCol. Neary\n\nI am very pleased to have had the opportunity of reading the manuscript written by Mr. Kidd, and it appears to me that it is, if anything, superior to the previous manuscript submitted. Certainly anyone who read this manuscript would acquire a great deal of knowledge about the Indians of this country.\n\nHowever, I do not think it would hold the attention of the juvenile reader as there is far too much detail in it and little, if any, action.\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY\n\nMr. Bernard McEvoy, Assistant Manager of Longmans, Green and Company, was in Ottawa and came to the office to see you. However, as you were out of town at the time, I saw him and he mentioned to me about the manuscript on \"The Indians of Canada\". He stated that he had spoken to you two years ago and that you would review it for him.\n\nI have read the manuscript from cover to cover and find it quite interesting. I particularly liked the last section dealing with the Iroquois. For some reason or another the first two sections are most uninteresting to the reader but the third and last section is very well done. It is not the information that makes the reading dull, it is the style. There appears to be considerable difference in the style between the first two sections and the third.\n\nI think the manuscript requires more folk stories, yarns or anything to give spice to the thing.\n\nThe writer unfortunately follows the old pattern of writing a history book. He starts from the long time ago and comes in to Canadian History and stops there.\nI would think he should commence his book with Indians of today and work on arousing the reader's interest in Indians, their habits, religion, livelihood, what the Indian has contributed to the White man, what the White man has contributed to the Indian, where Indians live today, what they are doing, how the Indians have changed from the Indians of the past, where is the athletic and muscular Indian of the past, etc., anything to arouse interest.\n\nThe writer of the book is determined to write a history book and he proceeds to do just that, by means of simple assertive sentences. This does not provide the necessary interest to the reader.\n\nI think the book is quite well done and it appears to have covered considerable subject matter. However, more would be required. The style needs improvement. The Indians of today should be brought into the picture and their contributions should be appreciated.\n\nM.F. Track.\nJuly 19, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. McEvoy:\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 6th, please be advised that I have Mr. Kidd's manuscript on \"The Indians of Canada\".\n\nI have read it over and am turning over my findings and the manuscript to Colonel Neary from whom you will be hearing.\n\nWhen Colonel Neary is through with the manuscript, I shall forward it to Mr. Glass as requested, and will advise you accordingly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.F. Track.\n\nMr. Bernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager,\nLongmans Green & Co.,\n215 Victoria St.,\nToronto, Ont.,\n\nNFT/HM\nMr. W. F. Track,\nEducation Office, Indian Affairs,\nCapitol Bldg., 220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nWhen I visited you some weeks ago you were good enough to suggest that you would be willing to look over Mr. Kidd's manuscript on THE INDIANS OF CANADA written at the intermediate school level.\n\nThis manuscript was sent to Mr. Glass of Ashbury College and he tells me that he has forwarded it to you. After you and Colonel Neary or Mr. Doucet have looked it over, would you be kind enough to return it to Mr. Glass. If he has a chance to see this sometime in August when he returns from his holidays he can, I think, be through with it and let me have it early in September before I go out on the road again.\n\nPlease be very frank in any suggestions or criticism that you have to make. We are anxious to have a good book and it is only by receiving helpful and constructive criticism that we can achieve this end. We are most grateful for your interest and encouragement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager.\nJune 29th, 1950.\n\nM. F. Track, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nEducational Branch,\nCapital Building,\n202 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nI am enclosing the manuscript of a book on Indians by Mr. Kenneth Kidd, sent to me by Mr. Bernard McEvoy. I have had the manuscript for sometime but have not been able to give it as much attention as I would like because of the general confusion at the end of term. Also, I am moving to a new school, Bishop's College School, Lennoxville, Que., this Friday, and this has led to further confusion. If it is at all possible, and I have written to Mr. McEvoy to this effect, I would like another and closer look at the manuscript some time in August. If Mr. McEvoy gives his approval I shall get in touch with you.\n\nYou will note that the chapter on the Algonquins is missing. It did not come to me when Mr. McEvoy sent the manuscript.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. L.

VERNON, N.Y.\nThe unsightly appearance of stained dinnerware, marred by discolorations from coffee, tea, lime, etc., particularly on plastics, has led to intensive scientific research for a truly effective and modern cleaning agent. Collaborating with the manufacturers and molders of MELMAC\u00ae dinnerware, the MAID-EAST CLEANSING PRODUCTS CORP. has developed and now presents the perfect PLASTIC CLEANER.\n\nFor Stain Removal\n\nM-E PLASTIC CLEANER**\n\nThis is an oxygenic compound designed to remove even the most stubborn coffee, tea or lime stains from plasticware, chinaware, glass, thermos bottles and servers. It leaves the plastic dishes perfectly clean and new-looking, and is most highly recommended by the leading molders of dinnerware. Many of the largest installations in the U.S.A., private as well as governmental, have approved M-E PLASTIC CLEANER and use this product regularly.\n\nIndependent chemical analyses have found by stringent tests that even prolonged immersion is not injurious to the plastic, but actually leaves it with a brighter finish. It contains absolutely no chlorine with its etching effect, and it sanitizes as it cleans. M-E PLASTIC CLEANER leaves no aftertaste and is harmless to the skin.\n\n**Reg. Trade Mark\n**Also privately labeled as K.I.K.\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR USE\n\nFill a stainless steel, wooden, earthenware or enamel container (or sink) with enough VERY HOT water to cover the stained dishes. Add 2 heaping tablespoonfuls (2 oz.) to each gallon of hot water. Place the stained ware in the solution and let it remain for a period of 5 minutes to a few hours, depending upon the degree of stain. Rinse well and return pieces to service.\n\nAlternate method: While still HOT and WET from regular washing, scrub stains with dry M-E PLASTIC CLEANER applied with a damp cloth.\n\nFor coffee urns or thermos bottles, servers, pots, etc., fill these vessels with a solution of VERY HOT water containing 1 teaspoonful of M-E PLASTIC CLEANER per quart of content.\n\nNOTE: Plasticware that has been previously damaged by chlorine or abrasive cleaners will require longer periods of soaking for stain removal due to the fact that the surface has been damaged and become porous. Such pieces naturally will be stained again more quickly than those always cleaned the M-E way. For best results use only M-E PLASTIC CLEANER.\n\nFor Dishwashing\n\nM-E SPARK\n\nFor machine dishwashing, the regular use of a specially prepared powder, M-E SPARK.\nwill minimize discoloration or staining of plastic tableware. In addition to containing cleansing properties for all china, silver, earthenware, glasses, etc., this product embodies an amount of M-E PLASTIC CLEANER sufficient to help keep the plasticware free from coffee stains, etc., if the dishes are not permitted to stand unwashed for too long a period.\n\nM-E SPARK imparts additional luster to the dishes and facilitates drying in less than average time. It sanitizes as it cleans.\n\nM-E SPARK is economical to use inasmuch as one ounce does the work of two or more ounces of ordinary cleansers or detergents.\n\n**M-E SHORT CUT**\n\nFor hand dishwashing, to secure the best results with plastic, china, silverware or glass, etc., use M-E SHORT CUT which has all the advantages of M-E SPARK. This product is particularly successful also in glass washing machines. Use only one tablespoonful of M-E SHORT CUT for each 5 gallons of water.\n\n*Other M-E Products include:*\n\n- **M-E COFFEE URN CLEANERS**\n- **ALL-PURPOSE CLEANERS**\n- **LAUNDRY DETERGENTS**\nOctober 7, 1950.\n\nMr. J.J.

I had a little note from him this morning in which he expresses some anxiety on this point but I have told him that you are probably having the book read and have not yet heard from your reader.\n\nI know that Mr. Woodley will be quite willing to accept any constructive criticism and we shall be quite ready to have any changes made that will bring the book up to your requirements.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J.

He has a style of writing which some people might have to make an effort to like. He should practice the handling of conjunctions, shorten a lot of sentences, and eliminate an assortment of hackneyed expressions.\n\nCare.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, June 14, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY\n\nThe Indian in Canada by E.C. Woodley\n\nI have just completed reading the above-noted manuscript and cannot be too sure as to the purpose it can be put to, if any, in our schools.\n\nThe material included is far from complete as there are enormous possibilities for covering more subjects such as culture, mode of living, religion, contributions to the White man, etc. Many of the subjects are covered but not as fully as required for school children, as not only facts are required, but these have to be elaborated to make the reading both interesting and educational.\n\nThe style is most unsuitable for school children. Mr. Woodley treats the subject matter as if he were writing a Chemistry book or Arithmetic book for he is stating facts after facts. To make a history book readable and valuable one must introduce short stories, incidents, comparisons, etc. A history book ought to be written like a novel rather than an assembly of facts.\n\nI am attaching a list of notes picked up from time to time while reading the manuscript.\n\nI think the book has possibilities as there has been a great deal of research made on the material, but it would have to be entirely rewritten to suit our pupils' requirements.\n\nM.F. Track.\n1. Lack of variety of types of seat work problems such as True, False, Matching, Filling blanks, completion sentences.\n\n2. Lack of variety of seat work (e.g.) Draw your version of a totem pole (2) buffalo (3) buffalo fence, sand table work, projects, cutting, constructing etc.\n\n3. \"The Coming of Jacques Cartier\" Page 22 begins too abruptly. It might be worthwhile to introduce the reader to the geographic locations in Eastern Canada where Cartier landed.\n\n4. Dates are very frequently used. These are meaningless to pupils, expressions such as \"350 years ago\" might be better.\n\n5. \"Order of Good Cheer\" Page 26 provides a good incident to give a short interesting story on what it meant to recreate an interest for the reader.\n\n6. Port Royal could be connected with the nearest present place name.\n\n7. \"Coureur-de-bois\" should be more elaborated on such as his work, his hardships, etc. A short interesting story would prove very valuable and interesting to the reader.\n\n8. A more vivid explanation of the hardships encountered by the missionaries may prove interesting reading. Such things as contrasts of living, homes, foods, habits. Just saying \"hardship\" has little meaning to the reader.\n\n9. \"Quebec\" should be connected with the present \"Quebec City\".\n\n10. Where are the \"Alleghany\" Mountains?\n\n11. A short story on Madeleine de Vercheres would prove interesting to a reader.\n\n12. Where is \"La Prairie\"? A larger present day city would have more meaning to the reader.\n\n13. Location of Caughnawaga should be given in miles from Montreal.\n\n14. Carrying the large bell to Caughnawaga would be a good place to say something on the mode of transportation used by the Indians of that time.\n\n15. Brantford, the large manufacturing centre could be given as the location of the Six Nations Indians in Canada.\n1.

Page 110\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOttawa, 23 August, 1950.\n\nCOL. NEARY\n\nI have read this manuscript with great interest. It would appear to me that the writer has done considerable research but has attempted the impossible, i.e. to cover the entire history of a race, including the biography of a group of outstanding men and women, in less than 35,000 words.\n\nIn order to do this he has obviously condensed his material and denuded it of the colour and fire necessary in a \"juvenile\".\n\nJust how much this is responsible for the style, i.e. long, confusing sentences, I would hesitate to say. In any event the result is deadly.\n\nShould the author attempt to rewrite, with a view to meeting requirements of the age group it is designed for, here are a few minor observations.\n\nThe use of the word \"ward\" is noted. Legally the Indian is not a ward of the Crown. Similarly we do not use \"reservation\" but, in Canada, it is \"reserve\".\n\nPage 17. \"General Baden-Powell\" should be \"Lord Baden-Powell\". Also the Boy Scout material is not accurate.\n\nPage 19. The section on hunting and fishing is a good spot to work in something on conservation.\n\nPage 54. The chapter on Paul Kane adds little to the book.\n\nPage 82. Joseph Brant.\n\"The war in America dragged on until 1782, and Joseph Brant and the Mohawks took their part in it to the very end, but when the Treaty of Paris was signed the Indians were not mentioned. It was strange that this should have happened, especially as the English statesmen knew how valuable their aid had been.\"\n\nI cannot see what purpose is served by bringing this up here.\n\nI also note that Crowfoot, the outstanding Indian leader of the West, only gets passing mention. (In the R.C.M.P. chapter) Surely he should be included among the \"Stories of Great Indians\".\n\nPage 86. \"they (the Indians) found the English more harsh in their attitude\" in comparison with the French. This is by way of explaining away Pontiac's treachery. I cannot see any useful purpose being served by a comparison of the two white races.\n\nPage 94. \"Tecumseh - Man of Vision\".\n\"In the history of the Western world Pontiac and Tecumseh will always be linked together.

Officer.\nMr. G. J. Bustess,\nJ. M. Dent & Sons,\n224, Bloor Street West,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Bustess:\n\nAs I mentioned to you in our recent conversation concerning Mr. Woodley's book, we have had it examined by several of our officials. Extracts from their reports are presented below:\n\nReader No. 1:\n\nMr. Woodley might experiment with a shorter work, possibly re-vamping parts of this and effecting something less telegraphic.\n\nThat would, perhaps, help him to write in a crisper and more vivid way. He has a style of writing which some people might have to make an effort to like. He should practise the handling of conjunctions, shorten a lot of sentences, and eliminate an assortment of hackneyed expressions.\n\nReader No. 2:\n\nThe material included is far from complete as there are enormous possibilities for covering more subjects such as culture, mode of living, religious instructions to the White man, etc. Many of the subjects are covered but not as fully as required for school children, as not only facts are required, but these have to be elaborated to make the reading both interesting and educational.\n\nThe style is most unsuitable for school children. Mr. Woodley treats the subject matter as if he were writing a Chemistry book or Arithmetic book for he is stating facts after facts. To\nmake a history book readable and valuable one must introduce short stories, incidents, comparisons, etc. A history book ought to be written like a novel rather than an assembly of facts.\n\nI am attaching a list of notes picked up from time to time while reading the manuscript:\n\n1. Lack of variety of types of seat work problems such as True, False, Matching, Filling blanks, Completion sentences.\n\n2. Lack of variety of seat work (e.g.) Draw your version of a totem pole (2) buffalos (3) buffalo fence, sand table work, projects, cutting, constructing, etc.\n\n3. \"The Coming of Jacques Cartier\" Page 22 begins too abruptly. It might be worth while to introduce the reader to the geographic locations in Eastern Canada where Cartier landed.\n\n4. Dates are very frequently used. These are meaningless to pupils, expressions such as \"350 years ago\" might be better.\n\n5. \"Order of Good Cheer\" Page 26 provides a good incident to give a short interesting story on what it meant to recreate an interest for the reader.\n\n6. Port Royal could be connected with the nearest present place name.\n\n7. \"Coureur-de-bois\" should be more elaborated on such as his work, his hardships, etc. A short interesting story would prove very valuable and interesting to the reader.\n\n8. A more vivid explanation of the hardships encountered by the missionaries may prove interesting reading. Such things as contrasts of living, homes, foods, habits. Just saying \"hardship\" has little meaning to the reader.\n\n9. \"Quebec\" should be connected with the present \"Quebec City\".\n\n10. Where are the \"Alleghany Mountains\"?\n\n11. A short story on Madeleine de Vercheres would prove interesting to a reader.\n12. Where is \"La Prairie\"? A larger present day city would have more meaning to the reader.\n\n13. Location of Caughnawaga should be given in miles from Montreal.\n\n14. Carrying the large bell to Caughnawaga would be a good place to say something on the mode of transportation used by the Indians of that time.\n\n15. Brantford, the large manufacturing centre could be given as the location of the Six Nations Indians in Canada.\n\n16. Being given a \"Baronet\" and becoming \"Sir William Johnson\" P. 43 is meaningless to a reader of elementary school level. More explanation may be necessary.\n\n17. More explanation of the term \"Seven Years War\" may be called for.\n\n18. \"Delivering my pipe\" would warrant more explanation such as what was it? What was meant? etc.\n\n19. Where is Louisburg? Page 46. More explanation would seem necessary.\n\n20. What is a navigator? Page 46. \"Making Soundings\" \"Preparing a Chart\", \"transit of Venus\" \"Astronomy\".\n\n21. What is a rattle? Page 47. What use might the Indian have for it? What was it like?\n\n22. Did the Indians sing songs as we do? Page 47. Was there any reason for their songs?\n\n23. Where did the Indians get the red paint? Page 48.\n\n24. How did the Indians skin the caribou and make the clothing? What did they use for thread, needles, buttons?\n\n25. Did Indians wear shoes, hats, socks? Page 48.\n26. More on religion would be useful. A story or two would be useful and interesting to the reader.\n\n27. The medicine man should get more special treatment.\n\n28. Hudson's Bay Company, particularly its establishment and its connection with the Indians, how it operated would be useful and interesting to the reader. Page 55.\n\n29. What were palisades? Page 50. A good opportunity to describe the early forts, their construction, their use, the powder house, etc.\n\n30. Marriage is brought in from time to time, what a good opportunity to give a short story on marriages, the ceremonies, etc., as applied to Indians.\n\n31. Where is Fort Nelson? Would a present location not be clearer?\n\n32. Inland and westward from Fort Churchill, Page 51 would not lead to Assiniboine River or the Prairie Provinces except in the northern section.\n\n33. More incidents from Kalsey's Journal would be interesting. Such extracts as locations, Indian mode of living, villages, food, etc.\n\n34. \"Advanced him (Kalsey) in their service\". Page 52 should be further explained.\n\n35. Was all of Canada declared a Dominion in 1867? This should be explained. Page 58.\n\n36. What was Rupert's Land? Page 58.\n\n37. How did liquor have bad effects on the Indians? Page 58. Why was it sold to the Indians? Page 58. These questions should be given more space.\n38. Why did the police wear red uniforms? Page 58. A short story on their hardships, both physically and mentally. How they reached their destination, where their headquarters were, who their chief was, their equipment. All this would be useful information to the reader. What were some of the common offenses of law that were encountered.\n\n39. What are treaties with Indians? Page 59. What did the Indian receive for signing the Treaty. What did he promise the Queen in return. A story on treaty celebration interweaving pertinent facts would be very interesting to a reader.\n\n40. More information on reservations, grants would be useful. Page 60.\n\n41. Need for education should be given more space. Page 61.\n\n42. What was the Canadian Pacific Railway. Page 64.\n\n43. Who are the Metis? Page 65.\n\n44. Where is Lower Canada? Page 66.\n\n45. A description of an Indian feast and ceremony thereto would be interesting.\n\n46. What are wampum belts?

Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 12th, 1950\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI was very pleased to see you again last week. This letter is just to tell you that I saw Mr. Eric Acland about the revision of Mr. Woodley's manuscript.\n\nHe was interested in this project, but he has in mind the completion of a boys' book for the Winston Company, publishers. This work will probably occupy him this winter but he expects to be free to tackle our job early next year.\n\nWhen in Montreal I spoke to Mr. Woodley about this matter and he is agreeable to our using his material as a basis for the book that Mr. Acland will write.\n\nWe are attempting something rather difficult and personally I am very hopeful that we can keep Mr. Acland's interest in undertaking this work. There is the additional advantage that he lives in Ottawa and can keep in close touch with you.\n\nIt may take us a little time to get this manuscript in proper shape but I think the effort will be worth-while. I think it will be possible for us to publish this manuscript, once it has been found satisfactory by your department, in time for school opening next year. In the meanwhile, would you be good enough to have typed out copies of the two reports submitted by your readers (one of them was Mr. Acland, I believe) so that I can make a submission of them to Mr. Woodley who naturally has a right to know what we are going to do with this material. I may say that he is quite agreeable to us rewriting it and realizes that his style is not suitable for the purpose we have in mind, but he points out, of course, that he did a considerable amount of research on the material and therefore has a proprietary interest in what is to be done with it.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.

B.F. Neary\n\nReplying to your letter of Oct. 4th, 1950, file 1-1-4(E6), re catalogues for schools. We enclose copy of our letter of Feb. 24th, describing the books required together with the requisition form, which we would ask you to kindly complete for us.\n\nD.R. Cassie,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\nDeseronto, Ont.\nFebruary 24th, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttn: Educational Division\n\nRe: Cataloguing Equipment and Supplies\n\nAt a recent meeting of the teachers and agent of the Tyendinaga Reserve, the above subject was discussed. We feel that it is desirable that all equipment and supplies on hand in the schools should be catalogued, and that the equipment at least should be checked at regular intervals. This would protect the teacher, enable us to transfer equipment from one school to another without the teacher carrying any of the responsibilities, enable us to list requirements with the minimum of work, and finally in the event of a change of teachers, both the new and the old teacher would be protected.\n\nThe Ontario Department of Education has a standard type of catalogue, but this does not meet with my approval because we want a type of catalogue that could be used for checking purposes over a number of years. With the Ontario Catalogue it is necessary to erase the check marks each year, or as is usually done, write out a list of the equipment each year and check from this written list. If your Department has no standard catalogue in supply, I would be in favor of using No.200 Government of Canada Register, with a supply of Index Tabs. We would require at least 3 of these books to start with.\n\nWe also discussed the cataloguing of Library Books. Some of our Schools are building up a nice library and consequently it is proving quite a chore to find any particular book. We are therefore interested in systems of cataloguing libraries. If the Department has no standard system in their schools, we would like to catalogue books according to the subjects on our curriculum. This system has many disadvantages, but I feel its simplicity outweighs them all. We would require for our book shelves some type of metal card holder. I would suggest that 3 dozen of these would be sufficient at the present time.\n\nD.R.CASSE, Supt. Tyendinaga Agency.\nOctober 16, 1950.\n\nMr. D.R. Cassie,\nSupt.

Neary, Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThank you for your enquiry of October 3rd, re Maplex cups.\n\nOn checking our records, we find that your schools, across the country, have purchased either directly or through Ottawa, not only cups, but various other Maplex items. We find also that in various cases they have ordered tumblers, mugs, or Cups, as well as plates, assorted sizes.\n\nEnclosed is our price list, which you will note we have endeavoured to keep the same, in spite of the rising cost of labour. We hope to try and keep it this way as long as we possibly can.\n\nWe also take the liberty of enclosing a list of items which we have on hand, and which we would offer to you at half the list price. These items are all first quality, the reason for our wish to offer them being that the colours are slightly different in shade than that which we now run, but at the same time, they are the shade that your schools have been getting, and so will be in keeping with the tableware which they already have. These prices of course, apply only to the list of tableware enclosed.\n\nTrusting that you may see your way clear to using these, and thanking you in advance, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMAPLE LEAF PLASTICS LIMITED.\n\nB.

Bonnah,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nIn response to the report submitted on the visit to the three schools in your agency we are arranging to forward the following supplies to these schools:\n\nFor all classrooms:\n- 4 flags (one for each classroom)\n- 4 Pictures of the King and Queen complete with frames. Authority for purchase of necessary glass for each picture.\n- Bookcase - Cornwall West, Cornwall East\n- Cupboard - Cornwall East\n- Radios - Cornwall East, West, St. Regis Village\n- Phonographs - Cornwall West, St. Regis Village\n- 1 Ditto Duplicator - for use by all teachers in Agency but machine to be located at St. Regis Village school.\n- 6 25 lb. tins Toilet compound\n\nWe are purchasing this compound for experimental purposes and your views on its adaptability for our schools would be appreciated.\n\nAs no provisions have been made for flying the flag outside, the flag should be displayed on the classroom wall at all times along with the Picture of the King and Queen. The installation of a flag pole at each should be accelerated, and a flag will be provided for that purpose when requested.\nThe Department is exposing itself to severe criticism by not flying the flag when school is in session.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that there appeared to be no provision for drinking water at the schools. If these facilities are limited, please be advised that the Department is prepared to supply the necessary water coolers and plastic cups, if you feel these are necessary.\n\nIt was noted that the boys' toilets leave much to be desired. It is suggested that a trough to be used as urinal should be installed in each boys' toilet. This trough should be made of two pieces of lumber and lined with aluminum sheet metal, with the sheet metal extending about a foot above the trough. The trough should be fastened to one wall at a suitable height.\n\nYou are authorized to make local purchase of the necessary sheet aluminum. The Manual Training boys should be able to do the work.\n\nThe Department cannot see its way clear at present to provide you with a 16 mm. projector as our funds for that purpose are limited.\n\nI have been informed that the children are well behaved and the classrooms clean and tidy.\n\nThe problem of the Cornwall Island school will be a subject of further correspondence.\n\nYou will notice that we are arranging for the purchase of supplies only for the three schools visited. We do not know the requirements of the other two schools; therefore, it would be appreciated if you would submit a requisition for these two schools based on the supplies we are sending for the other three schools.\n\nBernard F.

Bernard Henry,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my periodic inspections of the Indian Schools in Bruce County I have noted that there is very little reference material such as the World Book or the Book of Knowledge. I recently came across an encyclopedia which should be most helpful in any elementary school. I refer to Compton's Pictured Encyclopedia. Has the Indian Affairs Branch ever seriously considered placing this in the Indian Schools? Having this in the hands of the pupils would be a most progressive step. Personally I think so highly of this book that I am purchasing two complete sets as gifts to my grandchildren.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.M.

Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Training,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Doucet:\n\nThank you for your letter of October 13 regarding Notre Famille and Chez Nous. Our records show that a copy of Chez Nous was mailed to Colonel Henry on September 12 and a copy of Notre Famille on September 22. You say you have received only one of these. Perhaps you have received the other book by now, but, on the other hand, it may have gone astray in the mails, so I am sending you another copy today and hope it reaches you safely.\n\nI certainly hope you find it possible to make some use of these two books in the Province of Quebec, and perhaps in another locality in which you have French-speaking pupils. There are such beautiful books that they speak for themselves and I do not think it is necessary for me to say more about them, except perhaps to tell you that a teachers' manual is in preparation.\n\nI think Mr. Litch spoke to you about our health text in the French language, Sant\u00e9 et S\u00e9curit\u00e9 - Sugg\u00e8s. This is more or less a translation of our Health, Safety and Citizenship with which I think you are familiar. This book is presently being set in type and has been authorized in New Brunswick. We expect it to be ready sometime in the early spring, and we shall, of course, see that you get copies of it.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNORMAN G. S.

Ottawa.\n\nI presume the next step is to place a requisition covering the number of cabinets required at Encl. 1 the present time.\n\nH. E. Beaume,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nI attach correspondence in connection with the efforts of Col. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, to secure suitable storage cupboards to hold stocks of school supplies in various schools throughout Canada.\n\nIt is noted that the immediate requirements of the Branch will entail some eighteen cabinets, and that requisitions will be placed for additional units as the occasion arises. The Canadian Public Booth Company Ltd., Arnprior, Ont., have submitted the best price on the cabinets\u2014almost suitable to meet the requirements of the schools. They have agreed to deliver by truck to our Warehouse in Ottawa cabinets individually crated and ready for trans-shipment at a cost of $58.00 each.\n\nA considerable saving can be effected, as it costs from $95.00 to $110.00, depending on the locality of the school, to have a carpenter build an equivalent cabinet.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I should like to secure tentative approval for the purchase of the eighteen cabinets now required, at a cost of $1044.00, and also authority to place orders with the firm on the same cost basis when requisitions are received from time to time from the Indian Education Division.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n(41) Lionel Follet\nDeputy Minister.\n\nAPPROVED:\n(41) W.

LTD.\n\nManaging Director.\nOctober 10, 1950\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nTeachers, Indian Superintendents and School Inspectors have been constantly demanding additional storage space in many of our Indian day schools across the country.\n\nSome of the Indian Superintendents had arranged to purchase material and hire Indian labour to construct shelves with suitable doors and locks. This process has been rather expensive. The Department has, therefore, undertaken to secure a suitable cupboard that would be large and strong enough to hold all the stock and school supplies under lock and key as required and yet make an economical buy.\n\nAfter canvassing a great number of manufacturers it was decided that the best buy was from Canadian Public Booth Company Limited, Arnprior, Ontario. We attach the quotations received. This company has quoted a price of $58.00 f.o.b. Arnprior, Ontario.\n\nThese cabinets are 75 inches high, 35 inches wide and 20 inches deep and are made of birch with panel ends and doors with five adjustable shelves and equipped with elbow catch and cupboard locks. This company will do the crating and shipping without cost to the Department.\nIt is recommended, therefore, that the storage cabinets manufactured by Canadian Public Booth Company Limited be supplied to our schools when requested by requisition.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nLast May when we had the pleasure of discussing with you the work of the Audubon Society, and the placing of Canadian Nature in your schools, you advised us subscription orders would probably reach us about October last. As we have not yet heard from you in reply to our letter of the 25th September on this subject, we are afraid it may not have reached you, and therefore enclose a copy.\n\nIn our interview you mentioned your excellent method of building up school libraries by purchasing annually a book for each pupil in a school. In view of the fact that none of the Indian schools received Canadian Nature for 1948, 1949 and 1950, we are now writing to bring to your attention the Bound Volumes for these years.\n\nThese are interesting and informative volumes, and we know from experience that your schools will be grateful to you for making this material available to them. Each volume contains approximately 64 articles, 88 full colour illustrations, 161 photographs and 141 line drawings, all fully indexed. Single copies are $2.50 each, but for your schools we now offer you sets of the three volumes for only $5.00 a set - a saving of one-third. We would suggest that sets of these be obtained for at least the boarding schools and larger day schools. In order that you may be able to see them for yourself, and show them to your inspectors, we are sending you a set under separate cover.\n\nNone of the material in these books will be reprinted, and when the present stock is sold no further bound volumes for these years will be available. As less than a thousand volumes of each are still in stock, and the demand is heavy, we would suggest you advise your estimated requirements - say up to 250 sets - and we will reserve them for you, and you may order them shipped to your schools over the next few months as desired.\n\nWe trust we may have the pleasure of serving you and your schools in their study of the important subjects of nature and conservation.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(A. R. Whitemore)\nEditor\nSeptember 25th, 1950.\n\nColonel Bernard F. Neery,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCapital Theatre Building,\nQueen & Bank Streets,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neery,\n\nIn our discussion last May regarding the work of the Audubon Society, and the placing of Canadian Nature in your schools, we understood we should hear from you this September as to the number of subscriptions desired, after you had taken the matter up with your inspectors.\n\nWe are enclosing some material for your information, which your inspectors will no doubt find interesting, and hope we shall have the pleasure of hearing from you shortly. With the opening of the school year, a carefully planned long-range programme for teaching nature and conservation is continued in Canadian Nature, which is of considerable value and interest to teachers and students.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(A.

We trust that the samples and the above mentioned information and quotation will meet with your entire satisfaction and that we may anticipate the pleasure of further serving you in the near future.\n\nPlease accept our sincere apologies for the delay in answering your inquiry.

If there are special circumstances, I would like to hear about them.\n\nIn future, I am not prepared to sign a requisition for an accountable advance for a trip unless previous accountable advances have been settled with Treasury. The only exception will be where an official is in town only two or three days and is being required by special circumstances to make another trip.\n\nBernard F.

I would have selections of this sort made by experts who excel in voice and manner. Some of our teachers are sadly in need of models to imitate in the auditory field.\n\nIt would be possible to carry into the classroom ideally phrased messages from various officials of the Branch who cannot conveniently visit remote schools.\n\nI should like to bring back from surveys and visitations on which stenographic aid is impracticable, the spoken opinions of persons interviewed and a better record of the proceedings than memory or brief notes can provide.\nConferences and interviews could proceed without the halts required for note taking.\n\nThe machine would serve to economize time in place of personal dictation to stenographers at Headquarters, and production of reports, memoranda and correspondence would proceed unimpeded by the lack of staff.\n\nG.A.F.

If you have the means of analysing Rowney's Georgian White in comparison with other makes in the same price range you will be able to verify our claims that our Flake White and Titanium White are pure pigment only.\n\nWe are now in receipt of an order from the King's Printer and we shall ship this immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

If you have not there is still time to subscribe for a copy of the limited memorial edition.\n\nThe memorial edition was made possible through special contributions. The entire proceeds from its sale go into the Howard Braucher Memorial Fund. The limited edition of one thousand copies came off the press last August and the response has been gratifying.\n\nIt is our hope that every recreation department will place one or more copies of this book on its library shelves for ready use. Howard Braucher's editorials and writings through the years have furnished invaluable reference and speech material. As these writings are brought together under the title of TREASURY OF LIVING, carefully selected, classified and indexed they have more value than ever before.\n\nThis is an invitation to order your copies now before the memorial edition is exhausted. Your recreation library will be enriched and you will help build the Howard Braucher Memorial Fund.\n\nA copy of the table of contents and an order blank are enclosed for your convenience.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nExecutive Director\nA TREASURY OF LIVING\nPrice $10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nForeword\u2014by Raymond B.

Trask\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe thank you for your letter of November 16th with reference to books required for your Library list for your Indian schools for 1951-52, and note that you particularly require titles suitable for Grades, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nKeeping this in mind we have made up a list of 24 titles as per the attached, and samples are going forward today for your examination. There are 16 Garden City titles and 8 Doubleday titles included, suitable for the age group you mention, and within a reasonable price range. We have only included two samples of our new Modern series which list at $1.25, as these are the only two titles suitable for the 6 to 9 age group. However, we enclose a list of this complete series and would ask your consideration of these titles when making selections for older children.\n\nWe are also sending you our new Junior Books catalog (prices shown are U.S. list, so there is a slight mark-up for Canada) and our Garden City titles with Canadian prices. If there are any other books on these lists which you would like to see, please let us know and we will be glad to send samples.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDOUBLEDAY PUBLISHERS\n\nH. L.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNovember 30, 1950.\n\nCIRCULAR LETTER - ALL TEACHERS:\n\nA number of inquiries have been received in this office as to what period should be observed for Christmas holidays by our Indian Day Schools. To avoid confusion and to secure uniformity, Indian Day Schools in British Columbia will conform with the dates set by the Provincial Department of Education, which are as follows:\n\nDecember 19th, 1950 - Schools close for Christmas Vacation.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1951 - Schools re-open.\n\nRecent visits of inspection have indicated that The Pupils' Own Vocabulary Spellers are not being used in accordance with the instructions which are to be found at the beginning of each of the three books and headed \"How to Use Your Book\". Teachers should follow these directions. The pupils should use a separate exercise book for this subject.\n\nSome of our Catholic Schools are using the Faith and Freedom series as the basic readers for Grades 1 and 2. In future all schools, Catholic and Protestant, will use The Curriculum Foundation Series in Grades 1 to 3 and the Canadian Parade Readers in Grades 4 to 6, inclusive. Any Catholic school not using this Series should requisition for them now and place the word \"Urgent\" at the head of the requisition. The Faith and Freedom Series will be used as supplementary readers when the new series is received.\n\nTeachers should keep on file in the school copies of requisitions which they forward to the Department.\n\nGuide Books for the use of the teacher accompany both the Curriculum Foundation and Canadian Parade Readers series and teachers are required to use them in preparing their lessons.\n\nI have been pleased to note that almost all teachers are now using Plan Books. Unfortunately, some teachers have been recording in these books the days work after it has been completed. It is expected that teachers will show in these books their plans for the succeeding day instead of using them as a record of work accomplished.\n\nThe Department has decided that in schools where religious instruction is given, the school day will be lengthened by the amount of time devoted to religious instruction, unless local conditions prevent this. Should your school be unable to lengthen the school day by the equivalent time, the Superintendent of your Indian Agency should be informed so that the possibility of overcoming local difficulties may be thoroughly explored.\n\nR. F. DAVEY,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools\nfor B.C.\nDecember 9, 1950.\n\nCitizenship & Immigration\n\nMAKE CHEQUE PAYABLE TO:\nGeorge J. Mclean Ltd.,\n117 Peter St.,\nToronto 2B, Ont.,\n\nTo payment of books supplied for reviewing purposes $ 2.24\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn reply to yours of September 6, 1950, we enclose herewith a copy of the invoice in question.\n\nTrusting this is the information required, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGEORGE J. McLEOD, Limited.\n\nE. Rosser\n(Credit Manager).\n\nER:ejo\nEnc.\nNovember 27th, 1950.\n\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Track,-\n\nWe are now pleased to hand you a sample of Poster Color Brush, similar to the one you left with the writer when he was in your office.\n\nThis Brush is made in Canada and we believe will be very suitable for your work. It is not very expensive as on same we would be able to quote the Department a price of $1.00 per dozen, sales tax included. Quite prompt shipment could be made.\n\nTrusting this may be what you are looking for, and the price a saving over what you are now paying, we remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL. A.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have just received a protest regarding paragraph 3 of Regional Inspector Davey's circular letter of November 20th, 1950, which read as follows:\n\n\"Some of our Catholic Schools are using the Faith and Freedom series as the basic readers for Grades 1 and 2. In future all schools, Catholic and Protestant, will use The Curriculum Foundation Series in Grades 1 to 3 and the Canadian Parade Readers in Grades 4 to 6, inclusive. Any Catholic school not using this Series should requisition for them now and place the word \"Urgent\" at the end of the requisition. The Faith and Freedom Series will be used as supplementary readers when the new series is received.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, I would refer you to page 3 of the November 1950 Bulletin and under the heading \"Standard Text Books\" the following appears:\n\n\"In certain Catholic Schools, the Faith and Freedom series is used. Other Catholic Schools prefer to use the same readers as used in the Provincial Schools. The Department will again provide one or the other of the readers but not both unless specifically authorized by the Provincial School Inspectors concerned.\"\nIn the supplementary to the Indian School Bulletin dated November 1st, 1949, the following appeared with reference to \"Standard Text Books\":\n\n\"Catholic Readers\n\nIn certain Catholic schools the Faith and Freedom series is used. Other Catholic schools prefer to use the same readers as used in the provincial schools. It must be emphasized that the department will provide one or the other of the sets, but not both, unless specifically authorized by the Provincial School Inspector concerned.\"\n\nThe direction given in Mr. Davey's circular is different from what appears in either of the Bulletins mentioned above.\n\nPlease let us know at the earliest possible date why Mr. Davey did not place in his circular the same information as contained in the Bulletins.\n\nPP/ST\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Education Service.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a circular letter to all teachers written by R.F. Davey, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C. It has been forwarded to me by Father Campbell, missionary of Sechelt, B.C.\n\nWould you be so kind as to let me know whether this circular reflects the policy of the Federal Department of Indian Affairs or the personal feelings of the Inspector.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFather P.A. Renaud, O.M.I.\nAssistant.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nNovember 30, 1950.\n\nCIRCULAR LETTER - ALL TEACHERS:\n\nA number of inquiries have been received in this office as to what period should be observed for Christmas holidays by our Indian Day Schools. To avoid confusion and to secure uniformity, Indian Day Schools in British Columbia will conform with the dates set by the Provincial Department of Education, which are as follows:\n\nDecember 19th, 1950 - Schools close for Christmas Vacation.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1951 - Schools re-open.\n\nRecent visits of inspection have indicated that The Pupils' Own Vocabulary Spellers are not being used in accordance with the instructions which are to be found at the beginning of each of the three books and headed \"How to Use Your Book\". Teachers should follow these directions. The pupils should use a separate exercise book for this subject.\n\nSome of our Catholic Schools are using the Faith and Freedom series as the basic readers for Grades 1 and 2. In future all schools, Catholic and Protestant, will use The Curriculum Foundation Series in Grades 1 to 3 and the Canadian Parade Readers in Grades 4 to 6, inclusive. Any Catholic school not using this Series should requisition for them now and place the word \"Urgent\" at the head of the requisition. The Faith and Freedom Series will be used as supplementary readers when the new series is received.\n\nTeachers should keep on file in the school copies of requisitions which they forward to the Department.\n\nGuide Books for the use of the teacher accompany both the Curriculum Foundation and Canadian Parade Readers series and teachers are required to use them in preparing their lessons.\n\nI have been pleased to note that almost all teachers are now using Plan Books. Unfortunately, some teachers have been recording in these books the days work after it has been completed. It is expected that teachers will show in these books their plans for the succeeding day instead of using them as a record of work accomplished.\n\nThe Department has decided that in schools where religious instruction is given, the school day will be lengthened by the amount of time devoted to religious instruction, unless local conditions prevent this. Should your school be unable to lengthen the school day by the equivalent time, the Superintendent of your Indian Agency should be informed so that the possibility of overcoming local difficulties may be thoroughly explored.\n\nR. F. DAVEY,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools\nfor B.C.\nSUPPLEMENT\nto\nINDIAN SCHOOL BULLETIN\nNovember, 1950.\n\nANNUAL SCHOOL SUPPLY REQUISITIONS\n\nAs the Department operates the most widely scattered school system in Canada, supplying the needs of our schools must be a systematic procedure and each teacher and principal is urged to shoulder his or her responsibility.\n\nIn order that the Stationery Branch can handle the flood of requisitions, it is necessary to have them spaced over the twelve month year as follows:\n\n1. Requisitions to reach the Department by December 31, 1950, or as soon thereafter as possible.\n   (a) from all residential schools\n   (b) from day schools in the Yukon, Northwest Territories and in the Northern parts of the province where mail and freighting facilities are limited (e.g., Norway House Agency).\n\n2. Requisitions to reach the Department by March 31, 1951.\n   (a) from all day schools in British Columbia and Alberta.\n   (b) for all library and supplementary books (special order form will appear in the next issue of the Bulletin).\n\n3. Requisitions to reach the Department by May 31, 1951.\n   (a) from all other day schools than those mentioned in 1 (b) and 2 (a) above.\n\nOrder Forms To Be Used\n\nThe Department has again decided to publish this order booklet as a supplement to the Indian School Bulletin. Attached hereto you will find the following requisition forms:\n\n(a) Standard School Supplies - Stationery\n(b) Standard text books\n(c) Form for ordering text books required by Provincial Course of Study.\n\nThe purpose of this pad is to make easier the ordering of the main list of supplies and books for the next term. The extra pages are for supplementary requirements as necessary from time to time. For all other requirements use the \"Requisition for School Material Form I.A. A13\". If ordering a few books or supplies listed on the attached forms or Form I.A. A13, please quote the stock number at all times, as this will avoid delay.\nStandard School Supplies - Stationery\n\nPlease adhere closely to this scale of issue in requisitioning supplies, otherwise, your requisition will be reduced accordingly. If you feel that your request warrants special consideration, please express your views by letter directed to the local Indian Superintendent and forward it to him attached to the requisition.\n\nScale of Issue:\n\n(a) Pencil Sharpener - one per classroom\n\n(b) Foolscap - 50 sheets per pupil in Grade 5 and upwards\n\n(c) Loose Leaf Notebooks # 1973 - one per pupil in Grade 7\n    two per pupil in Grade 8\n\n(d) Loose Leaf Notebooks # 2933 - two per pupil in Grade 9\n    and upwards\n\n(Note: Ruled refills are available for above)\n\n(e) Crayons - Wax crayons are provided for Grades 1 to 3\n    Crayolas are available for Grade 4 and upwards.\n\n(f) Modelling clay is available at the rate of a quarter or a pound to each pupil in Grade 1.\n\n(for modelling by older pupils use paper-mache,\nor plaster-of-Paris or flour, salt and water.)\n\n(g) Dry Tempera: We provide a set of assorted colors for classroom use. Special Tempera brushes are provided for schools where teachers are doing Tempera work in Primary grades.\n\n(h) Water colour boxes are provided for Grade 4 and upwards. Boxes should be used over and over again and refills ordered rather than discarding boxes when colours have been used up.\n\n(i) Oil paints and pastels are provided for Grade 7 and upwards, provided that these are required by the Provincial Course of Study or the teacher has had training or experience in this line of work.\n\n(j) White water colour drawing paper is provided for Grade 6 and upwards only. Lower grades will use Blank Drawing Books and Kraft Wrapping Paper for larger work, friezes, etc.\n\n(k) Poster Paper is provided for Grade 6 and upwards only.\n\n(l) Multiscript Paper: 1000 sheets per classroom only unless a magazine is being printed. (This paper is provided for stencil type duplicators only)\n\n(m) Typewriter Paper: 1000 sheets per classroom only unless a magazine is being printed. (This paper is provided for gelatin type of duplicator or repeater pad duplicator or gelatin tray).\n\n(n) Six scratch pads of each type are provided per classroom.\n(c) Speedball Pen Nibs: we provide these only in boxes of 6 assorted widths in the round style. These are excellent for making posters, reading charts, flash cards, etc. Scale is 1 box per classroom.\n\nStandard Text Books\n\nThe Provincial Department of Education are narrowing their selections to one or two sets of readers. The Standard reader in use in practically all provinces for Grades 1 to 3 is \"The Basic Readers of the Curriculum Foundation Series.\"\n\nIn certain Catholic schools, the Faith and Freedom series is used. Other Catholic schools prefer to use the same readers as used in the Provincial schools. The Department will again provide one or the other of the readers but not both unless specifically authorized by the Provincial School Inspectors concerned.\n\nFor Grade 4 and upwards the schools again will be allowed a choice of the Canadian Parade Readers or the Canadian Reading Development Series - depending on which series is authorized for the province. All others will order the readers authorized for the Province in which the school is located.\n\nSpellers:\n\nMost of our teachers are familiar with the \"Pupils' Own Vocabulary Spellers\" now authorized in several provinces. These spellers have been so well accepted that we are making them available again.\n\nManual Training:\n\nYou will notice that \"Second Year Woodwork\" is now available.\n\nArt:\n\nLeading authorities on the teaching of classroom art are agreed that the use of large paper and large brushes are easier to handle by small children. They are also agreed that small children should do more art work with Dry Tempera colours and Dry Tempera brushes. Teachers coming from Normal Schools and from Summer Schools have been very enthusiastic with the results after putting this theory into practice. Consequently, the Department is making available the Dry Tempera colours for all grades. The Dry Tempera brushes are made available also. (These brushes have a long handle and coarse bristles and may be used by all grades).\n\nFor large paper, the Department is providing -\n\n(i) Kraft Wrapping Paper for the lower grades, which can be used as drawing paper on one side and finger painting paper on the reverse side,\n\n(ii) Large white drawing paper - for Grades 7 and upwards.\n\nSome Provincial Courses of Study demand art work in oils for Grade 7 and up. Many teachers have also taken training in this line of work. The Department, is therefore prepared to supply the paints in tubes and special oil paint brushes to meet the demands for this type of materials. These will normally be supplied to the larger schools.\n### STANDARD SCHOOL SUPPLIES - STATIONERY\n\n(Two copies required in Ottawa)\n\n| Item Code | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| 3219      | boxes Chalk, white |\n| 3220      | \" Chalk, asst. colours |\n| 3226      | Blackboard brushes |\n| 4406      | Pencils (19/7 H.B.) |\n| 4213      | Pencils (Primary 308) |\n| 4214      | Pencils (Checking Blue # 76) |\n| 4216      | Pencils (Checking Red # 77) |\n| 4046      | Erasers (Pencil) |\n| 4231      | Erasers (Ink) |\n| 4453      | Erasers (Art gum) |\n| 4277      | Penholders |\n| 4271      | boxes Pen Nibs (fine) |\n| 4272      | \" Pen Nibs (medium) |\n| 4074      | pkts.

Desrosiers,\nController of Purchases.\nDecember 19, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSome time ago this office was advised that the Department would be supplying a small quantity of the booklet \"Little Songs for Little People\". A number of requests have been received for this and I shall appreciate the Department informing me as to when we may expect delivery.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM - Mr. W. S. Arneill\n\nI refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of December 13, concerning my circular letter to teachers dated November 30, 1950, in which instructions were given concerning the use of certain Readers in the Catholic Indian Schools of this province.\n\nAt the time of the issuance of this circular I was aware of the instructions that had been given teachers in the Indian School Bulletins of November, 1950 and November, 1949. My interpretation of these instructions is that I am empowered to authorize the use of both of these Readers, although the wording in the Bulletin refers to Provincial School Inspectors. Naturally, I assumed that the Department confers upon me the same authority that it delegates to School Inspectors not directly under the control of the Department.\n\nThe only material difference between the instructions included in the Bulletin and the action taken by myself is in indicating how these two sets will be used. It is my considered opinion that the Curriculum Foundation Series and the Canadian Parade Readers are superior to the Faith and Freedom and Corona Readers. Consequently, I indicated that the first two named sets should be used as the basic Readers.\n\nI did not consider that I had gone beyond the bounds of authority which should be assumed by an Inspector of Schools or the authority as suggested in the Indian School Bulletins of November 1949 and 1950. Since the Department is prepared to supply the two series when requested by the Inspector, surely he is entitled to indicate how these should be used.\n\nR. F. Davey,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 1-1-4 (FL)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of December 13th, I have discussed with Regional Inspector Davey his circular letter of November 30th, 1950, regarding the use of certain readers in Catholic Indian Schools and Mr. Davey, in his memorandum of December 16th, enclosed, sets forth his understanding of the Department's instructions in the bulletin which lead to the preparation and release of his circular.\n\nI might mention also that certain Catholic Schools are believed to have expressed a preference for the Canadian Parade Readers. I can see Mr. Davey's point of view in the matter but we will of course be guided by the Department's instructions.\n\nW.S.

She has asked that we send copies of our catalogs to you, and it is a pleasure to comply with her request. These catalogs are going to you separately. We hope that they will reach you promptly, and prove interesting and helpful.\n\nSince the publication of these catalogs many months ago it has been necessary to make some adjustments in prices due to rising costs of materials. These adjustments are contained in the price correction table inside the front cover of the catalogs. Please refer to these in getting up-to-date information on prices.\n\nHundreds of schools in Canada, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, are using Denoyer-Geppert geography maps, historical maps, globes, health and hygiene charts, and models, and we are sincerely desirous of working with you on your program as it may relate to the Indian schools. We think you will find many items of our production that will fit in with your teaching objectives, and a number of items that are not regularly published in Canada. We trust that we may have the pleasure of supplying these needs as your program moves ahead.\n\nIf we can be of help to you at any time in connection with the selection and use of maps, globes, charts or models, it will be a pleasure to work with you.

Subjects for entry were carefully selected with school curricula as guides; scientific studies assured the choice of a vocabulary comprehensible to children; even the type face used was selected by a sample group of boys and girls. The result is an interesting, direct treatment that is easily understood and enjoyed. An example of the informal presentation is this vivid start to the article on \"Arbitration\" \u2014 \"The umpire calls 'strike three!' and the batter is out. Both baseball teams have agreed in advance to accept this official's decision on every disputed point.\"\n\nThe illustrations are diversified and appealing \u2014 photographs, three-color drawings, charts, pictographs, reproductions in color, and several types of maps. Locator maps are an interesting departure to show the site of products and industries, streets, notable buildings, islands, rivers and political divisions. The excellent use of visual aids is indicated by the material accompanying the article on boxing. There are drawings of a Roman match, a series on modern boxing, and two reproductions of fight scenes by George Bellows.\n\nAn important feature of the set is the \"Ready Reference\" volume, which serves as an index to the encyclopedia and also provides excellent definitions and identifications. Examination of the index demonstrates how wide are the interests of the modern elementary-school child, and how seriously BRITANNICA JUNIOR takes these interests. Listed are articles on every conceivable subject from flowers and the Planetarium to the Tennessee Valley Authority and electronics. Biographical articles, too, are well represented, with listings for world figures as well as for persons of special appeal to youngsters.\n\nA final outstanding feature of the set is the format. Type face is unusually clear and readable; illustrations are effective; page make-up as a whole is exceptionally attractive.\n\nIt has taken several revisions and many improvements for this set to become a first-rate children's encyclopaedia. Now, with the new edition for a limited age group, BRITANNICA JUNIOR has made a place for itself.\"\nBoys' and Girls' Encyclopaedia\n\n\"Britannica Junior.\" Prepared under the direction of the editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Company, Toronto; 15 volumes, $90.\n\nNext to a good teacher, the most valuable educational factor in a pupil's life is a good reference collection. These are three indispensable basic elements to a school library. They are: a reliable dictionary, an accurate atlas, and an interesting and authoritative encyclopaedia. Having these three essentials in hand, the school can add as many individual books on various subjects as it wishes.\n\nA careful examination of Britannica Junior shows that it combines the best features of all dictionary, atlas and encyclopaedia. This reviewer was thrilled as he pitted through the volumes, read the articles and looked at the many pictures. Britannica Junior has always been one of the best children's encyclopaedias, and the new printing is a great improvement. It is recommended for elementary schools and junior high school grades with scarcely any reservation.\n\nAs the editors indicate, Britannica Junior is written for boys and girls of the elementary grades, but the material is so well written that they will find it interesting. It is obvious that a good deal of thought and skill have been used in preparing each article. Each writing is a masterpiece of interesting presentation. Teachers who know the value of reference books in getting pupils to use reference books will appreciate the fascinating way in which the articles in this encyclopaedia are written. The reader is constantly reminded with introductory sentences or each article which are calculated to lure the child to read further.\n\nBig words are avoided and the style is simple, but accuracy and thoroughness are not lacking. An encyclopaedia for a child is something different from one for an adult. The editors of Britannica Junior look for scholarly details of an advanced nature, the child's wants are considered. The editors of Britannica Junior have wisely recognized this in selecting the material to be included in the text.\n\nThere are several features of the new encyclopaedia that are worthy of special mention. First is its appearance. The volumes are beautiful to look at. The initial attractiveness is sustained throughout. The make-up editors are to be congratulated on the smart appearance of the pages and the attractive arrangement of headings. They are a definite improvement over those in the previous printing. The type face is also improvement, too. The new type face is larger and easier to read.\n\nThe volumes are profusely illustrated. Color is used not only in the full page photographs, but also in a number of smaller pictures. The art work throughout is outstanding. A feature of this set is the color reproductions of famous paintings obtained from the Encyclopaedia Britannica collection of modern American painting.\n\nVolume 1, the \"ready reference\" volume, is a jewel. Offering quick information on thousands of topics, it is an invaluable time-saver and an index to the set. The editors have been particularly concerned for the clear and picturesque way of explaining how to use this volume.\n\nThe atlas at the end of volume 15 has 81 colored plates, and throughout the set there are many \"locator\"\nmaps which give the students a clear idea of the products and points of interest of each country or province and show the location of a country, province or city in relation to its neighboring territories.\n\nThere are many useful charts, tables and diagrams.\n\nThe interesting way in which articles are introduced has been mentioned. An example may be cited from the piece on the kingfisher:\n\n\"If you should chance to be on the bank of some small stream and suddenly see a flash of blue above fall like a meteor upon the water's surface, without feeling doubtful you could say 'That is a kingfisher.'\"\n\nSlightly more than a page is devoted to the kingfisher, including a picture.\n\nThe article on Saskatchewan properly begins with an account of the province's agricultural operations. It explains the meaning of \"Saskatchewan,\" gives its location, and presents a historical sketch. There is a good paragraph on other industries, a description of life and activities in the northern part of the province, and information about the aboriginal people and their sports, recreation and cultural activities. The importance of Regina as a center is clearly indicated. There is a full page \"locator\" map and another map about two-thirds of a column deep showing the physical features and places.\n\nPrinted in U.S.A.\nJan. 18, 1951.\n\nCol. B. F.

You will note that this time we have furnished the completion sentences for dictation, an addition which we feel will be a \"time-saver\" for your teachers.\n\nIf you would like additional copies of this material please let us know.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nElementary Education\n\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\nMID-YEAR SPELLING SURVEY TESTS\nto accompany\nTHE CANADIAN PUPILS' OWN VOCABULARY SPELLERS\n\nIt is important to test spelling growth during the year and for this purpose we submit MID-YEAR Spelling Tests from the spelling lists of each grade in THE CANADIAN PUPILS' OWN VOCABULARY SPELLERS.\n\nHOW TO ADMINISTER THE TEST\n\nDictate each word in the completion sentence given and then repeat the word alone for the pupils to write.\n\nMARKING THE TEST\n\nIn marking the tests give the pupils credit for the number of correct words in the test and allow three marks for each correct word e.g., 30 correct words = 90 marks. If the child has over 92 marks he can do the spelling of the next grade. If he has under 75 he should be given the spelling of a lower grade.\n\nNote: We will have Final Tests similar in type to the Mid-Year Tests given here.\n\nThese Final Tests are available to you on request.\n\nARE YOU FOLLOWING \"The Plan for Individual Weekly Review\"?\n\n\"Words missed on Friday should be correctly recorded at the end of the lesson. If possible, misspelled words should be studied immediately after the test is taken. The source of each error should be sought and the correct form given special attention. The pupil should be encouraged to refer again to the dictionary and to seek the teacher's help freely on these words. Dictionaries appear at the back of each book beginning with Grade IV. Each child should study his misspelled words again on Thursday of the following week and include them in his Friday test. If he misses the word again the same process should be repeated.\n\nIf after this second study the child still misses the word, he should record it correctly in a list of his own hard words.\"\n\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\n70 Bond Street Toronto 2\nSPELLING SURVEY TESTS\n(MID-YEAR)\n\nGrade 2 -

Thomas Jr.\nEducational Representative.\nFebruary 2nd, 1951\n\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nAttention: Mr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Education Division\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Teaching Tables\n\nOn November 14th, 1950, we received an enquiry to submit quotations on the manufacture of a specially constructed Teaching Table in lots of 25.\n\nMay we be advised the possibility of our being favoured with an order apropos to our quotation of December 4th, 1950.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.A. McLaughlin\nAssistant Commissioner\nAIR MAIL\n\nFebruary 9, 1951.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nOn reviewing our file, I find that your letter of December 19th did not receive a reply.\n\nI note the second paragraph of your letter, and while I have no doubt the statement is true, at the same time I would point out that we have received several letters from persons who took exception to Mr. Davey's circular and consider that the use of Catholic readers in Indian Day Schools conducted under Catholic auspices is prohibited. I think you will agree that this was not the tenor of the information contained in the Bulletin to which I referred in my letter of December 13th.\n\nI feel certain that Mr. Davey will desire to conform strictly with the instructions contained in the Bulletin to which I have just referred.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\nRiver of the Sun\n\nBy James Ramsey Ullman\n\nThis superb novel, which was the Book-of-the-Month Club choice for January, blends excellent adventure with intellectual stimulation. Like the unforgettable The White Man's Burden, it explores the psychology of living against a background of hazardous experiences.\n\nThere are three stories, and one besides. From the Andes to the plains between the Isthmus and the Amazon, follows the course of the forest. It is in this forest valley, the Amazon valley, that the action of the story takes place.\n\nBillion, ex-Army pilot, has buried himself in a routine job in the town of Manaus, trying to forget the past adventure which his wife was killed. He is persuaded by his friend, Berman, seeking the fabled River of the Sun, resolved to flee through the valley rich in gold and gems. With the party is Christine, wife of Dr. Nils Barna, who is going up-river to find his missing wife. Unexpectedly, the expedition discovers a new river, and searches for Dr. Barna, who has disappeared into the enveloping wilderness.\n\nMighty rivers, dense jungles, mood of steaming jungle and mysterious rivers, where the map shows only a blank spot marked \"Unexplored,\" and against this setting is woven a story of thrilling adventures. But behind the excitement lies the real theme of the book\u2014a man seeking something outside and beyond himself, for a goal in life, for inner peace. $4.25\n\nThe Faith of Mrs. Kelleen\n\nBy Katherine Mary Flannigan\n\nRemember Mrs. Mike, that fine story of an Irish coltress who married a Montana? Real life \"Mrs. Mike\" was Katherine Mary Flannigan, and now she has written a book of her life, though in the form of fiction, it is based on actual events in the life of her great-aunt.\n\nIt happened eighty years ago in Montana. Mrs. Mike's great-aunt Kelleen lived with her son Rory, the first boy of eighteen. When Rory took two young horses to sell at the county fair, and then returned late at night, his mother was sick with worry. In the morning, the police came to arrest him, he had been accused of murdering one of the Mustangs, a horse trader.\n\nFrom that moment, Kelleen's life was dedicated to freeing Rory from the charge. Even when he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, her faith did not fail. She fought for him, but of her health, sight, small possessions, home, even memory of life itself, not even death could put an end to her efforts, and her spirit remained unbroken until finally Rory walked out of prison into a new life with beautiful Mary, the Shoshone with secret heart, who had worked with his mother to bring about his exoneration.\n\nThere is a quiet power in the telling of this simple tale that carries conviction. The plot depends not so much on action as\nViews of Attica\n\nBy Rex Warner\n\nWhen a poet and distinguished neologist goes to Greece to travel, the result is likely to be unusually interesting and often that poet is also a first-rate classical scholar and the country he is visiting is Greece. This book is full of unique value and beauty.\n\nViews of Attica will give no one in love of Greece much. Instead of assembling information, Rex Warner has tried to convey something of \"the violent and tender, full of expectation which is never satisfied, the full of chance, excitement and joy.\" The feeling he expresses is that of one who has fallen in love with Greece.\n\nTwenty-eight pages of photographs supposedly illustrate the text. $3.50\n\nWhite Man Boss\n\nBy Adamastor\n\nIn South Africa today there is a regime reminiscent of Hitler's. It is presided over by Dr. Daniel Malan, Prime Minister and head of the Nationalist Party. One of its basic tenets is the doctrine of racial superiority, and in keeping with this belief the natives are rigorously segregated and discriminated against. The Afrikaners, who were outspoiled and disarmed during the war, called themselves \"Die Volk,\" a name that calls to mind the \"Herero\" of the German Southwest.\n\nDr. Malan said in 1941: \"Hereby we declare that our republic shall not be like the state we have at the moment, in which the liberalistic British parliamentary system is imposed upon us. We want a race one gets if one gives the franchise to everyone indiscriminately?\"\n\nAdamastor (the real name of a prominent South African author) answers with his denunciation of the fanatical Afrikaner tribe which 300 years ago cut the ties with Europe and became victims of the savagery that is inherent in the culture of older Africa.\" $3.00\n\nHow to Write for Pleasure and Profit\n\nEdited by Warren Bower\n\nTwelve nationally known editors and experts have written this encyclopedia of the entire field of writing for profit, covering for everything that can be taught about the business, right up to the actual writing which can be learned only by doing.\n\nThe thirty-five chapters are crammed with useful facts and practical suggestions, with hundreds of stimulating examples. Most of the contributors are or have been teachers of the subjects they discuss, and many of them have themselves written successfully for the market they discuss. (Talkative also meet markets.) All learn of some that are quite unknown to most writers.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections\u2014Creative Writing, covering the arts of fiction writing; Practical Writing, which includes newspaper and magazine writing, journalism, writing letters, speeches, and publicity; and General Information, containing instructions on how to prepare and submit manuscripts, and where to find the right market for them.\n\nWarren Bower, editor of this compilation, is Director of the Writing Center of New York University, and former fiction editor of Scribner's. $6.25\n\nThe New You and Heredity\n\nBy Amram Scheinfeld\n\nWhen this book was first published in 1937 the Medical Association of the American Medical Association called it \"unquestionably the best book ever written for the general reader yet available.\" Time, which does not bestow praise lightly, described it as \"a highly popular treatise of the facts and fiction of heredity.\"\n\nMore than three-fourths of the material in this edition is entirely new or completely revised, all the photographs new, and many new drawings by the author. Scores of leading physicians and experts have given their advice and assistance, assuring a degree of accuracy rarely found in any popular-science book. The remarkable content about human inheritance is presented in the clear and dramatic style that won for the first edition more than half a million readers and the acclaim of the professional world.\n\nSee if you can answer these questions: What determines a baby's sex? Why are men genetically taller than women? Can beauty pass on to children? Is race mixture harmful? How do you determine your life span? Can homosexuality be cured?\n\nYou'll find the answers to these and hundreds of other questions in the new You and Heredity. $6.25\n\nA West-India Fortune\n\nBy Richard Pares\n\nIn 1685 one Azariah Pinney, who had been involved in Monmouth's Rebellion, was exiled to the West Indies. This is the story of the Pinneys and their fortune, its growth during nearly two centuries. It tells the history of sugar production on the island of Nevis, and of the business in Bristol that grew out of it.\n\nRichard Pares, who is Professor of History at the University of Edinburgh, has turned out a book that is both a history of the study of economic history and to the layman, embellished with brilliant and witty commentaries by the author and some of their employees \u2014 Charles Pinney, for instance, whose office as Mayor of Bristol ended somewhat ignominiously when he died. Illustrations, from portraits and prints, are apt additions to the text. $5.00\n\nHe That Plays the King\n\nBy Kenneth Tynan\n\nKen Tynan, a youthful prodigy who is already a successful theatre producer at the age of twenty-three, was once considered a great dramatic critic in the making, but now he seems to have lost interest in the theatre. This volume of criticisms displays both the exuberance of youth and the maturely intelligent love of the theatre. Mr. Tynan is whole-hearted in either enthusiasm, but he has lost patience with the lukewarm comments of the critics. \"Criticism,\" he says, \"has taken a wrong turning into a perturbability of mind which it has succeeded in worry about communicating excitement or sense.\"\n\nThe author is an unabashed hero-worshipper, and his book is concerned largely with larger drama. However, he turns aside occasionally to pulverize some minor play or to defend the ageing shopworn D'Orly Carte Opera Company with its affected style and wide, ironic smile. Too many spurious phrases issuing from the spasmodic freezes. While we are here, there are a couple of other quotable lines: \"Olivier would pounce on a line and rip its heart out,\" \"Richard III skips a beat and bounces along it, shaving off pathos in great flakes.\" And his description of an actor's \"ceaseless...\"\nfits of wrestling with his cloak, like a tortoise in a philosophical mood.\n\nThere is a stimulating introduction by Orson Welles, who applauds some of Mr. Tyran's judgments and takes sharp issue with others.\n\n$3.00\n\nThe Incredible De Foe\n\nBy William Freeman\n\nThe author of Robinson Crusoe\u2014who gave the dramatic \"De\" to his plain name of Foe\u2014lived in turbulent times that marked his own life. In his youth he saw London ravaged by the Plague and the Great Fire; five years later he died. During his lifetime, he witnessed the effect of Monmouth's Rebellion, the restoration of the last Stuart, and the accession of William of Orange.\n\nAs a young man, Daniel De Foe was a businessman of varied interests, whose deals ranged from buying and selling ships to the purchase of a farm of civet cats. But his energy and ambition were greater than his business sense, and his ideas of honesty were, say his biographers, platonic. He was bankrupt twice, was twice imprisoned in Newgate, and stood for a seat in Parliament. Nevertheless, he had a fundamental respect for credit and justice, and paid off his creditors by paying off twelve thousand pounds in the end.\n\nWilliam Freeman has done more than bring us the life of an amazing man. He has given us, too, a wealth of curious and fascinating detail, the England in which De Foe lived.\n\n$8.50\n\nThe Magic People\n\nBy Arland Usher\n\nArland Usher, whose brilliant and provocative The Face and Mind of Ireland has been enthusiastically received both in this country and elsewhere, now writes of the Jews.\n\nHe begins with a survey of the history and character of the Jewish people as revealed in the Old Testament. He goes on to discuss the nature of Jesus as symbol, not only of the Jew but of Jewry. This leads to the subject of the Jewish religion and Jesus as the Messiah, and some interesting speculations as to what would have happened to Christianity if they had accepted him. Finally he reaches the core of the book, an analysis of antisemitism, and puts forward many explanations on many levels. It quite rightly, for anti-Semitism is a complex phenomenon, with roots in all kinds of soil.\n\nThis is a most stimulating book, the product of an unusual mind and a true believer's intuition. It overflows with unorthodox and often brilliant ideas, expressed in a style that makes reading a pleasure.\n\n$2.50\n\nWe Two\n\nBy Ulrik Atlebek\n\nThe theme of We Two is one of the simplest and most powerful in the world\u2014a mother's love for her baby. Before she is even aware she is going to have a baby, the mother experiences, wonderfully sensitively, the emotions of pregnancy, of the actual birth, of first holding the baby, of watching the sensations she feels on the baby's first crying, waking, feeding, talking, and answering her questions about life.\n\nDealing with intense emotions, the story yet avoids falling into sentimentality. Readers are put in direct contact with the feelings of the mother, experiencing them almost as their own.\n\n$2.75\nDIVISION OF TESTS, STANDARDS\nAND RESEARCH\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nJanuary 25, 1951.\n\n20 pkgs.

FOR ECONOMY\n\nAsk ten different maintenance engineers, building Superintendents, and actual maintenance men how to clean and polish a given floor and, likely you will get ten different answers.\n\nThe following suggestions and information are based on more than 50 years manufacturing and maintenance experience, and to the best of our knowledge, covers the requirements of institutions, keeping in mind . . . ease of application . . . beauty of the floor, itself . . . the economy of using good materials in the proper manner.\n\nTHE CORRECT TYPE OF FLOOR WAX TO USE ON....\n\nCork Flooring ........................................ Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nComposition Floors .................................. Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\nHardwood Floors ..................................... Buckeye Paste Wax\nLinoleums, all types .................................. Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax\nMastic or Asphalt Tile ............................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nPainted Cement Floors .............................. Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax\nRubber Tile Flooring ................................. Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\nTerrazzo Floors ....................................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nTile Flooring .......................................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\nINFORMATION ON\nBUCKEYE PASTE WAX and\nBUCKEYE CLEANING and POLISHING WAX\n\nThese two waxes are the original types of wax polish. They contain various kinds of waxes blended together with solvents of naphtha, turpentine, benzine, or mineral spirit type. They contain more wax solids than so-called \"water emulsion\" or \"no rubbing\" type of wax, and actually are less expensive in the long run than \"water emulsion\" wax.\n\nHowever, from the standpoint of time and labour, these waxes are more expensive since they require longer to polish.\n\nCleaning and Polishing Spirit Wax is merely Buckeye Paste Wax thinned out with an excellent cleaning agent.\n\nUse Buckeye Paste Wax or Cleaning & Polishing Wax on hardwood floors for better results.\n\nBuckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax can be used also, on all types of linoleums, but is not recommended where there is extremely heavy and dirty traffic. However, it does give the finest finish of any wax, but is a little more difficult to maintain.\n\nHOW TO APPLY BUCKEYE PASTE and BUCKEYE CLEANING & POLISHING WAXES:\n\nIn applying Paste Wax, a thin, even coat is the secret of good waxing.\n\nWood floors should be WAXED ACROSS THE GRAIN and POLISHED WITH THE GRAIN.\n\nAllow about five minutes to dry and polish with a soft, clean cloth...a weighted brush...or an electric polisher.\n\nOne advantage of Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax is that it cleans and polishes at the same time...can be applied faster than Paste Wax, and is fairly easy to apply.\n\nIt also makes an outstanding polish for furniture and woodwork of any colour.\n\nDo not use either one of the above waxes on composition floors...mastic or asphalt tile, or rubber flooring.\n\nThe solvents contained in these types of waxes sometimes take out the colours, and actually will dissolve mastic or asphalt tile.\n\nGLEEMAL\nEASES CLEANING PROBLEMS\nA Concentrated All Purpose Cleanser\nDissolves Dirt - Free Rinsing Creates Freshness\n\nFOR WASHING\nWalls - Ceilings - Painted Woodwork - Floors (wood)\nTerrazzo - Linoleum - Rubber Composition\nFixtures, Kitchen Equipment, Wash Basins, Sinks, Toilet Bowls, etc.\nINFORMATION ON\nBUCKEYE SELF-SHINE WAX\n\nIn addition to \"Self-Shine\" this product answers variously to the names: \"No Buff,\" \"Self-Polishing,\" \"Water Emulsion,\" and \"Water Wax.\" It is, basically, a blend of waxes and shellac dispersed in a solution of water and colloidal soap.\n\nAfter application, the water evaporates, depositing the minute particles of wax in a uniform film. These tiny particles reflect light and give a glossy, lustrous sheen without rubbing or buffing.\n\nWalking over, sweeping, and mopping a floor coated with Self-Shine Wax all tend to burnish and increase the gloss. Some users prefer to buff Self-Shine to achieve the maximum lustre right away... this can be done with a weighted brush or an electric polisher.\n\nSelf-Shine enables one man to wax and polish double or more the floor area than he could by the old method. It also eliminates fire hazards, bad odours\u2014common to paste or liquid waxes.\n\nCovers from 3600 to 5400 square feet per gallon, depending upon porosity of the surface and variations in application.\n\nDries non-tacky in about twenty minutes unless there is exceptional humidity or poor ventilation.\n\nSelf-Shine Wax is waterproof when thoroughly dry. This permits mopping with cold water without removing the wax. It also explains resistance to spilled liquids, rain, etc.\n\nIt can be removed with warm water and our neutral soap Perfection or Terrazine Floor Soap.\n\nIt is recommended particularly for linoleum of all kinds, rubber tile, cork flooring, composition floors, mastic or asphalt tile, and any floors which have a tightly sealed surface, such as terrazzo, tile or painted cement floors.\n\nHOW TO APPLY\nBUCKEYE SELF-SHINE WAX\n\nSelf-Shine Wax should be FLOWED on the floor in a thin, even film, using a suitable applicator. It should NOT BE RUBBED IN like Paste Wax and Cleaning and Polishing Wax.\n\nLevel the wax out, then leave it! Going back over the wax after the two or three minutes it takes to set, may cause streakiness.\n\nPouring a small quantity of the wax on the floor and spreading it out, may be satisfactory for a small floor, but an open container in which you can dip the applicator is better for large areas.\n\nThe wax should be applied in straight sweeps running the same way not in a circular motion.\n\nAllow to dry for about 20 minutes... longer on humid days.\n\nIf buffing is intended, use a clean, soft cloth under a weighted brush, or an electric floor polisher.

Track,\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mike,\n\nRe: READERS FOR GRADES 4, 5 and 6\n\nYou will remember our discussion concerning the readers recently published by this Company. I am attaching to this letter a descriptive folder of the titles and prices.\n\nWe anticipate a heavy sale in Ontario for these readers as they are now authorized. You will find them listed in the Ontario Department of Education Authorized List for 1950-51. When you are looking at this list, I would particularly draw your attention to the prices of the other readers! You will note that our Grade 4 reader is priced at $1.00. Our nearest competitor has a Grade 4 reader priced at $1.50. Knowing that your estimates have been cut, I would suggest that a fifty cent saving on each Grade 4 reader would be of interest to both Mr. Phelan and yourself.\n\nYou will note that our Grade 5 reader is priced 25\u00a2 lower than our nearest competitor, and that the Grade 6 reader is 30\u00a2 cheaper than the next reader. Yet I am sure you will agree that our readers compare most favourably with any other in the field.\n\nThe chief editor is Colonel S. A. Watson, Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education for Ontario. He and his associates have developed a reading series that really has the interest and appeal for any Canadian child. If you wish extra sample copies, please drop me a note and I will be glad to send them along.\nThanks for the library order, and I particularly hope that the Bible stories prove popular. We have just made a big sale of them to Eaton's who feel that the stories, coloured illustrations, and price are hard to beat.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nB.F. Neary.\n\nBFN:ER\n\nEnc.\nFor better reading in 1950\n\nNelsons present\n\nTHE new HIGHROADS TO READING SERIES for Grades IV, V and VI\n\nby Stanley A.

F. Track,\nEducation Office, Indian Affairs,\nCapitol Building,\n220 Queen Street,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nI have been looking through the correspondence that I had with you last July about Mr. Kidd's THE INDIANS OF CANADA. When you wrote to me on July 19th you told me that you had turned over your impressions of the book to Colonel Nearie from whom we would be hearing. I have looked through my files and cannot find any letter from Colonel Nearie, nor can I find your impressions of the book to which you referred.\n\nWhen I had a talk with you about this a week or so ago, I was very impressed with your remarks. I thought that if we were to pay some attention to what you said we would very greatly improve the book when it finally comes out. Could you let me have a copy of the material you forwarded to Colonel Nearie at that time to come to us? I would be very grateful for this.\n\nVery best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard McEvoy,\nAssistant Manager.\n## STANDARD TEXT BOOKS\n\nTwo Copies Required in Ottawa\n\n### PROTESTANT SCHOOLS\n\n#### BASIC READERS\n\n**Grade I**\n- 214 Before We Read\n- 215 We Look and See\n- 216 We Work and Play\n- 217 We Come and Go\n- 218 Think and Do Book for Pre-Primer Program\n- 219 Fun with Dick & Jane\n- 220 Think and Do Book for Fun with Dick and Jane\n- 221 Our New Friends\n- 222 Think and Do Book for Our New Friends\n- 223 Guide-book to Grade One Program\n\n**Grade 2**\n- 224 Friends and Neighbors\n- 225 Workbook Friends & Neighbors\n- 226 More Friends & Neighbors\n- 227 Workbook - More Friends & Neighbors\n- 228 Guide-book Second Grade Program\n\n**Grade 3**\n- 229 Streets and Roads\n- 230 Workbooks - Streets & Roads\n- 231 More Streets and Roads\n- 232 Workbook - More Streets & Roads\n- 233 Guide Book - Third Grade Program\n\n### CANADIAN PARAIDE READERS:\n- 196 Young Explorers (Grade 4)\n- 197 Workbook - Young Explorers\n- 198 Guide Book - Young Explorers\n- 199 Gay Adventures (Grade 5)\n- 200 Workbook - Gay Adventures\n- 201 Guide Book - Gay Adventures\n- 202 Proud Processions (Grade 6)\n- 203 Workbook - Proud Processions\n- 204 Guide Book - Proud Processions\n\n### CANADIAN READING DEVELOPMENT SERIES:\n- 205 Up and Away (Grade 4)\n- 206 Workbook - Up and Away\n- 207 Guide Book - Up and Away\n- 208 Wide Open Windows (Grade 5)\n- 209 Workbook - Wide Open Windows\n- 210 Guide Book - Wide Open Windows\n- 211 All Sails Set (Grade 6)\n- 212 Workbook - All Sails Set\n- 213 Guide Book - All Sails Set\n\n### CATHOLIC SCHOOLS\n\n#### FAITH and FREEDOM SERIES:\n\n**Grade I**\n- 174 Our First Book\n- 175 Here We Come\n- 176 This is Our Home\n- 177 Workbook for Here We Come\n- 178 Teaching First Grade Reading I\n- 179 This is Our Family\n- 180 Workbook for This is Our Family\n- 181 Teaching First Grade Reading II\n- 182 These Are Our Friends\n- 183 Workbook for These Are Our Friends\n- 184 Teaching First Grade Reading III\n\n**Grade 2**\n- 185 These Are Our Neighbors\n- 186 Workbook for These Are Our Neighbors\n- 187 Teaching Second Grade Reading\n\n### CORONA READERS Grade 3 and Up\n\n- 188 Paths of Grace (Grade 3)\n- 189 Workbook for Paths of Grace\n- 190 Tales to Tell (Grade 4)\n- 191 Workbooks for Tales to Tell\n- 192 Stories for Everyday (Grade 5)\n- 193 Treasure Trove (Grade 6)\n- 194 Fact and Fancy (Grade 7)\n- 195 Wide Horizons (Grade 8)\n\n### LANGUAGE:\n\n**Living Language Series:**\n- 163 New Ways (Grade 3)\n- 164 Words at Work (Grade 4)\n- 165 More Progress (Grade 5)\n- 166 Carry On (Grade 6)\n- 167 Teacher's Manual, L.L.S.\n- 168 Opportunity Workbook in English, (Grade 7)\n\n**Opportunity Workbook in English, (Grade 8)**\n\n### SPELLERS:\n\n- 238 Pupils' Own Vocabulary Speller, Book 1 (Grades 2 & 3)\n- 239 Pupils' Own Vocabulary Speller, Book 2 (Grades 4 and 5)\n- 240 Pupils' Own Vocabulary Speller, Book 3 (Grades 7 & 8)\nARITHMETICS:\n\n148 Jolly Numbers Primer\n149 Jolly Numbers, Book 1\n150 Jolly Numbers,\nBook 2 - 1st half\n151 Jolly Numbers,\nBook 2 - 2nd half\n155 Teacher's Manual, Book 1\n156 Teacher's Manual, Book 2\n\nHEALTH:\n\nSafe and Healthy Living Series:\nFor Teachers' Use Only:\n157 Spick and Span (Grade 1)\n158 Health Parade (Grade 2)\n159 Growing Big & Strong (Grade 3)\n160 Safety Everyday (Grade 4)\n\nFor Pupils' Use:\n161 Health, Safety &\nSuccess (Grades 5 & 6)\n162 Your Health and Safety (Grades 7 & 8)\n\nSOCIAL STUDIES:\n\n234 Story Workbook in Canadian History (Grades 5 - 7)\n235 Social Studies Workbook on Eastern Canada (Grades 7 & 8)\n236 Social Studies Workbook on Western Canada (Grades 7 & 8)\n237 The Story of Canada (Grades 5 - 7) (Teachers only)\n\nGRADES\n\nBelow Grade I\nGrade 1\nGrade 2\nGrade 3\nGrade 4\nGrade 5\nGrade 6\nGrade 7\nGrade 8\nGrade 9\nGrade 10\nGrade 11\nGrade 12\n\nTOTAL:\n\nName ____________________________\nSchool __________________________\nPost Office (nearest) _______________\nExpress Office ____________________\nProvince _________________________\n\n(PLEASE PRINT)\n\nApproved: ________________________\nIndian Superintendent.\nMarch 1st, 1951.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education,\n220 Queen,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWe appreciate very much the orders received from your Department this morning.\n\nIt reminded me that I should send you a copy of a new book RED STREAK OF IROQUOIS by Arthur C.

O. Lajoie\nActing Superintendent of Stationery.\nOttawa, February 7, 1951.\n\nTO: Superintendents, Indian Agency, Regional Supervisors of Indian Agencies and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to the Circular Letter of February 7, 1949, concerning Civil Service Regulation 85A, dealing with compensation for overtime for employees of the Civil Service, please note the following amended Regulations:\n\n\"Employees to whom this regulation applies shall be compensated by additional leave for overtime worked in accordance with the following conditions:\n\n(a) that the overtime work was performed on the written instructions of an official authorized to give such instructions by the deputy head, with the concurrence of the Commission;\n\n(b) that in the case of an employee required to register daily the time of his arrival and departure and in receipt of a salary not exceeding $3180. per annum, the period of overtime work is not less than one hour and was worked either on a statutory holiday (or other day declared a holiday by competent authority) or on a normal working day.\n\n(c) that in the case of an employee earning over $3180. or who is not required to register daily the time of his arrival and departure, the period of overtime work was not less than three hours and was performed on a statutory holiday (or other day declared a holiday by competent authority);\n\n(d) that the time of arrival and departure for such overtime work is properly recorded.\n\nLeave may be granted to employees in compensation for overtime worked at the rate of one-half day's leave for each three hours' overtime, and this leave may be used for the same purpose and subject to the same conditions, including provision for carry-over between Departments as vacation leave, sick leave or special leave. This additional leave in compensation for overtime work may be used for vacation leave during the fiscal year in which the overtime is worked and the following fiscal year, and may be used for sick leave or special leave at any time up to the date of separation from the Service.\n\nAt the time an employee separates from the Service by resignation, retirement or for any reason other than misconduct, overtime leave available for use as vacation leave, may be treated as outstanding vacation leave, and overtime leave available for sick or special leave, may be used for the purpose of qualifying for retiring leave under Section 73 of these regulations.\"\n\nLeave covered by overtime must be requested on the usual leave application form now in use, (Form No. 263).\nConsideration has been given to the procedure for recording overtime under this regulation, and it has been decided that periods of overtime worked will be computed to the nearest completed half hour. That is to say, odd minutes in excess of the last completed half hour will not be recorded. For example, if an employee works overtime for a period of one hour and fifty minutes, he will be credited with one and a half hours; if he works two hours and five minutes, he will be credited with two hours.\n\nAll authorizations, (Form C.P. 300) for overtime work of the Indian Affairs field staff as set forth in the regulations, will be signed by the Superintendents. The forms will then be forwarded to the Regional Supervisors for their recommendation and submission to Head Office.\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nGlenorchy, ONT.\nJan. 17th, 1951.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am in receipt of your statement regarding my monthly day school returns for the month of Dec. 1950, which I am returning herewith.\n\nIt seems to me that this discrepancy is due to the fact that Item #6 on our \"Teacher's Monthly Day School Return\" Form R3506 provides for pupils actually attending during the month while Item #1 provides for the number of pupils enrolled, which in this case is 24; consequently my total by grades agrees with the number of pupils enrolled and registered in my daily register under their own specific grade.\n\nI suggest that this sheet (anticipated teacher's errors) is confusing to all teachers and should be revised.\n\nEnclosed you will also find the envelope which contained your correspondence. As usual your letter, bearing the marks of our dept. was open - not only open but the flap of the envelope (see Glenorchy post mark), apparently it was never sealed. Could anything be done about this? I might mention that my salary cheque, as far as I can recollect, never bore signs of manipulation.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMr. L. A.

I am willing to bet that you are a lot more crowded than you were on Queen Street.\n\nUnder separate cover I am sending you three books which I think you will like for next year's library list. ARCTIC PILOT is priced at $1.25, less 33 1/3%. It is widely used in the school libraries of the provinces and it is a school edition of one of our popular titles. You will find it deals with Indians and Eskimos and there are many references to the mission schools etc., at Aklavit, Resolution, and Providence.\n\nTHE BEARS OF JASPER is priced at $1.50 less 33 1/3% and should be popular with teen agers. It is widely used also in school libraries. CARIBOO ROAD is priced at $1.50 less 33 1/3% and is the story of the gold rush in B.C. It is, of course, used as a library book in the B.C. schools.\n\nPlease note that all of the above are about Canadians and are of the type for which we were always on the look-out.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHOMAS NELSON & SONS (CANADA) LIMITED.\n\nBFN:ER\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.

Nelson & Sons,\n91 Wellington St. W.,\nToronto 1, Ont.,\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have your recent letter and the sample copies of the Arctic Pilot, The Bears of Jasper and Cariboo Road for which I thank you. I have placed these books in the usual collection for my next year's library list.\n\nWe have now moved to the new building and you would be surprised to see how well it looks. There appears to be plenty of space for all and everyone seems happy. The building is nice and clean, well lighted, warm and satisfactorily ventilated. Mr. Phelan and particularly the Director have very beautiful offices.\n\nYou will remember the stationary cupboards we purchased from the Canada Public Booth Company. We brought a number of them with us and used them to isolate the quarters occupied by Mr. Eisenhardt and Mr. Mingay, giving them a private office. We gave up the steel shelving and the legion books, which went to the Warehouse.\n\nI shall be at the O.E.A. convention for the three days and will be on the lookout for suitable library\nbooks for next year, also for some information on the new curriculum.\n\nIt might be of interest to you that Mr. Phelan has been awarded the position of Superintendent subject to appeal which expires March 30th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.F.

Lapie\nActing Superintendent of Stationery.\nOttawa, January 14, 1951.\n\nEducation Division,\nCitizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa.\n\nIt has been suggested that we print on our invoices for Catalogue and Non-Catalogue Items of Stationery, the headings of the financial encumbrance coding stamps used by the several government departments.\n\nWe are quite ready to accommodate everybody in this matter, but first we need facsimiles of all the financial encumbrance coding stamps used on these invoices.\n\nWould you, therefore, let us have a facsimile of your financial encumbrance coding stamp by return mail, please. The sooner we have yours and the others, the sooner we will be able to draw up a composite stamp to meet the needs of all concerned.\n\nF. O. Lajoie\nActing Superintendent of Stationery.\nReferring to your letter of October 27th, please be advised that the compound sent for experimental purposes so far has not proven out very well. It may be that this compound will work satisfactorily during Spring and Summer. We have not yet had an opportunity to try it during the warm weather. Since it appears that to get maximum benefit from the compound, sewage matter will have to be covered with liquid at all times. I should imagine we are going to have to make metal containers for the toilets or line the present boxes with metal. I should like to hear if better success has been met with from other Agencies and under what circumstances.\n\nConcerning the urinals you wanted placed in the boys' toilets, we have just now been able to obtain sheet aluminum. I have my doubts as to how this will work out as in some cases the seats are little more than a foot from the floor and the trouble would have to run into the box from the top of the seat. If it was just a case of having the drain-off into a hole in the ground instead of boxes as we have to contend with, there would be no problem at all. We tried this out some years ago and condemned it for unsatisfactory and unsanitary reasons.\n\nT.

Track,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nCopeland Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Track:\n\nFurther to the second last paragraph of my letter dated December 27th, I regret to inform you that my Company has today advised me that on the special reinforced nesting table with bookshelf, 30\" x 48\" x 26\" as made for you, we will be obliged on future orders to charge you $29.00 per table, F.O.B.

Lajoie,\nStationery Office,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis refers to my letter of March 16th and your note on same letter regarding the assignment of another departmental prefix for this Branch.\n\nThe Education Division who secures all the stationery, text books and general school supplies for the Indian schools from your Book Unit uses requisition numbers commencing in the thirty thousand series.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch supplies office who requisitions the stationery and office supplies for the agents in the field and the headquarters staff in Ottawa, presently uses the requisition numbers in the five and six hundred series. As you mentioned in your note that their requirements should be ordered through their Department's stationery office not from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, this remark is correct. However, the Stationery Office prepares requisitions to replenish their stock to purchase non-catalogue items and large requirements to agents in the field.\n\nThe other day, I received an envelope containing copies of non-catalogue Stationery items. The numbers were Group 59 - 636, 681, 624, 578, 446, 641, 628; Group 2 33666, 33456, 33709, 33705, 33688, 33687, 33540, 33656, 33683, 33698 etc.\nIn view of the above information, it would be appreciated if another prefix number would be assigned to this division, as outlined in my letter of March 16th, which is attached. For any further information, you may contact Mr. M.F. Track, Local 7683.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 2, 1951.\n\nNorthern Transportation Co.,\n10167-99th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have a copy of your Schedule of Sailings 1951. However, it would be appreciated if you would forward me an additional eight copies of this schedule for our staff.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 28, 1951.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nThis refers to your Voucher No. 195 covering Permanent Record Cards amounting to $100.00 plus freight.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department is obliged to forward this Voucher to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery for payment. Usually the Stationery Office pays such accounts without questioning. However, they feel, and rightly so, that they have the sole authority to purchase and pay for all stationery, supplies, books, printing etc.\n\nIt has been noted in the past that considerable books, etc., have been purchased by your office without consulting this office, who in turn requests the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to make the necessary purchase. It is felt that only urgent purchases should be made by your office and all other requirements directed through the proper channels.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise whether the Permanent Record Cards was a special priority job or whether these are forms used by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nA copy of these cards would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nMFT/HM\nA/Superintendent of Education.\nMarch 1951\n\nMr. P.N.L. Phelan  \nActing Supt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration  \nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Wooden School Chair-Desks\n\nWe are advised by the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary that the cost to manufacture the hardwood chair desks in accordance with the sample submitted would be $17.67 each, sales tax exempt,rating extra, f.o.b. St.Vincent de Paul Penitentiary.\n\nWe realize that our quoted price for this type of desk is above that submitted by commercial concerns. However, as the sample desk submitted is the only one of this type that we at present manufacture, we are unable to quote other than our actual cost.\n\nHowever, we do feel that given the opportunity we could produce the lighter type of chair desks as manufactured commercially at a competitive price, and we would appreciate, if possible, your favouring us with a token order of perhaps 50 desks of the medium size, which would suffice for us to develop a lighter desk to better suit your requirements and at a price competitive to commercial concerns.\n\nWe regret our inability at this time to submit a true sample of what our shops are able to produce, and trust we shall be given the opportunity of supplying a part of your requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.M.

You will note, under our \"GENERAL INFORMATION\", the following clause:\n\nINSURANCE\n\n\"Shippers are expressly notified that all shipments are carried entirely at their own risk during transit. It is advisable to insure shipments. Adequate marine and cargo insurance may be obtained upon application to the Company. Value must be declared on all shipments requiring coverage by insurance.\"\n\nThe above quoted clause is self-explanatory and we trust that you will avail yourself of the facilities we have for arranging the necessary marine and cargo insurance. The following rates have been quoted us by the insurance company and will be in effect this season for shipments north from Waterways:\n\n| Points not beyond Fort Smith, including points on Lake Athabasca | Per $100.00 value |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Beyond Fort Smith but not beyond Resolution                   | .375             |\n| Beyond Resolution but not beyond Providence, including all points on Slave Lake | .50              |\n| Beyond Providence but not beyond Fort Norman, including Fort Liard and Fort Nelson | .625             |\n| Bear River and Great Bear Lake                                 | .875             |\n| Beyond Fort Norman but not beyond Aklavik                     | 1.00             |\n| Beyond Aklavik but not beyond Tuktoyaktuk                     | 1.125            |\n\nBe sure to protect yourself against marine and cargo loss during the coming season.\n\nNORTHERN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY (1947) LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Manager\n\nFMBroderick/S\nOttawa, Ont.,\nMarch 22, 1951.\n\nCitizenship & Immigration\nIndian Affairs, Education Branch,\n220 Queen St.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHerewith copy of an invoice for material ordered by Mr. R.F.

If such a requisition has been issued, kindly return the invoice and advise. If not, please obtain an original invoice and return with your requisition for payment.\n\nJ.B. Desrosiers,\nController of Purchases\nMarch 31, 1951.\n\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nCould you supply us with a list of the Indian Residential and Day Schools in Canada with their Post Office addresses?\n\nPerhaps this information may be available in one of the Department Annual Reports. On receipt of your advise we would be very pleased to remit any costs in connection with supplying this list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL SUPPLY LTD.\n\nManaging Director.\nApril 2, 1951.\n\nDept. of Education,\nToronto, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould you kindly forward me a copy of your latest textbook list approved for the Province.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 30, 1951.\n\nRe: Your 1-1-4 (26) March 28.\n\nI refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of above date concerning the purchase of Permanent Record Cards amounting to $100.00, plus freight, from the Text Book Branch of the Department of Education, Victoria. These were ordered by Mr. Davey following his visit to Ottawa in the Fall of 1949. He was under the impression that it was in order for him to secure these in the same way in which he has been securing Programmes of Studies, Standardized Tests and other similar printed material. This office regrets that some inconvenience has been caused to the Education Division and I wish to inform you that steps will be taken to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Unfortunately, before the receipt of your letter, Mr. Davey had ordered an additional thousand of these cards, the voucher for which you will now have received.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would inform this office as to whether or not Mr. Davey must discontinue his practice of securing Programmes of Studies, Tests, etc., direct from the Department of Education. If at all possible this office would like to continue the practice which has been observed in the past.\n\nAs requested, I am enclosing a copy of the Permanent Record Card. These are forms used by the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nW. S.

CREDITS\n\nREMINGTON RAND LIMITED\nApril 9, 1951.\n\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nThis refers to your letter of March 30th in connection with the local purchase of Permanent Record Cards and other supplies for the Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nThe Department fully realizes the difficulties encountered in ordering supplies and books through Ottawa and the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, as there is still a considerable delay from the time the order is placed and goods are delivered. However, the Stationery Act is a law passed by Parliament and designates that all purchases of books and stationery must be handled through the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. This Department is very fussy to see that this law is complied with.\n\nWe have occasions in this office when it would be in the Public interest to authorize local purchase of books and supplies but we are reluctant to do so for this very reason.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Davey requires Programmes of Studies; Standardized Tests etc., from time to time is appreciated. However, it is felt that a reasonable estimate of future requirements can be made and when ordered through the usual channels delivery can be assured within a reasonable time.\nIt is readily understood that from time to time there will be emergency cases where urgent action will be required. In such cases, the Department will be prepared to authorize local purchase. However, this office should be informed of the situation.\n\nWe are not trying to be disagreeable; however, we have the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to contend with and we are just afraid that if the local purchase system is abused and the Stationery Office should refuse to pay such accounts, we would be in a very embarrassing position. I am certain you will understand.\n\nWe are passing the account for the Record Cards to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery for payment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 9, 1951.\n\nMAKE CHEQUE PAYABLE AND SEND TO:\nDepartment of Education,\nText Book Branch,\nVictoria, B.C.,\n\nTo payment of 5000 Permanent Record Cards supplied for Indian Schools in B.C. $100.85\n\nOur Regional School Inspector in British Columbia required these Permanent Record Cards in July for immediate delivery prior to the opening of the 1950-51 academic year, in order that all records in all the British Columbia schools could be begun simultaneously. As these cards are standard for the Provincial schools in that area, it was decided to secure the cards from the Provincial Department of Education.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if the account was put through in the usual manner.\n**INFORMATION**\n\n**DATE**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| July | To Permanent record cards for use in Indian Schools in British Columbia, as per statement attached. | $100.00 |\n|      | Freight | $85.00 |\n\n**FOR USE BY INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT**\n\n- **Voucher No.:** 195  \n- **Date:** March 8, 1951  \n- **P.O.:** E.R.  \n- **Charge to Vote:** $146  \n- **Allot:** 12-415  \n- **Band Funds:**  \n- **Emergency Expenditure:**  \n- **Dept'l Letter File No.:**  \n- **Dept'l Cheque No.:**  \n\n**CERTIFICATE**\n\nI hereby certify that the material has been supplied, the work performed, that the charges are fair and just and the expenditure has been incurred on Government business.\n\nRecommended for payment.\n\nW.S.

Kernohan of Forest, Ontario, has written me again, making enquiry about his history of Canada maps that were purchased last year by your Department.\n\nHe wants to know if they were distributed in the Indian Schools and how they were received. I would gather from his letter that he is anxious to know if they were of any great value to your Department and if you required any more. At any rate I would appreciate a report on the value and success of these maps at an early date.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHugh MacKenzie,\nM.P. for Lambton-Kent.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nHistory Neary\nin memory\nfor 25 years\nfor have and\nperceived\nApril 9, 1951.\n\nMajor I.

We are unable to submit a requisition for text books as we do not know what books would be required for the different grades. It is suggested that you include the necessary books when the stationery order is being prepared for these schools.\n\nIn order that requisitions may be prepared for the remaining schools' requirements, would you please forward as soon as possible 50 requisition forms and 50 requisition forms for standard text books.\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSioux Lookout Agency\n\nEnc.\nApril 11, 1951.\n\nH.A.

The number of charts we obtained permitted us to supply all of these schools, and at the present time we do not require any more.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nApril 13, 1951.\n\nMr. W.S.

PHELAN\n\nRe: Department of Public Printing and Stationery Accounts for Fiscal Year 1950-51\n\nIn the Summer of 1949, the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, after a survey decided to secure a number of tabulating machines from the International Business Machines Company to handle all the office book-keeping, billing, invoicing, ordering etc. These machines were to replace most of the book-keeping and typewriting procedures carried out by office staff in the past.\n\nThese machines were installed on September 6th and all work carried out by hand was discontinued as all the work was to be done by the machines. The result was that there was a long delay in getting the organization going as the staff was not trained to handle the machines. Colonel Neary and I protested to officials of the Public Printing and Stationery urging them to process our requisitions except those for the schools with the International Business Machines Company machines processing ours in the old manner until the staff became acquainted with the new set up to bring our division under this new arrangement. The Stationery Branch, however, could not see our way and held our requisitions in abeyance until they had the organization completed.\n\nIn December, 1949, I telephoned the Pre-Edit Section of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery asking them when they would commence our requisitions only to be advised that the required cards had been received from the suppliers but did not fit the machines and were returned, resulting in further delay.\nFortunately all requisitions received prior to September 6th were processed by the old system and the schools received their supplies before school opening.\n\nIn January, 1950, we were beginning to get very many complaints from teachers and principals that supplies ordered after September for emergency reasons were not being delivered. Again, we took the matter up with the Stationery Office but were informed that they were revising the catalogue and nothing could be done until such time as the catalogue was prepared.\n\nWe then took the matter up with the Director of Services who agreed to our proposition to ship the requirements and attend to the billing when the catalogue, the required cards and billing sheets were ready. The Department of Public Printing and Stationery agreed that they would make shipments from the date of requisition and forward them to the Pre-Edit Section for billing. We were assured by the Stationery officials at that time that all shipments made prior to February 28th, 1950 would be billed before March 31 of that year. However, this was not done. The Stationery Office did not commence their billing for this branch until June, 1951, with the result that many of the shipments affected during December, January and February, 1950, when the residential schools were having their orders for the 1951-52 academic year requirements met were not billed until the Summer of 1951.\n\nWhen Mr. Dalton, present Chief of the Pre-Edit Section took over in October, 1950, there were 1200 of our filled requisitions on hand which had to go through the machines for billing purposes only as the shipments had been.\n\nThese outstanding billings have now been cleared up and today the Stationery has about sixty requisitions on hand which can be cleared in a week.\n\nTo summarize, on account of the delays encountered by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, we are obliged to pay from the 1950-51 vote for all supplies requisitioned during the period September 6, 1949 to March 2, 1951, a period of nineteen months. It might be in order\nto add that the months of December, January, February and March are the heaviest months as all the residential schools in the North and all British Columbia schools are obliged to order their supplies during these months. This arrangement was made for the convenience of the Stationery Office to avoid a last minute flood. This arrangement has caused us to pay for this heavy period twice out of one year's vote as the 1950-51 and 1951-52 requirements are billed on the 1950-51 vote.\n\nAttached, are extracts from the Auditor-General's reports showing the comparisons between expenditures for salaries and school supplies.\n\nI have worked out the figures in percentages and you will note that there was a steep decline in the figures for 1949-50 from the figures of 1948-49. This can mean only one thing, that many of the supplies requisitioned and shipped in 1950 were billed in 1951 for reasons already explained above.\n\nDuring the past few years Colonel Neary had found from inspection of schools and talking with school inspectors a need for a more concrete type of seatwork material and after considerable correspondence, dickering with publishers we were able to secure a reasonably priced duplicator and Duplicopy Workbooks from the Company of Canada. A copy of the book is $2.52. We had fifteen assorted titles of these books and they were distributed to all the schools at the rate of one book for every five pupils with a maximum of fifteen for the school. This amounted to a considerable expense.\n\nTo encourage better attendance in the day schools, it was decided to provide the day schools who had an average percentage of attendance of between 70.00% and 79.99% with 5 bonus library books; those with between 80.00% and 89.99% with ten bonus books and those with over 90% with fifteen bonus books.\nFor the fiscal year 1949-50 the Auditor General's report states that $139,085.93 was spent by this Branch for Printing and Stationery Accounts.

MILLAN\n\nRe: Department of Public Printing and Stationery\nAccounts for Fiscal Year 1950-51\n\nIn the Summer of 1949, the Department of Public Printing and Stationery after a survey decided to secure a number of tabulating machines from the International Business Machines Company to handle all the office book-keeping, billing, invoicing, ordering etc. These machines were to replace most of the book-keeping and typewriting procedures carried out by office staff in the past.\n\nThese machines were installed on September 6th and all work carried out by hand was discontinued as all the work was to be done by the machines. The result was that there was a long delay in getting the organization going as the staff was not trained to handle the machines. Colonel Neary and I protested to officials of the Public Printing and Stationery urging them to process all the requisitions except those for the schools with the International Business Machines Company machines processing ours in the old manner and when the staff became acquainted with the new set up to bring our division under this new arrangement. The Stationery Branch, however could not see our way and held our requisitions in abeyance until they had the organization completed.\n\nIn December, 1949, I telephoned the Pre-Edit Section of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery asking them when they would commence our requisitions only to be advised that the required cards had been received from the suppliers but did not fit the machines and were returned, resulting in further delay.\nFortunately all requisitions received prior to September 6th were processed by the old system and the schools received their supplies before school opening.\n\nIn January, 1950, we were beginning to get very many complaints from teachers and principals that supplies ordered after September for emergency reasons were not being delivered. Again, we took the matter up with the Stationery Office but were informed that they were revising the catalogue and nothing could be done until such time as the catalogue was prepared.\n\nWe then took the matter up with the Director of Services who agreed to our proposition to ship the requirements and attend to the billing when the catalogue, the required cards and billing sheet were ready. The Department of Public Printing and Stationery agreed that they would make shipments from copies of the requisition and forward them to the Pre-Edit Section for billing. We were assured by the Stationery officials at that time that all shipments made prior to February 28th, 1950 would be billed before March 31 of that year. However, this was not done. The Stationery Office did not commence their billing for this Branch until June, 1951, with the result that many of the shipments affected during December, January and February, 1950, when the residential schools were having their orders for the 1951-52 academic year requirements met were not billed until the Summer of 1951.\n\nWhen Mr. Dalton, present Chief of the Pre-Edit Section took over in October, 1950, there were 1200 of our filled requisitions on hand which had to go through the machines for billing purposes only as the shipments had been made.\n\nThese outstanding billings have now been cleared up and today the Stationery has about sixty requisitions on hand which can be cleared in a week.\n\nTo summarize, on account of the delays encountered by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, we are obliged to pay from the 1950-51 vote for all supplies requisitioned during the period September 6, 1949 to March 2, 1951, a period of nineteen months. It might be in order\nto add that the months of December, January, February and March are the heaviest months as all the residential schools in the North and all British Columbia schools are obliged to order their supplies during these months. This arrangement was made for the convenience of the Stationery Office to avoid a last minute flood. This arrangement has caused us to pay for this heavy period twice out of one year's vote as the 1950-51 and 1951-52 requirements are billed on the 1950-51 vote.\n\nAttached, are extracts from the Auditor-General's reports showing the comparisons between expenditures for salaries and school supplies.\n\nI have worked out the figures in percentages and you will note that there was a steep decline in the figures for 1949-50 from the figures of 1948-49. This can mean only one thing, that many of the supplies requisitioned and shipped in 1950 were billed in 1951 for reasons already explained above.\n\nDuring the past few years Colonel Neary had found from inspection of schools and talking with school inspectors a need for a more concrete type of seatwork material and after considerable correspondence, dickering with publishers we were able to secure a reasonably priced duplicator and Duplicopy Workbooks from Ditte Company of Canada. A copy of the book is $2.52. We had fifteen assorted titles of these books and they were distributed to all the schools at the rate of one book for every five pupils with a maximum of fifteen for the school. This amounted to a considerable expense.\n\nTo encourage better attendance in the day schools, it was decided to provide the day schools who had an average percentage of attendance of between 70.00% and 79.99% with 5 bonus library books; those with between 80.00% and 89.99% with ten bonus books and those with over 90% with fifteen bonus books.\nFor the fiscal year 1949-50 the Auditor General's report states that $139,085.93 was spent by this Branch for Printing and Stationery Accounts. In view of the fact that for 1950-51, we are billed for nineteen months, eight of which are the heaviest months; the additional seatwork books and bonus books provided; the higher cost of books in general and the new day and residential schools opened to which supplies were sent amounted to a considerably higher expenditure than previous years.\n\nM.F.

This represents a saving to the consumer of up to 15.3% for what is to be exactly the same product\u2014a children's book with sewn sheets and sturdy laminated and washable binding with full color illustrations on a high quality paper. There will be no economies in manufacture because of the price change.\n\nA spokesman for the company gives as the principal reasons for this step, in spite of an opposite trend in prices, \"the company's hope that it will make these books, which have been praised by parents, child authorities and child educators throughout Canada, available to an even greater number of children than before by bringing them into an even lower price range. Hundreds of thousands of the published titles are already in the possession of Canadian children, and with several new titles introduced every month it is anticipated that thousands of additional children will be able to enjoy them.\"\n\nIt was pointed out also, that Wonder Books are made possible at this low price because of the already enthusiastic response in Canada and, because it is possible to print them in huge runs of up to a million copies.\n\nATTENTION\u2014BUYER\u2014\n\nWOULD YOU KINDLY SEND US A COUNT (NUMBER OF BOOKS ONLY) OF YOUR WONDER BOOK STOCK PURCHASED FROM GEORGE J.

It is too early to advise you of our success during mild weather but as advised in our above-noted letter this chemical did not prove out during winter. If you wish, I could let you know how this works out for the next thirty days or so.

The question in my mind at the moment is what material can we line the boxes with that will withstand the chemical itself.\n\nT. L.

FOR ECONOMY\n\nAsk ten different maintenance engineers, building Superintendents, and actual maintenance men how to clean and polish a given floor and, likely you will get ten different answers.\n\nThe following suggestions and information are based on more than 50 years manufacturing and maintenance experience, and to the best of our knowledge, covers the requirements of institutions, keeping in mind... ease of application... beauty of the floor, itself... the economy of using good materials in the proper manner.\n\nTHE CORRECT TYPE OF FLOOR WAX TO USE ON....\n\nCork Flooring .................................................. Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nComposition Floors ............................................ Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\nHardwood Floors ............................................... Buckeye Paste Wax\nLinoleums, all types .......................................... Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax\nMastic or Asphalt Tile ....................................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nPainted Cement Floors ...................................... Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax\nRubber Tile Flooring ......................................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\nTerrazzo Floors .................................................. Buckeye Self-Shine Wax\nTile Flooring ..................................................... Buckeye Self-Shine Wax ONLY\n\nO.C.L.\nBRAND\nINFORMATION ON\nBUCKEYE PASTE WAX and\nBUCKEYE CLEANING and POLISHING WAX\n\nThese two waxes are the original types of wax polish. They contain various kinds of waxes blended together with solvents of naphtha, turpentine, benzine, or mineral spirit type. They contain more wax solids than so-called \"water emulsion\" or \"no rubbing\" type of wax, and actually are less expensive in the long run than \"water emulsion\" wax.\n\nHowever, from the standpoint of time and labour, these waxes are more expensive since they require longer to polish.\n\nCleaning and Polishing Spirit Wax is merely Buckeye Paste Wax thinned out with an excellent cleaning agent.\n\nUse Buckeye Paste Wax or Cleaning & Polishing Wax on hardwood floors for better results.\n\nBuckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax can be used also, on all types of linoleums, but is not recommended where there is extremely heavy and dirty traffic. However, it does give the finest finish of any wax, but is a little more difficult to maintain.\n\nHOW TO APPLY BUCKEYE PASTE and BUCKEYE CLEANING & POLISHING WAXES:\n\nIn applying Paste Wax, a thin, even coat is the secret of good waxing.\n\nWood floors should be WAXED ACROSS THE GRAIN and POLISHED WITH THE GRAIN.\n\nAllow about five minutes to dry and polish with a soft, clean cloth...a weighted brush...or an electric polisher.\n\nOne advantage of Buckeye Cleaning & Polishing Wax is that it cleans and polishes at the same time...can be applied faster than Paste Wax, and is fairly easy to apply.\n\nIt also makes an outstanding polish for furniture and woodwork of any colour.\n\nDo not use either one of the above waxes on composition floors...mastic or asphalt tile, or rubber flooring.\n\nThe solvents contained in these types of waxes sometimes take out the colours, and actually will dissolve mastic or asphalt tile.\n\nGLEEMAL\nEASES CLEANING PROBLEMS\nA Concentrated All Purpose Cleanser\nDissolves Dirt - Free Rinsing Creates Freshness\n\nFOR WASHING\nWalls - Ceilings - Painted Woodwork - Floors (wood)\nTerrazzo - Linoleum - Rubber Composition\nFixtures, Kitchen Equipment, Wash Basins, Sinks, Toilet Bowls, etc.\nINFORMATION ON\nBUCKEYE SELF-SHINE WAX\n\nIn addition to \"Self-Shine\" this product answers variously to the names: \"No Buff,\" \"Self-Polishing,\" \"Water Emulsion,\" and \"Water Wax.\" It is, basically, a blend of waxes and shellac dispersed in a solution of water and colloidal soap.\n\nAfter application, the water evaporates, depositing the minute particles of wax in a uniform film. These tiny particles reflect light and give a glossy, lustrous sheen without rubbing or buffing.\n\nWalking over, sweeping, and mopping a floor coated with Self-Shine Wax all tend to burnish and increase the gloss. Some users prefer to buff Self-Shine to achieve the maximum lustre right away... this can be done with a weighted brush or an electric polisher.\n\nSelf-Shine enables one man to wax and polish double or more the floor area than he could by the old method. It also eliminates fire hazards, bad odours\u2014common to paste or liquid waxes.\n\nCovers from 3600 to 5400 square feet per gallon, depending upon porosity of the surface and variations in application.\n\nDries non-tacky in about twenty minutes unless there is exceptional humidity or poor ventilation.\n\nSelf-Shine Wax is waterproof when thoroughly dry. This permits mopping with cold water without removing the wax. It also explains resistance to spilled liquids, rain, etc.\n\nIt can be removed with warm water and our neutral soap Perfection or Terrazine Floor Soap.\n\nIt is recommended particularly for linoleum of all kinds, rubber tile, cork flooring, composition floors, mastic or asphalt tile, and any floors which have a tightly sealed surface, such as terrazzo, tile or painted cement floors.\n\nHOW TO APPLY\nBUCKEYE SELF-SHINE WAX\n\nSelf-Shine Wax should be FLOWED on the floor in a thin, even film, using a suitable applicator.\n\nIt should NOT BE RUBBED IN like Paste Wax and Cleaning and Polishing Wax.\n\nLevel the wax out, then leave it! Going back over the wax after the two or three minutes it takes to set, may cause streakiness.\n\nPouring a small quantity of the wax on the floor and spreading it out, may be satisfactory for a small floor, but an open container in which you can dip the applicator is better for large areas.\n\nThe wax should be applied in straight sweeps running the same way not in a circular motion.\n\nAllow to dry for about 20 minutes... longer on humid days.\n\nIf buffing is intended, use a clean, soft cloth under a weighted brush, or an electric floor polisher. This method gives an excellent floor that will withstand heavy traffic.\n\nCAUTION!\n\nIf any floor on which Buckeye Self-Shine Wax appears slippery, it is a sign that too much wax is being used.\n\nBuckeye Self-Shine Wax has been passed by the Underwriter's Laboratories as being \"ANTI-SLIP MATERIAL,\" but even with this guarantee, it is advisable where floors have a tendency to be slippery, to thin out the material from 10 to 15% with cold water. Each maintenance man can gauge the amount of water to be added for each type of flooring.\n\nOn terrazzo, painted cement floors or red tile, thin out the wax with water up to 40 or 50%.\n| Product                  | Description                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Steribac Sterilizer     | \"A Cationic Disinfectant\" Odorless, Non-Inflammable, Non-Volatile, Non-Irritating, Non-Corrosive |\n| Hi-Test 15              | Powdered Chlorine Disinfectant and Sterilizer A Chlorine Sanitizing Agent For Use As Germicide - Bactericide - Deodorant Stain Remover - Disinfectant Guaranteed: Available Chlorine 15% |\n| Tri-Versal Sterilizer   | Bactericide - Deodorant Disinfectant - Cleaner Guaranteed available Chlorine 12% Has only a faint chlorine odor |\n| Destrol                 | White Tar Acid Disinfectant FOR FLOOR CLEANING For disinfecting urinals, lavatories, and all surfaces where there may be bacteria germs or bad odours, use \u00bd to \u00be cupful to an average pail of water, or about 2 fluid ozs. per gal. of water |\n| Pineoleum Disinfectant  | A High Quality Pine Odour Disinfectant For countering foul odours, and stale air, when sprayed in Hospitals, Sick Rooms, Hotels, Theatres, Public Buildings and Churches |\n| Washing Agent           | UNEXCELLED FOR CLEANING Chinaware, Glassware, Tumblers, Baking Utensils, Etc.

In a simple straightforward fashion, they present the basic outline of Canada's government, history, geography, resources, etc.\n\n\"The Canadian Scene\" was produced by our Branch at the request of the Canadian Education Association for use as a textbook in citizenship classes. The first five sections of this booklet are written in basic English and make it a valuable aid in classes where English is being taught.\n\nI feel certain that if your Branch would like to use these publications in its educational work, an arrangement could be made to place them at your disposal.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank Foulds,\nDirector.\n\nJC/GB\nMay 28, 1951.\n\nMaple Leaf Plastics,\n703 Bloor St. West,\nToronto 4, Ont.,\n\nDear Mr. Dansons,\n\nI have your letter of May 24th quoting a price of $2.90 a dozen for plastic cups.\n\nPlease be informed that we are asking our Departmental Purchasing Agent to secure three hundred dozen of these cups.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nMay 28, 1951.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Indian Schools in Canada.\n\nVOTE 532 PRIMARY 16-415 OBJECT DATE REQUIRED\n\nSHIP TO Mr. Philip Phelan, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, 187 Slater St., Ottawa.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 3000     |            |       |\n\nQuotation from:\nMaple Leaf Plastics Ltd., from whom plastic cups were purchased in the past.

It would be appreciated if you would forward me a sample copy of each together with information on their grading, prices and whether the whole series or any part of it has been authorized in any of the provinces.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 28, 1951.\n\nMr. H.G. Mingay,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nMarkham, Ont.,\n\nDear Mr. Mingay:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 24th, I am sending the foolscap and ordering the letter cards for the Spanish River Indian Day School.\n\nYour comments on the biscuits have been noted.\n\nIn connection with your inquiry for black dressing for blackboards, I presume you are referring to blackboard paint, which we have been providing for a number of years. As a matter of fact, we would rather provide the paint and have the blackboards resurfaced rather than purchase new blackboards.\n\nWith reference to the activity table, I cannot promise it now. However, I hope to have this matter discussed fully at the Inspectors meeting in Ottawa when a definite decision should be reached. In the meantime, would you keep the name of this school in mind and I shall discuss it with you on return to Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Mike,\n\nHow is the battle going anyway. Thanks for the brief case.\n\nIt is quite a help.\n\nMost of the schools in this area are getting too many biscuits. Mr. Lawrence the agent spoke to me about it and I see quite a holdover in most schools. I thought you might like to know. Serpent River, Sagamook and Spanish River C of E. are some of the places I have in mind. Garden River does not want any biscuits shipped this fall. Mr. Supt. Lawrence asked me to tell you that, both schools.\n\nCan you send right away to Mrs. D. Dewdney, Spanish River, C of E School, MASSEY, ONT., a package of Foolscap ruled about 500 sheets and about six boxes of letter cards for grade one.\n\nThen while you are at it you could ship to this school an activity table with six chairs. She is using one she got from the R.C. school and they want it back. But do try to send those number cards at once.\n\nMost of the schools seem very well supplied. In some cases too well. By the way do you stock a black dressing for blackboards. Most of the agents could do with a little of it for their schools.\n\nWhen you write to me tell me what the score is on that.\n\nBest regards,\n\nH.G. Mingay.\n| CITY | CLASS | PRO. | ITEM | DEP. | INST. | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|--------|\n|      |       |      |      |      |       | 4.20   |\n\n**DELIVER TO INDIAN AFFAIR BRANCH**\n\nRoom 407 Copeland Bldg.\n\nKent & Albert St\n\nOTTAWA\n\nNo receipt will be recognized by us other than the official receipt issued by the Company.

It is noted that the yearly subscription fee is nominal, but it is felt that our teachers should subscribe from their personal funds.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have made arrangements with the Department of Education, Province of Manitoba, to have the provincial curricula sent to all the Indian Schools of this Province.\n\nI believe that the teachers should also get the monthly magazine \"Manitoba School Journal\", as this magazine contains much current information regarding the programme of studies for the Province. This will cost one dollar a year for the subscription. May I have the authority to subscribe for the magazine for all the teachers of Indian Schools in this Province.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. H.

Please forgive the delay in sending this display, but until very recently, I have been travelling almost continually.\n\nIn preparing this small but select display, I have tried to keep in mind the limitations you mentioned to me. Most of the books have a relatively mature interest level but limited vocabulary. There are no fairy tales or classics. Emphasis has been placed on outdoor life and crafts. Finally, I have tried to limit the price range to $2.75 retail, although in a few cases there are prices above this level. Incidentally, as you know, the prices indicated are subject to a 20% discount on your order.\n\nYou will find the attached list duplicated inside the carton of books. Where the book(s) represents a series, I have indicated the other available titles.\n\nWe are hoping to hear from you when you have had an opportunity to examine these books.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nS.

Brock\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 14/31 I wish to advise that it has been ascertained that the proper volumes of the Encyclopaedia were supplied in all cases. While it would appear from the billings that Volume 1 was supplied in error in these instances, these seeming discrepancies were due to a mechanical error in our Division. As 18 spaces only are allotted to description on our punch cards the second digit of Volumes 12, 13 and 14 did not appear on our billings due to this error. However as stated above the correct volumes were forwarded to the schools.\n\nWith reference to the charges against W.C. Brushes #5, the necessary credits will be issued to offset these overcharges and will appear in your May accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Dalton,\nfor O.R. Robert,\nMechanical Accounting Div.\n\nJD/bp\nIndian School Bulletin\nIndian Education\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn reply to the request for opinions on the library books, I would like to let you know that both my pupils and I are delighted with the Wonder Books and the Little Golden Books.\n\nThe story appeal is excellent. Odd stories are given adequate attention and there are charming new stories such as the Sky Little Horse and The Pisky Puppy. Imaginative stories about animals are valuable in teaching the children to be kind to animals. However, I thought that more realistic stories about other peoples and places could be included.\n\nThe children were not only interested in hearing the stories read or told, but showed a lively eagerness...\nto read and re-read themselves. At first only a few were interested but as the year went on they all developed more interest.\n\nThe beautiful illustrations were an important factor in the children's increased desire to read. Many of the books have large illustrations that tell stories themselves. Many children asked about the pictures, they begged to have the stories read or tried to read them themselves. The pictures aroused curiosity, amply illustrate the stories and many unknown ideas to the children and stimulate conversation and language about the stories and characters. In fact, the children said \"the pictures are the best part.\" Many lively imaginative drawings of the children's personal interpretations resulted from viewing the drawings.\n\nThe books held up very well in the classroom and I both felt the exterior and interior material pleasing and practical.\nRegarding the vocabulary. On the whole it is excellent, but often a little difficult for my pupils, who are all about one year behind in reading. However, it is a good vocabulary for story-telling and language lessons, as it gives them a chance to become familiar with the words and widen their vocabulary.\n\nI find the books excellent teaching material for language, pre-reading, reading, picture study, number work, social studies and other lessons. The pictures are clear and attractive, the language simple enough, and the stories very appealing and illustrate good behaviour.\n\nAlthough I feel I still have too little experience to be really sure, I would like to recommend that some of the books, recommended as supplementary reading in the Guide Book to the Basic Readers, be chosen. I feel the children need more reading with a vocabulary that is in a line with their readers. I could\nalso use for poor readers more easy reading.\n\nIn the Teacher's Catalogue published by Educational Publishing Co., I find Books for Retarded Children advertised on page 41. They cost 30\u00a2 ea. and I thought they might be very useful.\n\nI would also like to see more easy reading about people of other nationalities and professions such as \"The Two Little Miners.\"\n\nJoe and Ruth are great favourites with all grades 1 to 5. Couldn't the book after Joe & Ruth be supplied?\n\nHope my letter is not too late.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEdna Kibby\nJuly 24th, 1951\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nThank you for your letter of July 20th. We do appreciate the fact that these books have been published for some time and that the quantities are large and the reading programmes have changed.\n\nI think I know you well enough to be frank with you and to feel that you would be the same with me, so if the very special price given below is not right, let me know and we will do our best to bring it more in line with what you have in mind.\n\nThere are 4,568 copies of \"Joe and Ruth Go To School\" and we should like to get 15\u00a2 each for these. There are 2,470 copies of \"Joe and Ruth Workbooks\" and we should be glad to let these go at 10\u00a2 each.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. J. BURRAGE\nJuly 20, 1951.\n\nMr. C. J. Eustace,\nJ.M.Dent & Sons (Canada) Limited,\nPublishers, 224 Bloor Street West,\nToronto 5,\nCanada.\n\nMy dear Chris,\n\nI have your letter of July 4th concerning your present stock of \"Joe and Ruth Go To School\" and \"Joe and Ruth Work Books\".\n\nThe quantities are quite large and for some time now we have been using the basic readers which are in use in most provinces. I doubt if we could depart from this practice very easily. I have discussed the matter with our Inspectors and I think possibly we could use the main book as a supplementary reader. The workbook, however, would be pretty difficult for us to use in any class.\n\nHowever, as the books were prepared for our Department, we would consider taking the whole quantity off your hands if we received a very special price. You mentioned you were willing to make a special offer and I shall be glad to consider it when it comes to hand.\n\nI do appreciate all your kind wishes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nHGM:GFB\nJuly 5th, 1951\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Phil,\n\nWe were going over our stock of books and we find that we have about 4,800 copies of \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" and about 2,400 copies of the Joe and Ruth Workbook.\n\nThese were prepared especially for the Department of Indian Affairs, as you know, and we have no sale for them outside the Department. \"Joe and Ruth Go to School\" could still be a useful supplementary reading text for Indian children who are beginning to read, and the Joe and Ruth Workbook supplies interesting seat-work and can be used with the primer.\n\nWe shall be pleased to make you a special price on this whole quantity of books to clear them out, if you are interested.\n\nIt seems to be some time since I have seen you, and honours appear to have been coming your way since then and I do congratulate you most heartily on them all. They are well deserved.\n\nWith all kind wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. Bustage\nJuly 26, 1951.\n\nMr. C. J. Eustace,\nJ.M.Dent & Sons (Canada) Limited,\nPublishers, 224 Bloor Street West,\nTORONTO 5,\nCanada.\n\nMy dear Chris,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 24th I may say that I am afraid we did not expect to pay so much as that for these books. It will be difficult for us to use them and they will have to be worked into the programme gradually. We are prepared, however, to take the total amount off your hands for a lump sum of $300.00.\n\nI do not want to bargain too sharply but I have to bear in mind that they will remain in stationary stores for some time and that the money will be tied up in these books for several years.

SMYTHE\n\nWhile this is the exciting chronicle of a famous professional mountain climber, it is also by a man who knows how to write and how to bring his subject alive. It is the product of a distinguished mind.\n\nMountaineering and exploration in the remote parts of the Canadian Rockies composed Frank Smythe's last adventure before his death at the base of the Himalayas. Two summers and an entire winter spent in climbing provided \"this most famous of modern mountaineers\" with the richest of materials for this book. The same quick sense, the power of graphic description, the enthusiasm of the mountaineer, and the appreciation of every sort of natural beauty that characterized The Valley of Flowers are all here as Frank Smythe tells of his experience.\n\nThe book tells of personal experiences, personal feelings; of the great mountain ascents and untrodden summits; of the spirit of this wild and lonely country of the Canadian North West. Illustrated by the pick of over two thousand photographs, this is truly a beautiful book, and will be a lasting memorial to the most famous of modern mountaineers.\n\nORDER FORM\n\nPlease send me ___ copies of:\nCLIMBS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES.\nBy Frank S.

After hearing tall tales and get-rich-quick stories, they made up their minds that they were going to spend at least one season as boatmen in California.\n\nThey combed the beaches and tide flats near Tacoma for suitable vessels. They found one, and for well over a year they worked day and night on the weather-worn hulk, patching, repairing, replacing, shoring, fabricating and creating a staging boat. $3.00\n\nLAIRD'S CHOICE.\nBy Rosamond Marshall, best-selling author of \"Kitty\", Duchess Hotspur\" and \"Celeste\". $4.00\n\nTHE SOUTHWEST CORNER.\nBy Mildred Walker. $2.75\n\nTHE PROPER GODS.\nBy Virginia Sorensen. $3.75\n\nTHE WITCH-DIGGERS.\nBy Jessamyn West. $4.00\n\nTHE SALT BOX.\nBy Ian Hilliard. $4.00\n\nIt's the A to Z of youthful charm, poise and beauty\n\nBETTY CORNELL'S GLAMOUR GUIDE FOR TEENS $5.25\n\nA TREASURY OF BASEBALL HUMOR.\nEdited by Dave Stanley. $4.00\n\nLAUGHTER IS LEGAL.\nBy Francis L.

'30/31.\n\nThe Editor,\nIndian School Bulletin,\nEduc. Div., Indian Affairs B.C.,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I came to Little Pine Day School in 1947, there were practically no supplementary reading books for the thirty to forty children. This fall I brought the list of library books up to number one hundred and eighty-eight, thanks to our Education Division.\n\nLittle Pine Children have taken very good care of their Library Books. Very few have been torn, and almost none written in, though \"a story book in every desk\" (from grade one up) is our custom.\nI teach the juniors, and notice they do enjoy animal stories and stories of children, even city children. Short stories in larger print are enjoyed more than longer ones as they read them faster and feel they have accomplished something easily. They love the brighter pictures, funny ones and ones of birds, animals etc., which they already know. Being observant, they often dive into their desk for a story-book illustration relative to some lesson or discussion.\n\nMy children like poetry but find it difficult to read to themselves.\n\nThe seniors enjoy stories a grade or two below their school grade in difficulty. Books with small print, or long stories are avoided, I think, because the children feel they are too difficult. The teacher needs\n3. To read aloud the first chapter or two to arouse interest, and let the children read on for themselves. I find the juniors rather like trying to read books above their grade and they often learn many new words in this way.\n\nI found seniors interested in the \"Funny Book\" type of classics such as Lorna Doone, Uncle Tom's Cabin etc., which I'm sure would never be read in the original. I think it is our duty as teachers to fill the children's minds with as many stories and poems as she can, and awaken their interest in and enjoyment of reading that it will become a life-time habit and we hope, may lead to further self-improvement. The Education Division is building up fine libraries for these children who are learning to love to read.\n\nYours truly, Margaret R. Sprague.\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakwa, British Columbia,\nSeptember 10, 1951.\n\nThe Editor of the INDIAN SCHOOL BULLETIN,\nThe Education Division,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Editor:\n\nIt was kind of you to ask us to state the reaction of the library books sent to us and how they fare under actual conditions. May I be permitted to make several suggestions?\n\n1. Story Appeal\n   A. The primary grades; The books you sent appeal very much to them. You have sent a variety of kinds for which the teachers are grateful. We hope you continue to do the same.\n   B. Intermediate and senior boys have taken more to the animal stories and Mother West Wind Stories than to the others so far. Their reading tastes must be widened and increased.\n   C. The intermediate and senior girls are attracted to the Teen-Age type. They prefer fiction.\n\n2. Interest to young Indian children.\n   A. Artistic appeal. They prefer colourful and illustrated books. Some of the books you sent have great artistic appeal. The reference books should have artistic appeal as the children acquire more from pictures than from reading.\n   B. Some of the books have teaching value.\n\n3. Illustrations; On the whole, the illustrations are good. In the primary books most illustrations are excellent. In the smaller grades the pictures are really quite and attract the children's eyes. Even the little ones learn more from illustrations than from the story as their background is so limited.\n\n4. Make up or Format\n   A. Utility in classroom - Yes.\n   B. Binding - Poor in the smaller grades. After the children use the books a few times, it begins to come apart.\n   C. Quality of paper - On the whole, good. The paper does not tear too readily and wears quite well on primary books.\n   D. Cover Stock - Washable covers ideal.\n   E. Size and quality of type and printing - Primary books could be larger.\n\n5. Vocabulary; Would like it simpler, if possible, for primary grades.\n\n6. Special features; Thanks to the Department for making it possible for the senior classrooms to obtain the more expensive Encyclopedia and the Book of Knowledge. The students really like them and do acquire much from the pictures.\n\nA. Classics; A colourful set of well-illustrated and well-written classics for grade school children would be ideal.\n\nB. Would there be any possibility of obtaining Cadmus books? The Cadmus publishers are specializing in children's books; making them more attractive, printing and writing them in size, quality, illustrations, printing, format, and vocabulary as ideally as they consider possible in children's books. Their prices are below the average. All their books are classified.\n\nAddress: Cadmus Books\nE. M. Hale and Company\nKenosha, Wisconsin\n\n(I am writing and asking them to send you the latest Cadmus Book List for you to peruse.)\nC. We would appreciate being allowed to choose a few Catholic books each year as some excellent books are now being published by the Catholic Authors 4-Sight Edition.\n\nTheir address: Catholic Authors\n1201 S. Lindbergh Blvd.\nKirkwood 22, Mo.\n\n(I am asking the above to send you their reference books of the 4-Sight Edition of Catholic Authors for your study.)\n\nWe teachers would like to have the Department continue to supply a large variety of books. The older students are poor in reading. A large variety enables each of them to select some books they like. So far we have tried to procure most of the reference books which are excellent. In the senior grades our fiction group is small yet.\n\nIn the last few years the Department has made such rapid improvements in assisting schools in both supplies and library books that I want to voice the thanks of the other teachers and myself. We can now plan on having adequate libraries for our Indian schools. This little note of appreciation from the other end is for your encouragement to let you know that we are grateful and thankful for your efforts in building up our Indian school system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSister M.

The rest of the schools are to order theirs by May 31st.\n\nThis procedure appears to have worked out satisfactorily, however, your comments would be appreciated.\n\nActually we are somewhat concerned with the format of the requisition forms and would appreciate your comments.\nWe have three sets of requisition forms. On these requisition forms are listed books and supplies which are stocked.\n\nWe are obliged by law to secure all books and supplies through the Stationery Office of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. They either stock our requirements or place the orders with the School Book Branches, publishers and School Book Suppliers.\n\nThe three lists are as follows (copies are attached):\n\n(a) Standard School Supplies - Stationery\n(b) Standard Text Books\n(c) Supplementary to Standard School Supplies\n\nThe first two are sent out with the Indian School Bulletin to all day and residential schools. The third is not sent out at all. However, if a teacher requests items included on this third list and all concerned are satisfied that the request is justified, the request is met.\n\nWe are drafting a new format for these requisition lists and feel that some of the items listed on list (a) can be dropped and placed on list (c) without jeopardizing the operation of the schools. There may be other changes you may feel to be necessary.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if you would review these lists and let us have your comments as soon as possible as it is necessary for us to send these forms to the printers shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl:\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\nSept. 11, 1951.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your recent order for the undernoted material.\n\nSocial Studies in Grade 9 .10\nIndustrial Arts for 7,8,9 free\nHome Economics for 7,8,9 .25\nRegulations and Bulletin 1A,1B,1C,1D,1E,1F,1G,1H,1I,1J,1K,1L,1M,1N,1O,1P,1Q,1R,1S,1T,1U,1V,1W,1X,1Y,1Z,2A,2B,2C,2D,2E,2F,2G,2H,2I,2J,2K,2L,2M,2N,2O,2P,2Q,2R,2S,2T,2U,2V,2W,2X,2Y,2Z,3A,3B,3C,3D,3E,3F,3G,3H,3I,3J,3K,3L,3M,3N,3O,3P,3Q,3R,3S,3T,3U,3V,3W,3X,3Y,3Z,4A,4B,4C,4D,4E,4F,4G,4H,4I,4J,4K,4L,4M,4N,4O,4P,4Q,4R,4S,4T,4U,4V,4W,4X,4Y,4Z,5A,5B,6,7,8 and 10 free\nFour-Credit Program in Technical Electives Free\nVocational Agriculture Free\nSchool Act with Amendments .50\nGeneral Information-Correspondence Branch Free\n\nSince the Department is not authorized to issue forms and bulletins on credit, and since it is too expensive for you to have us send goods C.O.D., it will be necessary for you to forward a remittance amounting to $2.55 before it is permissible for us to send the material ordered to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.

My experience with Indian Schools is as yet limited but I have had considerable experience in the setting up of forms of this nature. For the sake of clarity I am giving you my suggestions under a few sub-titles.\n\n1. Printing.\nInstead of using a mimeograph or offset process have the form printed in 7 pts type. The small type with bold face titles will enable you to save paper. This can only be done, I realize, if a large quantity is to be printed.\n\n2. Nomenclature.\nI would recommend the placing of the substantive first, followed by qualifying words & Tape, adhesive paper transparent (rolls) rather than rolls Transparent adhesive Paper Tape.\n\n3. Arrangement.\nIf (2) above is followed all items on the lists could be arranged alphabetically. This I consider an important point both as it affects the teacher and the clerk who fills the order. Items should be listed in alphabetical order.\n\n4. Format and General Arrangement.\nThe breakdown in your other forms are apparently as follows:\n   A - Standard Expendable Supplies\n   B - Textbooks\n   C - Supplementary Classroom Equipment\n\nIn order to expedite handling I would recommend a general rearrangement as per Appendix A.\n\nIn order to prevent waste and over or under ordering I would suggest that your order form be used as an inventory. This could be done by having two spaces beside each article headed ON HAND REQUIRED.\n\ncontinued.\nThe date the form is to be completed should be printed on the form.\n\nAt the bottom of the form should be a detachable slip to be signed by the teacher and posted to the Regional School Inspector where the form has been filled in and mailed to the Superintendent. This would give the Inspector a chance to check supply orders and prevent to some extent, a flood of late orders in September.\n\nL.G. F.

At the present time there are apparently five forms in all, consisting of four mimeographed sheets - Stationery, Standard Text Books, Books to be secured from the Departments of Education, and a supplementary form to Standard School Supplies - Stationery, also printed Form I.A.413. I believe this number could be reduced by omitting the supplementary form for Standard School Supplies and by the placing of certain items from this form on the regular sheet headed \"Standard School Supplies - Stationery\". The complexity of the last named form could be reduced by deleting certain items from this sheet. The deletions that I would suggest are as follows:\n\n- 4214 Pencils (checking Blue)\n- 4231 Erasers (Ink)\n- 4271 Boxes Pen Nibs (fine)\n- 4076 Pkts. Ink Powder, Red Qt.\n- 1807 Blank Drawing Books #1, 6 x 9\n- 1808 Blank Drawing Books #2, 9 x 12\n- 1812 Loose Leaf Note Books #2933 (Gr. 9 and upwards)\n- 3168 Scratch Pads #6 (8 x 10) ruled\n- 1865 Pkts. Interlined Paper\n\nUnder \"Exercise Books\", the present scribbler \"C\" would be satisfactory for all purposes if it included more pages.\n\nI would also suggest that the following items be placed on this form from the supplementary sheet to Standard School Supplies; those items listed from\nCardboard, 22 x 28, to Creped Paper, with the deletion of the Conductor's Punch and the Cardboard 11 x 14. The items listed below should also be transferred:\n\nIndian Ink, Black\nManila Tag 9 x 12 and 18 x 24\nMathematical Sets,\nNeedles, sewing and raffia\nPaste Par Out (one color only)\nPins No. 4\nReinforcement Rings No. 2\nSewing Cards,\nSpeedball Pens --- and the items on the back of the sheet, with the exception of Tracing Paper and Water Color Refills, which may be deleted.\n\nThe other items on the supplementary list are of a permanent nature and I would suggest that these could be ordered on Form I.A.413. In order that teachers may know that the Department will supply this type of equipment, I would suggest that once a year items of permanent equipment such as contained in the supplementary list be itemized in the bulletin.\n\nIf the numbers which precede the items listed on these requisition forms are not essential, I would suggest that they be deleted, since they have no meaning to the teachers.\n\nMay I also suggest that on one of the forms items be included for school requisitions, monthly report forms and pupils report forms. I have noted that teachers have in many cases omitted to requisition for these items.\n\nI would suggest that more copies be supplied to Superintendents and to teachers than those normally attached to the bulletin. Frequently, after a change of teachers, it is found that supplementary requisitions are required and the forms attached to the bulletin have usually been used by the preceding teacher.\n\nThis office greatly appreciates the very considerable improvement that there has been in the last three years in the delivery of texts and supplies. I also appreciate the very fine selection of library books now being offered by the Department to our schools. This is particularly true concerning the primary grades and I would suggest that special attention now be given to the Intermediate and Junior High School levels.\n\nW. S.

It is almost unbelievably resistant to abrasion, chipping or charring. It has other special advantages, too. Look inside for information on how easy it is to care for this new-type dinnerware. It gives excellent results and practically endless useful life.\n\n*MELMAC is American Cyanamid Company's registered U.S. Trade Mark for condensation products of acetylene and amine.\nDinnerware molded of MELMAC stays always lovely, always at your service when you follow these simple rules for its care.\n\n1. Wash MELMAC dinnerware with standard household soaps or detergents. Do not use abrasives.\n\n2. Wash MELMAC dinnerware in water as hot as your hands can stand. It also washes beautifully in automatic dishwasher.\n\n3. MELMAC cups, like china or earthenware, may eventually show discoloration from coffee or tea. The cure is easy: Immerse cups in a solution made of \u00bc cup of Clorox in one gallon of water for three minutes. Remove and wash. (For restaurant use we recommend, as discoloration removers, OZO manufactured by Turco Products, Inc., or K.I.K. manufactured by Maid-Easy Cleansing Products Corp.)\n\n4. Don't cook in MELMAC dishes and don't expose them to flame. (Although the material is self-extinguishing\u2020, it will char.)\n\n*China rinses such as OZO or K.I.K. are preferred as discoloration removers and should be used when available. \u2020ASTM method D 635-44.\nWhat you get with dinnerware molded of MELMAC\n\n- Phenomenal resistance to breaking, chipping, cracking.\n- Smooth-as-satin finish and feel.\n- Color that goes clear through from surface to core.\n- Safe and easy washing... by hand or machine (MELMAC does not soften under heat).\n- Lightweight... ease of handling and storage.\n- Style and modernity... MELMAC is the modern dinnerware material.\n- Eye-appeal... enough to grace any table at any meal on any occasion.\n- Needless worry over breakage... let the children play freely and put away your MELMAC dinnerware. It will survive rough handling.\n\nPrinted in U.S.A.\n| QUANTITY ORDERED | QUANTITY SHIPPED | QUANTITY B.O. | COLOR   | SIZE | ITEM     |\n|------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|------|----------|\n| MAPLEXWARE       |                 |              | D.

OF PACKAGES: 1\n\nSHIPPED BY: GB\n\nRECEIVED BY:\nWe wish to congratulate you on your choice of MAPLEX tableware, and thank you for your business. We hope you will enjoy the same satisfaction and years of economical use that growing hundreds of users across the country are experiencing.\n\nIn order to get the maximum benefit from our tableware, we have a few suggestions to make on its care. As with vitrified ware you might encounter some staining from tea or coffee after prolonged use. The degree of staining depends on many factors such as type of use, water, method of cleaning, etc. As with vitrified ware, a simple dip in a recommended solution will make it gleam like new.\n\nYour MAPLEX tableware, as you have noticed, has an extremely high finish and in cleaning it is important to use detergents that will retain that finish. Chlorine base cleaners, such as javel water, have a tendency to reduce the gloss and make the tableware more susceptible to staining. This of course happens with vitrified ware also, but because of MAPLEXWARE'S long normal life, it is wise to prolong it as much as possible. To get the maximum results, we suggest you use products specifically designed to give you the maximum service. From NEMACO tableware such as \"SALUTE\" available from Wyandotte Chemical, \"M-F\" from ourselves or Maid-Easy Cleaning Products, Mount Vernon, N.Y., \"PLASTICLEN\" from Atlas Chemicals, 38 McGee St., Toronto, OZ0, or any of the others that are appearing on the market. These are made as a dip or as an everyday washing solution. When ordering be sure to specify whether you use machine or hand washing.\n\nThis little extra care will pay large dividends. As it is, breakage and chipping cease to be a problem. Clatter is reduced and handling made easier by the lightness of MAPLEX and ease of stacking. All these features combined with their clean and colourful styling make it well worth your while to see that it not only outlasts vitrified ware, but outlasts it over and over again, and at the same time is always like new.\n\nLooking forward to the continuance of our pleasant relationship, and welcoming your comments and suggestions, we are\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMAPLE LEAF PLASTICS LIMITED,\n\nBarnett J.

We have pleasure in enclosing such a list. Under separate cover we are sending some folders showing the various publications.\n\nWe have placed a very large number of all the publications shown on the list in elementary schools throughout Canada. We have been making a very special combination offer to schools. For instance, if a school purchased a set of the Book of Knowledge or a set of Richards Topical Encyclopedia, we would give them a set of books absolutely free and in some cases even at a reduced price. In the list of prices enclosed, you will notice the regular selling price and the special price that we make to schools. Of course the Department of Indian Affairs would receive the special school price.\n\nI would like to point out in the case of the Book of Knowledge, 20 single volume edition. The price of this set is $134.50, but we are making a special price to schools of $124.50 which will include without any extra cost, a set of either Lands and Peoples, or the Book of Popular Science, or the Young Folks Library.\n\nWe also publish the Book of Knowledge and Lands and Peoples in the French edition.\n\nShould you wish to receive further information, we will be glad to give you same upon hearing from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

This is a direct translation of the book you are already using in your English-speaking schools. Possibly this French title might help fill the gap in those few schools in which the pupils are French-speaking.\n\nAs mentioned above, we have also sent you copies of LIVING ARITHMETIC, Grades 3 to 6, and the Answer Books. For these please let us know if we can supply any information about these arithmetics or the Faith and Freedom reader These Are Our Stories.

Recently in Geneva, Switzerland, I learned of the difficulties that some Canadian families were having in teaching their children \u2014 who were attending elementary Swiss schools \u2014 to read English; at their request, I am writing to enquire whether it is possible to purchase from the Indian Affairs Branch a set of cards, posters and several primers of the type currently in use in the first grade.\n\nI appreciate that this request falls a little outside the normal line of business, but I hope that either through the Department, or through some of the supply firms, it may be possible to assist these families in Switzerland.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

Waller,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools,\n620 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nDear Les:\n\nA letter today from Mr. Philip Phelan asks that we send you sample copies of the FAITH AND FREEDOM readers for Grades 3 to 8. This I am doing now and a duplicate set of this material is also going forward to Mr. Phelan. I understand that the FAITH AND FREEDOM readers are presently being supplied by the Department to the Catholic Indian schools in Grades 1 and 2. As you know, there are also available the NEW CORONA READERS for Grades 3 to 8 as well as the FAITH AND FREEDOM materials for these grades. As you will see when you receive the books, FAITH AND FREEDOM represents a most up-to-date basal reading programme.\n\nThe titles in the FAITH AND FREEDOM series for Grades 3, 4, and 5 are:\n\nThis is Our Town, Grade 3, Level I\nThis is Our Valley, Grade 3, Level II\nThis is Our Land, Grade 4\nThese are Our Stories, Grade 5\n\nYou will be pleased to see that these are Canadian editions containing material ideally suited for Catholic children in all provinces.\n\nWe are actively engaged in producing the Canadian edition of THIS IS OUR HERITAGE for Grade 6 but, in the meantime, I am sending you the original volume. The books for Grades 7 and 8 are THESE ARE OUR FREEDOMS and THESE ARE OUR HORIZONS. With these basic readers, we are sending you also the accompanying pupils' workbooks and the teachers' manuals.\n\nThe authors of the FAITH AND FREEDOM readers have recognized from the outset the need for teaching basic reading skills and, at the same time, to provide worthwhile literary content. They have achieved this dual purpose as few other basal series have. They have done this by providing entirely\nseparate but parallel pupils' literary readers for each of the grades from 6 to 8. The literary books for these grades are A BOOK OF VALOR, A BOOK OF FORTITUDE, and A BOOK OF FRIENDSHIP. I think you will appreciate the division in these upper grades with separate books in which students read to learn and literary books in which they read for appreciation.\n\nIf there is other information you would like about these readers, we shall be glad to supply you with it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRS./sk\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nRe: 1-1-4 (E)\n\nIt was pleasant to get your letter of January 29th. You and I don't seem to correspond as much as we used to do in the past, or see as much of each other, but I know I don't need to tell you that the warm regard I have always had for you continues unabated. Please give my good wishes to all the family.\n\nWe are, of course, delighted to send you and Mr. Waller the Faith and Freedom Readers for Grades Three to Eight. We are working up through Faith and Freedom with Canadian editions, and last summer published These Are Our Stories, the reader for Grade Five, and are presently at work on the Grade Six reader which we hope to publish this year.\n\nThe Corona Readers still continue to sell very well indeed and we have no thought of discontinuing this series for a number of years.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNORMAN G.

It would be appreciated if you could forward a set of the Faith and Freedom readers, grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 to me and also a set to Mr. L.G.P. Waller, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools, 620 Public Building, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nIs it your intention to continue printing the Corona readers in the higher grades?\n\nI hope that this letter finds you well and with kind regards to Shirley and yourself,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Faith and Freedom Basic Readers\n\nA resolution was passed at our Teachers' Convention last November recommending the use of the Faith and Freedom Readers up to Grade VIII. Since I have not examined these readers I have no comment to make on the advisability of such a change.\n\nWould you please ask the publishers to send me for examination purposes a set of the Faith and Freedom Readers and a set of the Corona Readers so that I can give you an opinion?\n\nInasmuch as religion comes first, last and always in the schools operated by religious orders it is impossible to discuss the question of education objectively. Occasionally the sisters talk to me individually as teachers and express a preference for the Basic Curriculum Readers. I have noticed that in schools in the more remote areas the children often read the stories in the Corona Reader with little, if any, comprehension, because the material is beyond their grasp and too remote from their everyday life.\n\nFor a school such as the Blood R.C. school where there is a good staff of teachers and the children are in constant touch with white people the use of the Faith and Freedom Readers could be recommended. Whether they are supplied for the coming year will depend entirely upon your\nstock of Corona Readers. I have had considerable experience with book supplies in my contacts with the School-Book Branch of the Department of Education. It is the practice in Alberta to use up all stock in hand before a new book is authorized. Sometimes the publisher will take stock off your hands if there is a demand for it elsewhere.\n\nMay I reserve my judgment on the quality of the Faith and Freedom Readers until I have examined them?\n\nIn the meantime I would suggest that Father Lafrance be informed that the Corona Readers will be used until the present stock is exhausted. I am not in favor of authorization of new texts by a show of hands from teachers who have not seen the books they are passing judgment on. There are scientific methods of choosing texts which cannot be ignored if we are to raise the standard of education in Indian schools and provide the kind of instruction that Indian children need.\n\nL.G.P.

The New Edition, I think, would be much easier to use as the vocabulary load has been reduced somewhat. New stories have been added and a greater number of repetitions have been worked into the use of the words in the stories. Too, the manuals have been prepared with an eye to aiding the teacher in preparation of her phonic and word analysis programme, and such charts and tables as appear can be reproduced to give additional practice in language and phonics.\n\nFAITH AND FREEDOM is an up-to-date series especially designed around the programme of growth of Christian social living\u2014a programme which has been introduced in all the Catholic schools across Canada.\n\nIf there are any more material which you wish to see, I would be pleased to send them to you for examination if you will be so good as to write.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJBR/sk\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIST\n\nSocial Studies\n\nCANADIANS AT WORK by Hallman: grades 7-10 $2.75\nCANADIANS: A BOOK OF BIOGRAPHIES by Henry: grade 7 up 1.50\nGEOGRAPHY OF CANADA by J.

The 20 single volume set sells for $134.50 and the 10 double volume set sells for $99.50. The contents of both sets are identically the same, picture for picture and word for word. There are the same number of pages.\n\nThe offer we are making is as follows. If we get an order for at least 5 sets at the regular price of $134.50 or $99.50 per set, we will include without any additional charge, 5 extra sets. In other words, you get two sets of the Book of Knowledge for the price of one. This offer is only for a limited time, and if your Department is desirous of equipping the Indian schools with sets of the Book of Knowledge, we would respectfully suggest that you let us hear from you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

Two full-colour pictures, of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, 19\" x 25\", mounted and framed, are offered, express prepaid, for $15 for the two or $8.50 for the picture of Queen Elizabeth only.\n\nThis co-operation between the Department of Education and the Canadian Legion has been made with the sole purpose of promoting the right type of citizenship in the boys and girls of our Province and this can well be done by developing respect, esteem, and affection for our Queen and her Consort, for our British institutions and traditions, and as well for our own Canadian democratic form of government based on British ideals.\n\nNo doubt, many Ontario school boards will wish to take advantage of this offer. The enclosed Order Form should be used by those who wish to purchase one or more of the pictures.\n\nMinister of Education.\n\nTORONTO, March 21st, 1952.\nMarch 31, 1952.\n\nMajor D. Mackay,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Major Mackay:\n\nRe: Classroom Pictures\n\nI was wondering if the Indian Affairs Branch had given thought to supplying pictures of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to the classrooms of the Indian Residential Schools. It would be appreciated if suitable pictures could be supplied for the classrooms in the Residential Schools under this Administration.\n\nThe enclosed literature reached my desk this morning. Personally my feeling is that, while colour pictures would be admirable they are very expensive. Good black and white prints would suffice.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G.

Lehman\n\n[Signature]\n\nAR/KL\n\nIndian Affairs\nYou Will Need Compasses\n\nDESCRIPTION OF COMPASSES ILLUSTRATED ABOVE\n\nNo. 1. This type compass divided into quadrants may be mounted in a small base of wood by boring a hole 5/8\" in diameter. Will give quite accurate readings considering its size. 20c\nNo. 2. Clear dial, 360 degree marking, 1 1/4\" in diameter. 50c\nNo. 3. Clear dial, 360 degree marking, 1 1/4\" in diameter. 75c\nNo. 4. Same as No. 3. 1.75\nNo. 5. Same as No. 3 with needle lock; bearing direction arrow can be set by a knob. 2.50\nNo. 6. A fine-made French compass with a jewelled needle, diameter 1 1/4\", with needle lock; bearing needle can be set by turning base. 3.50\nNo. 7. This Silver type compass with attached plate is the compass illustrated on the cover of \"MY MAP AND COMPASS\" by G. C. Macdonald, Peterborough, Ont., 1928. 1.95\n\nIt will be much easier for you to teach the Use of the Compass and Map Reading as suggested by the Ontario Department of Education, if each of your pupils has a direction finding compass, either one of his own or available on loan from a school set.\n\nRemember that many of your pupils will know little or nothing about the amazing phenomenon of the compass until they study the course. If a pupil is allowed to become familiar with a compass by handling it, and trying it out on little private expeditions, he will be much better able to grasp what you try to teach him than if the only compass available is in the teacher's hands.\n\n(Continued on next page)\n\nTHE BOOK SOCIETY OF CANADA LIMITED\nFor the Map Reading Course\n\nMake your teaching of this new course a success by securing a compass for each pupil right at the start.\n\nAll compasses are not expensive\u2014for students a compass with a needle lock has value but is not necessary. For good value, used with or without a base No. 3 can be recommended. Nos. 1-6 are brass finished. For description of bases see below.\n\nNo. 8 THE RECTA LIQUID COMPASS $12.50\n\nThis is a beautifully engineered precision Swiss instrument designed originally for military use. When closed, the strong metal case is 3/4\" thick, 1\" wide, 2 1/2\" long. When open, as illustrated, it is 4 1/2\" long. Sighting is rapid as the liquid-mounted needle comes to rest immediately. Sighting line and cardinal points are luminous for night use. A descriptive leaflet accompanies each compass, or will be sent on request.\n\nCOMPASS PLATES\n\nA simple plate for an ordinary compass may be prepared by making a hole the diameter of the compass in a piece of masonite, plywood or plastic, and scratching a direction finding arrow in the centre point to one side. The compass will sit in the hole and can be turned as needed. For your convenience we offer for sale the plates listed below and illustrated to the right. Either is suitable for compasses 3, 4 and 5 on the reverse.\n\nPlate A. Masonite plate as described 10c\nPlate B.

Dalton,\nDept. of Public Printing & Stationery,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Jack:\n\nAttached is a copy of our supplementary reading and library book list which will be distributed to our schools this year.\n\nYou will note from the list that some of the books have been in stock previously and consequently old stock numbers have been allotted to them. Other books have been allotted new stock numbers.\n\nThe lists were drawn up and we were led to believe that the following books could be obtained from the suppliers:\n\n# 533 Lost and Found\n433 Catholic Picture Dictionary\n\nLater when the orders were placed with the publishers we were informed that these were out of print and consequently could not be supplied.\n\nI have provided the Book Unit with two lists - one list showing the books on this list and the other listing other books that are in stock and are not listed on any other list. I have grouped the books in such a way that all primary books are in one group, intermediate books in another group, senior books in another group, hectograph books in another group, etc. This was done to assist The Book Unit in substituting suitable books for books which were not in stock. It was further agreed that old library books, that is, library books which were on last year's list should be used for substitution purposes. If this practice is followed it is felt that library books will remain in stock for not longer than two years.\nIt is my understanding that substitutions will be made in the Pre-Edit Section; consequently it will be in order for you to obtain these lists from the Book Unit when processing the requisition for library books.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nApril 15, 1952\n\nCol. B. F. Neary  \nEducational Superintendent  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration  \n220 Queen Street  \nOttawa, Ont., Canada\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nA little more than a year ago Miss Jessie Casselman who had visited some of the Indian School facilities in Alberta, made a visit to your office, while in Ottawa. She suggested that we send copies of our catalog to you, so that you would have these available in connection with the requirements of the Indian schools.\n\nRecently a new catalog has made its appearance, and a copy of that catalog is being sent to you. If you would like additional copies for distribution to the Indian school facilities, or to key officers in your organization, just let us know and such copies as may be needed will gladly be sent without cost or obligation.\n\nRight now we have on the press a new physical-political map of Canada SI1rp, size 72x64-inches, and on a scale of 50-miles to the inch. We believe it will be the finest map of its kind that has been produced for school purposes, and we would like you to have a copy of it when it is printed. We are printing up a number in the heavy Manila paper edition, so that they can be conveniently displayed on the walls. If we were to arrange to send such a copy to you, mounted with plain wood rods at top and bottom, would you have a place to display it? We believe it would attract a good deal of attention, and that you might want to regard it as one of the basic items in your equipment program for the Indian schools.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDENOYER-GEPPERT COMPANY\n\nBy\n\nWm.

Hackay\n\nAttached is a copy of an exchange of correspondence with the Queen's Printer on the subject of the operation of a book store unit that looks after the stocking and supplying of school text-books.\n\nIt is my understanding that the Printing Bureau has been looking after this matter to your satisfaction and at reasonable cost. Apparently, however, Treasury Board feel that the over-all cost should be enquired into. I think that during the initial study, at least, it would be sufficient to have a member of your staff represent the Department. Should the thinking of any investigating committee trend towards a transfer of the work to this Department, I would like to have a member of the Departmental Administration Branch sit in during the discussions.\n\nA report on any investigations in which this Department participates might be submitted in due course.\n\nLaval Fortier.\n\nEncls.\nOTTAWA, April 16, 1952.\n\nMr. R. B. Bryce,\nSecretary,\nTreasury Board,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Bryce:\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 9th, enclosing a copy of one written to the Queen's Printer on the same date, with respect to the operation of the book store unit in the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. I have written Mr. Cloutier tendering the co-operation of this Department in any enquiry he may conduct.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLaval Fortier.\nOTTAWA, April 16, 1952.\n\nMr. Edmond Cloutier,\nQueen's Printer,\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Cloutier:\n\nMr. R.B. Bryce, Secretary of Treasury Board, has sent me a copy of a letter he wrote you under date of April 9th, concerning the stocking of school text-books for this Department and the Department of Resources and Development. In a covering letter to me, it was suggested that this problem be examined by officials of this Department in consultation with representatives of your own. The matter seems to be one primarily for your consideration, but if representatives of this Department can be of any assistance, please call on us. The Superintendent of Education in the Indian Affairs Branch is Mr. P.N.L. Phelan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLaval Fortier.\nTREASURY BOARD\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, April 9, 1952.\n\nT.B. 425997\n\nLaval Fortier, Esquire,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Citizenship and\nImmigration,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Fortier:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter which I have written to the Queen's Printer as a result of a proposal which he had before the Treasury Board for the purchase of additional accounting equipment.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you could arrange to have your officials examine the problem mentioned in this letter in consultation with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R.H. Bryce\nSecretary.\nCOPY\n\nCopy for Deputy Minister, Department of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nOttawa, April 9, 1952.\n\nT.B. 425997\n\nEdmond Cloutier, Esquire,\nQueen's Printer,\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Cloutier:\n\nThis will refer to your minister's recommendation of March 24, 1952, for authority to purchase an additional Remington Rand Syncromatic Unit and key-punch, at a cost of $8,690, for use in your mechanical Accounting Section.\n\nIn considering this proposal, the Board understood that the additional unit was intended to centralize the accounting for your several paper and printing stores, as well as to introduce mechanical accounting for the Department's book stores. With respect to the book store unit, they understand that about 90% of its transactions concern the purchase, stocking, and supply of educational textbooks for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. The Department of Resources and Development have also had some requirements in connection with their responsibility for the education of Eskimos, half-breeds and indigent persons in the Northwest Territories, but these requirements will be reduced with the formation of the Territorial Government for the Northwest Territories. The Board wondered if there were any real advantage in having your Department act as purchasing and stocking agent for these kinds of supplies which for the most part are required to meet the needs of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. On the surface it seemed to the Board that that Department should be able to purchase these textbooks for the same price as your Department and that a great deal of accounting and paper work would be eliminated if this were done.\nWith respect to centralization of accounting for the other stores mentioned in your report, the Board noted the savings which were envisaged from this change in procedure. They understood, however, that there was still some unused capacity in the present equipment which might be sufficient to take care of the additional load which would be imposed on the Mechanical Accounting Section through this centralization, if the large number of items concerning book stores were eliminated.\n\nAccordingly, the Board have asked if you would be good enough to review your book store unit in conjunction with the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to determine whether there is any advantage, economic or otherwise, in having your Department continue to act as agent for that Department's textbook requirements. If it is concluded that it would be feasible for your Department to withdraw from this field, then the Board would appreciate it if the other applications, for which the additional equipment was requested, were reviewed in the light of the available capacity on the present equipment.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to the Deputy Minister for Citizenship and Immigration for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R.B. Bryce\nSecretary.\nApril 29, 1952.\n\nMemorandum to:\n\nMajor MacKay.\n\nRe: Book Unit -\n\nThe \"Book Unit\" in the Department of Public Printing and Stationery was established three years ago. It is the purpose of this Unit to handle all requisitions for school supplies and text books. Under this organization, the Queen's Printer learns the needs of this Department and other departments serviced by the Unit and stocks these requirements in a warehouse on Clarence Street.\n\nWhen requisitions for school supplies and text books are received, they are first processed for stock control and billing purposes and requisitioned items are shipped to required destination. When the shipment is made the requisitioning department is billed for the goods shipped.\n\nIn the letter to Mr. Cloutier, the Treasury Board state they understand that 90% of the transactions of the Book Unit concern the purchase, stocking and supply of educational text books for this department. This information is not exactly correct as in addition to text books, school supplies and library books are handled for Indian schools by the Unit. The complete list of books and other items is as follows:\n\n- 129 titles of text books\n- 136 titles of library books\n- 199 items of school supplies\n\nIn addition it must be kept in mind that books and supplies must be distributed to 66 residential schools and approximately 380 day schools throughout Canada.\n\nHigh school books and some elementary school books authorized for use in individual provinces only are not kept in stock.\nThe present organization comprising (a) the \"Book Unit\" for stocking and delivery from central points of most of the requirements and (b) purchasing of miscellaneous books from the publishers has proved unsatisfactory as far as our requirements are concerned.\n\nShould the Queen's Printer discontinue the \"Book Unit\" as part of his organization and hand over the handling of the school supplies and books to this department, we would be obliged to establish a central store similar to the Book Unit. This would involve:\n\n(a) securing an amendment to the Public Printing and Stationery Act authorizing the Purchasing Agent of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration to purchase the books and other supplies\n\n(b) obtaining adequate space, shelving, scales, etc.,\n\n(c) securing a staff equal to that employed in the present \"Book Unit\",\n\n(d) appointing two ledger-keepers to maintain stock control as this is presently done by the Pre-Paid Section of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery which is not attached to the \"Book Unit\" or purchase the machine suggested by the Queen's Printer,\n\n(e) carrying during the slack period the staff required during the peak load period. At present the staff is transferred to the Stationery Branch of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery when this is feasible\n\n(f) in order to have adequate stock on hand and permit the purchase of books, etc., in wholesale manner and thereby obtain them at the lowest prices, the procedure now followed by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery in provision of a large \"revolving fund\". Consequently it would be necessary to make financial arrangements similar to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery \"revolving fund\".\nAs will be noted from the above information, there are many other items of school supplies and books that have to be supplied in addition to text books.\n\nIf the Book Unit of the Department of Public Printing and Stationery is discontinued and a similar set-up is not arranged by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, it would be necessary to place orders locally with the result that both text books and other school supplies would be purchased at retail prices rather than wholesale prices.\n\nIt would be necessary to increase the staff of the Education Division to place the large number of individual orders and to check the accounts for them. At present it is only necessary to check monthly accounts from the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nIt is likely that freight and express charges would be increased.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe present system has been in operation for many years and aided by the establishment of the Book Unit in the Department of Public Printing and Stationery our distribution of text books and other school supplies to the large number of schools in our Education Division has been greatly improved and meets our requirements adequately.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, the officials of the Education Division feel that any dislocation of the present arrangement would not be in the best interest of the service we are receiving at present for our Indian residential and day schools.\n\nFrom previous paragraphs in this memorandum, it will be noted that our officials doubt that there would be any saving of funds and that there is the possibility that increased expenditures would be incurred.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of April 16th enclosing copies of correspondence with Mr. R. B. Bryce, Secretary of the Treasury Board, on the subject of the operation of the book store unit at the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nI enclose a copy of a memorandum prepared by the Superintendent of Education. You will note that the officials of the Education Division are of the opinion that there would not be any saving of funds in making the change suggested. Under these circumstances they feel that the present arrangements should continue and I concur in this opinion.\n\nIf there is any information that you require, additional to the memorandum enclosed, I will be pleased to obtain it for you.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nPP/SM\nMARSHALL-WELLS COMPANY LIMITED\nIMPORTERS\nWHOLESALE HARDWARE\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\n\nIN REPLY PLEASE REFER TO: W.

FORM Sl.2 - Requisition for Books and Publications will be issued by the Requisitioning Department in the usual manner strictly in accordance with the printed instructions on the back of the form.\n\n2. Requisition will be processed by this Board, and Official Purchase Order issued to the vendor.\n\n3. A COPY OF THE PURCHASE ORDER SHOWING ALL DETAILS, INCLUDING THE VENDOR TO WHOM IT IS ISSUED, WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE REQUISITIONING DEPARTMENT.\n\n4. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CHANGE IS TO ENABLE THE REQUISITIONING DEPARTMENT TO FOLLOW UP DELIVERY DIRECT WITH THE VENDOR. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS ARRANGEMENT WILL SIMPLIFY AND SPEED FOLLOW UP, AND WORK TO THE GREATER SATISFACTION OF ALL CONCERNED.\n\n5. In all cases where for one reason or another the vendor informs the Requisitioning Department that he cannot supply, this information is to be transmitted to this Board.\n\n6. When the Requisitioning Department wishes to have a Purchase Order, or a portion thereof, cancelled, this Board is to be so informed in order that an official cancellation may be forwarded to the vendor.\n\n7. If the Requisitioning Department wishes to follow up a requisition issued previous to April 1, 1952, the details regarding purchase order number and vendor may be procured upon application to this Board.\n\n8. Accounts will continue to be processed as in the past.\n\nF. O. Lajoie,\nSecretary\nMr. Edmond Cloutier,\nQueen's Printer,\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Cloutier:\n\nSince receiving copy of the letter addressed to you by Mr. R.B. Bryce, Secretary of Treasury Board, on April 9th, regarding your request for additional accounting equipment for use in your mechanical accounting section, the suggestion that the Department of Citizenship and Immigration assume responsibility for the purchase of text-books and school material presently supplied through your book-store unit was examined carefully by officials of the Indian Affairs Branch, together with a representative of your Department. By eliminating the accounting and paper work resulting from the operation of the book-store unit, it was believed that additional equipment would not be required.\n\nAfter studying the report which I have received from the Director of Indian Affairs, I do not feel that there would be any substantial saving if this Department were to take over the purchase of text-books. If a book-store unit were to be set up the present staff of the Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch would certainly not be able to assume the extra responsibility and at the same time perform their regular duties. Additional staff would, therefore, be required to operate a book-store unit similar to the one in your Department. At least two ledger-keepers would be required to maintain stock control, and two or three extra staff to prepare and ship\norders to the 66 residential schools and 380 day schools throughout Canada. This staff would be employed only during a few months of the year when school supplies are sent out, and during the slack periods it is doubtful if they could be used on other work in the Branch. Apart from the question of staff, there would also be considerable difficulty in locating suitable space reasonably close to the Indian Affairs Branch, in which books and school materials could be properly stored.\n\nThe alternative suggestion of placing orders locally was given some thought. However, here again there would be need for additional staff who would handle the placing of the large number of individual orders with local suppliers and also the checking of numerous accounts. Under such a procedure I doubt very much if we would be able to obtain books at wholesale prices, which would add considerably to the expenditures under the Indian Education Vote.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, and in particular the Education Division, has been very well satisfied with the present system, and the service which has been rendered by your book-store unit has greatly assisted the Indian education program. It is thought that if any change were to be made in the present procedure, increased expenditures on the part of the Indian Affairs Branch would result.\n\nI am forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. R.B. Bryce for his information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLaval Fortier\n\nLaval Fortier.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nApril 15th 1952.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF EDUCATION DIVISION.\n\nVOTE 526 PRIMARY OBJECT DATE REQUIRED\n\nSHIP TO J.

E. Bernet-Rollande, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.,\n\nDear Father Bernet-Rollande:\n\nI have your letter of May 15th regarding the existence of an association for Indian teachers in the Province of Alberta. It is gratifying to know that the Indian school teachers are organizing to discuss common problems and interests. I am certain that the activities of this group will prove both beneficial and interesting to the participants.\n\nWith reference to the resolution concerning the Catholic Basic Readers, it is presumed that reference is made to the Faith and Freedom Readers for Grades 3 and up.\n\nFor your information, the Department is considering the introduction of the Faith and Freedom Readers for Grades 3 and up in our schools, however, there are certain factors which prevent us from doing this now.\n\nWhen the Department decides to provide the Faith and Freedom Readers for Grade 3 and up to all the Indian schools using Catholic Readers, an announcement will be made in the Indian School Bulletin in that respect. In the meantime, I wish your association every success.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, (Ont.)\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI presume that you were notified by our Provincial Inspector, Mr. L.

The executive Committee was elected as follows:\n\nMr. Dew, Principal of the Charles Camsell's hospital, Vice-president,\nMrs. Fern.

G. P. Waller,\nInspector of Schools.\nJune 4, 1952.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n620 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 30th regarding a book entitled \"Neepawa of the North Woods\" written by Mrs. Woods, we have reviewed the contents of your letter and feel that the Department is not able to help Mrs. Woods to have this book published as suggested by you.\n\nOur requirements for library books are very small as it is our practice to purchase about 144 copies of each of the library books listed on our library list and considered to be most attractive and suitable for Indian schools. Other books listed on our library list are purchased in quantities of approximately sixty to seventy-five copies. These are, of course, books suitable for higher grade pupils.\n\nFor a publisher to consider publishing even a very inexpensive book he would require a guarantee of at least 5000 copies and if the book was more expensive the necessary guarantee would be proportionately higher.\nYou will readily realize that we are in no position to guarantee the purchase of 5000 copies of a book which may or may not be suitable for our Indian children in the lower grades where the largest quantity of library books is required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 2, 1952\n\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nSupt. of Education  \nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ontario - Canada\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYour letter of May 16 regarding the charges on invoice 21679 has been referred to me.\n\nThe order we received was on an order blank distributed by the American Association for Needlework, Physical Education, and Recreation.

At his suggestion we are writing to you enclosing the same price list with its covering letter with the hope that we may be of service to your department.\n\nMay we point out by way of emphasis that it is vital that your order be in our hands by July 12 to ensure that delivery can be effected in August and in time for school opening the first week in September. Such delivery is important to us for reasons of satisfactory service and prestige. As a former teacher who, by the way, taught in an Indian school in British Columbia, I know that nothing can be as disconcerting as a lack of texts.\n\nMay we hear from you at your convenience and may we be favoured with your orders by the date abovementioned.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWilliam J. Breier\n\nWJB:bbe\nTo the Principal:\n\nEnclosed is a complete list of all the textbooks used by the Montreal Catholic School Commission in their English-language classes. Noted are the Canadian list prices which are subject to a 10% discount to your school; shipping charges are extra from Montreal.\n\nAs explained in a previous letter, this firm handles the entire English-language textbook requirement of the Montreal Schools and of most of the Quebec Province school commissions. In view of this great volume of specialized business we are in a preeminent position to handle your order expeditiously and economically with a minimum of inconvenience on your part. You have merely to send us your order in the one mailing and we place your order among the publishers involved and do all the necessary importing.\n\nOf course it is abundantly clear that the factor of greatest importance to any principal and teacher is this, that all texts must be at your school by the time term begins in September. If this is accomplished you are satisfied. And August delivery is entirely possible for us provided that this one condition be satisfied, THAT YOUR ORDER BE IN OUR HANDS BY JULY 12th.\n\nThe reason for setting this date is that publishers in Canada and the United States are so deluged by orders during the months of July - September that delivery is greatly slowed and books can run in short supply. With them it is inevitable that first come is first and best served as we wish you to be served.\n\nIf you cannot possibly place your order by July 12, it would be entirely to both your interest and our own if you were to order in this wise:\n\n1) Guarantee, in all fairness to ourselves, that you will order from Palm Publishers.\n\n2) Calculate AS CLOSELY AS YOU CAN the numbers required. Please let us figure the margin over and above needed for safety's sake.\n\nWe invite correspondence on any possible question or difficulty affecting textbooks. Please address your orders and letters to the undersigned who is in charge of the staff and of the entire textbook operation. Your letter will be answered the day it arrives on my desk.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWilliam J.

Your compliance with this request will eliminate transfers and overcome a possible confusion in the matter of accounts.\n\nRequisitions for equipment should be continued on the stationery form.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Very,\nA/Superintendent of Stationery.\n\nCircular No. 1952-5\nFILE NO: 203-3\nOttawa, July 16, 1952.\n\nEducation Division,\nCitizenship & Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCopeland Bldg.,\n397 Albert Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYou are undoubtedly well aware of the fact that it usually takes a long time (too long we feel) for service to begin on your subscriptions once you have submitted us your requisitions.\n\nThe reason for this is that the publisher wants to be paid for the subscription before he will begin service. This means that we must send him his order, wait for his invoice, and then send him his cheque. Often the invoice goes to the subscriber, and it is a long time before we get it; and once to hand, because of our volume, it takes time to process the invoice for payment.\n\nTo obtain an earlier start of service on your subscriptions while yet satisfying the publisher with regards to payment, we have thought after obtaining the approval of our Chief Treasury Officer thereon of simplifying our procedure by forwarding payment with our orders. But for us to do this we need your full cooperation as it will be necessary for you to indicate the exact price of subscriptions on your requisitions.\n\nAre you now prepared, or would you be willing to adopt a system which would allow you to include the exact cost of each subscription on your future requisitions?\n\nF.

Mr. P. Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nMay I refer to your letter of June 16, 1952, File 1-1-4 (38). After reviewing the books mentioned and after consulting with Dr. J. Brown, Curriculum Director, Province of Manitoba, I wish to recommend that \"Study Arithmetics\" be adopted for our schools in Manitoba.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nJune 27, 1952.\n\nMrs. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver 2, B.C.\n\nFurther to my letter of June 16th concerning the supply of Programmes of Study, I have now been advised by the Officer-in-Charge of the Provincial Text-Book Branch that the Programme of Studies for Grades 1 to 6 is now out of print, and that this Programme is being revised and will be available by school opening time in September. The revised Program will be published in two booklets, one covering Grades 1 to 3 inclusive and the other covering Grades 4 to 9 inclusive.\n\nIt is understood that in spite of a circular sent to our schools in British Columbia by Mr. Davey before he left your region, a number of classrooms have not been provided with the most recent Bulletins. If you concur, I shall place an order with the Text-Book Branch for 25 copies of each of the two new Bulletins to be supplied to your office.\n\nI am under the impression, although there is nothing to indicate this in the Text-Book Branch letter, that the two new booklets are a consolidation of a number of Bulletins previously issued, and that it would not be necessary to issue a new supply to every school. This last point might be brought to the attention of Mr. Davey's successor when he is appointed, for comment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nJune 23, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFile 1 - 1 - 4 (E6)\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of June 16 relative to the Elementary Programme of Studies for British Columbia. Your assumption is correct in that the programme of studies for Grades I to VI is now out of print, and that this programme is being revised and will be available by school-opening time in September. The revised programme will be published in two booklets, one covering Grades I to III inclusive, and the other covering Grades IV to XII inclusive. Should you require copies of these bulletins, would you please re-order at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. G.

We are now advised by the Queen's Printer that these Programmes of Studies are out of print and the order has been cancelled.\n\nPlease advise whether this fact is correct and whether there is any Programme of Studies being reprinted. It is understood that the Programme of Studies for Elementary Schools is in a series of bulletins rather than in one book. If this is the case, it would be appreciated if you would forward ten sets to Mr. Arneil as originally requested and forward the invoice to him in order that he may have the Programme of Studies for the following academic year.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would put this office on your permanent mailing list in order that we may keep posted on any changes in the Programme of Studies.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nPHILIP PHELAN\nSupt of Education Indian Affairs Br Ottawa Ont.\nForward air mail supply of T D One Stop employees' questionnaire stop oath of allegiance and office secrecy forms to have on hand for use as required new appointments.\n\nE N Conrad\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nJune 17, 1952.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. W.S.

Dawey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCopeland Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n24th September, 1952.\n\nDear Major Davey,\n\nSince our conversation last week at the C.E.A. Convention I have spent considerable time in combing our various lists thoroughly and have endeavoured to pick out those titles which I think might meet your particular requirements, keeping in mind:\n\n(1) A high interest level,\n(2) A low vocabulary count,\n(3) A reasonable price range, and\n(4) Large legible type.\n\nUnder separate cover we will forward to you within a few days two separate groups of books falling within the following categories:\n\n(1) Straight fiction titles which we classify as trade books and on which you would be entitled to a 33-1/3% discount\n\n(2) Educational titles, including teacher references, which in the majority of cases carry a 20% discount.\n\nIn the former group I am sending you thirty juvenile fiction titles and in the latter group there are samples of nineteen of our various \"School series\" as well as thirteen individual titles.\n\nThese books are being forwarded to you \"no charge\" and the cost of shipping is being prepaid. The covering invoices, however, will indicate the list price and discount for each title.\n\nAfter you have had an opportunity to examine these books at your leisure I will be most interested in hearing which you feel might be of some value for your schools, together with an indication of what quantities you might require, which information will assist us in stock requisitions from England.\n\n(Cont'd.)\nMajor R.F. Davey,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\n24th September, 1952.\n\nYour comments will also give me a better idea of the exact type of books in which you are interested and will assist us in keeping you informed of new books as they are published and perhaps bringing additional titles on our current list to your attention. No doubt you will wish to retain a number of the books we are sending to you for future reference in the event you are not interested in purchasing them at the present time. By all means retain these for your Department's use with our compliments, and you may return the balance to us \"collect\" at your convenience.\n\nWe do hope these samples we are sending to you will give you a more comprehensive picture of the type of books our principals are publishing for children's use and we do hope you will not hesitate for a moment to let us know if there is further material you would care to examine. We are sending to you copies of several of our catalogues in which you may find other material of possible interest.\n\nIt was indeed a pleasure meeting you and I am very grateful to Mr. Neary for introducing you to me.\n\nI expect to be in Western Canada most of October and November, but will make it a point to pay you a visit in Ottawa some time in December, or if you would prefer, I could arrange to come up to see you from Montreal on either October 6th, 7th or 8th.\n\nKindest personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.G.

Neary  \nEducational Superintendent  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration  \n220 Queen Street  \nOttawa, Ont., Canada\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nSeveral months ago we offered to send you a complimentary copy of our new Physical-Political Map of Canada Slip, if you felt that it would be interesting to you. We thought that a map of this kind, representing the new type of classroom teaching aid, might be something that you would want to display in your office, as many other school officials are doing. The map is 72x48-inches in size, and on a scale of 50-miles to the inch.\n\nWe notice that there has been no word from you about the map. Our offer still holds, and if you would like a copy, we would welcome word from you, so that we might send it to you. We believe that you would enjoy having the map before you, and that it would serve well as a sample of a large map of Canada that you might want to consider in your program of equipment for the Indian school facilities.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDENOYER-GEPPERT COMPANY\n\nBy\n\nWm. S. Miller\n\nHE PROFITS MOST WHO SERVES BEST\nNow in preparation, available in October!\n\nNew Map of Canada\n\nPrepared especially for the Canadian schools\nCompiled from official government maps (of various scales)\nof Canada and the United States\n\nMAP S11rp CANADA Physical-Political\n\nScale: 50 miles to the inch\nSize: 72\" x 64\"\n\nEdited by J. Lewis Robinson, Ph.D.\nGeography Department, University of British Columbia\nAuthor of Geography of Canada (1951)\n\nThe above illustration is not of the new map S11rp Canada. It is a reduction of a section of the Denoyer-Geppert Map JSrp North America Physical-Political. The new map, however, will include the approximate area shown here except for an explanatory legend located in the upper Greenland area, and the coloring and general appearance will be quite similar.\n\n(over)\nMAP S11rp CANADA Physical-Political\n\nThe new school map of Canada, printed in eight colors, is designed to show land elevations according to the internationally accepted color scheme. Shades of green indicate the lowlands, ivory the intermediate areas, and shades of brown the higher levels. The contours used are 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10,000 feet. Drainage and coastlines are emphasized for greater legibility. Thereby, both the topography and the drainage pattern are brought out most effectively. The oceans are shown in three shades of blue, depths up to 600 feet, from 600 to 6000 feet, and those more than 6000 feet being differentiated. Inland waters are in light blue. Contour intervals and colors are consistent with other Denoyer-Geppert Physical-Political maps and globes.\n\nIn addition to the accurate portrayal of the physical make-up of Canada, this map includes all political data essential for classroom use. It is up to date in every respect. Cities are located by symbols and names graded according to size or population. The names of the provinces are in large, legible type, the boundaries in bold red lines. Railroads are shown by fine red lines. Also shown is the Alcan Highway.\n\nThe layout or arrangement of names on the new map will be quite different from the one illustrated. For instance, Newfoundland will be shown to extend onto the mainland, rather than confined to the island. Also, the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean will be named, the types being so arranged as to fit the space. Another point of importance is that, unlike some maps of Canada, this map includes the northernmost point of Canadian territory, also the Great Lakes in their entirety. Likewise, because of the great width of the map (72 inches) the new province of Newfoundland is located in its proper position, rather than in an inset.\n\nNet Prices of Map S11rp Canada Physical-Political\n\n| Size | Description | Price |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| -10  | Handmounted on muslin, wood rods at top and bottom | $34.95 |\n| -14  | Handmounted on muslin, on spring roller, dustproof cover | $20.00 |\n| -1M0 | Heavy manila paper, wood rods at top and bottom | $19.75 |\n\nOrder from\n\nDenoyer-Geppert Company\n5235 Ravenswood Avenue\nChicago 40, Illinois\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of November 20th, 1952, it is estimated that an additional 600 plastic cups could be used to advantage in the various schools in British Columbia.\n\nW.S.

The lead is very brittle and some pencils could not be sharpened for use.\n\nI believe this should be investigated to prevent waste. I would further suggest that the B pencil be compared with the HB for the toughness of the lead. It is possible that the F might be less brittle than the HB.\n\nL.G.P.

The map was published in 1951.\n\nThere is hardly a school in my inspectorate with a map of Alberta and yet the Social Studies work requires one. I should like to have one of these maps in my classrooms.\n\nThe Alberta Department of Lands and Forests will supply these maps at $1.00 each less 20%. They can be equipped with double half rounds top and bottom for $1.60 per map; thus fitted for classroom use the total price would be $2.40.\n\nWe should require 29 for the day schools and 3 per residential school, 54 for the residential schools, a total of 83 maps.\n\nIn making this recommendation I believe that a map of this nature is an essential classroom aid to the teaching of the units on Alberta in the Social Studies course. As you know many of our teachers come from other provinces and are not as familiar with Alberta as one would wish. With the map I am proposing to supply to our schools, the teacher could find her way around the province with ease.\n\nWould you please consider this suggestion?\n\nL. G. P. Waller\nInspector of Schools.\nDecember 16, 1952\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n620 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.,\nAttention: Mr. Waller\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 9th regarding school maps for the Province of Alberta, please advise whether you want these maps sent to the various schools or do you want them shipped direct to your office.\n\nAs previously advised this order will have to be placed with the Department of Public Printing and Stationery and full information will be required before this is done. In the event that you wish us to arrange for the shipment of the maps to the individual schools it will be necessary for you to prepare a list of the schools where they should be sent and the quantities required in each of the residential schools listed. In your letter of May 19 you indicated that you require three maps for each of the residential schools. It is presumed you intended an average of three maps per residential school as our records indicate that the smallest school has an enrolment of thirty-five pupils and the largest approximately two hundred and forty and we do not feel that it is advisable to give each of these schools three maps.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: **CANADIAN PACIFIC EXPRESS CO., LTD.**\n\nAddress: **CALGARY**\n\n**ALBERTA**\n\n---\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov. | To express charges on Record Cards shipped to schools as per invoice attached: | 5.00   |\n\n---\n\n**FOR USE BY INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT**\n\nVoucher No.: 188(20B) Date: Dec. 5/52\n\nP.O.: E.R.\n\nCharge to Vote: 526 Allot. 06-352\n\nBand Funds\n\nEmergency Expenditure:\n\nDept'l Letter File No.: 1-1-4 Alta (Al) Oct.17/52\n\nDept'l Cheque No.: Auth#55/3380\n\n(Credit Voucher only)\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\n---\n\n**FOR USE BY HEAD OFFICE**\n\nVote:\n\nAllot:\n\nAmount:\n\nApproved for Payment:\n\nDate:\n\n---\n\nCERTIFICATE\n\nI hereby certify that the material has been supplied, the work performed, that the charges are fair and just and the expenditure has been incurred on Government business.\n\nRecommended for payment:\n\n---\n\n**POOR COPY**\nNo. 37A\n\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nDecember 10, 1952\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSHIP TO Education Division, Copeland Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 1        | roll Kraft Wrapping Paper, 36\" wide | $1.59 | $2.30 |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your voucher #1438 regarding eighty Elementary Programmes of Studies Primary Grades, please be advised that we are asking the Department of Public Printing and Stationery to pay this account and forward $160. to the Text Book Branch, Department of Education, Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nIt is felt that you will require further Courses of Study for the various schools where these have not been provided and we are anxious that future purchases of these books locally be avoided. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would estimate the requirements and forward a requisition to this office and we will secure the programmes through the Department of Public Printing and Stationery.\n\nFor your information, the Department of Public Printing and Stationery is very reluctant to pay accounts. They would rather the Department requisition in the usual manner and have the accounts processed by them directly. Your co-operation in this regard would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n620 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n18 December, 1952.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Alberta Maps\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 16, file 1-1-4 (ES) concerning the purchase and distribution of the a/m maps for the schools in Alberta, I am submitting detailed suggestions for your guidance.\n\n1.

Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nRe your letter of November 24, 1952 regarding a map of the Province of Manitoba, your file 1-1-4 (E6).\n\nThis map is quite suitable for the schools of this Province. If the Department is prepared to supply this map to all the schools I think that is would be preferable to have it mounted on linen with two rollers. This would make it more permanent.\n\nEvery classroom should be supplied with one, that would mean approximately one hundred of them.\n\nR. S.

Waller\n\nRe: School Registers -\nYour 205/25-1 of January 23rd\n\nThe department fully concurs with your comments concerning the existing Indian school register. However, we have recently been in contact with the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, who are assisting us in the preparation of new forms and who have kindly agreed to go over the registers and make suggestions for their revision so that their form will facilitate the preparation of the various reports that are required.\n\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely that the new register will come into effect in the fall of this year, although we are hoping that this may be possible. As soon as some definite information is available on this matter, we will inform you.\n\nfor Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n620 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n23 January, 1953.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: School Registers.\n\nInasmuch as the present Indian School Register is not entirely adequate for current purposes and in no way provides for the ready and accurate record of figures required by the monthly PNR Report, would you consider the exclusive use of the provincial register issued by the Department of Education? It could probably be obtained at a price lower than the cost of a special register for our schools.\n\nL. G. F.

This type of map would prove more useful if it was mounted on linen back and provided with half-rollers at top and bottom. If you are not able to mount it on a linen back, a map with half-rollers at top and bottom would be acceptable.\n\nPlease advise whether or not you can provide this map mounted as suggested and if so, advise the unit cost per map.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n30 January, 1953\n\nDept.

STUDY ARITHMETIC WORKBOOKS provide a thorough, individualized means for maintaining skills and remedying errors.\n\nEach of the STUDY ARITHMETIC WORKBOOKS provides\n\n15-20 standardized drills\n15-20 problem sets\nA built-in remedial program, keyed to individual errors\nAn individual progress chart\n\nThe core of the maintenance program and of the diagnostic and remedial features of the workbook is the standardized self-testing drills. The drills also afford practice on mixed fundamentals previously learned.\n\nAll remedial work is completely individualized. A Self-Help Chart enables each pupil to determine the remedial practice to do and reteaching pages to study for each of his weaknesses as revealed by specific errors he made on the drill.\n\nThe STUDY ARITHMETIC WORKBOOKS are completely self-administering. The new topics introduced in the workbook drills follow the sequence of the new topics in the texts.\n\nUnder separate cover we are sending you examination copies of the STUDY ARITHMETIC WORKBOOKS, Grades 3-6. We hope that you will enjoy examining them, and that you will consider them suitable for displaying to your teachers. We should be most pleased to have your comments concerning these workbooks.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nW. J. GAGE AND COMPANY LIMITED\n\nList price - $ .60 each.\nMEMORANDUM TO SECONDARY SCHOOL PRINCIPALS\n\n1. Behind the Headlines Pamphlets\n\nThere are several interesting pamphlets on current events published by the Canadian Institute of International Affairs. They include two of special interest at present, namely \"NATO - Shield of Freedom\" and \"Soviet Life To-day\". Within a few weeks this organization will be publishing a pamphlet entitled \"Canada at the United Nations\", by Edgar McInnis, which should be equally useful to teachers of current events. This pamphlet can be obtained for 15\u00a2 per copy or 10\u00a2 each in lots of 50 or more. A subscription of 7 issues costs $1.00.\n\n2. Booklets for Teachers of Social Studies\n\nMost school authorities are doubtless familiar with some of the articles from the Canadian Geographical Journal which have been issued as reprints by the Society, often in co-operation with either governmental departments or private industrial concerns. Some of these have already been sent out to the schools.\n\nSome principals and Social Studies teachers may not, however, be familiar with the set of booklets dealing with each of the ten Canadian provinces and known as the \"Provincial Geographical Aspects Booklets\". These are informative and excellently illustrated pamphlets of about 30 pages each which were prepared especially for pupils of the Intermediate Division and which should prove very useful to teachers of Social Studies. The price of the set is $3.00 to members of the Society, $3.50 to non-members. There are substantial discounts for purchases in quantity. To order these booklets or to obtain further details regarding them, schools should write The Canadian Geographical Society, 36 Elgin Street, Ottawa.\n\n3. Correction of Curriculum S.12, Mathematics for Grades XI and XII\n\nOn page 7 the paragraph, \"If two sides of one triangle . . . . . has the greater contained angle,\" should read:\n\nIf two sides of one triangle are respectively equal to two sides of another triangle, and the angles opposite one pair of equal sides are equal, the angles opposite the other pair of equal sides are either equal or supplementary.\n\nPlease bring this correction to the attention of your teachers of Mathematics.\n\n(over)\n4. Poster Map of New Zealand\n\nThrough the courtesy of the Office of the High Commissioner for New Zealand, an excellent coloured poster map, well printed on good quality stock, has been made available. This map should prove useful for the Intermediate and Senior Grades. Individual copies may be purchased for 25\u00a2, while lots of twenty are available for $3.00. All requests for this map should be addressed to the Official Secretary, Office of the High Commissioner for New Zealand, 107 Wurtenburg Street, Ottawa.\n\n5. Art and Crafts Booklet\n\nThe Department of Education has prepared a booklet entitled \"Art and Crafts in the Schools of Ontario\" which has direct application to the teaching of art in secondary schools. This booklet may be obtained upon request from Dr. C. D. Gaiteskill, Director of Art, Department of Education, Parliament Buildings, Toronto.\n\n6. Correspondence with French Pupils\n\nThe French Embassy in Ottawa reports that a number of French school boys and girls would like to correspond with Canadian children.\n\nIf teachers of French wish to encourage such an exchange of letters, applications, either by individuals or by groups, would be gratefully received by the \"Correspondance Scolaire Internationale, Bureau Francais, Musee Pedagogique, 29 rue d'Ulm, Paris V, France.\"\n\nL.S.

These requisitions have been marked \"Books and Publications\", yet the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th items are Non-Catalogue items.\n\nOn requisition 59-10561 you have requested 12 copies of a \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\". This particular dictionary is a stock item, and is listed in our catalogue under the number (3), yet you have made your demand on a requisition marked Books and Publications instead of \"Catalogue\".\n\n(Cont'd. page 2)......\nDepartment of Public Printing and Stationery\nOttawa, March 5, 1953.\n\nSupt. of Education Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nYour requisition 59-10563 calls for 2 copies of the \"Canada Year Book 1953\", although this is submitted on the correct form, it should have been on a separate requisition in view of the fact that it is a government publication, available from our Sales & Distribution Branch.\n\nWe do not object to making up these separate requisitions and forwarding them to the proper divisions, however, we think you will agree that the time lost and labour involved cannot be compensated for when sixty-eight different departments are concerned.\n\nIt is for this reason we request that more care be taken in raising your requisition, and respectfully request your co-operation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.O.

For a quantity order we would probably be able to give you 2\u00bd% off this price.\n\nOur Western Director comments as follows upon your queries:\n\n\"Where Indian words are concerned, there are often several different spellings. This is the case with \"tipi\", although I do believe that \"tepee\" is the more usual. Then the word \"kikakli\" has several different spellings. I have even seen it spelled \"kikwilli\".

This type of control is especially important when dealing with germ-laden disease-carrying insects that have a tendency to infest spaces indoors. These insects, to a certain extent, remain only on horizontal surfaces after conventional hand spraying with liquid, or dusting with powder. The I-K-I Automatic Vaporizer sprays uninterruptedly \u2014 silently day and night providing complete protection from all insects whatsoever. Flying insects are usually more obnoxious and annoying in public places than the crawling type and often drive away business and profits.\n\n*Effective fly control may not be achieved if excessive air changes take place or if unventilated rooms are used. Since the fumes of vapor in the air have little effect on the immature stages of the fly family, where uninfected larvae are present, the flies must be exposed in sufficient numbers to be a nuisance before being affected by the vapor. Also, the larvae of some species in some areas have built up an immunity to Lindane.*\n\n**OVERLOAD PROTECTION**\n\nBuilt-in electrooverload fuse guards against abnormal heating which would cause excessive output.\n\n**CHROMALOR HEATING UNIT**\n\nNationally known for performance and long trouble-free life. Sealed to eliminate all fire hazards.\n\n**AUTOMATIC HEAT CONTROL**\n\nPrecision temperature control with finest heavy duty heat dissipating silver contact point thermostat.\n\n**PILOT LIGHT**\n\nLong life, low voltage, neon filled glow lamp indicates whether or not unit is operating.\n\n**BAKED ENAMEL FINISH**\n\nZinc coated steel is finished in silver gray polychrome enamel, baked on for enduring beauty.\n\n**BUSHING AND STRAIN RELIEF**\n\nProtects rubber insulation and prevents strain damage from being transmitted to interior wiring or terminals.\n\n**SIX FOOT RUBBER COVERED CORD AND PLUG**\n\nCurrent carrying capacity as prescribed by National Electric Code.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nIn the I-K-I vaporizer is an electric heating unit with automatic control which maintains exact proper temperature during the day and night. At this controlled temperature, scientifically speaking, sublimation takes place, which means\u2014\u201cconverting by heat into vapor\u201d. The minute invisible and odorless vapor particles from I-K-I Insecticide soon reach the air where they are deadly to insects. They will not form a film on mirrors, silver or glassware or stain walls, furniture, drapes or carpeting. Only about 1 gram of insecticide is vaporized per hour period. Even with its tremendous quantity, effective flying insect control will result in an area up to 15,000 cubic feet when no extreme air currents exist. Additional I-K-I units can be required to increase coverage if the premises are ventilated by exhaust fans or air conditioning. I-K-I is not effective outdoors or in open areas. Most effective operation results where rooms are closed for a time, such as overnight or over the week end.\n\n**SIMPLE AS A-B-C**\n\nThe I-K-I method of insect pest control is as simple as A-B-C.\n\nA\u2014Affix the I-K-I vaporizer to the wall. Always above the line of doors and windows.\n\nB\u2014Connect with any 110-120 volt AC outlet. Costs only a few pennies per month to operate.\n\nC\u2014Empty one envelope of powder, which comes with the I-K-I unit, into the cup. The white crystalline substance is the I-K-I insecticide, \u2018Lindane\u2019. One envelope should last about 30 days.\nFor the Home!\n\nEasy, safe, clean home insect control, with the I-K-I FUMER, using I-K-I LINDANE Economical . . . effective\n\nEngineered and manufactured by I-K-I Products, Inc., makers of the I-K-I Automatic Insecticide Vaporizer for commercial, industrial, and agricultural applications.\n\nThe I-K-I FUMER is a handsome, sturdy, highest-quality vaporizer, built to last, built to do the job.

It is produced for us by a company with a world-wide reputation, backed by 42 years of research knowledge gained in the production of insecticides. Like other \"wonder products\" such as Penicillin \u2014 Aureomycin \u2014 Dextran \u2014 PVP \u2014 DDT \u2014 2, 4-D and others, it remained in our laboratories until and unless efforts to bring it to perfection. The validity of its death dealing properties, especially to flying insects which elude spray residues, is now a part of scientific knowledge. Its effectiveness, and in spite of its extremely complicated chemical make-up and difficult production, its method of application and use has been made very simple and easy to understand.\n\nFOR SALE BY\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY\n\nKEMSA PRODUCTS LIMITED\n\nMONTREAL, QUE.

LIMITED\n495-517 WELLINGTON ST. WEST\nTORONTO\nCANADA\nMay 20, 1953.\n\nDirector of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have very recently published a new set of elementary arithmetics. These have been issued as a joint publishing effort on the part of our Company in Canada, and the Row-Peterson Company of Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief, Dr. H. G. Wheat, is the author of a new book on the teaching of arithmetic which presents a new philosophy for the teaching of arithmetic in elementary grades. Since the books have been introduced, we have received nothing but the highest praise for this new set of arithmetic textbooks.\n\nRecently the Ontario Department of Education have approved the same for listing on the list of approved texts for use in the schools of the Province of Ontario for Grades 3, 4, 5 and 6. The more elementary books for Primer, Book 1 and Book 2, could not be considered, as the Department of Education policy in this Province is not to list any approved arithmetics below Grade 3.\n\nBecause of the many up-to-date features contained in this new set of arithmetics, we believe, that the subject as presented in these several volumes will have some very direct appeal for use in the schools under your jurisdiction, and so for this reason, we are submitting a sample set of same to you, under separate cover, today.\n\nIt has occurred to us, that possibly the Superintendents throughout the Canadian Provinces should also have sample sets of these arithmetics in their possession, and we shall be very happy to provide the same if\nyou approved of this proposal and will provide us with the names of the officials concerned. We shall be very pleased to send the sample sets to the several individuals concerned free-of-charge.\n\nWe hope the set now going forward to you reaches you safely, and that you will get an early opportunity to make an examination of the same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCOPP CLARK CO., LIMITED\n\nE.T. Lindsey: JSA\nManager, Book Department.\nMay 25, 1953.\n\nNova Scotia School Book Bureau,\nDepartment of Education,\nHalifax, N.S.,\n\nDear Mr. Macleod:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 16 regarding surplus school books which you are prepared to offer at cost price, please be advised that we have carefully reviewed your list and feel that none of the books listed would meet our requirements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nNo. 37A\n\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\nMay 28, 1953.\n\nTo the Departmental Supplies Assistant: Mr. VACHON\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE PRIMARY OBJECT DATE REQUIRED\n\nSHIP TO Mr. H.

Avoid issuing requisitions for one item, only, except in cases of emergent necessity.\n3. Furnish exact details of product required.\nThe Mounting of Maps and Charts\n\nThe mounting operation is widespread in educational institutions and often involves the handling and display of large maps. The methods outlined here provide solutions for mapping out rooms, corridors, or other areas where maps need to be displayed appropriately.\n\n**Diagram:** A diagram illustrating various mounting techniques such as on walls, floors, and viewing stations.\n\n**Map Mountings:** Various map mountings described include:\n\n- **D-G Simplex Case**\n- **Single Roller Unit**\n- **MapRail**\n- **Navy Rack**\n\n**Specifications:** Details such as dimensions, weights, and materials used in each mounting option are provided.\n\n**Price List:** A price list for the map mounting equipment is included, listing items like:\n\n- Chartstands\n- Roller Steel Board Display Units\n- Single Roller Units\n\nAdditional equipment like accessories and clips for wall mounting are also covered in the documentation.\n\nContinuing The Mounting of Maps and Charts\n\nInstitutional display units and facilities for mounting maps and charts are highlighted, emphasizing how these can enhance learning environments. The use of map rail systems and cartographic displays is showcased as crucial tools in education and administration.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram:** Illustrations depict the setup of institutional map display units, including wall-mounted racks, ceiling hooks, and floor-standing displays.\n\n**Procedure:** Steps for setting up the map display units, from selection of materials to final installation, are outlined.\n\n**Accessories:** Lists of accessories such as clips, hooks, and mounting brackets are included to facilitate quick access during installation.\nActivity Globe and World Map for the Social Studies\n\nG203 20\" Project-Problem Slated Globe\n$59.75\n\n16\" Project-Problem Globe\n$52.00\n\nC59b Cartocraft Slated Outline Map\n$39.00\n\nSlated Spheres in Globe Mountings\n\n16\" Slated Sphere\n$37.00\n\n20\" Slated Sphere\n$52.75\n\nSimplified-Concept Globes and World Map for Introductory Levels\n\n16-inch Simplified Globes\n12-inch Simplified Globes\n\nG11PN0 Freedom Cradle\nG12PN0 Victory Cradle\nG12PN4 Floor Stand\nG12PN1 Plain Stand\nG12PN3 Movable Meridian\n\nNet Prices of 12-inch Globes\nG11PN0 Freedom Cradle $48.00\nG12PN0 Victory Cradle $43.00\nG12PN4 Floor Stand $39.50\nG12PN1 Plain Stand $39.50\nG12PN3 Movable Meridian $39.50\n\nNet Prices of 16-inch Globes\nG11PN0 Freedom Cradle $51.25\nG12PN0 Victory Cradle $48.00\nG12PN4 Floor Stand $43.00\nG12PN1 Plain Stand $43.00\nG12PN3 Movable Meridian $43.00\n\nNet Prices of Map 89xrs\n-10 Wood top and bottom $11.50\n-16 Top only, circular map, displayed $16.25\n-15 Frontal projection map $19.25\n-1D Polar, with cyclists $19.25\n\nSimplified Globe in Freedom Cradle G15PN0-12\n\nSimplified World Map\nScale: 400 miles to the inch\n\nThe Denver-Geffert Simplified World Map is a natural companion piece for the Denver-Geffert Simplified Globe, following the same pattern and covering the same area. It is the most simplified world map in the Denver-Geffert series. The map is drawn to show the true shape of the earth, presenting a unified view of the world. A complete network of parallels and meridians is shown, indicating true north and south lines, 15 degrees apart. Land areas are approximated for the more important parts of the world, while the less important parts are shown in fainter map form. The north polar inset corrects exaggeration caused by the cylindrical projection.\n\nIn studying the map, the graphic legend is used to explain the symbols and colors. Colors are carefully selected to show the map's subject matter in its simplest terms. Symbolic forms are used to convey geographic terms.\nThree Styles of Globe Globes\n\nAIR AGE GLOBES. All Air Age globes are available in three styles of mounting: the \"Freedom,\" the \"Victory,\" and the \"Liberty.\" All three are \"wall\" globes, resting in a wood cradle or cradle in which they may be turned. The \"Freedom\" is the most popular style for demonstration by the teacher and observation by the students. A flexible measuring strip or rule is a part of each globe equipment.\n\nNew, Stronger, Lighter Ball\n\nDG2 Globes feature a ball of revolutionary construction and appearance. It combines great strength with remarkably lightness of weight. The striking result is a ball with a perfectly smooth surface, making it unnecessary to apply plaster or other vulnerable coating. The result is an aerodynamic globe of unsurpassed beauty and of extraordinary durability.\n\nBeautiful, Clear Globe Maps\n\nNo pains have been spared in engraving and printing the Cartographic Globe Maps. The key plates are separate to a hair, the lettering sharp and legible. The colors are accurately matched to the actual appearance of the greens and browns which are consistent with the DG Wall Maps, a valuable aid in teaching geography.\n\nTeacher's Manual, Teaching the New Geography with the World Globe, accompanies all except machine-made globes.\n\nGlobes with Metal Appurtenances\n\nFloor Stand Globes\n\nWEIGHTED DISC BASE, MOVABLE MERIDIAN\n\nThis is the new safety mounting. The heavy base makes tipping difficult and virtually impossible. The globe is easily removed by pulling out the base.\n\nGlobe assembly pivots on stand allowing full flexibility. May be transferred from wall to floor or vice versa.\n\nNO-TIPPING* feature. The adjustable red ring is fitted with a plunger to prevent globe from dropping too quickly when transferred from floor to wall.\n\nGI6P1 16 inch Physical-Political Globe ........ $61.75\nGI6P2 12 inch Physical-Political Globe ......... 39.50\n\nFor orders on weighted disc base see $1.75\n\nTable Stand Globes\n\nPLAIN STAND\n\nThis style of globe stand has both a metal base and inclination arm (globe is readily pivoted on the base).\n\nGI6P1 16 inch Physical-Political Globe ........ $48.25\nGI6P2 12 inch Physical-Political Globe ......... 28.25\n\nMOVABLE MERIDIAN\n\nThis style of stand has a movable goniometer which fits into a fork firmly attached to the base.

Russell Smith, Ph.D., Columbia University\n\nMap Sharp World\n\nPhysical-Political\n\n400 Miles to the Inch\n\n64 x 44 Inches\n\nIllustrated in the right is an old edition which does not do justice to the map. It does not show in a general way the changes in the new edition, but the place names are now correctly located. The world is partially portrayed. The prime meridian is shown. The projection of Denoyer's semi-diffused projection is used. The map is drawn. See the 15x11 reduction of the map on the cover of this catalog. Prices appear at foot of page.\n\nMap S79rp World Map\n\nAmericas Centered\n\nPhysical-Political\n\n400 Miles to the Inch\n\n64 x 44 Inches\n\nThis beautifully colored map, using Denoyer's semi-diffused projection and large-scale elevation contours, well presents relationships between land and sea areas. The map is drawn in correct proportions.\n\nLatest political boundaries are shown. Important mountain ranges, important streams and air routes are shown. The map shows the significant trans-polar relationships on the equatorial scale of the main map.\n\nPrices appear at foot of page.\n\nOUTSTANDING FEATURES OF DENOYER-GEPPERT WORLD MAPS\n\nSpherecity. The most important single fact to geography is that the earth is a rotating sphere. The Denoyer semi-diffused projection used for the world maps suggests the spherical shape of the earth. The projection is a true representation, curving the meridian lines from the center of the map. Land masses near the sides of the map closely resemble their actual size.\n\nSame Scale for Land and Water Areas. As a world map is chiefly used for land areas, the Denoyer-Geppert projection permits land areas near water areas be portrayed with respect to the other. In the Denoyer-Geppert world maps the same scale is used for both land and water areas.\n\nPolar Insets. Each map has polar insets on the equatorial scale of the main map.\n\nOther features are listed on page 15.\nA vital new series...\n\nGraphic and pictorial\u2014interesting, inspiring, thought-provoking, timely\n\nThe visual aid you need for teaching The American Way\n\nThis series is now available for the first time in a new edition, enlarged to cover grade levels from kindergarten through high school. It is designed to be used by teachers and students at all levels.\n\nThe Challenge of Our Time is the teaching of democracy, its objectives, its benefits, its requirements of the individual, and how each person can contribute to the development of our movement and everyday living. No more important educational task confronts us today than the teaching of citizenship.\n\nToday's pupils are tomorrow's citizens. Their security, and our Country's security, depend upon their knowledge of citizenship and its responsibilities.

The effective yet pleasing coloring enables students to see the material to be shown, and emphasis of essentials makes these maps superior for class teaching purposes.\n\nAs an aid to the most successful teaching of American History, the Hart-Bolton Maps excel in these vital respects:\n\n1. Logical Presentation. The historical narrative commencing with the discovery of America by Columbus is presented in the present tense and unfolds visibly in natural sequence. The arrangement accords with current courses of study.\n\n2. Clear Emphasis. Proper emphasis is given economic and commercial developments in all periods. Effects of topography are well shown. Some developments are effectively presented. Important movements are readily visible.\n\n3. Unequaled Visibility. Unusually distinct yet pleasing coloring makes these maps particularly effective for classroom effectiveness. The lettering is a sharp black and easily read.\n\n4. Convenient Handling. The uniform size of all the DG History Maps, heavy backing, and convenient mounting make these maps easy to use and more effective than superior presentation. They may be had in any style of mounting, in any desired selection and arrangement.\n\n5. Low Price. These are inexpensive good history maps. However, be careful always to compare prices on equivalent mountings. NOT handmounted with Manila, etc.\n\nThe maps are designed to fit all standard courses. Moreover, any desired selection may be had, adapting the set to any special emphasis.\n\nA100 - Teachers' Manual. One free copy accompanies each set of 8 or more maps.

Gage Co. that they publish the Canadian Speller by Quance in two separate editions; one edition in two books authorized in Saskatchewan, and another edition in three books authorized in Quebec.\n\nBook 1 of the Saskatchewan edition covers Grades Two to Six, and Book 2 covers Grades Seven to Nine.\n\nBook 1 of the Quebec edition covers Grades Two to Four; Book 2 covers Grades Five to Seven, and Book 3 covers Grades eight and Nine.\n\nI am under the impression that you require the Saskatchewan edition. Kindly let me know if I am correct.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.W. Driscoll\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\nOTTAWA, November 1, 1933.\n\nMr. J.D. Sutherland,\nA/Supt.

Therefore, you may place an order for the Canadian Speller Books 1 and 2. A few of the Quebec edition will be ordered from time to time, but it is not worth while keeping these in stock, as they can be ordered when required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Driscoll\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\nOctober 24, 1933.\n\nMr. Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nQuite a number of teachers of Indian Schools in Alberta have been using some of our Primary material and according to their reports have found it very useful.\n\nSuch being the case I am taking the liberty of sending you under separate cover the following:\n\n1st - September, October and November issues of Primary Service.\n\n2nd - Grade I Seatwork.\n\n3rd - Grade II Seatwork.\n\n4th - Grade III Seatwork.\n\nPrimary Service is a monthly publication which sells ordinarily for $3.00 per year. Grade I Seatwork sells for 50\u00a2, Grade II Seatwork for 75\u00a2 and Grade III Seatwork for $1.00. As you will notice the Seatwork Exercises are mimeographed but we intend to print and revise these when the Department of Education in Western Canada finally decides on the reader which they will authorize.\n\nShould any of these publications be useful to you we shall be glad to quote you special prices or we will consider producing the Seatwork Exercises in a form more suitable for you. Do you think that they would be valuable in the Indian work throughout Canada?\n\nWe shall appreciate hearing from you at your convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nLIST OF SCHOOLS TO WHICH MAP OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN SUPPLIED.\n\nBlue Quills Res.

Economical buying is essential, and to assist schools to this end we are enclosing herewith a list of our books which we have especially reduced - books which are still in demand and selling in reasonable quantities.\n\nIn addition to the printed circular, we are attaching a special list of recently published books, and still further reductions in less recent books on which we are able to offer bargain prices for a limited time only. On orders received for any of these titles before the end of April, for delivery by next school opening, we are prepared to allow the low prices indicated on the special list. Many of these titles are in constant demand by teachers, supplying as they do supplementary reading material of the most valuable type.\n\nWe have pleasure in drawing your attention to these reductions in price, hoping that you will be in a position to pass on the benefits of such savings as can be made to the children. The reduced prices mentioned on the attached mimeographed list are NET.\n\nIn anticipation of your co-operation, and trusting that our efforts can be of service to you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M. DENT & SONS, Limited.\nSPECIAL REDUCED LIST FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL\nSUPPLEMENTARY READING MATERIAL & SCHOOL LIBRARIES.\n\nThese prices apply only on orders received before the end of April, 1934, for delivery not later than school opening in September, 1934.\n\n| Title                                                                 | Old Prices | Reduced Prices |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|\n| The Pat & Patsy Pre-Primer, by Alice & Lillian Harding               | .35        | .25            |\n|                                                                  | Paper      | .25            | .18            |\n| The Red Letter Primer, by M.E.

Barry of your department at Victoria advises us that he still recommends it as being the best one available and we might also add that the Education Department of the B.C. Government has just ordered 30 copies from us, in preference to their own new large wall map of B.C.

Driscoll\nSUPERINTENDENT OF STATIONERY\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFor some years past our Commission has presented each Indian boy and girl, when graduating, with a prayer and Hymn Book combined, and this service has been very highly appreciated by the boys and girls themselves as well as by their parents. Owing to the increased number per capita grants it will be impossible for our Commission to continue this presentation, without some assistance from your Department, and I have been instructed to ascertain if you will undertake to provide half of the number required this year. From the reports on hand it would appear that approximately 114 pupils will graduate this year from our Society's Schools, and if your Department will provide fifty of these our Commission will be responsible for the remainder. I enclose herewith for your information a sample of the presentation card which is fastened to the inside of the front cover of each book.\n\nAny help your Department may be able to furnish in the way suggested will be very sincerely appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThis book was presented to\n\nBy The Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada on the day of graduation from their Indian Residential School at\n\nDate Principal\nOttawa, August 3, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting to be supplied with approximately 50 copies of the Anglican Prayer and Hymn Book, for presentation to pupils graduating from Indian schools conducted under your auspices, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to supply this number on receipt of a requisition from schools where they are required.\n\nYou should notify the Principals to include on their requisitions a request for the number of Prayer and Hymn Books required for the purpose mentioned in your letter. They should state specially on the requisition that these are required for presentation purposes. You might let me know the best source of supply for these books, in order that, when the requests are received from the different schools, the desired information can be given to the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Church House, 604 Jarvis St., Toronto 5, Ont. Should your order be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the books are to be presented to boys and girls graduating from our Society's Indian Residential Schools, it is probable that the Board would allow a discount.\n\nOur Commission greatly appreciate the help which your Department is giving in this important matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\"PAGES FROM CANADA'S STORY\" supplied to Indian Day Schools from April 1st, 1933, to May 31st, 1934.\n\n| School                  | Part 1 | Part 2 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Big Cove                | -      | 3      |\n| Bel Ground              | 6      | 6      |\n| Caughnawaga R.

We are rather inclined to ask some gentleman into whose hands this correspondence falls to write us or to place the invoice (copy enclosed) into the proper channels for payment.\n\nThe Association is a professional organization of U.S. and Canadian libraries and librarians devoting its efforts and its resources to library development and to the promotion of education through voluntary reading and study. None of its activities are conducted for profit. Its books and pamphlets are priced only to cover editorial, manufacture, and distribution costs. It can ill afford, as you see, to lose even on a small transaction. Will you help us to straighten out the account in question?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nM.

It is advisable for country schools to order framing moulding at same time as Blackboard.\n\nProlac Asbestoslate Blackboard is made in widths of 3\u00bd ft. and 1 ft.; and in all lengths from 4 ft. to 8 ft., inclusive.\n\nThe weight of Prolac Asbestoslate Blackboard is 1.3 lbs. per square foot. The weight of natural slate is about 6 lbs.\n\nComes in black and green, single and double faced.\n\nSamples will be supplied upon request.\n\nSold by all leading dealers\nPROLAC \"Asbestoslate\" Blackboard has always been a Canadian Product\n\nWhy is it a Superior Blackboard\n\nProlac Asbestoslate Blackboard takes first place as a blackboard. It is as hard as rock; as black as coal\u2014through and through. The surface is non-reflecting, uniform, velvet smooth and dull. The chalk marks show clearly on the black ground, and they can be easily erased.\n\nAsbestoslate Blackboard has this advantage over natural slate, that it is manufactured in all lengths from 4 ft. to 8 ft. It does not crack nor break. It is fireproof, improves with age, costs less, and can be easily installed.\n\nIt is the blackboard of today. Prolac Asbestoslate Blackboard, owing to its modern composition, is indestructible. It will last as long as the school building itself. It is much less expensive than natural slate. The transportation cost is less. The installation cost is considerably less.\n\nPROLAC \"Asbestoslate\" Blackboard has always been a Canadian Product\n\nProlac Blackboard can be installed on any kind of a wall\u2014brick, plaster, or directly on the studding. Installation instructions are attached to the back of every sheet. It can be installed with ordinary carpenter tools. Each leaf of asbestoslate can be joined with a black metal joint that is very thin. It permits perfect writing the whole length of the surface of the board without interruption.\n\nWe sell the framing moulding, including the chalk trough (bottom tray which holds the chalk crayon).\n\nProlac Asbestoslate Blackboard is made in widths of 3\u00bd ft. and 4 ft., and in all lengths from 4 ft. to 8 ft., inclusively.\n\nThe weight of Asbestoslate is 1.8 lbs. per square foot. The weight of natural slate is about 6 lbs. Comes in black and green, single and double faced.\n\nSamples will be supplied upon request.\nSponsored by leading Educational Institutions at home and abroad\n\nExcerpts from Users' Correspondence\n\n\"The writer has tested the action of chalk pencil on 'Asbestoslate' and finds that the writing stands out full and clear. The 'Asbestoslate' blackboard having a surface of dull finish, there is no glare to the eye from any angle. As to the cleaning off of the chalk used on 'Asbestoslate' Blackboard find that this can be done as quickly as any other blackboard known to the writer.\"\n\n\"Fully convinced that Prolac 'Asbestoslate' Blackboard as manufactured by your Company is an up-to-date product in every respect and should have its place at the head of the class in any Educational Department.\"\n\n\"A board of this quality, light, substantial, and rigid\u2014in this latter respect out-classing . . . should prove very successful, and should have a large sale. Blackboards are very important as conditioning good work in a school, and I am sure a good material of this kind will find ready acceptance.\"\n\n\"Your 'Asbestoslate' blackboard is the best material for blackboard on market. I am delighted with it; it is equal to best slate blackboard.\"\n\nPROLAC LIMITED\nMakers of FIREPROOF WALLBOARD - WALLTILE - MARBLE - SHINGLES\n\u2022 THE STANDARD OF QUALITY \u2022 MADE IN CANADA \u2022\nLACHINE, P.Q., CANADA\nHOW TO INSTALL PROLAC ASBESTOSLATE\n\nAll walls must be plumb and square.\n\nAll work should be well planned. When necessary, cut blackboard to fit accurately before starting installation. Score across face of sheet and break off clean.\n\nWhere possible have solid wooden background of well seasoned lumber; and when solid wooden background is not built into walls, a simple frame background can be built as follows:\n\nThree horizontal parallel pieces of scantling with vertical pieces placed 16\" apart should be attached firmly to wall.\n\nWhere longer Blackboard than standard size is desired, arrange for vertical strip in frame to suit joint.\n\nSpecial flat metal joints are available making a completely smooth surface joint, which does not impair writing surface.\n\nWhere Blackboard is to be installed on solid walls, plug same 12\" apart to give firm screwing surface.\n\nDrill Blackboard and countersink holes for 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" No. 6 flat head screws \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" from edge of sheet, 12\" apart. Care must be taken to have holes fit plugging when installed to solid wall.\n\nWhen ready to apply Blackboard, place daub of Prolac Plastic Cement, size of walnut, 8\" apart on supporting back-up surface only... keep cement away from joints.\n\nTemporary bracing must be used overnight until Prolac Plastic Cement is set. Cover bracing with soft material to avoid injury to face of Blackboard. It is often advisable where other construction work is in progress to cover Blackboard with paper to avoid injury to surface.\n\nAlways keep Blackboards in original crates until actual installation has begun.\n\nWhen shipped from factory, Blackboard is liberally coated with pumice dust to prevent injury to surface in transit. Remove with clean dry eraser. Heavy flannel cloth can be used if necessary. Do not use water, soap or chemical preparations. They are injurious to all Blackboards, including natural slate.\n\nTo break in Blackboards, take flat side of chalk crayon and rub all over surface, erasing firmly. This procedure can be repeated, thereby improving writing surface immensely.\n\nProlac Blackboards improve with use.\n\nWe sell the framing moulding, including the\nASBESTOSLATE MANUFACTURING Co.\n\nManufacturers of Fire Proof Blackboards & Wallboards.\n\nASBESTOSLATE THE PERMANENT BLACKBOARD\n\nMONTREAL, CANADA, Sept. 20, 1934.\n\nMr. J.

E. Smith of Oka, Que., in his work with the Indian children. We believe that there might be a need for this kind of material if done in a very inexpensive form in your schools, and we are wondering if you will do us the favour of just glancing through it and letting us know if any quantity of these books if produced, could be used in the Indian schools either now or in the future.\n\nWe shall be sending you in a day or so a copy of a new book entitled \"Happy Hours in Garden, Field and Woodland\" by L. A. DeWolfe, Director of Rural Education, Truro.\n\nWe are very keen on this book as it is a combination of nature study, health and art, in fact the art of living in the country. There are many illustrations in it, and as it is my understanding that Indian children are, above everyone else, children of nature, I think that you will feel that a copy of this book should be in every Indian school.\n\nWhen I say this, I know that you will understand that we are not trying to \"high pressure\" you but merely stating that the book in our opinion is a charming piece of work. We hope that you will feel the same about it.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. M. DENT & SONS LTD.\n\nC. J. Eustace\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The letter is signed \"C. J.

DeWolfe, Director of Rural Education for Nova Scotia. These books are splendidly illustrated throughout, and inasmuch as they provide detailed accounts of the subjects with which they deal, we are hoping that you may find a place for them in your supplementary lists. HAPPY HOUSES particularly is charmingly written, and dealing as it does with all phases of nature, and the uses to which men put nature, should be of considerable practical help in Indian schools.\n\nWe are hoping to be favoured with a further order from you for both SAINTS FOR HOME & SCHOOL, and THE TEACHERS' OMNIBUS, for Grade One. We hope to issue the second Omnibus of this important series this Autumn. It will deal with Grade Two work just as fully as with the more junior work.\n\nProfessor George A. Cornish's STATISTICAL APPENDIX for Canadian School Geography, should be useful for all teachers who are using his geography texts in their schools. It is a handy work of reference, and as a matter of fact any teacher having geography lessons could not afford to be without it. Inasmuch as the price is only .30 cents a copy, let us hope that you may see fit to put a number of copies into your schools.\n\nFinally, may we draw particular attention to our new JUNIOR NATURE & LANGUAGE WORKBOOK. This is the latest addition to this deservedly popular series, and particularly suited, in our humble estimation, to the work done in your\nPHILIP PHILAN ESQ.\n\nschools.\n\nwe have a considerable stock of TWO LITTLE INDIANS and the JOE AND MOTH WORKBOOK left, and if you are able to take a further stock of these books at this time, the order will be greatly appreciated. We are prepared to offer a special price on the charts, both mounted and unmounted. If you care to consider putting in a set of unmounted charts in all the schools using your pre-primer, we can, I think, make you a very attractive price on quantities of either the mounted or unmounted charts.\n\nWe are expecting Mr. Button back at the end of this week, for which we shall all be thankful. It is no fun carrying on without direction, although it has been a sobering experience.\n\nI am sorry to say that we find that the A.E. Smith manuscript, entitled LOOSE LEAF STORY SYSTEM, was sent to you by registered mail on November 8th, and our records do not show that it has been returned. It is possible that our records are not all that they should be (in fact quite probable at this time of the year, just after the change from 1934 to '35 has been effected), but we should be grateful if you could have another search for this MSS made. The author is anxious to secure possession of it again.\n\nWith all best wishes, and hoping to have the pleasure of seeing you again shortly,\n\nWe are, Sincerely yours,\n\nJ.M. DEPT & SONS, Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 21, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Eustace,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo and have carefully noted contents of same.\n\nOn making another search, we found Mr. Smith's manuscript and I am enclosing it with this letter.\n\nAn order is being placed with the Government Stationery Office for 50 copies of Journeys Near and Far; 30 copies of Happy Hours in Garden, Field and Woodland; and, also, an additional 50 copies of Saints for Home and School.\n\nWith reference to the \"Teacher's Omnibus\" for Grade I, we have sent out practically all the copies that we previously obtained from you. I do not feel that it would be any use to send copies at the present time to teachers who have not received them, owing to the lateness in the academic year. You might, however, keep this in mind and write me again about the 15th of July and we will then consider placing them in the schools that have not already received them.\n\nAn order is, also, being placed with the Stationery Office for 300 copies of the Junior Nature & Language Work Book.\n\nWith reference to \"Two Little Indians\", I find that, since publication, we have used 7,412 copies and we have 399 in stock. We have also issued 8033 copies of the Work Book and have 382 in stock. The demand for these books at the present period of the academic year is quite small and, as the end of the fiscal year occurs next month when the Government Stationery Office takes stock, it is not likely that they will order any additional copies of these two books until early in the new fiscal year. Some time before the end of June, you will likely receive a substantial order for additional copies, in order that we may be prepared to fill requisitions in July for the books required for the academic year 1935-36.\n\nAn order will, also, be received for 100 copies of Pages from Canada's Story. We are requesting the one book edition as this is more convenient for our purposes.\n\nI hope that Mr. Button got back and that he is feeling in good health. Please remember me kindly to him,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. J. Eustace, Esq.,\nc/o J. H. Dent & Sons,\n224 Bloor St. W.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOTTAWA, January 31, 1935.\n\nMr. J.D.

Phelan -\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to advise you that I have the following books in stock which are not moving, and I would appreciate it if you could order so as to reduce my stock.\n\n| Item                          | Quantity |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| P.S.

These requisitions cover the \"Dominion Catholic Readers\" which are in stock at the present time. The quantities ordered on these requisitions will exhaust the supply of these books and they should not be re-ordered.\n\nThe twelve (12) Teacher's Manuals to accompany Corona Readers may be returned to Ginn & Co., 1517 Mountain Street, Montreal. They will issue a credit note for them.\n\nThe twenty-one (21) copies of Public School Writing Course #3 are of no use in our schools at the present time and we are, therefore, unable to take them.\n\nI have noted the other books mentioned in your letter and, within a reasonable time, requisitions will be forwarded regarding them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nThe King's Printer,\nOttawa.\nTHE ANGUS MACK COMPANY\n\nMOTOR GUIDES, ROAD MAPS, ADVERTISING\n\n145 ADELAIDE ST., WEST\n\nToronto 2, Ont.,\n\nFebruary 28, 1936.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nSchool Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMr. Robertson in your Surveys Branch tells me there is no hope whatever of your securing paper copies of the new map of British Columbia free of cost. However, I would be inclined to take a whack at them possibly through the Minister of Education, Mr. Weir.\n\nThis will confirm the rate I quoted you, $2.50, for mounting these sheets on linen with rods top and bottom. In the event of your deciding to use this map for the schools and have to purchase them from the B.C. Government, your total cost would be $4.00 per copy mounted.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTHE ANGUS MACK COMPANY,\n\nSales Department.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06",
