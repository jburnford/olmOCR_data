Lajoie, O.M.I.\n\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 the following provision was made for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the five schools in the Diocese of Grouard:\n\n| School                  | Amount |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| Grouard Residential School | $1500.00 |\n| Joussard                | $1500.00 |\n| Sturgeon Lake           | $1000.00 |\n| Vermilion               | $1000.00 |\n| Tabasca R.C.            | $2000.00 |\n\nTotal $7500.00\n\nFor some months past we have been requested on several occasions to supply new laundry machinery for the Grouard Residential School. This will cost approximately $3100.00. We endeavoured to find funds for this purpose in our appropriation for the fiscal year which closed on March 31, 1938 but owing to other heavy expenditures it was not found possible to provide this laundry equipment. It has, therefore, been decided to purchase this equipment immediately and pay its cost from the current year's appropriation.\n\nOwing to the present set up of our appropriation it will not be possible to expend at the five schools in the Grouard Diocese an amount greater than that provided. As a result the cost of the laundry machinery for Grouard will have to be deducted from the total amount provided. This means that there will be an amount of $4200.00 available for repairs, improvements and any new equipment that might be necessary at the schools in the Grouard Diocese.\n\nRt. Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nPlease let me know as soon as possible in what manner you wish this amount expended.\n\nAs all purchases have to be made through our Purchasing Agent it will be necessary for you to forward full particulars regarding any equipment that you require. Catalogue numbers and approximate cost of such equipment should be given for our guidance.\n\nIn view of the fact that Reverend S. Lajoie, O.M.I., has been in communication with us regarding the laundry machinery I am sending a copy of this letter to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIn my memorandum of March 10 I recommended purchase of laundry equipment for the Grouard Indian Residential School at an approximate cost of $3100.00.\n\nI understand that it was found impossible to secure this equipment before the end of March. Since that time we have received additional requests for new laundry equipment at the Grouard School and I would appreciate if immediate steps were taken to supply the equipment requested in my memorandum of March 10.\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in the appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nDirector.\nA R HOEY\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS DEPT OTTAWA\n\nPLEASE DON'T BUY LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT FOR GROUARD URGENT REPAIRS FIRST\n\nF S LAJOIE\n\nO M I GROUARD ALTA\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to my memoranda of March 10 and May 11 with reference to purchase of laundry equipment for the Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nI am today in receipt of a telegram from the principal in which he states that owing to the necessity of providing urgent repairs to the building he desires that the funds be used for this purpose rather than for the purchase of new laundry equipment. As yet he has not forwarded details regarding the repairs to which he refers in his telegram but in the meantime I would appreciate if no further action be taken in connection with the purchase of the laundry equipment.\n\nDirector.\nFeb 131-1-5\n\nMr. R. A. Roy, Sup't of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter the receipt of a copy of yours to Mr. Cee. Mrs. Langlois, SW. in connection with appropriation for schools in Trois-Rivieres, I wired you requesting postponement of acquisition of Laundry Equipment for Trois-Rivieres. Allow me to give explanation of my decision.\n\nWe are surely in need of a Laundry at the Trois-Rivieres Residential School. This is a pity for such an Institution to have to make the washing on our children just fit for an ordinary family.\n\nTrois-Rivieres, May 18th, 1938.\nOn the other hand, our finances do not allow us to go in such an expenditure.\n\nAccording to your statement, the laundry has to be taken from the appropriation to be used for the schools in the Truro District. The abbreviation of this year is far below what it was last year. Anyhow, it is up to us to use it in the best way. Heavy repairs in every mission are urgent. They can not be postponed. They will absorb more than the total appropriation. Having in mind that first we have to keep finances on sound basis, I have requested you not to buy the laundry. The Sisters are willing to suffer a year more not to create financial difficulties in the Vicariate. If the Dominion of Canada can not carry on this expenditure, how are we to wonder if our Administration tangled with the problem of destitution prevailing.\namongst Indians, does not feel itself able to do so.\n\nAnd this has to be appreciated in line with what I wrote you lately in connection with the financing of the new Boys' Building at Grand. Unless increase of revenue is secured we can not spend $3160.00 on a Laundry or on repairs. All repairs are urgent. They will be made first. Nevertheless we would appreciate receiving Laundry Equipment.\n\nIt may seem rather particular on questions of money this year. The future is not so bright. The prospects for the crops are worst than never in the Peace River District. If the drought keeps on we will have to buy table vegetables and cattle feed. There has been no rain since early last fall. We will have to slaughter our cattle to buy feed at high price. How long is...\nthe drought to last? This will reflect heavily on our finances for years.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.S. Logan, Q.M.\nAdministrator,\nFroward.\nM.R.A.

My standing was explained to the Department by a letter I addressed the same day to Mr. Hoey.\n\nIt is not without deep regret that I have taken such a step. I couldn't otherwise in the circumstances.\n\nRe: Repairs at Schools in Grouard Vicariate.\n\nAs the letter showing the appropriation for this purpose has been signed by Mr. Hoey, an answer was directed to him. Enclosed a copy.\n\nBy the last paragraph of yours of the 27th of May last, I feel that you are requesting more details than those given.\n\nOn the 19th of April, just after the reception of yours of the 11th of same, I addressed you a long letter explaining the situation for this year. My letter did not reach you or yours did not, but the fact is that I did not get any answer to my request of practical direction in the circumstances. Anyhow, here is the situation regarding each of the Missions in connection with appropriation.\n\nI- Grouard Road. School. Appropriation $1,800.00\n\nN.B. The following figures refer to my letter of\nMay 30th and to estimates attached addressed to Mr. Hoey.\n\n1) Repairs to Foundations of Convent and Principal's residence. Estimates: $1,200.00\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of May 19th, Cement had been ordered early in spring before the freezing out. At the exception of a few thousands of feet of common lumber, practically nothing else will be requested. Most of the expense will go to wages and sand and gravel.\n\n2) Sidewalks around new Boys' Building. $300.00\n\nCement ordered with other lot.\n\n3) Work at Sewers. $100.00\n\nAbout two hundred feet of Sewer Pipes needed. They have been ordered not to delay the work. Trenches could not be left opened for long.\n\n4) Digging a Well. $200.00\n\n1250 feet of rough lumber needed with about 200 feet of water pipes. Work.\n\nII- Joussard Resd. School. Appropriation: $1,500.00\n\nWarehouse, Garage, Machine Shop and Implement Shed combined: Estimates: $1,500.\n\n110 sacks of Cement ordered with lot coming to Grouard in order to have carload freight rates. Corrugated Galvanized Iron for roof ordered early in spring in order to start work. Work progressing rapidly.\n\nIII- Sturgeon Lake Res. School. Approp. $1,000.00\n\n1) Repairs to Foundations of Boys' Building. Estimates: $300.00\n\nAbout 100 sacks of cement needed.\nShould I order this cement or if the Department will do?... For such a small lot, I believe that we do better locally as we have to pay freight by the hundred pounds if we have less than a carload. I am asking for tenders which will be submitted to the Department if thought advisable.\n\nIt is very important that the work be done during the summer holidays not to disturb classes. The Principal and the teachers have requested me to start the work with the first days of July.\n\n2) Painting of the Boy's Building. Estimates: $700.00\n\nTo make a good job, 125 gallons of prepared paint are requested. Generally, we buy White lead and suitable Oil. We save a lot in that way.\n\nIV- Fort Vermilion. Appropriation: $1,000.00\n\n1) Chimneys. Estimates: $600.00\n\nBrick, lime, cement and lining bought and shipped last fall by last boat. It was too late to do the work last year.\n\n2) Chicken House. Estimates: $400.00\n\n8\u00bd squares of Corrugated Iron; 80 feet dip Starter and 40 feet Roof Top needed. Not ordered yet. Nails.\n\n70 sacks of cement for floor.\n\nLocal lumber to be used. Windows.\n\nV- Wabasca, R.C. Res. Indian School. Appropriation: $2,000.00\n\n1) Chimneys. Estimates: $1,200.00\n\nThe material was bought early in June last to be hauled on winter roads. We pay an average of two cents a pound in winter when it costs five or six cents for summer hauling, when it is possible to do. Besides, when I was notified to purchase through the Department's Agent, all the stuff had reached Wabasca since weeks.\nWabasca, to be continued.\n\n2) Diesel Engin. Estimates: $850.00\n\nThe old engine for the electric P\u00e2ant got out of order last winter. As replacement could not be deferred, the Principal took on him to buy a new one. This was before I was notified to pass through the Department for any purchase. Besides, when I heard, the deal had been done.\n\nWith this engine, we will save a lot on gas and oil. Nevertheless, had it not been absolutely needed, it would not have been bought. It was out of question to leave the Mission without light and power for a month or so.\n\nI would appreciate a prompt answer as to the material not bought yet. The season is so short that work has to be started early in summer to be over with cold weather.\n\nI presume you had the opportunity of meeting his Excellency Mgr U. Langlois, O.M.I. on his way for his consecration. His intention was to call on you and discuss some of our problems. He may not have gone in details as he is just coming in office. He left to me to submit to the Department the work to be done this summer.\n\nI feel it would be of some advantage to both parties if I could go to Ottawa and treat the many problems of our schools. As I am alone in the office, it is not easy for me to be away for two weeks. And besides, I have to spare every cent. The future does not look so bright. A terrible drought prevails in the District. Unless rain comes within a short future, the crop will be a complete failure. I'm taking steps to ascertain us feed for milk cows next winter. As to other cattle, we may have to slaughter them at fall. We will see then.\n\nPlease excuse me if I happen to be rather slow to answer letters. Days should be 48 hours long.\n\nHoping to have answered your desires, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. Lafole, O.M.I.\n\nGrouard.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They require that all material etc. be purchased through the office of our Departmental Purchasing Agent. You will, therefore, see the necessity in future of not purchasing anything for which the Department is expected to pay without first supplying us with full particulars in order to enable us to comply with the purchasing regulations. This rule may appear a little strict to you but I feel you will realize that those of us who are administering the appropriation provided by Parliament for Indian schools have to comply with any regulations that are made and to do this we require the co-operation of Indian Agents, Principals of Residential Schools and any other officials interested in Indian education. I realize that the schools in the Grouard Diocese are situated in rather isolated places to which it is often difficult to ship supplies. It will, therefore, mean that in future you will have to\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nGrouard, Alta.\nanticipate your requirements and let us know two or three months ahead what you require in order to enable us to purchase the articles through our Purchasing Agent and have them delivered to the respective schools at those seasons of the year when transportation facilities are best. However, in view of the action that you have already taken it has been decided not to require you to strictly observe the regulations this year.\n\nReferring particularly to the Grouard Indian Residential School I note that you have already purchased the cement an account covering the cost of which may be forwarded.\n\nI presume that the few thousand feet of common lumber required at this school can be purchased locally. If so, you may make the purchase but when forwarding the account in triplicate covering its cost you should attach to the account an explanation setting forth that this lumber was secured at a very reasonable cost and was secured from local sources.\n\nI note that you have also ordered the 200 feet of sewer pipe that is required. The account covering the cost of this will be paid.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the total expenditure for material and labour for the repairs at Grouard Residential School must not exceed $1800.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWORK.\n\nJoussard Indian Residential School.\n\nAppropriation: $1,500.00\n\nL) Warehouse, Garage, Machine Shop and Implement Shed.\n\nEstimates: $1,500,000\n\nN.B. Material ordered early in spring and work progressing rapidly. This was done before notification had reached me.\n\nBesides, due to scarcity of fur, many Indians were looking for work. They needed help. Work was started early.\n\nWater should be brought to the cow-barn. Impossible to give specifications before water has been located. If any money is left after the construction of the above mentioned building, specifications will be presented.\nREPAIR WORK\n\nWabasca Roman Cath.

As explained in previous correspondence, the material was bought early in January to be hauled on winter roads. We pay an average of two cents a pound in winter when it costs five or six cents for summer hauling, if possible. Besides, when I was notified to buy through the Department, material had reached Wabasca since weeks. Receipted bills can be produced at any time.\n\n2) Diesel Engin.\n\n800.00\n\nN.B. The old engin for the electric Plant got out of order last winter. As replacement could not be delayed, the Principal took on him to buy a new one. This was before I was notified to pass through the Department for purchases.\n\n$2,000.00\n\nThe engin was bought from Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd., Edmonton.\nREPAIR WORK.\n\nGROUARD Indian Residential SCHOOL.\n\nAppropriation: $1,800.00\n\n1) Repairs at Fundations of Convent & Principal's Residence. $1,200.00\n\n2) Sidewalks around New Boy's Building 300.00\n\nN.B. As pointed out in my letter of May 19th to Mr. Hoey, cement and pitch have been ordered early in spring, namely on the 16th of April, before the freezing out, then over a month the notification of passing through the Purchasing Agent had been received. Receipted bills can be forwarded at any time.\n\n3) Work at Sewers. 100.00\n\nN.B. Two hundred feet of Sewer Pipes Ordered and used as trenches could not be left open and sewer needed.\n\n4) Digging a well. 200.00\n\nN.B. Rough lumber bought locally. Water pipes and a pump will be needed. As we are not sure to get water it seems advisable not to buy pipes and pump before being in possession of water. Specifications will be forwarded when water coming.\n\n$1,800.00\nREPAIR WORK.\n\nFort Vermilion Indian Residential School.\n\nAppropriation: $1,000.00\n\n1) Chimneys: Estimates: $600.00\n\nN.B. Material: bricks, lime, cement and lining bought and shipped last fall by last boat. As the work could not be finished last fall, details will be provided when work completed this summer.\n\n2) Chicken House: Estimates: 400.00\n\n8\u00bd square of Corrugated Iron.\n80 feet dip starter.\n40\" Roof top.

To save money, it has been decided to build with peeled logs.\nUnfortunately, the carpenter has not given me yet the precise figures for the lumber needed for roof and upper floor and joices.\nLocal lumber could be obtained at better price than from a distant Lumber Yard.\nREPAIR WORK\n\nSturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nAppropriation: $1,000.00\n\n1) Repair to Fundations of Boy's Building $300.00\n   100 sacks of cement needed.\n   1 barrel pitch.\n\n2) Painting of Boy's Building and Principal's residence 700.00\n   To make a good job, 125 galls of prepared paint needed. Generally we buy White Lead and suitable Oil. Experienced painter.\n\nN.B. Let me point out that work should be done during summer holidays not to disturb classes. Could get material locally within a few days.\n\n$1,000.00\nGrouard, Alta., June 11th, 1938.\n\nMr. T.R.L. MacInnes, Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hasten to answer yours of the 6th inst. in connection with repair work to be done in each of the Indian Residential schools of the Vicariate of Grouard, Alta. Please find enclosed a sheet containing details for each School.\n\nYou will find that a great part of the material has been ordered already. This is due to the fact that notification that all purchases had to done through the Department has reached me too late. As pointed out, most of the material bought had to be hauled on winter roads or before the freezing out on account of reliable roads in summer. Let it be understood that, as far as I may be concerned, in the future, estimates and figures will be prepared soon enough that all material which may be requested could be bought through the Purchasing Agent of the Department.\n\nI hope that the misunderstanding which occurred this year will not interfere with the work. I have done by best to cope with the situation.\n\nI wonder if I should not point out the terrible situation developing in this part of Alberta. Hunting has been very poor for the last season, and there is no hope that fur will be restored for some time as, due to a prolonged drought, fire is sweeping the country. Fire extends from here to down North Fort-Vermilion and over. It is fortunate that we are doing some work in our Missions. Otherwise, most of the families would be starving. And what will happen next winter?... having this in view, we use as much as possible Indian work.\n\nI will consider a duty to provide with any further explanations or details asked for.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

All bills and statements will be forwarded in due time in the way specified by the Department.\n\nI was pleased to receive notification that advances have been made on the June quarter per capita allowances at the amount of $14,400.00.

Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn a letter from Reverend Father Lajoie, administrator of the Grouard Indian residential schools which I received lately, my attention is called to the drought condition that prevailed in that part of Alberta where these schools are situated. Father Lajoie informs me that even the school gardens did not produce vegetables in sufficient quantity and that such vegetables as are considered essential for the health of the children will have to be imported, at great cost due to transportation charges.\n\nLast year, the Department was able to help the Saskatchewan and Alberta schools that were in the drought area. Could not something similar be done this year for the Grouard group. Your inspector, Mr. Smith, might be asked to communicate with Father Lajoie and to make a report on conditions as he finds them.\n\nHoping that you will give this matter your usual sympathetic consideration, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I am writing to Inspector Schmidt for a report. On receipt of his reply your request for financial assistance to the schools in the Grouard Diocese will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following letter has just been received from Rev. J.O. Flourde, O.M.I.:\n\n\"In a letter from Reverend Father Lajoie, administrator of the Grouard Indian Residential Schools which I received lately, my attention is called to the drought condition that prevailed in that part of Alberta where these schools are situated. Father Lajoie informs me that even the school gardens did not produce vegetables in sufficient quantity and that such vegetables as are considered essential for the health of the children will have to be imported, at great cost due to transportation charges.\n\n\"Last year, the Department was able to help the Saskatchewan and Alberta schools that were in the drought area. Could not something similar be done this year for the Grouard group. Your inspector, Mr. Smith, might be asked to communicate with Father Lajoie and to make a report on conditions as he finds them.\n\n\"Hoping that you will give this matter your usual sympathetic consideration, I remain\"\n\nNo special provision has been made in the current year's appropriation for any such assistance as requested by Father Flourde. While I have no doubt that conditions may be as he states at the same time it is extremely doubtful if this Branch could make any allowance to a single group of schools. However,\n\nC. F. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nI should appreciate your letting me have a report regarding crop conditions in the Croward district during the past summer. At the same time you should state if any other Residential Schools in the Province of Alberta suffered any crop loss owing to drought.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, and it appears that at some of the schools at least the school gardens did not produce sufficient vegetables to meet their requirements.\n\nOur appropriation for the current fiscal year did not provide any funds that could be used to reimburse the schools for the loss that they have suffered. It might also be argued that conditions in the Grouard district are not similar to the conditions that prevailed last year in the Province of Saskatchewan when assistance was given to schools that had suffered from drought. The Province of Saskatchewan suffered from drought conditions for several years during which time no help had been given the schools and as a result their condition deserved special consideration last year. I understand that the summer of 1938 was the first time in many years that the Grouard district had suffered from drought.\n\nTaking the above into consideration and the further fact that the Church representatives recently met the Honourable the Minister with a view to having the deduction in the per capita rate restored, I feel\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nthat it would not be advisable to urge him to reimburse the schools in the Grouard district for a loss which, it is hoped, will not occur again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Owing to drought this summer, that part of the lake is now almost dry, except for a small body of water found on each side of a creek which runs through this bay. A ditch, several hundred feet long, was dug last summer, to bring the water from the creek to the end of the pipe-line. This, however, did not prove satisfactory, as the water therein was riled and weedy. I am attaching hereto a diagram showing the distance from the buildings to the water, at the present time. The pipe-line cannot now be used, as the shallow water in the lake and ditch is frozen through.\n\n(Sgd.) C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nGrouard, Alta.

It is understood, of course, that he will include in his report not only an outline of the work but an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Grouard school is located 13 miles from the village of Grouard, Alberta. The Joussard and Sturgeon Lake schools can be reached from Grouard. I would recommend that an engineer first proceed to Grouard and the Principal there will arrange for transportation to Joussard and Sturgeon Lake. If your engineer wires Rev. C. Fahler, O.M.I., Principal, Grouard Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alberta,\nregarding the time of his arrival at Crouard Railway Station the Principal will arrange to have someone meet him and take him to the school.\n\nThe Vermilion residential school, near Fort Vermilion, can only be reached at this time of the year by plane. I understand that a plane for Fort Vermilion leaves Edmonton every Sunday night.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nJanuary 4th 1939\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nGround Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 77 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

L'Heureux, Agent.\nDriftpile, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. L'Heureux:\n\nI should like to present a request for an electric bread-mixer for our school. With over a hundred growing boys and girls, and the Mission staff and employees to bake for, you can readily see that an electric bread-mixer has become a necessity. The mixer should have a capacity of approximately 125 pounds of flour.\n\nThis will not in any way hinder our girls from learning how to make bread, but will be a great time and energy saver. I shall indeed be grateful if you will approve and forward this request to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDriftpile Alberta\nJanuary 10th, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith request of the Principal, Grouard Indian Residential School to be furnished with an electrically operated bread mixer.\n\nI recommend the supply of same, herewith form 37\u00bd in triplicate, also letter from the Rev. Principal.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief,\nWelfare & Training Division,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received from His Excellency Mgr U. Langlois,\nO.M.I., of Grouard, a report of the survey made by the Engineer sent\nby the Department to investigate on the water problem at the Grouard\nIndian Residential School.\n\nAccording to the report, the Engineer recommends the\nbuilding of a large cistern where the water coming from the roofs\nor pumped from the lake could be stored for winter use.\n\nI have no explanations. It seems the most practical way,\nand the least expensive too, to secure water. There is no doubt that\nthe project is approved by His Excellency Mgr Langlois since he asks\nme to wire him the answer if the Department agrees to the proposition.\nDue to mild weather and to the fact that there is practically no frost\nin the ground, the work could be done this winter.\n\nThis cistern would be built with the credit asked for\non the fiscal year 1939-40. Some material will be needed, I presume\nthat the authorization of doing the work would mean that the material\ncan be bought locally, accounts to be rendered in due time and in due\nform.\n\nWould you, please, send me the answer at the following\naddress: 600 Cumberland Street, Ottawa, unless you wire yourself to\nMgr Langlois. Thanking you in advance for the attention.\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nPf S. Lejoie, O.M.I.,\n600 Cumberland,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1939.\n\nDear Father Lajoie:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant in which you state that you received a letter from His Excellency Mgr. U. Langlois, O.M.I., in regard to a survey on water problems made by one of our engineers at the Grouard Indian residential school.\n\nThe report of the engineer has not yet reached us from the Surveys & Engineering Branch. As soon as it is received immediate consideration will be given to its contents and either Bishop Langlois or yourself will be advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Return sheet and receipted invoices attached.\n\nLet me call your attention that I am reporting only the work done at foundations, cellars and sidewalks. A lot of other repairs was performed too, but as the credit was exhausted, I am not reporting on. Most of the sewers have been fixed and a lot of work done to bring water in the barns. Water is a very hard problem here.\n\nA car load of cement was purchased in April in order to profit by frozen roads for hauling, and to start the work early in the season.

For drinking water they are using melted ice obtained from the main Lesser Slave Lake, eight miles away. For domestic and sanitary purposes they are hauling water in barrels from the remnants of Buffalo Lake, a distance of 400 yards. For stock watering purposes they have a quite satisfactory well.\n\nBuffalo Lake, which is now at its lowest recorded level, is, even at its best during high water periods, quite unsatisfactory in my opinion. It is simply a huge slough several square miles in extent when full but last summer was a big hay meadow. There is a small duneish creek formed by seepage, flowing through it from which they are now obtaining their domestic water supply. Today there was two feet of rusty-coloured water in the water-hole cut in the ice, which I am confident is likely to be subject to pollution and contamination. They have a pump for getting water out of this so-called lake, which is now out of action due to a complete absence of water at the intake. The pump would be useless in wintertime anyway due to the 2-inch water main freezing as it is only a couple of feet beneath the surface. Even during periods of high water, I believe this source for domestic water to be unsatisfactory.\n\nThe present well has a flow of approximately 1200 gallons (perhaps more) per day but I would condemn it as a source of domestic supply as it is too near the barn and in the barnyard and so subject to contamination from surface water. The water has a satisfactory taste and was also quite satisfactory for washing my hands in as the soap lathered well. However, the Sister in charge of the kitchen stated it was not satisfactory for laundry purposes and for washing the dishes as it required too much soap. She prefers to use melted snow water in winter and rain water in summer. While there may be something in what she says, I believe she has been doing it for so long that it has become a habit and would instinctively balk at any sudden change but might accept a change for the better slowly.\nRecommendations\n\nThere is not only the well mentioned above but another well sixty feet from it used for stock watering purposes, both wells being about 33 feet deep. There have also been two other wells within two hundred yards getting water at the same level and I have been informed that there are some slight water seepages on Buffalo Lake shore in this close vicinity, all of which leads me to believe that there is a water-bearing strata about thirty to forty feet deep in the area occupied by the Mission Buildings.\n\nConsequently, I would recommend that a well be dug (not drilled) on a site selected behind the Boys' Dormitory. I do not expect a big flow of water and so suggest that the well be about 6' x 8' to form a big collecting basin at the bottom. If a satisfactory supply is found, a pump should be installed with a 3000-gallon lumber tank built over it, from which water will flow by gravity to pressure tanks already installed in five buildings, namely Boys' Dormitory, Convent, Priests' House, Kitchen and Laundry. The gravity supply system would require to be buried about seven feet underground.\n\nThe above recommendation, if carried out, would I think provide all the main mission buildings with a satisfactory supply for drinking, ablutions, bathing, water closets and fair fire protection, and might in time be accepted by the Sisters for kitchen and laundry purposes.\n\nThe estimated cost is $1,700.00 but has been worked out roughly and is subject to change after I have had an opportunity of checking prices when passing through Edmonton.\n\nThere is one related question which I should mention and which will apply to any proposed work for the Mission Schools at Jeussard, Sturgeon Lake and Fort Vermillion. The current wages paid by all these schools for labour is low and a little more than half that set by the Fair Wages Scale. If our Engineering Branch does the work itself, it will have to pay the Fair Wages Scale which for labourers, for example, is 45\u00a2 per hour while the local rate is 20\u00a2 or 25\u00a2 per hour. You can see where this would be upsetting locally. Consequently, I would suggest that any work done be turned over to the school authorities within the Indian Branch for execution, our Branch remaining entirely in an advisory capacity. This arrangement, I believe, would save the department money and be more satisfactory all around and especially to the local school authorities who are thoroughly conversant with local conditions and labour.\n\n\"G.

It is possible, however, that there might be some saving on the estimated cost of the improvements as it is our intention to request you to have the work done under your supervision. You realize, of course, that the engineer's reports have just reached us and, as both our Main Appropriation and the Supplementaries for the fiscal year 1939-40 have been prepared, it is not possible to provide funds other than those already specified in our 1939-40 Appropriation.\n\nConsidering the whole question, the Department feels that, in view of the representations made by yourself and the further information received from our engineer, it would appear advisable to improve the water situation before making any other expenditure. The total amount provided in the Appropriation for 1939-40 for the five schools in the Grouard Diocese cannot be exceeded and, consequently, until the improvements to the water system of the schools are made and the Department is definitely aware of the actual expenditure, it will not be possible to consider further purchases or the authorization of additional repairs and improvements.\n\nI thought it advisable, before requesting the Surveys and Engineering Branch to issue definite instructions regarding the manner in which the water supply should be handled, to write you fully, in order to save correspondence and so that both of us may be fully aware of the situation from a financial standpoint.\n\nWhen you have had an opportunity of studying the contents of this letter, I would like to hear from you. It would be appreciated if your reply was forwarded as soon as possible, as, if we are to proceed with the improvements to the water supply at the four schools mentioned above, and also at the Wabasca School when the engineer's report is received, it will be advisable to make the necessary arrangements at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

He recommends digging a well close to the present pump house on the lake shore.\n\nShould this well prove unsatisfactory, it will be necessary to go out into the lake and lay sufficient pipe to a depth sufficient to make it safe against frost.\n\n(3) Sturgeon Lake:\n\nDigging a well near the lake and providing tanks, piping, etc., in connection therewith.\n\nShould the well prove a failure, it is recommended that the intake be extended another 350' and laid in such a way as to be usable in the winter season.\n\n(4) Vermillion:\n\nDigging a new well and supplying a new pump house to house a 3000-gallon tank and pump\u2014a new pipe line to be laid to tanks in the basement of the convent and boys' dormitory.\n\nIt may be necessary to have a water pump for distribution.

S. LaJoie, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\nBanff, Alberta,\nFebruary 21st, 1939.\n\nREPORT on Water Supply Situation at\nGrouard Residential School, Alta.\n\nThe present water supply situation at this school is entirely unsatisfactory. For drinking water they are using melted ice obtained from the main Lesser Slave Lake eight miles away. For domestic and sanitary purposes they are hauling water in barrels from the remnants of Buffalo Lake, a distance of 400 yards. For stock-watering purposes, they have two satisfactory wells at the barns.\n\nThe sanitary and plumbing facilities within the school buildings are the best of the four residential schools that I visited during this trip, namely Grouard, Jouxard, Sturgeon Lake and Fort Vermilion, and would be adequate for the present situation if they had a proper source of water supply.\n\nBuffalo Lake, which is now at its lowest recorded level, is, even at its best during high water periods, quite unsatisfactory as a source of water supply in my opinion. It is simply a huge shallow slough several square miles in extent when full, but last summer was practically dry except a big hay meadow. There is a small sluggish creek formed by seepage flowing through it, from which they are now obtaining their domestic water supply. On the 31st January, 1939, there were two feet of rusty-coloured water in the waterhole cut in the ice which I am confident is likely to be subject to pollution and contamination.\n\nThey have a pump for getting water out of this so-called lake, which is now out of action due to a complete absence of water at the intake. The pump would be useless in winter time anyway due to the 2\" water main freezing as it is only a couple of feet beneath the surface. Even during periods of high water, I believe Buffalo Lake to be unsatisfactory as a source of domestic water supply.\n\nThe main well at the barn has a flow of approximately 1200 gallons per day. The other well close at hand has a much smaller flow. I would condemn both these wells as sources of domestic water supply owing to their proximity to the barn and the danger of their being contaminated by surface water. The water\n\n...........\nhas a satisfactory taste and was also quite satisfactory for washing my hands in as the soap lathered well. However, the Sister in charge of the kitchen and laundry stated it was not satisfactory for laundry purposes nor for washing the dishes as it required too much soap. She prefers to use melted snowwater in winter and rainwater in summer. While this opinion can be appreciated as there is no softer water obtainable anywhere, still she may accept and use similar water to that obtained in the well at the barn if it can be obtained cheaper and more economically and with no more effort on her part than by turning on a faucet.\n\nBoth wells near the barns are about thirty-three (33) feet deep and have about five (5) feet of water standing in them. Two other wells have been dug in the past but are not now used; both had moderate flows of water. One of them outside the convent was 20 feet deep and the other between the priests' house and the lake shore was about 6 feet deep. I was informed that there are some slight water seepages along the shore of Buffalo Lake in the vicinity of the school buildings, all of which leads me to believe that there is a water-bearing stratum about 20 feet deep in the area occupied by the school buildings. Consequently, I think that sufficient water can be obtained from a well or wells for the school purposes, especially if a storage reservoir is built for banking up a supply of water on days when little is used for use when a larger quantity is required, such as on washdays and for fire protection purposes.\n\nThe residential buildings of the school are provided with water closets and septic tanks so the new well should be sited above the disposal fields and away from possible runoff water from the barns. With this in mind, I selected a site towards the rear of the boys' dormitory where they should try first for water. This site is on a slight eminence with the surface sloping away in practically all directions.\n\nI would recommend that this well be dug 8 x 8 feet to form a collecting basin at the bottom and it is expected that water will be found within 40 feet. If a satisfactory supply is found, a pump should be installed with a 3000-gallon lumber tank built over it, from which water will flow by gravity to pressure tanks already installed in five buildings,- namely Boys' Dormitory, Convent, Priests' House, Kitchen and Laundry. The gravity supply system should be buried below frost line and the pump and 3000-gallon tank housed in a warm building.\n\nThe above recommendations, if carried out, would I think provide all the main school buildings with a satisfactory all-year supply of water for drinking, ablutions, bathing, water closets and fair fire protection (combined with chemical extinguishers), and might in time be accepted by the Sisters for kitchen and laundry purposes.\n### Estimate of Cost\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 130 feet - 2-1/2\" galv. iron pipe | 57\u00a2 f.o.b.

If our Engineering Branch does the work itself, it will have to pay the fair wage scale which for labourers, for example, is 45\u00a2 per hour, whereas the local rate is 20\u00a2 or 25\u00a2 per hour. It can be understood that this would be upsetting locally.\n\nConsequently, I would suggest that any work done be accomplished by the school authorities under the control of the Indian Affairs Branch; our Engineering Service remaining entirely in an advisory capacity. This arrangement, I believe, would save the department money and be more satisfactory all around and especially to the local school authorities who are thoroughly conversant with local conditions and labour.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our Engineer rules out both Buffalo Lake and present wells near barn, as both these sources of water are likely to be subject to pollution and contamination.\n\nThe present wells at the barn apparently furnish a satisfactory water supply for the stock.\n\nWe recommend the undertaking of the work estimated by our Engineer to cost $1,750.00, which estimate is detailed on page 8 of his report. This covers the digging of a well, installing a pump and a 3000 gallon tank, in a building to be constructed near the well, and the laying of the necessary pipe below frost line to carry water, by gravity, to pressure tanks already installed in the buildings.\n\nLabour costs in above estimate are based on prevailing rates of pay in the district as mentioned in the last paragraph of our Engineer's report.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

Let me, first, thank\nyou for the interest you pay to the question.\n\nAfter having discussed the question with\nHis Excellency Mgr Ubald Langlois, O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic,\nI am authorized to tell you that the authorities of the\nVicariate fully agree with the Department, I mean that it\nis advisable to improve the water situation before making\nany other expenditure. So, let it be understood that the\nimprovement of the water system in our schools will have\nthe priority on any new expense. (As pointed out in your\nletter, Wabasca makes an exception, material and furniture\nhaving been shipped by now.) Would there be a balance left,\nit will be used for the most urgent needs.\n\nI understand that an Engineer is to make\na survey of the water supply at our Wabasca School. We are\npleased to hear this. So, our water problem will be settled\nin a definitive way.\n\nIt is too early to discuss the details,\nthe engineer's report not being available yet. Nevertheless,\nlet me add a word concerning Grouard. We have had\nthe water coming in wells analysed at the Provincial Labora-\ntory in Edmonton. This water has been classified as very\nhard, so poor that we wonder if it would be advisable to\ngo in heavy expenses to secure such water. We feel that it\nwould be of good policy to inquire on the feasibility of\nboring a well deep enough to get soft water. Soft water\nhas been encountered at 680 feet at McPhannan. This water\nis used with satisfaction in Hospital and Hotel.\nI am gathering data on the problem. Information secured will be communicated as soon as at hand. You easily understand that we are anxious to know how it will turn out.\n\nRest assured that we will do our best to profit by the cooperation the Department is willing to give us in the solution of one of the most important problems we are facing. We are awaiting for the recommendations of the Engineer to make the first move.\n\nThanking you once more for the interest you may to this question, I remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Of course, all work would be under the supervision of an engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 amounts are provided for new equipment, repairs and improvements at the above-mentioned schools. I have already written to the Administrator of the Grouard Diocese pointing out to him that owing to the necessity of immediately improving the water supply at the four schools mentioned it is considered that this work should be a first charge against the money provided for repairs and improvements at the above-mentioned schools in the 1939-40 estimates. I have today received his reply approving our using the money in the manner suggested in the preceding sentence.\nIt would be appreciated if the Honourable the Minister would approve our authorizing the management of the above-mentioned four residential schools to proceed with the necessary work along the lines suggested by the engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nMar 27/39\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

The mild season is so short here that we would like to start the work as soon as possible.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of March 22nd, I have gathered data on the experiments made in the country. Water has been encountered nearly everywhere at different depths varying from 65 feet down. As to the nature of the water, I could not get any precise information as the boring was done for oil.\n\nHaving heard with great favour of Mr. Frederickson of St-Paul, Alta., the fellow who bore the well at the Indian School there, I wonder if it would not be profitable for us to call this gentleman here to study on the spot the best location for a well. Would you authorize the trip from St-Paul to here?.... We could have the benefit of his experience.\n\nIf there is no change in the temperature, the situation will be more serious next winter than during the past. There is very little water in the lake just now and it is receding every day. This water is far from being soft. We long for a change.\n\nHis Excellency Mgr U. Langlois, O.M.I., who is presently in the East, will presumably call on you in a few days. There is no doubt that a final decision on what is to be tempted will be arrived at.\n\nThanking you in advance, Dear Sir, for the attention you will give to this problem, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. LaJoie, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-5, part 3)\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant in connection with making improvements to the water supply at Grouard, Vermilion, Sturgeon Lake and Joussard Indian residential schools.\n\nIn order to keep our correspondence in proper shape a separate letter is being forwarded to the Principal of each school. Copies of these letters are enclosed for your information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRe: Water Supply Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nThe engineer sent by the Department reported in connection with the above as follows:\n\nThat this well be dug 8 x 8 feet to form a collecting basin at the bottom and it is expected that water will be found within 40 feet. If a satisfactory supply is found, a pump should be installed with a 3000 gallon lumber tank built over it, from which water will flow by gravity to pressure tanks already installed in five buildings; namely, Boys' Dormitory, Convent, Priests' House, kitchen and laundry. The gravity supply system should be buried below frost line and the pump and 3000 gallon tank housed in a warm building. He estimates the cost of this work at $1700.00.\n\nThe engineer suggested that any work done be undertaken by the school authorities under the control of one of our engineers. I am today informed by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that an engineer will visit your school at as early a date as possible and give you the necessary instructions in connection with the work.\n\nEarly next week an accountable cheque for $1700.00 will be forwarded to you. As soon as the work is completed you should forward a voucher in triplicate to which should be attached receipts giving detailed\n\nRev. F. J. Habay, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\ninformation regarding the manner in which the money was expended. If there is any balance remaining it should be returned to the Department. This is the only manner in which we can properly handle the work from an accounting standpoint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n24th May, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of the 18th instant in regard to the water supply at the Grouard Indian Residential School and note that $1,700 is being forwarded to the Principal of the school. As soon as possible we shall have one of our Engineers visit the school and give definite instructions to the Principal of what is to be done.\n\nDirector.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\nDATE: May 31, 1939\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Rev.

I presume that the Department has plans for such building suitable for Indian Schools.\n\nWe have to do something in that line at Joussard. The Ice Barn is falling down. It has been question to get a Frigidaire for Joussard, but a keen study of the question has brought us to the conclusion that we don't dispose of the electric power requested for a frigidaire. We don't want to overload the batteries. We will have to stay with Ice Barns.\n\nI am aware that at Resolution, N.W.T., they have a system of refrigeration by salt. This has been installed seven or eight years ago, at least. It may be that the plans have been provided by the Department. I would be interested to get information on this system.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to this question,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

I am today in receipt of the following letter from Rt. Rev. U. Langlois, Bishop of Grouard:\n\n\"Referring to our recent conversation about the water problem at our Indian Residential Schools I suggest that your Department hires the services of Mr. J. L. Cervais, of Montreal, to locate the exact spot where the wells should be drilled to assure a sufficient supply of water.\n\n\"Mr. Cervais is not what is commonly called a water wizzard; he is a real scientist, a radio-physic prospector of great experience who specialized in the finding of water and well drilling. As you know, the science of radiation has lately made immense progress and the success Mr. Cervais has met with proves that he has attained a high degree of proficiency in this new science. His address is 8609, St. Denis St., Montreal, and his phone No. Dupont 2965.\"\n\"May I mention that among the numerous credentials he would be glad to show you is a letter of recommendation to the Committee of National Defence signed by the Hon. Minister of Public Works, Mr. Cardin.\n\n\"I would suggest that Mr. Cervais be sent immediately to Joussard, Sturgeon Lake and other schools in Alberta or Saskatchewan where the water supply is not sufficient, and where your engineers have recommended the drilling of deep wells. In my humble opinion it is worth while trying the ability of this man, specially when his ability is so highly recommended. Mr. Cervais is not busy for the moment and he would be willing to undergo this trial almost for a nominal fee besides his expenses.\"\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDecember 7, 1939.\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Water Supply Systems at Crouard, Joussard, Vermilion and Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 24th ultimo with attached copy of a memorandum that you had received dated the 22nd ultimo from Dr. McGill with regard to the water supply systems at the above schools.\n\nFrom recent reports received from Mr. Walker, we are now in a position to give the following information:\n\nCrouard Water System:\n\nThe driller did not get water at the original depth estimated, and Mr. Walker advises that Father Lajoie has had the well continued to a greater depth in the hope of securing a suitable flow of water. On November 17th the well was down 650 feet with hopes that the drilling would soon break through shale formation into water bearing strata, particularly as water was found in a well drilled in the vicinity at approximately the above depth. Under the circumstances however, Mr. Walker in a letter to Father Lajoie, dated November 20th, authorized the continuing of the well to 800 feet, which is as deep as the driller can go with his machinery.\n\nIf, however, water is not found then, Mr. Walker has suggested to Father Lajoie that they drop back to the 330 foot level and arrange to utilize the flow of about three gallons a minute of water that was found at this latter depth. It is Mr. Walker's opinion that, while this water when encountered was muddy, that it will clear in time.\n\nMr. Walker is in the same position as this office when he states that he is not aware under what financial arrangement Father Lajoie has been able to extend the well so much deeper than originally estimated, but assumes that he has funds available for the purpose separate and additional to the original $1,700.00 allotment. Mr. Walker's statement of expenditure to date and estimated additional expenditure is as follows:\n\n\"Original allocation as per your letter of June 8th and as shown distributed in my report and letter of instructions of August 17th ...........................................$ 1,700.00\n\nJ.M.

All distribution mains laid 7' underground and covered.\n\n2. Well down 650 ft. At 330 ft., flow of approximately three gallons per minute topped. This was soft water but not clear. Father Lajoie has continued drilling and as he had reached 650 ft. before advising Mr. Walker, the latter instructed him to continue to the maximum depth capacity of the equipment on the ground, namely 800 ft., if necessary.\n\nThe work still to be done consists of completion of well drilling, the construction of a small pump house and the installation of the pressure tank and centrifugal pump.\n\nJoussard Water System:\n\nOn the 20th ultimo Mr. Walker wrote Father Lajoie in accordance with instructions sent from this office based on authorization contained in your memorandum of the 14th ultimo for the undertaking of work at this school with $2,700.00 which Dr. McGill was arranging to provide.\n\nMr. Walker suggested to Father Lajoie that it would be advisable to get drilling of the Joussard well under way immediately, and to do this it would be necessary to get another rig for the job providing the driller he then had at Crouard was likely to be detained for some time.\n\nSince writing Father Lajoie on the 20th ultimo, Mr. Walker has received no report. Therefore, as far as our information goes at the moment, the standing of this project is as follows:\n\n\"(A) Authorized Expenditure as per your letter of November 18th.................................. $2,700.00\nEstimated additional funds required, based on all available information to date....... Nil.\n\n(B) Work Done: No work done to date.\n\n(C) Work to be done: Drill well near main building, install pressure tanks, make pipe connections and build pump house.\"\nFort Vermilion Water System:\n\nUnder date of October 20th last Mr. Walker received the following telegram from Father Huguerre:\n\n\"Well and cribbing down thirty two feet (Stop) Overcome by surface water coming fifteen hundred gallons per hour (Stop) Two twelve gallon buckets working steady with horses cannot keep up (Stop) No pump available here (Stop) Waiting your suggestions.\"\n\nAs the above depth would be below the water surface in the river, Mr. Walker considered that it was river water entering the well instead of surface water and on October 26th sent the following telegram to Father Huguerre:\n\n\"Retel do not dig well any deeper at present but extend cribbing to bottom of well (Stop) If possible complete trenching laying and connecting pipe install pressure tank complete wiring and erect pump platform chain hoist etc. (Stop) Advise soon as pump received and installed how high above bottom water rises in well before pumping.\"\n\nThe following is Mr. Walker's cost estimate and work statement:\n\n\"(A). Original allotment.................................$1,650.00\nEstimated additional amount required.............350.00\n\nTotal estimated expenditure for season.......$2,000.00\n\n(B). Work done.\nDistribution mains installed in 7 ft. trenches, connections made and back filling completed. Well dug and cribbed. Pressure tank installed and connected.\n\n(C). Work to be done.\n1. Pump to be installed in cribbed well.\n2. Trench to be dug and pipe to be laid from well to a point below water surface in river, providing seepage from river into well through river bank is inadequate and makes this intake necessary.\"\n\nSturgeon Lake Water System:\n\nMr. Walker advises that according to reports received from Father LaJoie, all land work scheduled for the Sturgeon Lake installation, consisting of excavating trenches, laying pipe, back-filling, connecting pipe and installing pressure tank, has been done. It has been noted, however, that Mr. Walker had suggested to the principal of this school that it was advisable to endeavour to excavate some 450 lineal feet of trench into the lake. When Mr. Nelson visited this school he was told that it was considered feasible to undertake this latter work by hand. Any other method such as shipping a power excavator to Sturgeon Lake was considered too expensive for so small a job. However, in a later report, dated November 27th, Father LaJoie advised Mr. Walker that so far they had not been successful in extending the trench into deep water by hand methods.\nMr. Walker has written the principal of this school, Father Fournier, asking him if he considered that this trench could be extended into the lake by working through the ice after the ice was about 6\" thick. Mr. Walker further advised that if this method was not feasible, then urgently funds would have to be provided for drilling a well estimated to cost $500.00. Mr. Walker advises, however, that no reply has as yet been received from the principal of the school, Father Fournier, with regard to this matter.\n\nIf it is found necessary to drill a well, the pump house and pipeline from the lake can remain as it is for use when the lake is not too low or frozen over, and would be available at certain times for fire protection and possibly could be converted later into years of standby supply if some feasible method can be found to deepen the intake into the lake. Mr. Walker considers this an important point as from the standpoint of fire protection, it is to the advantage of the school to secure water from the lake if possible.\n\nFrom the above it will be noted that at the end of November, Mr. Walker's information was not complete enough to allow of a definite estimate of funds required or work to be done. However, in his report Mr. Walker submits the following statement as being the best he can supply under the circumstances for funds required and report on work done or proposed:\n\n\"(A) Original allotment $1,000.00\nEstimated additional amount required $500.00\nTotal Estimated expenditure for season $1,500.00\n\n(B) Work done: Pipe laid and connected in trenches and to installed pressure tanks. Trench into lake started but not completed.\n\n(C) Work to be done: Trench into lake to be completed by working through ice if possible. If impossible then well to be drilled at an estimated additional cost of $500.00.\"\n\nSummarizing the preceding reports with reference to expenditure, the following statement is obtained:\n\n| Estimated Expenditure for Season | Allotment | Additional Funds Required |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Grouard                          | $3,321.00 | $1,700.00                |\n| Joussard                         |           | $1,621.00                |\n| Fort Vermilion                   | $2,000.00 | $2,700.00                |\n| Sturgeon Lake                    | $1,500.00 | $1,650.00                |\n|                                  |           | $350.00                  |\n|                                  |           | $1,000.00                |\n|                                  |           | $500.00                  |\n\nEstimated total additional funds required $2,471.00\nIt will be noted that the above figures have been prepared by Mr. Walker with no work done at Joussard, but assuming that the original allotment will be sufficient. Also for Sturgeon Lake an additional $500.00 is estimated as required, although this apparently will be contingent upon whether or not a well has to be drilled, on which latter point Mr. Walker had no definite information at the time of making his report on November 28th.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. [Signature]\n13th December, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water supply systems, Grouard, Joussard, Vermilion and Sturgeon Lake Residential Schools.\n\nWith reference to the above water supply systems I am forwarding a copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer outlining the status of the work in each case.\n\nGrouard Water System:\n\nIn regard to the Grouard system for which the sum of $1,700 was allotted it will be noted that drilling is continuing to 800 feet and that if the driller has no success at this depth they will drop back to the 330 foot level where a flow of 3 gallons a minute of water was found. The estimated total expenditure is $3,321.\n\nJoussard Water System:\n\nIt is noted that to date no work has been done although Mr. Walker has been in touch with Father Lajoie advising him that drilling of the well should be put underway immediately.\n\nFort Vermilion Water System:\n\nIt is noted, in connection with this water supply, that distribution mains have been installed in 7-foot trenches,\nthe well dug and crib and pressure tank installed and connected. Some additional work is required and the total estimated cost is placed at $2,000, the original allotment being $1,650.\n\nSturgeon Lake System:\n\nIt is noted that the work done in connection with this system consists of pipe being laid and connected in trenches and the installation of pressure tanks and that there remains to be done the completion of the trench which may or may not be possible. In the latter case it is suggested that a well be drilled which would be available in any case for fire protection and might be considered as a year round standby. It is estimated that an additional $500 will be required if the well is to be drilled.\n\nIn connection with these water supply systems I have your memorandum of the 11th instant quoting from a letter received from the Rt. Rev. U. Langlois in which he recommends the employment of Mr. J.L. Gervais, of Montreal, to locate the exact spot where a well should be drilled. This matter will be referred to our Engineers and given full consideration, although it is doubtful if Mr. Gervais would be able to locate water by his method at depths to which the wells are being dug.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 19, 1939.\n\nRe: Amount provided in 1939-40 appropriation\n\nTotal amount provided ........... $3200.00\nLess amount transferred to Joussard ...... 935.00\nNet amount available for Grouard $2264.00\n\nOf the above amount we have expended $126.50 for equipment and $1700.00 for wages advanced to the Principal or a total of 1826.50\nThis leaves a balance of 437.50.\n\nIn memorandum dated March 13, 1939, the Surveys & Engineering Branch estimated that the cost of the work required for the water supply system at this school would be ......... $1700.00\n\nIn memorandum dated December 13, 1939, the Surveys & Engineering Branch state that the total expenditure will be .................. 3321.00\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Water Supply for Indian Residential Schools at Grouard, Joussard, Fort Vermilion and Sturgeon Lake.\n\nSince receipt of your memorandum of the 13th instant, we have taken up the above question with Mr. Young, Chief Geologist of the Geological Survey, and quote a letter from him as follows:\n\n\"I have received your memorandum of December 19 asking if we have any information regarding the possibilities of securing water by wells for certain Indian Residential Schools in Alberta. I am afraid we have not much information of value but what we have is being collected and will be sent to you.\n\n\"You also ask if we know anything of the qualifications of Mr. J.L. Germain of Montreal who has been represented as being a radio-physic prospector of great experience specializing in the finding of water and drilling of wells. We have no information about Mr. Germain. I suggest that if you are considering employing him that you require him to indicate in some detail the method or methods he would employ and that he be asked to state what equipment he has. I am told that reputable companies claim some measure of success in determining the presence or absence of water-bearing horizons. Such a company is Henry Lundberg Limited, Victory Building, Toronto. I do not think they would guarantee to find indications of water and you might consider their scale of charges high.\"\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Young is having collected what information he has on the areas in question to be forwarded later. As soon as same is received you will then be advised.\n\nWith regard to the employment of a water prospector, I may say that we concur in the inference in Mr. Young's remarks that there is hardly enough factual information available as to the reliability of results obtained by such prospectors particularly in view of the possibly rather high cost as intimated by Mr. Young to warrant giving serious consideration to the proposal of employing any such prospectors.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

Unfortunately, the work\nis not completed yet. We are so far from supplies that more\nthan once we have been delayed several days waiting for a\nsmall piece of fitting.\n\nIt is obvious by the account rendered that the\nsum of $1,700.00 is far from covering all the expenses. En-\nclosed a preliminary statement of the cost. We have not to\nwonder if the cost runs over the first estimates. Nobody\ncould know ahead how deep we should go to get water. The\nengineer had figured a 200 feet well and water was en-\ncountered only at 702 feet. The working equipment having to\nbe rated on the depth of the well, a certain amount had to\nadded on this item. The higher increase comes from the drill-\ning and the material used. It will be a few days yet before\nI know precisely how much will be credited on casing returned\nto Beatty Pros Ltd.\n\nAs our batteries are already overloaded, we\nhave decided after undertaking with the engineering Office\nat Banff to use a gasoline engine to pump from the well. It\nmeans that the new house has to be larger and then more expen-\nsive than figured at the start. For the pumping from the cistern,\n(19,500 gallons cistern in the new Boys' Building), we in-\ntend to use two small automatic pumps we have here. Would not\nthis teaming of pumps work, we would have to buy a new pump\ncosting about $200.00. We hope not to have to do so.\n\nRemains the question of financing. I have had\nto borrow from the Bank to pay the most urgent bills especially\nthe men's wages. Some firms are asking for money. May I expect\nthat the Department will find soon the way of financing the\nexpense exceeding $1,700.00? A requisition at that effect\nshould have been made by the engineering Office at Banff.\nReceiving this would help me a lot.\n\nLet me profit by this opportunity to thank you\nfor the interest you have paid to this important problem of\nwater supply in our Schools. If we succeed to get an adequate\nwater supply in our Missions, a great improvement will have\nbeen realized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. LaJoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It appears now that the allotment should be applied to the very School it was formerly appropriated. I would appreciate receiving an official list of the monies voted for each of our Schools. I can't trace any such list here.\n\nIn order to reduce the expenses, we have decided to turn in flour the wheat harvested on our farms. Having been offered of a Milling Mill at a very low price, the offer has not been turned down. I presume that it will not be out of order to charge this mill.\n\nThe financial situation is getting serious. As outlined a year ago, we are feeling the burden of the war. In many lines, the prices are doubled or about. And while the other citizens enjoy an increase of revenues by way of wages or bonus, the Indian Schools have been cut by 7.76% of their revenues. No doubt that the authorities of the Department are sympathetically the situation in order to afford effective remedy.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to this question, I remain, Dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

LaJoie, O.M.I.\n\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 8, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Lajoie:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding the amounts provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the five schools in the Grouard Diocese, the following is the information you require:\n\n| Location     | Item                  | Amount Expended | Total Appropriated |\n|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Grouard      | Less amount already expended | $700.00         | $698.80            |\n| Joussard     | Repairs               | $600.00         | $1300.00           |\n|              | Purchase of equipment | $700.00         |                    |\n| Sturgeon Lake| Repairs               | $1800.00        | $1800.00           |\n| Vermilion    | Repairs               | $500.00         |                    |\n|              | Less cost of roofing already purchased | $150.00 | $350.00            |\n| Wabasca R.C. | Repairs and improvements | $1200.00       | $1200.00           |\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Forcade, O.M.I.\n\nReferring to my request last February for linoleum to cover our Gymnastic Hall, I would add that, should it not be covered with material of this kind, it will still be necessary, before very long, to spend considerably on repairs of this floor. Were these done with concrete and paint, it would not better the sanitary condition. I am not pressing you as I feel you are giving this request your careful attention.\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1942.\n\nEX D\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the last instant, in which you again mention the necessity for covering the hall at the Grouard Residential School with linoleum.\n\nThis would involve considerable expense and we are not prepared to give the matter further consideration unless specially requested to do so by Bishop Langlois. As you are probably aware, the amounts provided for Church-owned Indian residential schools are specifically stated in our appropriation and cannot be exceeded. Bishop Langlois is endeavoring to improve the conditions at the Sturgeon Lake School and consequently has expressed the desire that we do not spend any money for repairs and improvements at other residential schools in his Diocese without his express request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G. Forcade, O.M.I.,\nGrouard Indian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\nMr. R.A.Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have had the projector on trial and concluded that it was not entirely satisfactory. The University informed us since that for projection of postcards, satisfaction could be obtained only on a special screen which costs $36.00. I plan to go to the University and see just what it gives. We are very thankful for your kind assistance in this matter.\n\nThe children and I have just completed the building of a printing shop, and a dark room for photography in their school house. This has given them much enthusiasm as they are accurate and neat in this kind of work.\n\nMr. J.H.Ross and Dr. G.F.McNally who have recently paid us a visit both said they were very satisfied with the kind and quality of activities this school was carrying on with the children.\n\nThanking you once again,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.Forcade, O.M.I.\nLeader.\nMr. R.A.Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-131-15.\n\nRecovering our gymnastic hall with linoleum, I have discussed your letter with Bishop Langlois. I readily understand it would be unfair for me to ask for more than we have when the Sturgeon Lake school is in a state of dismal necessity.\n\nI am not acquainted with the status of Church owned school. Whatever be the case, I am sure the Government cannot help but recognize the enormous contribution the Church itself is giving it in this kind of work. May I also point out that the Youth Training Programme we are carrying out here is most genuine \"vocational training\". Out of five of my trainees this year who became eligible for military purposes, four made their application and three have been accepted. The three of them are leaving for England very shortly. Eighteen of our old pupils are in the army...most of them in England.\n\nMr. J.H.Ross who has just visited our Youth Training Centre has noticed that whilst our vocational work was being promoted in the most efficient way, our gymnastic hall could bare to be improved for better health and better results. I therefor maintain my request for some governmental assistance in bettering the conditions we are in for physical training. We have taxed our energies and our revenues to the utmost this year for the welfare of the children and this is why we feel somehow justified in asking for some outside help. I trust you will do everything possible to meet our demand.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nG. Porcade, O.M.I.\nLeader.\nOttawa, June 18, 1942.\n\nDear Father Forcade:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 9, in which you discuss again the desirability of securing a sufficient quantity of linoleum to cover the floor of your gymnastic hall.\n\nWe are communicating with Bishop Langlois, in the hope that it may be possible to secure funds from the appropriation set apart for the repair of church-owned schools, to enable us to purchase the linoleum you may require. There is always the possibility, of course, that it may be exceedingly difficult to secure linoleum at this particular time. I have been informed by a number of men, responsible for the organization of physical culture classes, that it is possible to treat the cement floor with certain chemicals and later paint it with a coat or two of gray paint, and that the results are reasonably satisfactory. I have been wondering if at any time you have thought of this treatment.\n\nIt is altogether likely that you shall hear from us again, just as soon as we receive a letter from Bishop Langlois.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend G. Forcade, O.M.I.,\nSt. Bernard's Mission,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev. J.

I would like to mention that this is about the only game in the summer time that they are really interested in, and they do play a good game, but they need a few gloves, balls and bats. At the time that Mr. McCrimmon went through here for the Treaty Payment, I mentioned this to him, and asked if the Department would assist in getting a few of these articles, and he replied that he thought they would, and to write to you for these things. Therefore I would respectfully ask for a contribution of $30.00 to make up a good enough outfit for the boys of these two schools.

Delivery of the Dough Mixer can be made at approximately nine months from date of order, and similar time is required for a potato peeler.\n\nWe sincerely regret that more prompt delivery cannot be effected, but owing to a heavy back-log of orders and unfavourable conditions in labour and material supply, it is impossible for us to make shipment in a shorter time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPENDRITH MACHINERY CO., LTD.,\n\n(Sgd) P.B.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary,\n\nRe: Residential Schools\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Pendrith Machinery, sent to the Grouard Residential School. Also enclosed is a cut showing their various types of Dough Mixer.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the Residential Schools of Grouard, Joussard and Sturgeon Lake are very much understaffed. To knead bread for all the pupils and staff by hand is really a hard task.\n\nI have been approached by the principals of the above mentioned schools with a view to obtaining them each a dough mixer of 100 lbs capacity.\n\nAs noted in the letter from the Pendrith Company, these will not be available for another 9 months from date of order. Would it be possible therefore to supply these schools with one of these mixers each for next October.\n\n(Sgd) A. Landry,\nIndian Agent\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Residential Schools,\nLesser Slave Agency\n\nMr. Landry, Indian Agent, has made a request on behalf of the Grouard, Joussard and Sturgeon Lake Schools for bread mixers. Attached is a copy of his letter, together with a letter from the Pendrith Machinery Company, Toronto, quoting a type of Mixer which the principals believe to be suitable.\n\nI have visited these schools and know the need of some device which will relieve the pupils and staff of the drudgery in mixing large quantities of dough. There is no training for the pupils in doing this; a girl can only learn to bake when the household quantity is the unit. Therefore, it is recommended that this, and other institutions which are not now supplied with mixers, be supplied as early as possible.\n\nThis particular request is for your consideration and comments.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, February 18th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate, Calgary, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th inst., with reference to supplying bread mixers to the Grouard, Joussard and Sturgeon Lake Residential Schools.\n\nRecently we submitted to the Minister's office, a list of the labour-saving equipment that we considered might be supplied to Indian Residential Schools. Bread mixers were included in the list.\n\nWe have not yet received a decision from the Minister, but if he favours the supplying of the equipment, we have recommended, we will keep in mind the requirements of the three schools mentioned in your letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 27th 1947\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs' Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWith further reference to my telegram of the 11th instant re order for tractor, this is required at once for Spring operations at the Ground Indian Res.

We are informed that the survey of the underground water supply in the Prairie Provinces made some years ago by the Geological survey did not extend as far north as Grouard.\n\nWe have forwarded your letter to our District Chief Engineer in Calgary who has some personal knowledge of conditions in the area, with a request for a report on the probable supply and approximate cost of the well.\n\nNorman Marr,\nAssistant Controller.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe undersigned visited the Indian School and Mission at Brantford today, and discussed the water supply and results of well drilling and dug wells with Father Tessier.\n\nAccording to the information as I understand it, a deep well was drilled to a depth of over 700 feet. The quality of this water was apparently somewhat similar to that which was obtained in the hospital well at M. Lemoine, drilled to 652 feet. This shows that the hospital well at M. Lemoine, drilled to 652 feet, the shallow well at Lemoine is quite muddy when freshly pumped. This tendency is due to fine clay material held in suspension in the water.\n\nThe deep wells at M. Lemoine are considered to be drilled to the base of a marine formation known as the Smoky River Shale. No suitable water has ever been known to have been obtained in this marine shale bed. The underlying formation, known as the Dunegan, may have some suitable water at its base, but this is considered to be at around 1000 feet from surface. Therefore, at Brantford, since no previous drilling has proved the existence of suitable water at this depth, it is not recommended that a well to this depth be tried.\n\nIt was reported that a bed of fine sand, estimated to be 20 feet in thickness, had been encountered in both drilling and in digging for water at the Mission buildings. However, this sand was always of such fineness that it gave trouble in the well, and also the quality of the water obtained was high in iron content and low in hardness.\n\nIn my opinion that if this bed of sand was at one time a part of the lake bottom, that the deposit might continue downward.\ntoward higher ground, and if it were an old lake beach,\nthat the material contained would tend to be closer to a\nshore line and therefore coarser, such as coarse sand or gravel.\nIt is also thought that water held in fine or coarse gravel\nwould probably be free of its own content and thereby\nresult in quality. This fine sand material may also be along other\nglacial deposits, and glacial gravel could be in association.\n\nIt is further proposed that a test hole or holes might\nbe drilled eastward for possibly 1/4 mile toward the eastern\nboundary of the property. This is proceeding higher up the\nslope of the hill, and farther from the existing lake. The\npurpose of these test holes would be so that the fine sand\ndeposit found at 30 feet at the buildings. If these sands\nlead to become coarser, or to become a gravel bed, thus\nit is thought a sufficient and suitable quality of water\nmay be obtained from a well possibly 25 to 100 feet\nin depth. If such were obtained in a test hole,\nthis company would construct a suitably sized well complete\nwith proper steel well casing and using a continuous pump\ntest on the well for, say 48 hours, until the quantity of water to\nbe obtained had been assured. A sample of water would\nalso be sent for chemical analysis to determine\nThis water could possibly consist of 6 to 8 feet below, with\na total of say 250 or 300 feet of drilling. Then possibly a\npermanent well at the most suitable location.\n\nIt is proposed that if suitable quality quantities of water\ncould be located even maintain a distribution of the water from\nthe building area, that the cost of bringing that water to the building\narea by underground pipe line would be less expensive and\nmore satisfactory than the drilling of a deep well at the building site.\n\nThis company proposes to willingly to undertake this work\nfor the mission at the rate of $8.00 per hour for all time\nspent by drilling equipment or crew, to include the setting up\nWESTERN WATER WELLS\n\nMunicipal and Industrial Water Supply Contractors\n\nDOUGLAS F.

Neary\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI beg to enclose letter written to Reverend Father Luc Beuglet, O.M.I., by Mr. Hamelin, manager of the Western Water Wells, Calgary, Alberta, re the well which it is proposed to dig at the Grouard School.\n\nI am not a geologist and do not know anything about wells but it is possible that the Department of Geology may be interested in the opinion expressed by Mr. Hamelin, Geologist and Manager of the company.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, June 27th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCONTROLLER, DOMINION WATER & POWER BUREAU\n\nGrouard Indian Residential School,\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information, a copy of a letter received at this office. This was received from the Western Water Wells and is self-explanatory.\n\nDirector.\n\nAJD/MGD\nV. Meek, Esq., Controller, Dominion Water & Power Bureau, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to a copy of a letter received from the Director of Indian Affairs, asking to be advised if a water resources survey had been made in the area of Grouard and if a well could be dug at a cost of not more than $4000 to give a sufficient supply for 225 persons under Bishop Langlois of Episcopal Corporation of Grouard.\n\nAs instructed, I have made contact with Mr. D. F. Hamelin of Donegal Mansions, Sunnyside Blvd, Calgary, and wish to report as follows.\n\nMr. Hamelin advises me that he is a graduate in geology from the University of California and took a postgraduate year at Stanford. Mr. Hamelin has apparently had considerable experience in well-drilling. One of his jobs of Transport and one of the last jobs completed with that Department was at Whitecourt, Alberta. Mr. Hamelin confers with Dr. Allen and other geologists in Alberta and on account of such contacts, along with his education, appears to have a grounding in geological knowledge that would be most useful in well-drilling work.\n\nThe survey as requested by the Indian Affairs Director has apparently not been made and no one can say definitely that the water is available at the particular location in question. Mr. Hamelin is, however, optimistic that a shallow well might tap a sufficient supply for, say, 7500 gallons at the above school.\n\nFor a well one-hundred (100) feet deep, his firm, he estimated, could drill it at approximately the following cost.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 200 hours of drilling time                | @ $2.00 | $1,600.00 |\n| 50 feet of 8\" Casing                      | @ 3.00  | 150.00     |\n| 100 feet of 5\" Casing                     | @ 1.50  | 150.00     |\n| Transfer charges, drilling equipment      |        | 100.00     |\n| Travelling expenses of Mr. Hamelin or his assistant to Grouard, etc. |        | 100.00     |\n\nIf a shallow well were found where a suction pump could be used, the pumping equipment might range from $175.00 to $300.00.\n\nIf it was a deep well, the pumping device might cost up to $600.00\n\nHence, if pumping equipment cost $600, Total Cost $2,700.00\n\nExigencies, 10%                            | 270.00 |\nGrand Total                                | $2,970.00 |\nIf the well is a shallow one, the cost may be accordingly reduced, whereas if it be considered advisable to go deeper than one hundred feet, it might cost more.\n\nIn any case, I believe Mr. Hamelin to be a suitable driller and would suggest that he be engaged to drill the Grouard well. His rig is at present near that area.\n\n(Sgd.) O.H.

This report concerns the digging of a well at the Grouard Indian Residential School, located a few miles north of Grouard, Alberta, at the west end of Lesser Slave Lake. We would appreciate receiving from you, as soon as possible, your views concerning this report, as we are very anxious to contact Mr. Hemelin, who already has his rig in this area. We hope that you can provide this information in the near future.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum to: Col. Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of July 12th re the proposed well at Grouard Indian Residential School and attached report from Mr. O.H. Hoover, District Engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch in Calgary. The following information is taken from R.L. Rutherford's Report #21 (1930) of the Research Council of Alberta, entitled Geology and Water Resources in Parts of the Peace River and Grande Prairie Districts, Alta. While Rutherford's survey extended only to a few miles east of McLennan, Alta. (Twp.77, Rge.19 W.5th), we have utilized it in order to predict as closely as possible the continuation of conditions eastward to the Grouard location in Twp.75, Rge.14, W.5th.\n\nAccordingly, the Grouard area and that covered by the Research Council's report are both underlain by the Smoky River Shales beneath which lies the Dunvegan Formation comprising an alternating series of sandstones and shales, the former known to be water-bearing. Above the bedrock lies an unknown thickness of glacial drift and Recent alluvium. Such drift is commonly composed of impervious boulder clay with lenses or pockets of sand and gravel scattered throughout which may be good aquifers. The base of the drift is also a common groundwater horizon. Thus there appears to be three chances for obtaining an adequate supply: a shallow well tapping sand or gravel deposits in the drift; the plane of contact between the drift and bedrock; or from the sandy members of the Dunvegan Formation.\n\nIn the McLennan area, existing geological conditions indicate that a good supply of water cannot be obtained from the upper strata. Dug and bored wells here are usually less than 100' deep, mostly penetrating clays and shales of the drift and the water where obtained is extremely hard. It is recorded...\nthat a few shallow wells which have penetrated superficial coarse glacial deposits or peat bogs produced good water. Assuming similar surface conditions around Grouard, it may be possible by sinking test holes prior to digging to discover a satisfactory shallow sand or gravel aquifer. Otherwise digging at random would be hazardous.\n\nDrilled wells are a more satisfactory source. Some have been recorded as penetrating the sandy layers of the Dunvegan Formation and getting water which, although not hard, is inclined to be salty. However, here we have the problem of depth. In McGlenan several such wells went to over 650' in depth before striking a Dunvegan water horizon. The Formation outcrops toward the north and dips southward, (Map #14, Report #21) hence since Grouard is farther south than McGlenan, the depth to the same aquifer would be greater, and salty water is frequently found at such depth. From the standpoint of drilling costs, therefore, it would be inadvisable to try for this horizon.\n\nWe have no information regarding groundwater at the base of the drift. This could be tested before drilling by sinking an auger hole. Regarding depth to bedrock, an oil well drilled at High Prairie (Twp.74, Rge.17,W.5th) recorded 668' of surface deposits, which, again because of the southerly regional dip, should not be as great around Grouard, in the absence of local hills. No water was reported from the drift in this well, although much of the deposition was sand.\n\nFrom the above you will see that the best course seems to be that of primarily sinking test holes in the surface deposits, penetrating, if necessary, down to bedrock, in hope of encountering a sand or gravel aquifer therein, or a source at the top of the bedrock. Unless such a horizon is encountered near the surface, the well may have to be drilled even up to 650' to reach a satisfactory supply, but at least the possibilities can be explored in this manner at no great expense.\n\nB.R.

Meek, Esq., Controller, Dominion Water\n& Power Bureau, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of\nthe 21st instant in reference to a copy of a letter re-\nceived from the Director of Indian Affairs, asking to be\nadvised if a water resources survey had been made in the\narea of Grouard and if a well could be dug at a cost of\nnot more than $4,000, to give a sufficient supply for 225\npersons under Bishop Langlois of Episcopal Corporation of\nGrouard.\n\nAs instructed, I have made contact with Mr. D.F.\nHamelin of Donegal Mansions, Sunnyside Blvd, Calgary, and\nwish to report as follows.\n\nMr. Hamelin advises me that he is a graduate in\ngeology from the University of California and took a post-\ngraduate year at Stanford. Mr. Hamelin has apparently\nhad considerable experience in well-drilling with the Dept.\nof Transport and one of the last jobs completed with that\nDepartment was at White Court, Alberta. Mr. Hamelin con-\nfers with Dr. Allan and other geologists in Alberta and on\naccount of such contacts, along with his education, appears\nto have a grounding in geological knowledge that would be\nmost useful in well-drilling work.\n\nThe survey as requested by the Indian Affairs\nDirector has apparently not been made and no one can say\ndefinitely that the water is available at the particular\nlocation in question. Mr. Hamelin is, however, optimistic\nthat a shallow well might tap a sufficient supply for, say\n7500 gallons at the above school.\n\nFor a well one hundred (100) feet deep, his firm,\nhe estimated, could drill it at approximately the following\ncost.\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 200 hours of drilling time  | @ $8.00| $1,600.00|\n| .50 feet of 8\" Casing        | @ $3.00| 150.00    |\n| 100 feet of 5\" Casing        | @ $1.50| 150.00    |\n| Transfer charges, drilling equipment |          | 100.00    |\n| Travelling expenses of Mr. Hamelin or his assistant to Grouard, etc. |          | 100.00    |\n\nIf a shallow well were found where a suction\npump could be used, the pumping equipment might\nrange from $175.00 to $300.00.\n\nIf it was a deep well, the pumping device might\ncost up to $600.00\n\nHence, if pumping equipment cost $600, total cost $2,700.00\n\nExigencies, 10% 270.00\n\nGrand Total $2,970.00\nIf the well is a shallow one, the cost may be accordingly reduced, whereas if it be considered advisable to go deeper than one hundred feet, it might cost more.\n\nIn any case, I believe Mr. Hamelin to be a suitable driller and would suggest that he be engaged to drill the Grouard well. His rig is at present near that area.\n\n(Signed) O.H.

Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of July 11th re\nthe proposed well at Grouard Indian Residential School and attached\nreport from Mr. O. H. Hoover, District Engineer of the Surveys and\nEngineering Branch in Calgary. The following information is taken\nfrom R. L. Rutherford's Report #21 (1930) of the Research Council\nof Alberta, entitled Geology and Water Resources in Parts of the\nPeace River and Grande Prairie Districts, Alta. While Rutherford's\nsurvey extended only to a few miles east of McLennan, Alta. (Twp. 77,\nRge. 19 W. 5th), we have utilized it in order to predict as closely\nas possible the continuation of conditions eastward to the Grouard\nlocation in Twp. 75, Rge. 14, W. 5th.\n\nAccordingly, the Grouard area and that covered by the\nResearch Council's report are both underlain by the Smoky River\nShales beneath which lies the Dunvegan Formation comprising an\nalternating series of sandstones and shales, the former known to\nbe water-bearing. Above the bedrock lies an unknown thickness of\nglacial drift and Recent alluvium. Such drift is commonly composed\nof impervious boulder clay with lenses or pockets of sand and\ngravel scattered throughout which may be good aquifers. The base of\nthe drift is also a common groundwater horizon. Thus there appears\nto be three chances for obtaining an adequate supply: a shallow well\ntapping sand or gravel deposits in the drift; the plane of contact\nbetween the drift and bedrock; or from the sandy members of the\nDunvegan Formation.\n\nIn the McLennan area, existing geological conditions\nindicate that a good supply of water cannot be obtained from the\nupper strata. Dug and bored wells here are usually less than\n100' deep, mostly penetrating clays and shales of the drift\nand the water where obtained is extremely hard. It is recorded\nthat a few shallow wells which have penetrated superficial coarse glacial deposits or peat bogs produced good water. Assuming similar surface conditions around Grouard, it may be possible by sinking test holes prior to digging to discover a satisfactory shallow sand or gravel aquifer. Otherwise digging at random would be hazardous.\n\nDrilled wells are a more satisfactory source. Some have been recorded as penetrating the sandy layers or the Dunvegan Formation and getting water which, although not hard, is inclined to be salty. However, here we have the problem of depth. In McClenmen several such wells went to over 650' in depth before striking a Dunvegan water horizon. The formation outcrops toward the north and dips southward, (Map #14, Report #21) hence since Grouard is farther south than McClenmen, the depth to the same aquifer would be greater, and salty water is frequently found at such depth. From the standpoint of drilling costs, therefore, it would be undesirable to try for this horizon.\n\nWe have no information regarding groundwater at the base of the drift. This could be tested before drilling by sinking an auger hole. Regarding depth to bedrock, an oil well drilled at High Prairie (Twp. 74, Rge. 17, W.5th) recorded 668' of surface deposits, which, again because of the southerly regional dip, should not be as great around Grouard, in the absence of local hills. No water was reported from the drift in this well, although much of the deposition was sand.\n\nFrom the above you will see that the best course seems to be that of primarily sinking test holes in the surface deposits, penetrating, if necessary, down to bedrock, in hope of encountering a sand or gravel aquifer therein, or a source at the top of the bedrock. Unless such a horizon is encountered near the surface, the well may have to be drilled even up to 650' to reach a satisfactory supply, but at least the possibilities can be explored in this manner at no great expense.\n\n(sgd.)

Hamelin, Donegal Mansions, Sunnyside Blvd., Calgary, to dig a well at the Grouard Residential School.\n\nAs you are probably aware, an amount of $4,000 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Grouard School. This is the total amount that we can spend and consequently if digging the well will involve a higher expenditure than the amount mentioned we will only be able to allow $4,000. However, if you strike water at less cost than that mentioned above, any balance can be expended later for repairs and improvements at the Grouard School.\n\nNo doubt you will make arrangements with Mr. Hamelin to start work as soon as possible and we would appreciate it if you would keep us informed regarding the progress of the work as we are anxious to know if you are successful in striking water and at what depth.\n\nThe attached copy of a report from the Bureau of Geology may be of some interest to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

As the school was without light and power and the matter of replacing this plant was urgent, I was asked to take the necessary steps to buy a new engine, generator and batteries upon my arrival at Edmonton. This plant was bought and is now installed.\n\nIt was explained to me that there was at that time a credit balance of some $1700, in favour of the residential schools in the Grouard Diocese from the amount provided in the estimate for 1947-48, and it was agreed that this amount would be applied to cover part of the cost of a new lighting plant for Grouard Residential School and that the balance would be paid from the estimates for 1947-48. On March 24th, 1948, I forwarded to the Department received invoices from Bruce Robinson Electric Limited, Edmonton, in the amount of $4657.00 for this purchase but the account has not been paid as yet. I would appreciate this amount being reimbursed. Should you not have received the invoices, kindly let me know and I shall have additional copies made and forwarded to you.\n\nI believe, Mr. Neary, that the above requisitions are legitimate and trust that you will give them your very careful consideration.\n\nCopied: V.S.\n\nSEP 16 1948\n\nRev.

If I remember well this has been promised for the school but funds always seemed to be too low for its purchase.\n\nAs no money has yet been spent this year for the Grouard group of schools, I am sure that we will not be able to give this excuse to the Rev.

Generating plant is urgently required to replace the old one which has become inadequate to supply light and power to the School which has greatly expanded during the last few years. It is estimated that a 10 K.W.D.C. Generating Plant would cost approximately $4000.00. Owing to the high cost of labor and commodities of life, the Principal explains that he can not bear this expenditure himself unless he receives financial assistance from the Department.\n\nI understand that funds were made available to build new barn at Sturgeon Lake and a Gymnasium at Joussard.\n\nThe amount of $1500. is requested by the Principal of the Wabasca R.C.

When we receive these, careful consideration will be given to them and your requests will receive favourable consideration as far as funds will permit.\n\nWith special reference to the third paragraph of your letter regarding the new D.C. Generating plant for the Fort Vermilion Residential School we would appreciate it if you would forward a special requisition giving complete details regarding the type of machine required and if possible quote a catalogue number.\n\nAs you are aware all equipment and materials have to be purchased from the Departmental Purchasing Agent and detailed information is required not only to assist them but to make certain that you receive what you need.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nAugust 5th 1949\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYour File 761-5 (H)\n\nRe Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nThe following material is requested to paint the Residential School and Classrooms at Grouard:\n\n- 55 gallons outside white paint\n- 20 gallons Raw Linseed Oil,\n- 15 gallons Turpentine\n- 25 gallons Cream or Ivory outside paint\n- 5 gallons Leather Brown outside paint.\n\nAn amount of $1200.00 should be provided for labour.\n\nWill you please have above list of painting material purchased by your Departmental Purchasing Agent and shipped to Rev.

For your information would say, direct current motors are approximately two and one half times more costly than alternating current motors of the same size, which will serve to explain what might appear to be a vast discrepancy in price.\n\nIf we can be of any further assistance to you in this matter, kindly let us know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nELECTRIC MOTOR SALES LTD.\nA.

Tessier, O.M.I.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of a telephone call from the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., to the effect they had received an enquiry from you for a 1 HP 115 Volt Direct Current motor.\n\nFrom the information given to us it appears you purchased a Dough Mixer which came equipped with an alternating current motor, and which you are now desirous of changing to direct current. Since Canadian Fairbanks Morse have nothing to offer in a motor of this description they have turned this matter over to us. For your information would say we can supply from stock a 1 HP direct current motor and take pleasure in quoting as follows:\n\n1 Type D 1 HP 115 Volt 1750 RPM Direct Current Compound Wound Leland Motor ...........................................$148.40\n\nThe above price is quoted Net F.O.B. Edmonton, Sales Tax included.\n\nNo doubt you will want to trade in the motor at present in your possession, but without a full description it would be difficult for us to arrive at an allowance. If you care to give us the complete name-plate reading of your present motor, and at the same time stating if it is new, we would be glad to prepare an estimate.\n\nTrusting to hear further from you in this matter, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nELECTRIC MOTOR SALES LTD.\nA. A. Burrell\n\nAAB/lbr\nVia Air Mail\n\nFather G. Tessier, O.M.I.,\nGrouard Mission,\nGrouard Mission P.O.,\nAlta.\n\nRev. Father:\n\nIn reply to your letter to us of August 18th, we wish to draw to your attention that the Department of Mines and Resources' Purchase Order distinctly called for a 60 cycle, 110-200 volt motor, and no mention whatsoever was made that a D.C. Motor be supplied. Had a D.C. Motor been specified on the order, of course the price would have been considerably higher.\n\nAs there are no D.C. Motors available in Toronto, it would be necessary for us to order one from the U.S.A. for you, and delivery would be approximately eight weeks' time. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you get an authorization for a local Purchase Order to purchase the D.C. Motor which Bruce Robinson Co. Ltd. have on hand. No doubt, if you explain to them that the A.C. Motor which is now on your Machine has never been used, they will make you a reasonable allowance for it. We feel that handling the transaction in this manner would be most satisfactory to you, as there would then be no return freight for you to pay on the motor which is now on the Mixer.\n\nWe trust that we have made it quite clear that it is not our fault, as the Department's Order did not specify a D.C. Motor.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHUBBARD PORTABLE OVEN COMPANY\nOF CANADA LIMITED\n\nH.S. Heyes\nPresident.\n\nESTABLISHED 1886\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\nMay 6th, 1949.\n\nReverend G.

A letter from Electric Motor Sales to Reverend\n   Tessier dated August 30th.\n\nYou will note from the correspondence that the\ndough mixer was supplied with a 1HP A.C. Motor but that a\nD.C. Motor is required. Electric Motor Sales, Edmonton, will\nsupply a suitable motor F.O.S. Edmonton, at $148.40. They\nwill allow $42.50 for the A.C. Motor which came with the\ndough mixer.

Aujourd'hui, je voici principal de l'\u00e9cole Indienne de Rouard, Alberta. J'en suis venu avec vous, Monsieur, \u00e0 cette conclusion qu'il faudrait faire quelque chose de pratique pour nos jeunes Indiens. Les filles apprennent la couture, la cuisine, la tenue d'une maison; tr\u00e8s bien, mais nos jeunes gar\u00e7ons ! Ici, nous avons commenc\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 leur montrer \u00e0 faire quelque chose par eux m\u00eame : les objets qui leur seront n\u00e9cessaires dans la vie qu'ils devront mener dans le bois: outils, canot, maison, quelque meubles, etc. Mais je ne puis oublier qui sont naturellement chasseurs et p\u00eacheurs et je crois que le plus grand service qu'on pourrait leur rendre serait de les entra\u00eener dans l'\u00e9levage des animaux \u00e0 fourrure.\n\nH\u00e9las ! Ces esp\u00e8ces d'animaux disparaissent vite dans notre Nord autrefois si riche en fourrures. Dej\u00e0 m\u00eame beaucoup sont enti\u00e8rement disparus. Quand je pense que nos Indiens pour vivre en sont r\u00e9duits \u00e0 chasser l'\u00e9cureuil qu'on ne regardait m\u00eame pas il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, tout comme l'hermine d'ailleurs !\n\n\u00c0 Rouard, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 ouest du Petit Lac des Esclaves en Alberta, nous avons une place id\u00e9ale pour ce nouveau genre d'industrie. Nous pouvons trouver sur place et facilement et sans beaucoup de frais, tout ce qui serait n\u00e9cessaire, et je sais avec quel plaisir, quel entrain nos \u00e9l\u00e8ves se porteraient \u00e0 ce genre de travail si conforme \u00e0 leurs go\u00fbts. Plus tard, ce pourrait \u00eatre pour eux un moyen assez facile de se procurer le vivre et le couvert.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ce qui m'encourage c'est que nous savons ici que d\u00e9j\u00e0 vous avez encourag\u00e9 certaine \u00e9cole dans cette voie.\n\nEt ce serait m\u00eame avec plaisir que je recevrais les conseils que votre exp\u00e9rience voudrait bien me sugg\u00e9rer et m'aider ainsi \u00e0 faire une r\u00e9ussite dans ce genre d'\u00e9ducation tout nouveau \u00e0 Grouard.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre, Monsieur le Surintendant,\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-11, part 1)\nExtract from Inspector Schmidt's report on the Grouard Indian residential school visited on November 28, 1938:\n\n**MANUAL TRAINING**\n\n**Boys:** The older boys help with the chores around the institution, and get a good general training in farming, gardening, care of live stock, horses, and general repair work, under the supervision of the lay brothers who live at the mission. They are in charge of this work, and have a complete line of carpenter's, blacksmith's and mechanic's tools. The Principal intends using part of the basement, under the school (class) room for a manual training shop for the boys. He remarked that they had no tools, and could not very well borrow same from the mission brothers to use in this shop. I suggested that a requisition for same be submitted without delay, and that this boys' shop be opened and going as soon as possible.\n\n**Girls:** The girls do general house-work: cooking, baking, laundry, knitting, sewing, mending, patching. They also make new clothes for both the boys and themselves. They are, however, more or less handicapped for sewing, as they have no proper sewing room. This matter I will take up under the heading of Buildings.\n\n**CLASS-ROOMS:** A separate frame building having four lovely large, well-lighted class-rooms, is used. This is heated by a hot-air furnace and is very comfortable. It has a full-sized basement, part of which the Principal intends to partition off for the purpose of establishing a manual training shop for the boys, who will work under the supervision of one of the brothers.\n\n(Sgd.) C. P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nWill you please note the attached requisition for the purchase of eight Singer Sewing Machines for the Grouard Residential School.\n\nPlease advise if any machines have been purchased in the past for this school and if so were they paid for by the Department. Do you make a practice of purchasing sewing machines for other Residential Schools? Are there any instances where the machines are purchased by the Church authorities themselves?\n\nIt would seem that the number of machines asked for is somewhat large. Might it not be wise to reduce the number?\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, August 2, 1940.\nOttawa,\nAugust 7, 1940.\n\nEXD.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of August 2 enclosing the attached requisition which includes 8 sewing machines for the Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is located in the Diocese of Grouard and there are four other schools in the same Diocese; namely, Sturgeon Lake, Vermilion, Joussard and Wabasca R.C. His Lordship Bishop Lajeunesse is extremely interested in providing advanced domestic training for the older girls of these five schools. Last year he made arrangements for two or three of the Sisters to take a special course in domestic science and for the academic year 1940-41 he intends to bring to Grouard from the other four residential schools in his Diocese the most capable older girls in order that they may have the advantage of a year's course in advanced domestic science under the guidance of trained Sisters.\n\nAs these girls will be included in the number of regular grant-earning pupils this special programme will not involve any extra expense to the Department other than the equipment of the rooms in which domestic science will be taught. The cost of the equipment will be taken from the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-11, part 1)\nIn order to have sufficient sewing machines available for those taking the course the number shown on the attached requisition are required.\n\nI feel that this is an excellent course for the older girls and is preferable to advanced academic training for them. Under these circumstances I recommend that the equipment included on the requisition be purchased.\n\nIn the second paragraph of Mr. Jackson's memorandum he refers to the purchase of sewing machines. It has always been our practice to supply a few of these to each residential school in order that the staff and the older girls may make clothing required for the pupils. If you do not wish sewing machines to be supplied in the future please let me know.\n\nYou will note, however, that the sewing machines requested for Grouard are for a special course and not for general use in the school.\n\nDirector.\nThe pupils of the Domestic School of Grouard are doing excellent work. At the time of my visit, they had sixty-three complete boys' suits already packed to be sent to Joussard School. Rev. Sister Eustache, who is in charge, told me that those had been made within a month's time and beside other works. The girls also take lessons in cooking, washing, ironing, knitting and all kinds of fancy works. I was very much interested in the practical cooking lessons given to them which include meat curing, smoking and canning and sausage making etc... They also learn to take care of milk and cream, as well as butter making. The pupils have been picked from Joussard, Sturgeon Lake, Wabasca Fort Vermilion and Grouard Residential Schools. There are thirteen of them.\n\nIt was brought to my attention, by His Lordship, Bishop Langlais and Rev. Father Habay Principal of Grouard School, that something similar to Domestic School should be attempted with the boys, if we wish to make a success with the young Indians. They intimated that, as long as the boys will have nothing to do when they come out of schools, all our good work with the girls will be useless. They suggested that, if the boys of a certain age could be taken to a school especially organized for them under a competent person and taught a trade along with farming, we could expect some results, as they would be in better position to make a home and provide for those girls, whenever they get married. Of course the boys would have to remain there until they are eighteen years old.\n\nN.P. L'Heureux\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited Alberta this spring he had not sufficient time at his disposal to enable him to visit your school. However, I know from personal conversation with Bishop Langlois that you are very much interested in encouraging manual training work among the boys and it is hoped that you will put forth special efforts in this regard during the academic year 1941-42.\n\nA curriculum covering a simple course in manual training is now being prepared and will be forwarded to you before September 1. We are also arranging to send to your school the tools which are considered necessary in order to enable you to carry out the proposed curriculum. In addition you may expend an amount not exceeding $25.00 in purchasing material required to follow the course.\n\nOn the part of the school management it is expected that they will provide a suitable room for the classes and also arrange to have someone reasonably well qualified conduct these classes.\n\nYou realize, of course, that our funds are limited and it is only by co-operation between this Branch and the school management that we can conduct the manual training along lines that we hope will be really profitable to the pupils.\n\nAs mentioned above, the curriculum to be\n\nRev.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Bishop Langlois:\n\nFor your information I enclose copy of a letter which is being forwarded to the Principal of the Grouard Residential School. Similar letters are being sent to each of the Principals of the other residential schools in your Diocese. While it is quite possible that some manual training has been taught at all your schools our intention is to make an endeavour to place the work on a regular basis. In order to do this a copy of the curriculum in regard to woodwork that we wish followed during the academic year 1941-42 will be sent to each Principal. In addition we will forward to each Principal the tools which we consider are necessary to follow the curriculum.\n\nI feel certain that the Principals of the schools in the Grouard Diocese will co-operate fully in carrying out the proposed programme.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Sir:\n\nI notice in your letter of October 27th that, due to the absence of your carpenter-instructor, the manual training classes have not yet begun at the Grouard School. This is rather unfortunate. I would appreciate it if you would notify me as soon as these classes are started.\n\nYou probably have noticed in the Monthly Report Form that we require this report to be sent to us at the end of each month whether or not there has been any instruction. We would appreciate your co-operation in this phase of the instruction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Jos.

There are eight enrolled for the present.\n\nI shall forward our first report at the end of the month.\n\nWould it be possible to obtain from the Department the manual, Hand Woodworking by Evans?

Under these circumstances I cannot understand why you request, in the last paragraph of your letter of November 14, a copy of \"Handworking by Evans\".

Were this done with concrete and paint it would not affect the sanitary conditions. I am not pressing you as I feel you are giving this request your careful attention.\n\nThere was also a request with regard to the Bishop Sand Picture machine which we would like to purchase and keep here after his departure.

This is a very effective way of learning and teaching activity.\n\nThe University of Alberta is offering us today a machine with descriptions capable of illustrating slides as well. They have an unlimited number of slides which we could rent at a nominal price. The machine is not new. They are offering it at the price of $50.00. I believe this machine is suitable for our school purposes and I am asking you if you could assist me in the purchase of this item.\n\nOur Youth Training is still progressing among the children.

Please let me hear further from you regarding this request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Jos. Habay,\nPrincipal,\nGrouard Indian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\nDear Reverend Friends, and Girls and Boys of Grouard Mission:\n\nSister Jean has given me the opportunity of expressing my appreciation for all your hospitality and the opportunity of seeing so much that was interesting and also seeing in person so many who were only names previously.\n\nAll persons connected with the Grouard Mission are to be congratulated on the progressive outlook of this educational institution and the very friendly spirit which prevails.\n\nThere are so many features to which I should refer but will content myself with mentioning a few which appealed to me particularly - the remarkable cleanliness of your premises on a muddy day - and yet it was a pleasant and comfortable cleanliness with no feeling of rigidity; the value of your system of uniforms and rank badges with the corresponding responsibility of living up to the standard; the quality of the physical work in \"fundamentals\" and dancing - I was delighted with the singing; the steam baths - a great deal of credit is due to Father Forcade for his perseverance and ingenuity with respect to this activity. He has made a contribution, not only to your School but to the general problem of bathing, etc.\n\nOne could continue listing pleasant memories but wet weather at that time and space now forbids. Sometime in the future I hope to renew my acquaintance with you when the boys probably will be able to take me over the School \"Farm\" and show me another group of splendid achievements of the pupils and Staff of your School, which is a credit to your Church and the Indian Department.\n\nYou may be interested to know we arrived in Edmonton on time after further experience with mud and seeing a big black bear. To all, my sincerest thanks for a pleasant and educative experience.\n\nOnce again, \"Aur Revoir\".\n\n(sgd.) Joe.H.Ross.\nDear Sister Jean:\n\nI have your kind invitation of May 29 that I send a message for your next issue of the \"The Grouard Echoes\" and will try to send you one. It will not be easy to say all I wish and keep it within a reasonable space for publication.\n\nIf it is too long, you may exercise an Editor's prerogative of using the blue pencil.\n\nWill you please extend to all members of the Staff my sincerest thanks for all their kindness and forbearance in reducing the programme for our convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) Joe. H. Ross,\nDirector of Health & Recreation.\n\nJHR:HG.\n\nSister Jean Placidus\nSt. Bernard Mission,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nDear Sister Jean:\n\nI should like you to know how much Mr. Ross and I appreciated the opportunity we had last week of seeing something of the work of the St. Bernard Mission. Not to make my letter too long I shall confine my comments to two or three matters.\n\nFirst, we were greatly impressed with the neatness and home-likeness of the classrooms of the school. Indeed, I cannot remember when I have seen rooms so brisk and spry. Coupled with this was the evident happiness of the children. I had formed that opinion of the Mission children from reading the \"Echoes\" but was hardly prepared to find the feeling so general.\n\nThen we were so pleased with the Health and Recreation program. The degree of excellence reached by both girls and boys would have done credit to classes which had been in training much longer than those at the Mission. Nor must I forget the splendid baths. These, I am sure, account in large measure for the healthy, happy appearance of all the children. On our way home Mr. Ross commented more than once on the high standard of results which you have attained.\n\nAnd, lastly, I must mention again what I said when speaking to the children. The Mission provides a first-rate opportunity for an all-round education. In addition to the regular school subjects the girls get training in the domestic arts under conditions which approach nearly to those to be found in the homes which we hope they are going to have. A similar training on the farm for the boys will make the opportunity complete. I can think of hundreds of boys and girls in Alberta for whom I could wish just such a well-balanced education.\n\nOur visit was all too short but left us with a definite desire to repeat it.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) G. Fred McNally,\nDeputy Minister\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-11, part 1)\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOn May 26th, Mr. G. Fred McNally, Deputy Minister of Education of Alberta, and Mr. Joe H. Ross, of the Dominion-Provincial Youth Training, honoured the Grouard Indian School with their visit. Their visit was short on account of the inclement weather, it having rained continuously during the preceding night, and the rainfall threatening to continue for some length of time. You, no doubt, know the plight of the motorist on a 275 mile trip on gumbo roads soaked by rain.\n\nI take pleasure in enclosing copy of the respective letters, perhaps somewhat mandatory, received from these distinguished visitors, by Sister Jean Placidus, directress of \"The Grouard Echoes\". You will doubtless appreciate reading these letters which deal with a work to which you have devoted your best years.\n\nI simply wish to call your attention to the wish expressed by both these gentlemen, to see, beginning next Fall, for the older boys of our Indian Schools, a post-school course equivalent to that which we are endeavouring to organize for the older girls. This work is essential and should be undertaken by your Department as soon as possible, war or no war. We have already discussed the matter together and, once again, I offer you my services and my entire collaboration to assist you in putting it to a test.\n\nBest personal regards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt.

The letters received by the Sister from these officials indicate that you have succeeded in providing a well balanced and worthwhile educational program at the school. It is particularly encouraging to learn of the emphasis that is being placed upon vocational and physical instruction. I am anxious that you should convey to the members of the teaching staff the thanks and appreciation of the officials here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

The children are highly interested in this work and I feel we can do more advanced work with a newer model of the same type. This is strictly for school work and I would ask your Department if it were possible to help us in the purchase of the machine. The total cost is $357.50. I have now brought it down to a net cost of $208.50.\n\nWe would therefore appreciate a great deal any contribution your Department could make towards this purchase.\n\nThanking you kindly,\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour truly, G.

Under existing regulations any purchase over $50.00 has to be made by the Purchasing Branch and, under present conditions, I cannot see my way clear to recommending the purchase of such an expensive machine. However, I will be prepared to arrange a payment of $50.00 toward the cost of the machine, provided you purchase it. If you do, you should obtain an account and you should attach this to a voucher form which should read -- \"To amount allowed toward purchase of gestetener for vocational training purposes at Grouard Indian Residential School, as per receipted account attached ...$50.00.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe more I study the people here, the more I see it is necessary for us to teach them how to earn their living. To make them feel this, you must create some ambition in them. I am directing my activities towards industries among them. We have begun this in class. One of our activities is leather work and bead work. We show them how to make use of their skill and the value of it in leather crafts. We are more or less boycotted through lack of material and especially beads. Do you know of some channels through which we could get them? You will hear more about this through our ECHOES.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGF BL.\n\nP.S. We have purchased and are now operating here the Gestetener Printing machine for which you have given us an allowance of $50. The Company is forwarding you the invoice.\nDear Father Forcade:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant and to state that I was more than delighted to learn of the attempts you are making to promote worthwhile handicraft projects at your school. It is my hope that you will be as successful in this regard as you have been in the development of your physical courses.\n\nWe have experienced the utmost difficulty in securing beads. In this connection we have communicated with a number of agencies in the Dominion, including a representative of Czecho Slovakia. It would appear that beads are not available at this time, nor are they likely to be available at any time in the immediate future. However, we have on hand a small quantity of small white beads, and we would be prepared to send forward 5 pounds, should you consider such a small quantity of any value to you. I am personally of the opinion that Indians, for the time being, should be encouraged to take up handicraft work which does not involve the use of beads.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend G. FORCADE, O.M.I.,\nSt. Bernard's Mission,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nSt. Bernard Mission,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nOctober 20, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI wish to thank you for your prompt response to my appeal for material on Indians. I was indeed happy to receive the helpful booklets and pamphlets you sent for research work. We have already begun to use them.\n\nThe photographs you sent of the Exhibitions of Indian handicraft are especially helpful, as it gives one an idea of what can be done, and also spurs one's enthusiasm. I wish to assure you of my sincere gratitude.\n\nReverend Father Forcade was called away on business for a time. Before leaving, he asked me to thank you for your kind letter, and to tell you that we would be very happy to receive the white beads you offered to send. We shall be making head and arm bands, and the white beads as a background, with colored decorations, make up very beautifully. It is hard to get any light colored beads here, so the white ones you are able to send will be a boon.\n\nPlease accept our gratitude for your interest and kindness. We deeply appreciate it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister Jean Placide\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Sister:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th ultimo, 5 pounds of white beads are being forwarded to you.

Habay, O.M.I., Principal of Grouard School,\nGrouard, Alberta.\n\nIn reply to your letter dated July 8, 1942 the department ordered the No. 45 Stanley plane from Ashdown for your manual training class. We have received the letter from this company stating that the plane is now available. I am inclosing a copy of this letter. Have you secured one of these planes and is it still necessary to order manual training equipment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout two and a half years ago I was appointed Assistant Principal at the Grouard Indian Residential School. On my arrival I found that Indian handicraft had almost disappeared from the school and, as the authorities were anxious that it should be re-established as soon as possible, I immediately began to interest the children in this particular activity.\n\nAlong with my endeavours as far as the school children were concerned I also tried to interest the former girl pupils of the school and their parents, with the result that in a relatively short time moccasins, gloves, curios of various kinds and even buckskin coats and parkas were being made in reasonable quantities by both the older school girls and the former pupils of the school living either on the reserve or close to the school.\n\nThe result of these various activities was that we found ourselves with about $4000.00 worth of these articles for which we found a very ready market with the Hudson's Bay Company and the American tourists, as well as the employees of the various companies that were working on the Alaska road project.\n\nThe skins for all these articles were bought from the local Indians and from the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as from the Indians of British Columbia. As we ran out of materials we attempted to purchase skins from the Indians of Ontario, as well as from those of the Mackenzie District, but we found that transportation costs were too high and we consequently had to curtail our production.\n\nI believe that I am quite within the truth when I say that about 60% of the women of the reserve, ranging in years from 22 up, worked for the school along with the children and that the above families shared, in various degrees, in this amount of $4000.00, with the result that a great deal of personal pride was taken in the work they were doing and a consequent betterment in social conditions resulted.\nThis experience has led me to believe that something basically sound could be established for the older pupils of the Grouard School, as well as the former ones, if we could arrive at a more standardized method of production. For the last three weeks I have been investigating manufacturing conditions among the Indians of Little Lorette in the Province of Quebec and the results that these people have obtained by the establishment of small manufacturing plants, some of which are even housed in private homes, are proof that something similar could be set on foot in Northern Alberta for our Indians.\n\nI have three projects in view which I am now submitting to you for your kind consideration and approval, if you should see fit to do so. The first of these projects is one for the manufacturing of standard models of moccasins, house slippers, work mitts and gloves. For the time being the leather for these various articles would be bought from the regular sources, but later on it would be our ambition to utilize the skins of the wild animals of Northern Alberta, as well as the domestic skins that could easily be bought from the Indians and the white settlers of our district.\n\nThe second project would be the establishment of a sawmill. There is, in the territory closely adjacent to our Grouard School, considerable timber which could be turned out into boards and building lumber at a reasonable cost, provided (and that, of course, would be our aim) only local labour was used.\n\nMy third project would be the setting up of a small tannery. I am now learning the tanning business in an amateurish way, but I am informed that the data which is being given to me now by one of the leading tanners of the City of Quebec will be sufficient for what we have in view for our Indians.\n\nFor the present I would like the Government to help me in the purchase of the material which will be necessary for the manufacture of the moccasins and other articles mentioned above.\nLater on, if this project is a success, I will take the liberty of asking the Government to help me in the two other projects.\n\nI hope, dear Mr. Hoey, that the above rough outline of my ambitions regarding the social uplift of our Indians will be sufficient to induce you to grant the help which I am now seeking.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. Forcade, O.M.I.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe following is a list of the machines and accessories for the manufacture of house slippers that can be bought from A. Gagnon, Loretteville, Que., and delivery of which could be had immediately:\n\n1. A \u00bd H.P. motor D.C. 110 volts;\n2. 2 Union special sewing machines for soles and assembling;\n3. 1 Singer machine for sewing the binding on moccasins;\n4. 2 Singer machines for assembling;\n5. All the dies for soles from size 3 to size 8;\n6. 800 pairs of forms for babies', boys' girls', women's and men's slippers;\n7. Patterns for all the above forms;\n8. 1 machine for shaping the slippers;\n9. 2 Mallets;\n10. Shafting, hangers and transmission pulleys for above machinery;\n11. 2 Tables for cutting leather;\n12. 1 Table for 6 sewing machines;\n13. 1 knife and blades for cutting;\n14. Stands for thread.\n\nWe are given to understand that the above machinery is in first-class order and is fully guaranteed by the owner. We did not have the opportunity to examine the machinery, but we did see the forms, the dies, the tables and other accessories and none of these articles showed any appreciable wear. This leads us to believe that the owner's recommendation can be accepted at its full value.\n\nThe price asked for the above was $1000.00, but on learning that this machinery was needed for an Indian school the owner kindly consented to reduce the price by $200.00.\nOn information gathered from various manufacturers of house slippers and moccasins, we are of the opinion that this machinery will be quite sufficient to start us in business and that with it we can manufacture a readily salable product.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. Forcade, O.M.I.\nOttawa, August 18, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of two letters received by me from the Reverend Father Forcade, of the Grouard Residential School.\n\nSubject to your approval, I would like to ask Mr. Doucet, who is at present at Restigouche, to visit Lorette on his return journey and make an inspection of the machinery referred to in this correspondence. If, in Mr. Doucet's judgment, this machinery is in good, serviceable condition and suitable for the organization of a worthwhile handicraft project, I would recommend its purchase by the Department for the Grouard School. The purchase price - approximately $300.00 - should, in my judgment, be charged to the amount set apart annually for the promotion of handicraft. You are aware that, although we have an official in charge of handicraft promotion in the Branch, we have been spending very little money on this work at any time during the last two or three years.\n\nFather Forcade, who is at present in Quebec, taking a course of training in the tanning and processing of leather and in the manufacture of gloves and slippers, and with whom I have discussed this proposal at considerable length, informs me that he could provide work for a great many men and women in the Grouard district by the establishment of this industry. A large number of young men from the Grouard district joined the Armed Forces and are now serving overseas. It is just possible that the establishment of an industry such as this would provide employment for them in the immediate post-war period. In any event, Father Forcade has done very effective work in the organization of the school courses at Grouard and in the organization of the pupils, particularly the senior pupils. He is now taking a course of training at his own expense.\nand it is somewhat difficult for me to see how we can withhold this assistance.\n\nR. A.

Forcade, O.M.I., who visited the Department yesterday with Father Plourde, is very anxious to purchase a set of machinery suitable for the manufacture of moccasins and slippers and he wishes the Department to assist him in this purchase.\n\nFather Forcade informs me that this machinery is at present at Loretteville and is readily available, should we decide to purchase it. I have been wondering if you would find it convenient to stop off at Lorette, on your way home from Restigouche, with the object of looking over this machinery and deciding on its usefulness and serviceability. We do not feel that we could recommend financial assistance in the purchase of this equipment until it has been inspected by you. Father Forcade's address is:\n\nRev. G. Forcade, O.M.I.,\n15 Avenue des Oblats,\nQuebec City, Que.\n\nIf you can make arrangements to undertake this inspection, you might communicate with Father Forcade in respect to the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet,\nc/o Dr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent, Restigouche, Que.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of two letters received by me from the Reverend Father Forcade, of the Grouard Residential School.\n\nSubject to your approval, I would like to ask Mr. Doucet, who is at present at Restigouche, to visit Lorette on his return journey and make an inspection of the machinery referred to in this correspondence. If, in Mr. Doucet's judgment, this machinery is in good, serviceable condition and suitable for the organization of a worthwhile handicraft project, I would recommend its purchase by the Department for the Grouard School. The purchase price - approximately $800.00 - should, in my judgment, be charged to the amount set apart annually for the promotion of handicraft. You are aware that, although we have an official in charge of handicraft promotion in the Branch, we have been spending very little money on this work at any time during the last two or three years.\n\nFather Forcade, who is at present in Quebec, taking a course of training in the tanning and processing of leather and in the manufacture of gloves and slippers, and with whom I have discussed this proposal at considerable length, informs me that he could provide work for a great many men and women in the Grouard district by the establishment of this industry. A large number of young men from the Grouard district joined the Armed Forces and are now serving overseas. It is just possible that the establishment of an industry such as this would provide employment for them in the immediate post-war period. In any event, Father Forcade has done very effective work in the organization of the school courses at Grouard and in the organization of the pupils, particularly the senior pupils. He is now taking a course of training at his own expense.\nand it is somewhat difficult for me to see how we can withhold this assistance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Porcada, Grouard, Alberta.\n\nFour samples of clay, marked No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, were received with the request that they be examined to determine whether they could be used for pottery and handicraft work.\n\nA physical examination of the four samples gave the following results:\n\n| Sample No. | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Calcareous Sand | Non | Non | Non | Very gritty |\n| Water of Plasticity % | 22.3 | 22.8 | 21.9 | 26.9 |\n| Plasticity | Good | Good | Poor | Poor |\n| Drying behaviour at 65\u00b0C | Good | Good | Good | Good |\n| Softening point | Cone 4 | Cone 4 | Cone 4 | Cone 3 |\n| Remarks | Highly carbonaceous | Highly carbonaceous | Highly carbonaceous |\n\nSamples 1 and 2 have good working properties for a pottery clay but would be very difficult to fire due to their short vitrifying range and high carbon content. This type of body would also be difficult to glaze. Samples 3 and 4 have poor plasticity, and because of this and their sandy nature, would not have satisfactory working properties on a potter's wheel.\n\nNone of the four samples of clay tested could be classed as a satisfactory clay for use in pottery and handicraft work.\n\nG.

Forcade, Grouard, Alberta, were subjected to tests in our Ceramic Laboratory by G. A. Kirkendale, Ceramic Engineer. His report is herewith submitted, in duplicate.\n\nAs the samples were very small they could not be tested fully, but the information obtained is sufficient to judge their suitability for the making of craft pottery and I believe that Mr. Kirkendale's conclusions that the clays are not well suited for pottery making are justified.\n\nI will be glad to discuss the matter with Father Forcade and suggest more suitable sources of clay.\n\nHowells Frechette,\nChief,\nIndustrial Minerals Division.\nRequirements\nfor\nSlippers, mittens and gloves.\n\nA.

To arrive at the quantity to be purchased, one would have to know the number of pairs of each item which can be manufactured with the equipment that will be available.\n\nThis is a rather unknown factor as the employees which Father Forcade will dispose of will be without any experience. Nevertheless, he is of the opinion, after consulting experts in Loretteville, that an expenditure of eight or nine hundred dollars would enable him to operate for three or four weeks. If this estimate is correct, he would not need any further help, and even might begin to pay the Department part of the funds allowed him, by the sale of the manufactured articles and a system of prompt collections.\n\nThe prices supplied in the enclosed list are those current in the city of Quebec, and are similar to those being paid by small manufacturers in the same line. No names of firms are given, but these can be supplied at a moment's notice.\n\nMy purpose in writing the present letter is to place before you a tentative plan regarding this venture.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These regulations and any amendments thereto may be cited as the Indian 'Revolving Fund' Regulations.\n\n2. \"Minister\" shall mean the Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\n3. \"Director\" shall mean the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\n4. \"Inspector\" shall mean the Inspector of Indian Agencies in the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the Indian Commissioner for the Province of British Columbia.\n\n5. There shall be a \"Revolving Fund\" in the amount of not more than three hundred and fifty thousand dollars as provided in Section 94 B of the Indian Act, Chapter 96, R.S. 1927, as amended by Chapter 31, George VI.\n\n6. The Director may with the approval of the Minister grant loans from this fund to Indian Bands, groups or groups of Indians, or individual Indians for the purpose of farm implements, machinery, live stock, fishing and other equipment, seed grain and materials to be used in native handicrafts. The Minister may also, with the approval of the Minister, expend and loan money from the said fund for the carrying out of co-operative projects on behalf of the Indians.\n\n7.

L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI enclose copies of forms for an application for a loan from Revolving Fund to be used in connection with the Grouard Indian Residential School Craft Project which is being organized by Reverend Father Forcade. These forms should be signed by five or six recognized Indian craft workers who will be employed in the proposed slipper and moccasin industry, for which this Department is purchasing certain required machinery.\n\nReverend Father Forcade is at present in the East but will notify you immediately on his return to Grouard. He will also notify you of the date on which he will have the group of applicants at the school prepared to sign the forms, and of the time of meeting. You, or your clerk, must attend at Grouard School at the time appointed by Father Forcade. Your signature, or that of your clerk \"for Indian Agent\", is required in the space provided at the foot of the forms which should then be forwarded by you to Inspector C.P. Schmidt at Calgary for his approval. I am writing Inspector Schmidt in this connection today.\n\nWhen this application for loan has been approved by the Minister, instructions regarding its administration will be sent you. The money will probably be used for the purchase of leather and other materials by Father Forcade, who will submit, through your office, receipts covering such purchases.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 2, 1943.\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of letters to Mr. N.P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alberta, and Reverend Father Forcade of the Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nFather Forcade has visited this office and we are anxious to do everything possible to assist him in establishing a slipper and moccasin industry for the pupils and graduates of the Grouard School, as well as other Indians who may find employment in this connection.\n\nThe Department is purchasing some machinery necessary in this connection, but a loan is required for the purchase of materials etc. When these forms are forwarded to you by the Indian Agent will you please sign and forward them to me, unless you know of some definite reason why such a loan should not be approved.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 2, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, copy of a letter to Mr. N.P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alberta, regarding the proposed application for loan from Revolving Fund, for the promotion of a craft project for the benefit of Indian workers near Grouard.\n\nThe regulations provide that such loans can be administered only through Departmental employees, but funds can be made available as soon as the loan in question is approved by the Minister, Honourable Mr. Crerar. If you do not require the whole amount of $1500.00 for immediate use, it would be wise to apply only for what is required, in order to save interest. The procedure is for this office to make an accountable advance to the Indian Agent, from which he can issue a definite sum to you. For any funds issued to you, you will be required to sign the Agent's cash book receipt form. You, in turn, must take receipts for every item of expenditure, and these receipts should be sent to the Indian Agent with a covering credit voucher or list, which, in turn, will be forwarded to Ottawa. Receipts covering all expenditures up to the full amount of the loan must, in due course, be presented to the Treasury Office by our Department.\n\nInterest is charged at the rate of 5% per annum, and it would be advisable for you to set aside, toward the payment of interest and principal, at least one quarter of the money received for goods sold. You will see by the forms that the first payment on the\n\nRev. G. Forsade, O.M.I.,\nGrouard Indian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\nloan must be made not later than November 1, 1944, but earlier payment will be to your advantage in the saving of interest.\n\nFrom the enclosed copy of my letter to Mr. L'Heureux you will see that he has been instructed to attend at Grouard School as soon as you have explained matters to a group of Indian workers who are prepared to apply for the loan. There will doubtless be numerous details to be settled from time to time as to procedure, but these can doubtless be arranged as the work progresses. I wish to be clear on one point, however, and that is that the Agent is responsible to this office for the funds in question, but from the time you accept an advance and sign a receipt for same you will be considered to be responsible to him, as he must receive from you either receipts covering expenditures, or a refund of any amount not so covered.\n\nAs soon as the application for loan is returned to Ottawa, signed, we will transmit it to the office of the Minister for approval.\n\nWith best wishes for your success, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.

Back in the West, I travelled north with the Bishop and I am now on my way home. This accounts for the fact that I have given you no further information on my activities. I presume that Father Flourde has informed you, however, and I trust it was satisfactory to you.\n\nI have purchased the equipment necessary for the making of boudoir slippers from Mr. A. Gagnon, Loretteville, P.C., and I had him send the account to your Department, as it was understood. Everything should be satisfactory in the equipment. I had the machines thoroughly inspected and I saw to the packing and the shipping of these myself.\n\nIn Calgary, I saw Mr. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Schools. He informed me of the procedure to be taken at Grouard by the Indians in asking the Department for a loan. I asked Mr. Schmidt to delay this, as I thought we should at least start on our own and, if things go well, we could keep on manufacturing without the necessity of such a loan. In any case, you will hear of this later.\n\nPlease accept my thanks and my very sincere appreciation for all that has been done by you personally and by your Department towards the setting up of this industry among the Indians which I hope will be a success. I have no doubt in the world it will be unless some day unexpected difficulties arise. We shall keep you posted of the progress of this initiative. The Bishop who is very interested, is now working with me to prepare location for this instalment. The machinery has not yet arrived.\n\nThanking you once again, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.- Mr. A.

I am writing to him today and suggesting to him that he forward his account to you in duplicate.

He has overhauled it and I am sure we have a very good piece of equipment. We have not set it up yet as it is too cold to build the cement foundation that it requires. We will do this as soon as we can however. We have purchased a small building for our Plant and we are to move it here very shortly.\n\nI wish to thank you very heartily for this very valuable donation, Mr. Hoey, and all those who have helped in securing it for us. It will mean a great deal for our enterprise and our community. We will certainly try to justify your efforts in helping us by keeping on the work we have started and which I still believe will prove to be one of the best means to civilize our natives.\n\nWe are working steadily though we are not producing in huge quantities. We cannot produce in big volumes. We have not the capital for this purpose. We are forced to buy in relatively small quantities and therefore our output must be in line with our purchases. We are moving ahead however.\n\nTo-night, in a general meeting, we will fill out forms, a memorandum of association for the erection of a Credit Union in Grouard, among the Indians. I think the time has come for that institution too. We have been having classes at night treating this subject. The people are very willing to co-operate. They realize a little better now, that saving is the only way out of their destitution. They have deposited quite a little money already and they promise to do more. As soon as we have officially opened the doors of this institution, I shall give you more information.\n\nOnce again, I thank you very heartily and\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This started exactly in 1907. From that time I had very often some Boys working with me after school time and during their free hours. This was always quite a work, like farm work as well as house work. We used to work also with engines and also occasionally with further, cooking fuel for stock, making flour for about a month a year... and many other kind of work we have to have with here and there. From 1916 I worked mostly in the general shop work with some Boys coming to be trained for many hours a week. I tried to teach the Boys according my knowledge in the wood work which does not consist in anything really or purely technical or expensive but of something practical and really useful in every house or on every farm and specially among the Indian people.\n\nThe last year 1924 before June the Boys had performed the following things in the Shop: 4 or 5 night cupboard which they call also wash stand, with 2 shelves and a drawer in each one, 4 kitchen and family tables, 2 radio tables, 8 cabinet or Medicine Cup board with mirror or picture on the door, 3 big chairs, 3 or 4 stools, 2 big loan of garden Benches, 2 wall shelves close special for Indian houses, 5 strong little wagons for children playing off, 3 little toboggans for children playing, 2 wheel barrows, and many hobbies.\n\n(see over)\nmade by the beginners which is too long to be listed.\n\nBesides the big boys have many occupations not only in the wood work also in the tin work, farm implements repairing, as handling axes, forks, hoes, and even other tools eventually.\n\nIn the spring time I use to take care of a garden which also is attended by all the boys. This work consists of sowing, thinning, weeding, transplanting etc., etc. The boys use to show a real interest in this work, and as a result, the heavy crop in the fall has often given evidence that the work and trouble was not scattered in vain.\n\nIf you wish me to give you any other data of my little experience with the Indian Boys, please let me know about it, and I will be pleased making my best also in this regard.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nBrother T.

The other group where only 4 boys, all of them except one came to the shop the first time.\n\nThe conduct of the boys, in general, was satisfactorily, and if some ones eventually did not show a full interest, yet the most part of them gave a good application to their work and consequently showed also a real betterment from the previous years.\n\nThe boys have only made during the year what is absolutely utilities for the houses, farms, and around the barns, because as these Indian boys are already as big as ordinary Men and liable (at least for one part), not to come to school anymore, it is advisable to teach them to do what they are going to need in their own house tomorrow, also I use to ask every boy before they begin one project to ponder which item they need or like more to have in their house or on their \"so-called\" farm. The answer is nearly always what is really useful for any house and much more for every Indian houses, which use mostly to be empty from wall to wall.\n\nThe following citations will give you a short account of the articles made by the nine boys this year: The number of the pieces stamped by myself before the two-weeks exhibition at the end of the year amounted to about 87 pieces.\n\nChildren cribs, 7; Kitchen and family tables, 7; utility cupboard, 8; general utility trunks, 6; chairs with elbow-rest, 12; other chairs, 5; Lawn benches 6 feet long, 2; Medicine cabinet, 8; Stools, 7. Besides this, they have also made (around the spring time), many bird houses, guns, many wagons, (toys), and also bigger wagons, which they use around the houses for hauling kitchen wood, etc. Many other things are not quoted here. I add only some tool carriers, many flower stands.\n\nOf these many things stated here above, I was pleased to find, the Principal of this school graciously willing (in spite of quite many expenses to support the shop in boards, planks, nails, screws, paints, etc., to give to each boy, off the shop-work, two of the best pieces they have performed during the year, two pieces to their own choice, this was a gracious revelation for the parents and also a \"start-pieces\", of desirable ambition for having later-on, yet more furniture in their houses which will also contribute in some extend to the improvement of their welfare.\n\nThe boys\nThe boys of the second and third year have also made many pieces of metal work, as scoops, dust-pans, repairing and soldering.\n\nThey have made a garden and although under my supervision, they have themselves lined, planted, covered and cared of until the time of their going for vacations, and I ascertain that actually we are not ashamed to show to the welcome visitors the \"Boys Garden\".\n\nAny remarks you would make to me about this letter which is made in any way of a little report, or any other advice for the future, would be received with thanks.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBrother T. Nicol, O.M.I.,\nInstructor,\nGrouard Indian School,\nGrouard Mission P.O.,\nAlta.\nGrouard Indian School,\nOct the 21st, 1947\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nLast year, on July the 17th, 1946, Brother T. Nicol, accepted by your Department to be a Training Instructor for the boys of our Indian School, for the Carpenter work, made a report to your Department, addressed to Mr. Phelan himself.\n\nAs he didn't have special forms for such a report, he made it just by himself. Last year (1946-1947), Brother Nicol gave absolutely the same training to those boys, three times a week, in the afternoon, by groups of 4 boys, each time.\n\nIf you want to have more information about the training done, in that line, you could write to our Indian Agent, Mr. Lendry, High Prairie, Rev. A. Plourde of Ottawa could tell you something about it too. During the year (1945-1946), your Department has allowed the salary of $600.00 for our Annual Training Instructor, Brother Nichol. Last year, the same Brother gave the same training, three times a week, but he didn't make any report, because he didn't have any special forms for it. Would you kindly send me those special forms, so he could make those reports required by your Department.\n\nAs Brother Nicol didn't receive any\nsalary for his training given, I think that Mr. A. Landry already has made the allowance submission for it. Thanks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFather Tessier O.M.I.\nGroesbeck Mission P.O. Alta.\nOttawa, October 29, 1947.\n\nDear Father Tessier:\n\nYour letter of the 21st instant addressed to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training has been referred to me for attention.\n\nI was pleased to note the two snaps enclosed. On close observation I noticed that the articles made by the pupils are objects that are most useful in their homes. You are to be commended for these directives. By this means, the desire of better living may be created.\n\nI am enclosing forms for Monthly Reports as required in this letter. Also you will receive in the near future two sets of plans and badge charts together with new regulations concerning the badges. Kindly have the form \"Application for Manual Training Instructor\" completed and returned to this office at your earliest convenience. At that time I will be able to look into the matter of remuneration for Brother Nicol.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nTraining Division.\n\nRev. G.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Grouard Indian School, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nAs requested in your last letter regarding our Manual Training instructor, I send you today the first report for the present year.\n\nAs we didn't have all the children in for the month of September, our instructor started just in October, exactly October the 6th. Since that date, however, the training woodwork is attended in due time regularly, and every boy seems to be interested at the work. One of them is in for the third year, four for the second year and three for the first year.\n\nFinally, we could find a form to make that class monthly report. I do hope that it will be satisfactory. In the same I enclose the Application for the Manual Training Instructor, Brother T. Nicol. Thanks.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFather G.

Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Grouard Residential School requesting us to supply them with goats. At several of the Indian residential schools in Eastern Canada we have started goat herds with satisfactory results and we would like to see some of these herds encouraged at some of the residential schools in Alberta. With special reference to the recent request from the Grouard Residential School, I would appreciate your advising if you can obtain 6 female goats and 1 male goat in your province. An early reply would be appreciated stating where you can secure the goats and their cost.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCalgary, April 28th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nReference your No. 131-1-11 of the 5th instant re purchasing six (6) female and one male goats for the Grouard Indian Residential School, I beg to say that I have made enquiries and have not found anything suitable in the Southern part of the Province. It would appear that the greatest number of the few herds that were in the South were sold a short time ago for use on the bombing range (see experimental work) at Suffield, Alta., near Medicine Hat.\n\nIn company with Mr. S.G. Freeborn, Senior Live Stock Field Man for the Dominion Department of Agriculture, Room 411 Public Building, Calgary, we looked over two lots in the outskirts of Calgary, but did not find any females that would be worth buying. We saw a two-year old Toggenburg Buck which could be used providing females of the same breed or species can be found. This animal is well bred (good blood line), but apparently has not had proper care and attention, and therefore has not developed as well as he should have. We were unable to get a price on this animal, which belongs to Mrs. Grace Court, now of Vancouver, B.C. The owner who is keeping the animal says she will demand a high price. He is most anxious that she get rid of the animal which he claims is very cross and vicious, and has to be kept in a pen or tethered.\n\nEdmonton District:\n\nThrough the office of the Edmonton Exhibition Association, Ltd., I was informed that Mr. J.J. Thompson, 11143 - 106 Street, Edmonton, has a number of female goats, ages two to six years, some of which are fresh, and others due to freshen soon. His price ranges from $20.00 to $35.00 each. The name of the breed was not given.\n\nMr. W.H.T. Mead, Live Stock Promoter, Provincial Department of Agriculture, informs me that Mr. N.S. Thompson of 8550 - 74th Ave., Edmonton, has six female goats to sell, for $30.00 each, all bred and to freshen soon. These are of the Saanen breed. He has no male animals to sell.\n\nMr. G.C. Leight, Indian Agent, Winterburn, informs me that Mr. G.A. Johnson, 9555 - 103A Ave., Edmonton, has six female goats and a buck, ages one to three years, for which he is asking $155.00.\n\nI have just been informed that a Mr. Henry Guenette, 11210 53rd Street, Edmonton, had a few young goats; however these may have been disposed of; I have not communicated with him.\n\nAgent L'Heureux writes that he does not know anyone in the Grouard district who has goats for sale.\n\nFrom information I can gather, a fairly well bred female -- two to three years old -- with a flow of two quarts or better of milk, is worth about $25.00 to $40.00. Prices are higher than they were two or three years ago.\n\nIf a buck cannot be found in Alberta I would suggest buying a buck kid in British Columbia, to be shipped to Grouard when weaned. He would be ready for service next Winter.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-14, part 1)\nIn conversation with Mr. S.G. Freeborn, aforementioned, who is known as the \"Goat Man for Canada\" he stated that he would be quite willing to take charge of the purchase of these seven (7) goats for us, and arrange shipment to Grouard. I recommend that this be done; personally I have never had anything to do with goats. It might be well for our Branch to take up with Mr. R.S. Homer, Director of Production Service, Department of Agriculture, Ottawa, the matter of having Mr. Freeborn make the purchase for us on his first trip to the Edmonton district.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nS/B\n\nP.S. Since writing this letter I have been informed that Mr. O. Scott, Sub P.O. 23, Edmonton, Alberta, has a herd of goats which he wishes to dispose of.\nOttawa, May 3, 1943.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Purchase of Goats,\nGrouard Residential School.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 28 and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nWe are of the opinion, from our experience in the East, that the Saanen breed of goat is the best adapted for use at our residential schools. This is a dairy type of goat, with a milk supply averaging about one gallon per goat per day.\n\nWe are interested in the goats at present the property of G. A. Johnson, 9555 - 103 A. Avenue, Edmonton. If these goats are a good breed and are in a healthy condition, we do not consider the price of $155.00 excessive. Would it be possible to have Mr. Freeborn inspect these goats at the time of his visit to Edmonton? The actual purchase could be made by Indian Agent Laight. We would like these goats purchased at as early a date as possible.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Miss Blanchfield;\n\nI have received your letter of the 8th re goats and called at Mr. G. A. Johnson's home, 9555, 103rd Ave. this evening but he was not at home. However, I spoke to him on the phone (his number is 21406) and he tells me that he has disposed of some of the females but knows where he can get others to replace. He still has the billy goat.\n\nWould you please call on Mr. S. G. Freeborn and if he comes to Edmonton (say next week) he could call Mr. Johnson on the phone and arrange to see the goats immediately. Mr. Johnson has a car. It is five miles to the farm. If these goats are not suitable, (note what Mr. Hoey says regarding breed \"Saanen\") he could see the others mentioned in my letter to Mr. Hoey (copy of which I enclose herewith together with Mr. Hoey's letter).\n\nAs regards price, he can be governed by Mr. Hoey's letter, i.e., 7 at $155.00 is not considered excessive. ($155.00 \u00f7 7 = $22.15) I do not want to suggest an average price. Mr. Freeborn knows more about this than I do and I know that he will select good milk producers. When he has found suitable animals, I would ask him to kindly contact Mr. G. C. Laight who will make the actual purchase and submit the voucher. Mr. Freeborn will, I am sure, advise him of any precaution or arrangements, if any, to be made in the Railway car.\n\nI understand that Mr. Johnson expects to leave on a trip East before the end of the month.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Purchase of Goats, Grouard Indian Residential School, Lesser Slave Lake Agency, Alberta.\n\nReference Mr. Hoey's letter No. 131-1-14 of the 3rd ultimo, copy of which Miss Blanchfield sent me while I was in Edmonton, I beg to enclose herewith copy of my letter dated at Edmonton on May 12th, 1943, addressed to Miss Blanchfield, which is self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Freeborn was contacted, and it was arranged that he and Indian Agent G.C. Leight of Winterburn would go together to see the goats. Mr. Freeborn's report on this matter reads as follows:\n\n\"Calgary, June 2, 1943.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Schmidt,\n\n\"In connection with the milk goats required for the Grouard Residential School, I contacted the Indian Agent at Winterburn, Mr. G.C. Leight, and we first got in touch with Mr. A.A. Johnson, 9555 - 103A Ave., Edmonton, and in company with him visited half a dozen prospects. Afterwards we contacted Mr. J.J. Thompson, 11143 - 106th St., and went from there to Mr. N.S. Thompson, of 8550 - 74th Ave., Edmonton. I also checked up on Mr. C. Scott who has quite a number of goats in the neighborhood of 155th St. and 106th Ave., and Mr. Frank Adamson, 82nd Ave. and 80th St.\n\n\"We could not find anything that I would care to recommend for the Grouard purchase. Apparently the younger goats have been pretty well picked over, and the only goats of suitable size, type, quality and character were goats from five to eight years of age. While we could purchase five or six old goats that, properly mated with a good buck, might be expected to produce fair grade milk goat kids, I was of the opinion that for a foundation flock such as the Grouard Residential School would be expecting, an average age of six to seven years was too much of a handicap.\n\n\"The best goats were in the hands of Mr. N.S. Thompson, Mr. Frank Adamson and Mr. J.J. Thompson. Mr. N.S. Thompson informed me that he had just one yearling doe in kid but not freshened yet that would be of the general character that we might require. She was out on his farm elsewhere and it was raining hard so we did not inspect this individual.\n\n\"Mr. N.S. Thompson also informed me that the goats that he previously offered for sale were snapped up very quickly. He directed us to Frank Adamson if we could use old goats, giving the old goats that Adamson had for sale a good recommendation.\n\n\"I regret that we were unable to locate the making of a herd that would promise satisfaction, but I do think that a herd of this kind should not average more\n\n-- than -- (Over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-14, part 1)\n\"than two to three years of age so that while the kids that are produced by the herd are taking their time to develop the management of the new venture will at least have strong goats in their prime with which to get experience.\n\n\"If there is anything further that I can do along this line you have only got to mention it and I will try to help you in any way I can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"S.G. FREEBORN\"\n\nSenior Fieldman.\"\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Freeborn at this office today, he informs me that he does not know where he can find any young goats that will be suitable for our purpose; and that in the aged class -- 5 to 8 years of age -- he probably could have obtained 6 animals, but of this number one only would have been five years of age. I understand from Mr. Freeborn also, that it is quite difficult to get good milk goats from British Columbia.\n\nFrom what I can gather, one of the reasons for the shortage of young goats is, that they have been purchased in large numbers by the Department of National Defence.\n\nMr. Freeborn will keep us in mind in his travels around the Province, and will advise me if he locates any goats which he thinks will be suitable for the Ground School.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTo: Mr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Goats for Crouard Residential School\n\nMr. S.G. Freeborn, referred to in my letter of April 28th and June 14th, last, called and says he believes that in a short time he may have a report from Mr. T.G. Stewart, Dominion Government Field man in B.C., to say that they can buy and ship six (6) goats from a point in B.C. to the Crouard School at a cost of approximately $50.00 each. Total $300.00 F.O.B. Shipping point. These will be of very high grade breeding and due to freshen this spring.\n\nMr. Freeborn is anxious to know whether we want them at that price; he will write me as soon as he has definite word from Mr. Stewart in B.C.\n\nHe says we don't need to worry about a buck (Billy Goat) till late next summer and a good animal may be found, somewhere nearer, before that time.\n\nFor your information please. Immediately Mr. Freeborn's letter is received, I will communicate with you, giving cost including transportation, when a decision may be made whether to purchase or not.\n\nC. Pant Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1944.\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta.\n\nRe: Establishment of goat herd, Grouard Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 29, in which you intimate that it may be possible to secure six goats through Mr. T.G. Stewart, Dominion Government Field man in British Columbia, for the marginally-noted school. The price quoted, $50.00 per head, appears to be a little high, but, in view of existing conditions, it is not at all likely that we can secure goats at a lower price.\n\nWe are anxious to establish at Grouard a goat herd from which we could later distribute goats to needy families and particularly families who urgently need a milk supply for their children. It will be acceptable to the Department, therefore, if you make arrangements for the purchase and shipment of these goats. It will be necessary to communicate with the Principal of the school and to satisfy yourself that they have the building and feed necessary to maintain these goats. You should also explain to him that, while the original cost is being borne by the Welfare Division of this Branch, we will expect them, in the course of time, to make a contribution of goats to needy Indians equivalent to the amount of this purchase.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training. Your file 131-1-11 of April 5th and 131-1-14 of May 3rd, 1943. - Re Purchase of Goats for the Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nReference my memorandum of the 29th ultimo, re the above, I beg to enclose, herewith, a memo on the matter handed to me by Mr. S.G. Freeborn, who in conversation stated that he had kept me in mind and made many inquiries during his travels, and that he finds that there are very few goats or as he says, \"no supply for sale in Alberta\". He therefore recommends that we purchase those listed on his memo which he believes are a very good milk strain, and very well bred. He suggests that we buy, at once, because if we pass these up, we may not get another chance, for a long time, to get as good, or nearly as good animals. Also, if we don't buy at once they will have \"kidded\" in a short while and may be kept and not sold for another year, at least.\n\nMr. Freeborn recommends buying the three (3) owned by Mr. R.C. Hirst; the one (1) owned by M. Straham and two, if not all three, offered by Miss Joy Barnes, and that they be shipped (crated) all in one shipment, at once, before they start kidding.\n\nI have made inquiries from the C.N. Express Company re rates from Vancouver to Enilda, Alta., this is $6.75 per cwt, if crated. By shipping them express there is no need of having a man in charge to feed and water.\nFor your information, please. I beg to be advised if purchase is to be made, and how. I would be pleased to make the trip and do the purchasing. I have not had any holidays this year and only a few days last year. A short trip would be like a rest and I feel the need of this.\n\nO. P.

G. Freeborn, sent forward therewith.\n\nIn this connection, may I refer you to my\nletter of February 1, 1944, in which you were authorized\nto proceed with the purchase of these goats. The prices\nquoted seem to be a little bit better than the prices\nfirst indicated. I am disposed to think that you should\nbuy the 7 goats referred to in the memorandum. At the\ntime of shipment you should send forward all available\ninformation that you can secure, with respect to the\ncare of these animals and the most suitable feed with\nwhich they should be provided.\n\nI note the suggestion in the last paragraph\nof your communication, that you be permitted to proceed\nto British Columbia to make this purchase. I have today\ndiscussed this request with the Director and we are agreed\nthat, in view of the fact that you have had no holidays\nthis year and are not likely to be in a position to take\nholidays at this comparatively late date, it will be\nsatisfactory to the Department if you proceed to the coast\nto make this purchase and take a few days' rest prior to\nyour return to duty.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Establishment of Goat Herd - Grouard Indian Residential School.\n\nReference Departmental letter No. 131-1-14 of the 4th instant, I beg to report that I proceeded to Vancouver, where in company with Mr. T.G. Stewart, Dominion Live Stock Fieldman, we drove out to the owners' homes to look over the goats offered, which I found to be very nice animals; -- all white, with fine coats of hair, sound of limb, and very tame and easy to handle. Four of these had kidded a few days before, giving male kids, which were destroyed; the owners have not the grass in their very small holdings to rear non-productive goats; their interest is in milk-producing animals only.\n\nI was very much impressed with the udders of these goats, i.e., the size of them: They were giving 2, 3 and 4 quarts, and are not yet up to their full flow of milk; they are still young.\n\nOne is due to freshen in March, and the other two are due some time in April; these, with the four mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter, make up a total of seven (7).\n\nThere was one thing which I wanted to find out first-hand for myself, viz., whether these goats were specially cared for, groomed, and what they were fed; or, in other words, whether they were pampered like some dairy cows: I found that this was not the case. They are out in the open, with a shed which they can enter if it is stormy and snowing. As regards feed, they are given a small feed of chop (oat hulls mostly) and a bit of green feed. As for grazing, their small plots are cropped very close. I was glad to see this condition, because they cannot get worse anywhere, and at the Grouard School they will be properly stabled and well fed.\n\nMr. Stewart will arrange for shipping (in individual crates) sometime around the 15th of March. This will give the animals that have already freshened time to pick up stamina for the trip, and those that do not come in till April will have time to rest and get familiar with their new surroundings and the people who handle them.\n\n(OVER)\n\nIndian Affairs.

They are good animals and are being milked regularly. The school will give one female goat to some responsible needy Indian for each goat purchased. Note - a good male Saanen goat should be sent to the school from Ontario as one cannot be obtained in the West. I would suggest that Father Primeau at Spanish be requested to send one of his male goats to Grouard in August. It is important to send a young animal that has been acclimatized in the northern district. If this is done, then Inspector Arneil should be asked to obtain another Saanen male in southern Ontario for the Spanish herd.\n\nMay 20, 1944.\nOttawa, May 31st, 1944.\n\nC. P.

You will note that Treaty will be paid at Cross Lake July 31 to August 4. I am not at all sure, however, that you can make satisfactory arrangements for your visit to Norway House and Cross Lake on the dates submitted by the Indian Agent. In view of the criticism that has been directed against the Department in respect to the administration of relief, the health of the Indians, the failure to provide hunting and trapping grounds etc., and in view of the fact that Inspector Hamilton has not visited Cross Lake at any time within the last ten-year period, I am anxious that your inspection of the Norway House Agency should be as complete and as searching as it is possible to make it. You should feel free to remain there for the length of time necessary to undertake this task thoroughly. If you cannot reach Norway House by way of The Pas you may be able to make arrangements to fly in from Winnipeg or Lac du Bonnet.\n\nMr. Roberts and I have discussed with Mr. Arneil the advisability of sending a male goat from the Spanish Residential School to Grouard. We have been informed that it would be suicidal to send a\n\nMr. J.E. Morris,\nc/o Mr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-14, part 1)\nyoung goat this distance at any time during the summer months. In the meantime we have asked Inspector Schmidt to make inquiries in respect to the availability of a goat that might be secured from British Columbia.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe, Saanen male Goats\n\nRegarding the sending of male goats to the Blue Quill And Duck Lake schools as recommended in my reports I wish to make it clear that I never intended that young goats be sent. I do feel that good animals six months old could be sent without any difficulty. These three schools are very interested in the raising of goats to be distributed to needy T. B. Indians and we will have to encourage the project by helping to obtain breeding stock.\n\nI investigated the possibility of obtaining saanen male goats at Edmonton, Calgary and at any other place where I thought goats could be obtained. This question was very thoroughly discussed with Inspector Schmidt and all the agents I have visited to date and in every case they state that there are no good breeding goats to be had. Mr. Schmidt stated regarding the purchase of goats in British Columbia that there only a limited number available at a very high price and that in his opinion there has been a great deal of inbreeding already. He was of the opinion that if goats are to made a success of in the Agencies in the West good breeding stock will have to come from Ontario.\n\nP.T.O.\nI would therefore suggest that Father Primeau be asked to hold a number of good male goats until I return to Ottawa. I will provide him with shipping instructions so that the animals can be shipped, stopping over certain points where the farm instructors can feed water and exercise them, so that they will reach their destination without hardship.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Schmidt:\n\nWe have not been very successful to date with the goats which the Department of Indian Affairs had sent us for the well-being of the Indians.\n\nWe have lost one through illness and another is now stricken with the same disease, and I fear that we will lose it too. The climate does not seem to agree with them. Moreover, I have received complaints that they destroy the trees, the flowers, etc., in our gardens.\n\nThis experience is, therefore, unfavourable to us and I am of the opinion that it would be only right for us to return them to the Department of Indian Affairs that they may dispose of them in favour of other schools, more especially as they will not be useful to us for next year since we have no he-goat.\n\nTaking for granted that we do not lose the one which is ill at the present time, we have five left, in addition to the 2 kids which were born here.\n\nTrusting to hear from you in this connection at your earliest convenience, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"JOSEPH HABAY\" O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nCOPY: for your information, please.\n\n405-11A.

School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received this day from Rev. Jos. Habay, O.M.I., Principal of the Crouard School, re the above. This letter is not encouraging; rather I should say, it is discouraging, as the reasons given for wanting to get rid of the goats are not what I consider major ones.\n\nIf the goats are destroying flowers, &c., in the gardens, and shrubs and trees, could not a higher and tighter fence be built around them; or the goats kept in a closed pasture field?\n\nAs regards a he-goat: The Department have authorized the purchase of one \u2014 \"the best to be found\" of the Saanen breed; and Mr. S.G. Freeborn, Senior Fieldman, Dept. of Agriculture, Livestock Division, Production Service, and myself have already started making enquiries. I am awaiting a reply from a party at Timeu, Alta., South and West of Smith, who I understand has a well-bred Billy, bred from a good strain, with good milk production behind him.\n\nI would ask you to please take this matter up with the Rev. Principal, and get his reasons and full particulars (if there are any besides \"that they destroy the trees, the flowers, etc. in our gardens\") as to why he wants to get rid of these goats.\n\nPlease submit a full report to our Branch at Ottawa on this matter, to whom I am sending a copy of this letter; please let me have a copy of your report for my file.\n\nC. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-14, part 1)\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 1, 1944.\n\nMr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI have for acknowledgment copies of correspondence relating to the goats purchased a few months ago by the Department for use at the Grouard Residential School.\n\nThe purchase of these goats represented an attempt to provide the Indian pupils in attendance at the school with a certain amount of training in the care and feeding of these animals. We have been assured from time to time by nutritionists, particularly by Dr. Kruse, of the Milbank Foundation, New York, that it is almost impossible to provide a balanced diet, particularly for children, in the absence of fresh milk. If such is the case, training in the care and feeding of goats is just as important as instruction in Reading, Writing and Arithmetic.\n\nThe objections raised by the Principal of this School are scarcely convincing. If the goats have given trouble in the destruction of trees, there is no reason whatever why they should not be fenced in or tethered. Thousands of small farmers in Europe keep goats on small plots of land, surrounded by beautiful trees. This is done by tethering and by careful supervision. The Department, however, has no desire to keep goats at a school in opposition to the wishes of the Principal. It might be well, therefore, for you to discuss the matter somewhat fully, by letter, with the Principal himself, and, if necessary, transfer these goats to another residential school in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency. If the school principals are unwilling to accept them, you might canvass the possibility of having the goats distributed to a reputable and dependable Indian family.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nAug. 1st, 1944.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, as also a copy of a letter from Rev. Joseph Habay O.M.I., Principal of the Crouard School, Re Goats, and wish to make the following report.\n\nOn Sunday July 30th, I met Rev. Father Habay at Joussard, and had a talk with him about these goats. He told me that the main reason for not wanting to keep the goats, was that they were into everything, destroying shrubs, gardens, flowers etc., and that the Nuns were very much against that. He is also under the impression that they have contracted some disease, and that if they are left there, they might lose them all. They have already lost one, and another is sick. I might add that there were no other reasons given to me by Father Habay. I tried to get him interested in the keeping of these goats, but he seemed to be disgusted with them.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6366, file 761-14, part 1)\nMr. F. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNORWAY HOUSE, MANITOBA.\n\nRE: GOATS.\n\nYou are authorized to buy sixteen female goats at fourteen dollars each ($14.00) and six male goats at ten dollars ($10.00) each from the Rev. Mr. Jones; payment to be made out of the Welfare Vote. You are also authorized to purchase two female goats and one male goat from Father Rivard at twenty-five dollars for the three animals.\n\nThis herd is to be established at Norway House; the milk to be used for tubercular patients and the children of families who are unable to provide milk.\n\nThere has been considerable inbreeding in this herd; therefore, you are requested to separate the males at the earliest possible date. Probably you can arrange to pasture them on another island until they are distributed. The male goat purchased from Father Rivard should be used with this herd.\n\nOne male goat has already been sent to Island Lake. The others should be disposed of as follows:\n\nOne to Father Trudeau to establish a herd at Cross Lake.\nOne to Indian Agent Lovell at The Pas.\n(Note: It is suggested that this goat be sent there by aeroplane when Dr. Yule next visits Norway House.)\nTwo good billies should be selected -\nOne to be sent to the Duck Lake Indian Residential School, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan.\nOne to the Blue Quill School in Alberta.\n\nIt is suggested that you write to Father George Letour, Duck Lake, Saskatchewan, and Father L.C. Letour, St. Paul, Alberta, asking them to provide you with the proper shipping instructions.\n\n- Over -\n\nIndian Affairs.

In my opinion, it might be wise to send these goats via Prince Albert; the one for Duck Lake could be transported from there by truck, the one for the Blue Quill School could be placed off at a station on the main line to Edmonton. If this is done the goats will be delivered in the shortest possible time.\n\n(Sgd) J. E. Morris.\nWelfare and Training Division.\nOttawa, August 25, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Morris:\n\nFurther to my letter of July 10th, regarding the shortage of male goats at Spanish, a letter has now been received from Father Prinsen in which he states they expect to have more kids than was originally anticipated.\n\nI quote hereunder from Father Prinsen's letter:\n\n\"Following up your letter of March 30th (File 24-13) in reply to my letter of the 24th to Mr. Morris, I am pleased to say that we expect to have more kids than we thought there would be at that time. There are already five that have arrived, four billies and one nanny. There will be a good number of others I hope, as more of the nannies were bred than Brother Grubb had thought. I shall let you know later this month as to the number of kids we expect to be able to provide this season.\"\n\nIn passing this information on as it has just occurred to me you may wish to alter the instructions you recently gave to Mr. Lanchby regarding the shipping of billies to Saskatchewan and Alberta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

J. Habay, the Principal, whose parting words were:\n\n\"I would be very pleased if you would send the goats somewhere else; no one cares to have them around the place here, and I have more complaints about these animals than everything else put together!\"\n\nI mentioned goats when at Sturgeon Lake and Joussard Residential Schools, and it was obvious that they did not want any.\n\nI recommend, and beg to ask for authority, to send the five (5) remaining females to the Youville Residential School at St. Albert, near Edmonton, who have asked for goats. (Vide: Your No. 110-1-14 of August 5th, last.) I had a talk with the Sister-Principal of this school in September, when she said she would be pleased, and was prepared to take goats at any time.\n\nMay I have a reply by air mail or radiogram, and I will immediately wire the Principal of the Grouard School to ship the goats by railway, at once.\n\nRe a buck to place with these five females: I do not think I will have any difficulty in getting one. If a suitable one cannot be found locally, Mr. T.G. Stewart, Dominion Live Stock Fieldman at Vancouver, B.C., says he can get one there.

Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Goats -\nGrouard Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 6th instant and have noted with interest the somewhat disturbing information contained therein.\n\nMay I re-emphasize the fact that these goats were purchased for the Grouard Residential School in response to a number of requests for goats, received by us from the church authorities. The expenditure involved in this purchase - travelling expenses, freight on goats, purchase price, etc., was quite substantial. I feel that you, the senior administrative officer of Indian Affairs in Alberta, should inform the school authorities that this is not the kind of cooperation expected from them by the Department and that this is an experience that should not be repeated at any time in the future.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, you are authorized to take the steps necessary to have these goats transferred to the Residential School at St. Albert. It is my hope that the Indian pupils in attendance at this school will have an opportunity to receive instruction in the general care and feeding of these animals. Ultimately, of course, we shall have to establish goat herds in the North. As a matter of fact, the Hudson's Bay Company, with years of experience behind them, are establishing a number of goat herds this year at their outlying posts. We do not deem it wise, however, to ask a school principal to keep animals in the care of which he is no longer interested.\n\nR. A.

She pointed out one of the boys in bed & I felt his pulse. There was none. Artificial respiration was tried without result. I learned that the boy's name was George Big Bear, a treaty from Whitefish Lake. Sgd. Father Marcel PHOUIX\n\nThe room where the boys sleep is a large place and has 75 beds; at present there are 65 boys sleeping in the room. I was given to understand that there is always one of the Sisters present when the children are in the room, and during the night one of the Sisters sleeps in an adjoining room on the same floor, so that she is always available if necessary. On the night in question, Sister Gerard was on duty, and she advised me that there was no disturbance during the night and the boy had not complained. Neither had he been complaining since his return from Whitefish Lake about not feeling well. The Sister did notice that the boy had not been looking very well since his return to school on September 1/36, but as he appeared to be getting along alright, she did not say anything. The mother of the child resides at Whitefish Lake and a messenger was sent to notify her of the death of her child, also Mr. N.P. L'HIRURUX of DRIFTPILE who is the Indian Agent was informed of the boy's death. Statement was also obtained from Coroner McIntyre as follows:\n\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\nSept.15/36.\n\nStatement of E.L. McIntyre, Coroner of HIGH PRAIRIE, On Sept.15/36, Corporal Faulkner and myself were notified that a boy (George Big Bear) 10 years of age had died in bed in the GROUARD CATHOLIC MISSION boys' dormitory. We proceeded by auto livery and motor boat to the R.O.M. School at Grouard, after taking statements and examining the body, I decided that the boy had died from natural causes. The body was that of a male child of about 10 years of age, fairly well developed and slightly debilitated. He had a well marked scabies condition on the body, and the pupils widely dilated, but there were no marks of violence on the body. Apparently the boy had had influenza of both respiratory and gastric intestinal type during the latter part of the holidays and he had returned to school in a debilitated condition.\n\n(b) He also had congenital V.D.S., death had apparently been caused by heart failure (V.D.R.) from influenza; the condition had been aggravated by congenital V.D.S.; I signed the death certificate accordingly, I decided that an inquest was unnecessary.\n\nSgd. E.L. McIntyre, M.D.\"\n\nIn view of the above statement and my investigation I am concluding this case. The boy is being buried at GROUARD, death being registered before W.B.

Sept. 16/36, I received a phone call from Mr. McIntyre, Coroner at HIGH PRAIRIE, that the above named boy age 10 years had been found dead in his bed at the Catholic Mission School at GROUARD, he had apparently been alright the night before, and when the Sister in charge of the room had gone around to wake the boys at 7:30 am she found him dead in bed.\n\n2. Accompanied by Coroner McIntyre via auto livery we left HIGH PRAIRIE and patrolled to the GROUARD boat landing, where we met the ferry boat and continued our journey to GROUARD, upon arrival we were shown the body of the boy, examination of the body showed there were no marks or violence, statements were taken from the witnesses as follows:\n\n\"Grouard, Alberta,\nSept. 16/36.\n\nGeorge BIGBEAR states; I am 6 years of age, and a Treaty Indian my mother resides at WHITEFISH LAKE where she is still living, my other George (Deceased) spent our vacation at WHITEFISH and returned to school on the 1st of Sept. 1936. George was about 10 years of age.\n\n(b) About July 1/36, my brother & I left school & went to WHITEFISH LAKE, my brother was in good health at that time, after he had been home for about two weeks he took sick, he had headaches and vomiting spells, he was sick for a long time at home, he would get up to eat his meals and go right back to bed again.\"\n\n\"Grouard, Alberta,\nSept. 16/36.\n\nSister Mary AUXILIATRICE states:\nI am in charge of the boys room at the Catholic Mission at Grouard, George & Gordon Big Bear arrived from Whitefish Lake about Sept. 1/36, for school.\n\n(b) George ate well, but he was pale & thin when he came back to school, I was not on duty this morning.\n\nSister Mary Auxiliatrice.\"\n\n\"Grouard, Alberta,\nSept. 16/36.\n\nSister Paul GERARD states:\nThe boy (George BIGBEAR) was feeling fine when he left school for vacation, coming back in September he was pale and then this morning waking the boy up I found the boy dead, I called him by name but no answer so I felt his pulse, and heart beat and could not find any sign of life, the boy appeared to be better the night before even better than usual, he was not sick during the night.\n\n(Sgd., Sr. Paul GERARD)\n\n(P.P.O.)\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ____________________________\n\nthis ____________________________ 19 _____\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A.403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Toward Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jouraward Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature] 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Name of School] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

pupils\n\nNOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.\n\nTOTAL number of days in Quarter: 91\nAGGREGATE number of days pupils in residence during Quarter: 9059\nAVERAGE attendance of pupils during quarter: 99.54\nAMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter: $435.45\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nthis [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

9061\n\nAVERAGE attendance of pupils during quarter: 100.9\n\nAMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter: $356.18\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Redacted] Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1st, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Redacted] Alta.\n\nthis 13th October, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [school name] School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [signature]\n\nDated April 1st 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftcreek Alta. this 6th April 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jousseard Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. Paul Lemieux\n\nDated July 2nd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driffield Alta. this 5th July 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftville Alta., this 7th Jan. 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 2nd, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftwood Alberta this 30 April 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lesser Jeussard Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paling it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5th, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Brightside this 6th January 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jousnard Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. Paul Levesque\n\nDated July 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nSept. 30th 47\n\nOct. 13th 47\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 209             | Robert Ward    | 14  | 1   |     | Driftpile       | 1             | 1                |                        | Sept.1-38                 | 92         | 11                                                          |\n| 219             | Archie No Hat  | 14  | 1   |     |                 |               |                   |                        | #4-39                     | 92         | 0 Not in yet, Parents fault                                 |\n| 220             | Freddie Chalifoux | 13 | 1   |     |                 |               |                   |                        | Sept.16-30                | 92         | 0 not in yet, working                                       |\n| 222             | Dannie Galileo | 13  | 1   |     | Sucker C.       | 1             | 1                |                        | Sept.1-40                 | 92         | 7                                                          |\n| 223             | Noel Villier   | 13  | 1   |     |                 |               |                   |                        | Sept.1-40                 | 92         | 9                                                          |\n| 226             | Marcel Giroux  | 14  | 1   |     | Driftpile       | 1             | 1                |                        | Oct.1-40                  | 92         | 0 not in yet, Parents' fault                                |\n| 227             | Fred.Wm.Willier| 14  | 1   |     | Sucker C.       | 1             | 1                |                        | Nov.1-40                  | 0          | Sick Sanatorium                                             |\n| 228             | Edward Willier | 12  | 1   |     | Driftpile       | 1             | 1                |                        | Nov.1-40                  | 92         | 9                                                          |\n| 230             | Pat John Ward  | 12  | 1   |     |                 |               |                   |                        | Apr.29-41                 | 92         | 6                                                          |\n| 231             | Rene Willier   | 12  | 1   |     | Sucker C.       | 1             | 1                |                        | Sept.15-41                | 92         | 6                                                          |\n| 232             | Fred Glacu     | 12  | 1   |     |                 |               |                   |                        | #

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is obtained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jouseard Indian School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Habay\n\nDated April 9th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at High Prairie this 9th April 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | BAND OR RESERVE | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagin'g it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jossard Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Hackett\n\nDated July 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. Joseph Habay\n\nDated October 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403 R. 3608\n##

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Habour\n\nDated January 10, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school; On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Habay\n\nDated January 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nG.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jossard Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussard Indian School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1949.\n\nPrincipal Joseph Habay\n\nDated October 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 6th October 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Jouscard Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph Hattan\n\nDated: July 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Hugh Maclean\n\nthis July 4, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Joussart Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Joseph H. H. [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at this date 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column, under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Falher, O.M.I., and upon enquiring as to the finances and records, the Principal informed me that he had no books at the school nor did he handle the grant or make any expenditures.\n\nIt appears that Bishop Guy at Grouard handles the grants and finances on behalf of some five residential schools in this northern Alberta diocese which is distinct from the Diocese of Edmonton and St. Boniface in Manitoba.\n\nAs Grouard is some 35 miles west and north of Driftpile at the extreme end of Lesser Slave Lake and travelling by road this time of year would be difficult, I did not make the trip, as I considered the Department would not wish me to spend the time or expense in so doing. From the conversation with Father Falher I gathered that Bishop Guy had taken up the matter of auditing with the Department.\n\nGrouard is fifteen miles from railhead, the train service from Driftpile is twice weekly and there was a possibility of Bishop Guy being away, in which event I would be unable to learn very much regarding the records etc.\n\nThis for your information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. B. Rayner,\nAuditor.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, due to an epidemic of measles on the Sucker Creek Reserve, the date has been delayed to September 14th and even later, if found necessary.\n\nWill you please advise me if in the trimestrial report of September, I should mention the absence of the children on account of illness, and if the grant will be allowed in this case - as for the vacation period, (July and August). In a similar case at Grouard a few years ago, I remember that the grant was not discontinued for the month of September.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, and with kind personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Habay, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal\n\nJH/BL.\nOttawa, September 16th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Habay:\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant in which you advise that owing to illness on the reserve, several children from Driftpile and Sucker Creek will not return to Joussard for some weeks.\n\nWe regret this situation but we cannot see our way clear to allow grant when children are absent. Consequently, when preparing the September quarter return grant should be requested for those children who were in the school on June 30th and who have not returned owing to illness for 62 days (holiday leave), plus the actual number of days such pupils may be in residence during the September quarter. A note should appear opposite each of them stating the reason for their absence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

It is also noted that numerous pupils have not returned due to neglect on the part of the parents. Please inform us what action has been taken in stopping the Family Allowance to their parents.\n\nWe are forwarding a part payment to the La Corporation Episcopale C.R. de Grouard, McLennan, Alberta, in order that the delayed payment of this Return will not cause undue financial inconvenience.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl:\nKB/HH.\nFebruary 4, 1948.\n\nMr. A.

In that letter we requested that the return be reviewed and amended where necessary.\n\nRecently we received the December quarter return but the principal has not yet sent back to us the September quarter return.

This return was sent to Indian Agent Landry on November 13, 1947.\n\nAt the end of December we received the December quarter return but we could not pay the grant for that quarter due to the fact that we had not received the September quarter return.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would arrange with the principal of the Joussard Residential School to complete his September quarter return and send it to the Department by air mail so that the amount due for September and December can be paid.\n\nIt will interest you to know that the per capita allowance has been increased by 17%, effective from October 1st, 1947.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

April 9, 1923.\n\nPrevious information indicated that there\nwere only two rooms at this mission. A third room was\nestablished. This room is not properly equipped with\nseats and desks. Long tables and forms are used with\nchildren facing each other. It is not a suitable class\nroom arrangement. Proper seating accommodation should be\nprovided.\n\nL. B. Yule,\nInsp.\nSir:\n\nThe report of the Public School Inspector who visited the St. Bruno's Boarding School in April, 1925, has been received by the Department. In his report he draws attention to the need of proper equipment for the third classroom which has been established at this school. He states that at present the room is not properly equipped with seats and desks - long tables and forms being used, with the children facing each other, which is not a suitable classroom arrangement.\n\nThe Department would be favourably disposed to providing single desks sufficient for the requirements of this third classroom; but, before doing so, it will be necessary to ascertain the sizes of the desks needed and the number of each size. For the information of yourself and the principal, I beg to say that single desks are made suitable for children of the following ages:\n\n- Ages 5 to 7 years,\n- Ages 7 to 9 years,\n- Ages 10 to 12 years,\n- Ages 12 to 14 years,\n- Ages 15 to 18 years\n\nKindly consult the principal and inform the Department the number of desks that would be needed to suit the children between the above ages. As soon as we have this information, we will be in a position to place an order here for the desks. You should also give full shipping directions. Kindly attend to this matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nI may further add that, if any blackboards are required for this extra classroom, the same will be supplied if the dimensions are given - that is both the length and breadth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Laird, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nIndia Affairs.

McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHarold Laird, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is my sad duty to inform you that fire has destroyed St. Bruno's Boarding School. This unhappy accident occurred on December 26th, it was a Sunday, the children had been called to church, nobody was in the building and no warning could be given early enough to stop the fire.\n\nMy contract with the government was that I had to build the schools at my own expense, a somewhat larger grant perhaps being allowed for housing children. Twenty years ago this country was still closed to civilization and the government found it a little hard to build our schools. Presently conditions are changed. The Edmonton-Prince Albert railway passes at 3 miles from St. Bruno Village. The task of rebuilding the school is so great for me that I humbly pray the government to undertake the work.\n\nWe have about 90 children here and we expect to have 100 more. All the Indians of Little River Lake belong to the Roman Catholic Church and besides the children who have their parents, numerous orphans are to be cared for. The sisters have taken the girls with them and Rev. Father Grace, principal of the school, has taken the boys in his own house, waiting for the rebuilding of the school which I trust the government will undertake as soon as possible.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nE. Croward\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndia Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6367, file 762-5, part 1)\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Jan.16,1924.\n\nMr. Ferrier:\n\nWill you kindly let me have a report on this so that I may reply myself to Bishop Grouard.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nJanuary 17, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe St. Bruno's Indian Residential School had two large buildings, a principal's residence and some smaller structures. The building operations were during the years 1913 to 1914; the property was church-owned.\n\nThe Indian agent reports that the main building has been burned and immediately we have filled rush requisitions for school, etc., I believe it was the boys' building, in which were the classrooms that was lost. Mr. Lordship's letter states that the St. Bruno's Residential School has been destroyed and it may be that the other large building or the girls' wing has also been burned; but from the information that is now at hand I believe that only one of the large buildings was lost.\n\nThis building had three classrooms and the boys' dormitories. His Lordship states that the girls are being cared for with the Sisters in the girls' building, I believe, as the Sisters' quarters were in this structure) and that the boys are living in the principal's residence.\n\nFor two years the school has earned the maximum grant of $60 and there are on the roll at present $4. The Bishop states there were about 90 children at the time of the fire.\n\nThirty-nine boys are now crowded into the principal's residence and the accommodation in the girls' building will be much too small as classroom facilities will have to be found. Hence, without doubt, the situation is urgent and a great number of these pupils are orphaned without homes and cannot be sent away. A building with three classrooms and proper residential facilities for 60 boys should be erected at the first opportunity. The Government does not own any Indian residential schools north of Edmonton and Saddle Lake, but the opening up of the Croward territory and the presence of a railway station three miles from the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School suggests that the time has arrived for the Department to consider capital expense.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndia Affairs.

Could you enlighten us on the subject? The cold weather coming on would necessitate the use of storm windows soon. We had also mentioned having screens for convenience as well as protection sake, but have had no answer concerning this either.\n\nI hope I am not putting you to any inconvenience in asking you this, so many little things come up every day that I seem to be continually putting in a demand for something.\n\nThere are 65 windows in the old building and all would need storm windows.\n\nThe new wing is progressing\nrapidly, and will serve as a fitting monument, doing honor to the generosity and big-heartedness of our Ottawa friends and benefactors.\n\nHoping to hear from you by return-mail, I remain,\n\nYours very gratefully,\nSister Mary Athlone\nSuperior\n\nSt. Bruno Mission\nJonqui\u00e8re, Alta.\nMARLBORO CEMENT CO.\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nPORTLAND CEMENT\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nInterest will be Charged on All Past Due Accounts at the Rate of 6% Per Annum\n\nORD.

By this we mean that it would be a very poor investment to install too small a plant only to find later that owing to additional equipment you needed a larger plant.\n\nFor absolute efficiency and smoothness of operation we are going to advise the installation of one of the 4 K.W. Super Smooth Electric Plants with four cylinder engine and complete with radiator for cooling, plant to include complete switchboard and 16 Cells 210 Ampere Hour Glass Jar Storage Battery for 32 Volt operation at a price of $1312.00, Thirteen Hundred and Twelve Dollars, F.O.B. Toronto all taxes paid.\n\nIn consideration of the work this plant is going to be used for, we will allow you a discount of 15% making a net price of $1115.20, Eleven Hundred and Fifteen Dollars and twenty cents.\n\nIn addition to the plant first suggested, we are going to offer you another of smaller capacity and less money, as it may happen that you can do with the smaller plant.\n\nFor a second consideration we suggest the installation of a Super Smooth, 2 K.W. (2500 Watt) Plant complete with switchboard and including 16 Cells, 168 Ampere Hour Glass Jar Storage Battery, 32 Volt at a price of $1095.00, Ten Hundred and Ninety-five Dollars, F.O.B. Toronto, all taxes paid.\n\nOn the basis of the same discount, this would make a net price of $930.75, Nine Hundred Dollars and Seventy-five cents.\n\nA 2500 Watt Plant will operate 63 forty Watt Lamps or Electric Motors up to 2\u00bd H.P. directly from the generator not counting on the current from the battery.\nWe will be only too glad to co-operate with you toward a real successful installation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMADDOX ENGINEERING COMPANY\n\nSales Manager.\n\nAJM/EM.\nDecember 11, 1929.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe have been in touch with the Reverend Mr. Beuglet at St. Martin's Mission, Desmarais, Alta., regarding an Electric Light Plant for the Indian Residential School.\n\nWe have just received a letter from St. Martin's Mission stating that the Department of Indian affairs are going to supply the Electric Light Plant for the new School, therefore, if you have not already purchased a plant we would appreciate very much if you would give some consideration to our product.\n\nCatalogues of the different Plants are enclosed and we are quoting you the same price as quoted direct to the Mission.\n\nIf we can be of any assistance to you in selecting the proper plant for this installation we would be only too glad to help you in whatever way possible. The attached quotation sheet will give you all details as to the Electric Plants quoted on.\n\nIt also occurred to us today that if there will be a Water Pumping System required and if you have any details as to the requirements on this equipment we will be very glad indeed to quote prices.\n\nIn the event that St. Martin's Mission are to look after that part of the equipment themselves we will be glad to quote prices to them direct.\n\nWe look forward with very much pleasure toward receiving an early reply,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMADDOX ENGINEERING COMPANY\n\nSales Manager.\n\nAJM/EM.\nA285 23 COLLECT\n\nEDMONTON ALTA 12 115P\n\nDR D SCOTT\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nCAN WE SUBSTITUTE FIREBOX BOILER IN PLACE OF RETURN TUBULAR BOILER AS SPECIFIED STBRUNOS SCHOOL THINK MORE SUITABLE FOR JOB\n\nWIRE REPLY\n\nJ P FITZGERALD.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nDec. 12, 1929.\n\nJ.

DIA.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYou will no doubt be interested in the progress of the work being done on the new wing. The plumbing is well advanced, most of the tiling finished, and the plum-fitters have arrived today to begin their work. The contractor announced today also that the needed alterations in the old house would begin immediately after the Christmas holidays; which means that we will have to take possession of a few rooms in the new wing most likely the class-rooms. I am enclosing a little snap-shot which will give you a little idea of its appearance, later on we will have a better one to show you.\n\nThe cold weather has arrived and caught me unawares, we having forty below zero weather just now and find it hard to keep warm. Seems to be continually asking for something, Mr. Scott, but it seems that if we had storm windows on the old building,\nit would be so much easier to heat the house. We mentioned this when we sent in the plans, but no answer was given as to whether they had been granted or not. The storm windows are all on, on the new wing, and it makes such a difference for heating. We would need 6' x 2' pane windows 8 by 12 for the old house. If they have been granted we should be pleased to know it as soon as possible, so that this may not be delayed too long.\n\nI am making out the list of needed furniture for the different apartments as I mentioned in a recent letter and will forward it soon, for your approval.\n\nMy requests are many, it seems, but I should like to have everything just as you would have it. I am sure if you were to hear my many demands, if, however, any of these things seem unnecessary to your board of being, you have only to say so, the refusal will be well accepted.\n\nLooking to hear from you shortly regarding my new request.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSister Mary Gilbert\nSuperior.\n| Names          | 17 | 3 | W | 3 | S | Total Price | Amount | Received payment | Witness |\n|----------------|----|---|---|---|---|-------------|--------|------------------|---------|\n| Percy Greenlaw | 10 | 10| 10| 10| 60| $25.00      |        | $420.00         |         |\n| Fred Dale      | 10 | 10| 10| 10| 60| $7.00       |        | $49.00          |         |\n\nTotal: $489.00\n\nI hereby certify that services have been performed and prices are fair & just.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nReturn of labor on the N.B.

The first lot which will be found on the closed file was paid on the 10th October 1929 by cheque No. 3949 and the second lot on the current file was paid on the 25th November by cheque No. 5129. These invoices as rendered are misleading so far as the amount claimed for freight is concerned, owing to the firm having deducted the same from their bills. Their quotations, however, were for prices f.o.b. Indiana and including the freight. The deduction of freight shown in the invoices should not appear there at all, as it is only made for the purpose of ascertaining the amount on which they had to pay sales tax. The total amount of freight claimed by the company is $1905.75, but as the duplicate payment was for $2626.79, an overpayment of $723.04 was made and will be returned to the Department.\nMEMO.\n\nWith regard to the overpayment of $723.04 I may say this is due to the fact that invoices Nos. 9871, for $1272.54; No. 9872 for $780.78; and No. 9873 for $575.47 were rendered twice.

I do not care much about the letter. However, I know you will notice it in connection and shall have it all to you.\n\nS. M. Gillies\nBox 1831, Grande Prairie, Alta.\nDecember 7th 1929.\n\nTo Revd. Father Giroux,\nJussard, Alta.\n\nRevd. Sir,\n\nDuring my recent visit to St. Bruno's Mission I took the liberty of looking over your lighting plant. I am very sorry you were not home so that we could have discussed the matter together as I believe you will find it necessary to increase the capacity of your plant to take care of new building. Your present engine is of an old type and has seen much service and has reached that stage when it cannot be depended upon for heavier work. It is of the gravity feed type with low tension ignition necessitating batteries and coil for starting and is getting much the worse for wear. It is not necessary for me to point out to you the inconvenience and possible danger of the lighting system in an institution such as you have at St. Bruno. The generator would be overloaded during your peak load which would make the whole outfit unreliable.\n\nI would recommend not less than a 6 K.W. plant and can give you the following styles at prices mentioned:\n\n- 6 K.W. Lister-Bruston Automatic 110 Volt less Batteries $2389.00\n- 6 K.W. Lister Non-Automatic \" \" \" \" $1700.00\n- 12 H.P. Marshall 011 Engine, 6 K.W. Generator 110 Volt Shunt Winding with switchboard and Texrope drove $2140.00\n\nThe above prices are F.O.B. Indiana or Enilda and include installation. Transportation and board from nearest station to be provided by you. Unskilled help to be also provided by you and necessary base to be provided in suitable place in accordance with blue prints before arrival of expert for installation.\n\nI have not included batteries in above prices as your present batteries are in first class condition and will serve you for several years. It would give me pleasure to discuss this matter further with you or if you decide to change I can promise you prompt and satisfactory service.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nR.A. Lister & Co., (Canada) Ltd.\nPer H. Giles.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6367, file 762-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHonorable Sir,\n\nAnother difficult problem has presented itself this week and I hasten to lay it before you, being totally unable to contend with it myself.\n\nIt seems as if there is no end to these particular needs, and just when we think one has been satisfied another one comes up.\n\nOur lighting plant having been out of order, we were obliged to call in the electrician who afterwards wrote the enclosed letter to Mr. Father Thross. I can truthfully corroborate this statement of his, for since we are having extra lights in the new building our shop aims to be constantly out of order. Although having no knowledge of lighting plants, I did not think at the time that it was caused by the lack of power.\n\nNow, you will see by Mr. Father Thross' letter the real estate of things and I do not in the least doubt of your capability in arranging it to the satisfaction of all and the advantage of the school.\n\nWork has begun in the old building, and preparations are in full swing.\n\nWe are gladly putting up with the many inconveniences this causes us.\njoining in the fact that we will soon be comfortably settled in our pretty new home.\n\nLast week we had the pleasure of Mr. Scott's visit. He was delighted with the improvements and said it surpassed his expectations in convenience and beauty. Numerous visitors have come lately and all are amazed to find such a mansion in the far North. We do not hesitate to give you all the credit for it dear Mr. Scott and are glad of every opportunity to speak loudly of your kindness for our Indian missions.\n\nYou cannot imagine, however, Sir, what a load of responsibility it takes from my shoulders to know that I can rely on you entirely to straighten out these problems which seem to come daily. The promptness with which you comply with so many demands makes me feel that I need not be afraid of coming again knowing full well that you will always arrange matters for the best.\n\nI am also sending you the list of furniture needed for each apartment.\n\nResting considerably upon the words \"ask and you shall receive,\" I thank you for past favors and beg to remain,\n\nYour very gratefully,\nSister Mary Gilbert.\n\nA Bruni's Residential School,\nJourneay,\nFeb. 1st, 1836.\nA letter has been received from Sister Mary Gilbert of St. Bruno's School advising that their lighting plant is out of commission. The present plant was installed some years ago and of course is not large enough to provide light for the old building and the addition which was made this summer. A 6 K.W. generating plant will be required and the cost will be approximately $2,400.00. If funds are available I would recommend that a new electric lighting plant be installed.\n\nArchitect.\nSt. Bruno Residential School, Indiana, Alta.\n\n10 Feb 15-1930\n\n| Name          | Amount |\n|---------------|--------|\n| G.

I have also your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the need of a new electric lighting plant, and I wish also to refer to Father Giroux' letter concerning the water supply. I may say that the Dominion Water Power Engineer's report has not yet been received. I regret to inform you that there are no funds for these purposes at the present time. This year, the Appropriation for Indian Education is completely assigned and there is no item in the Main Estimates for the coming fiscal year for the purpose. I may be able to secure a supplementary estimate, and, when this is being prepared, it may be possible to include an item for your school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev.

The plumbers are leaving today so they have done all they can do till the water is in. The steam fitters are nearing the end of their task too until the powerhouse is built.

Then too, we have sandpapered, sanded, varnished and waxed our new floors till they are really beautiful, and it seems almost sinful to bring the old side here to scratch and ruin, as they must, if moved. Then, our \"thirty-year-old tables,\" as you called them, would be sadly out of place in our bright new dining room, I fear.\n\nIn September you approved of the plan of the carpenters building tables and benches when they were unable to work on the building. They have worked steadily on the house so that there has been nothing done in the line of furniture making. Does your approval still hold good, or would you advise me not to ask them to do this?\n\nWith all these perplexing realities before me, your letter would indeed be disheartening did I not know that you have now, as always, an interest at heart, and I feel that somehow you will find a way out of all these difficulties. In the firm belief that you will succeed in securing a supplementary estimate in which to include an item for our school, I will trust and hope.\n\nThanking you again for your helpful kindness, I am\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSister Mary Gilbert.\nLOCKERBIE & HOLE\nSANITARY AND HEATING ENGINEERS\nGAS FITTING\n\nALL ACCOUNTS RENDERED MONTHLY\n\nNOTICE!

(RG 10, Volume 6367, file 762-5, part 2)\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding a report on the proposed water supply system for the St. Bruno Indian Residential school, I wired to the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary as soon as your letter was received asking him to make a definite recommendation on this matter as soon as possible. The Commissioner wired in reply that a report would be mailed in a few days recommending an expenditure for water supply and fire protection at approximately $14,000.\n\nI have today received an interim report on this subject, copy of which is enclosed, outlining the works required for the domestic water supply and fire protection of this school.\n\nThe Commissioner states that plans are now being prepared in his office together with an estimate and that these will be submitted at an early date so that the work can be proceeded with as soon as the approval of the Indian Department has been obtained.\n\nThe Commissioner states that he does not think it would be desirable in this case to call for tenders and considers that the best method to follow would be to give the work to Mr. Towers, who was contractor on the Onion Lake school work and Ile a la Crosse Hospital, on a cost plus basis.\n\nI will communicate with you again as soon as further information is received from the Commissioner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nPer M. F. C.\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir,\n\nReference the investigation of a suitable water supply for the St. Bruno Indian School in the NW\u00bc of sec. 8, tp. 74, rge. 13, west 5th meridian, near Jousard, Alta.\n\nI am forwarding under separate cover the following:\n\n1. Blue-prints of the new building together with the alteration and installing of heating and plumbing fixtures in the old building.\n\n2. Profile of ground line over proposed pipeline from the lake to the new boiler room (not built as yet).\n\n3. General and detail plans to accompany this report, in order that proper plans may be prepared.\n\nThe first matter under consideration was selecting a site for an intake at the lake. Depths were taken at places all along the frontage of the school bounds within reason, and it was found that the lake was very shallow near the school. Many holes were cut other than those shown on the plan, until it was found that the site which is shown on the plan was the best location that could be obtained. It was expected that some eight or ten feet of water would be obtained fairly close to the shore if locating was carried out to the east of the school, and the Rev. Father Giroux loaned me a fisherman who was conversant with the lake around this vicinity. The site selected was produced into the lake for 1,800 feet, in order to determine if any banks would intervene in low stages of the lake which should, however, be discontinued as the lake is in a fairly low stage this fall and winter.\n\nA pump house can be located immediately on top of the well defined bank where the pipeline comes out of the lake, and the floor of the pump house would be about twenty-four feet above the present water level and about thirty-five feet above the bottom of the well.\n\nIt will be observed from a study of the profile that the bed of the lake rises at station 6 \u00bc 70 to station 7 \u00bc 20 and is more shallow than closer to the bank.\n\nIt is proposed that the pipeline should be carried out to about station 3 \u00bc 00 if that be deemed sufficient; otherwise, it will have to be carried out to station 9 \u00bc 00 with a trench constructed to lower it over the hump between stations 6 \u00bc 00 and station 8 \u00bc 00.\n\nIn connection with this pipeline into the lake it must be recorded that great ice shoves occur on this shore and with a maximum ice depth of four feet, it is possible that sheet ice in the break-up may be up-ended and gouge into the shallow water, with possible damage to the pipeline.\n\nOn the other hand, if the formation of the ground should be favourable at the well, it might be preferable to\nconnect an intake into the well and pump directly from the well into the proposed 4,000 gallon pressure tanks in the boiler room. Taken on the whole, I am inclined to recommend that the latter procedure be adopted, with an 8\" pipe between the lake and the well, with double strainer on the lake end.\n\nThe pump house is proposed to house an eight or twelve horse-power gasoline engine, together with a suitable pump, and will be kept heated in the winter time with a stove. The water line from the pump house to the school will be below frost line, and should be fairly easily constructed for the most part.\n\nA fire hydrant should be located some thirty feet away from the new building with a shut-off valve in the 4\" main, so that in the event of a fire, the hydrant will function, either with the closed valve or pumping into hose as well as into the pressure tanks.\n\nThe dimensions of the boiler house are shown, in which it is proposed to house the pressure tanks, with a water pressure of forty pounds into the tank and coming out into the school service at around twenty-five or thirty pounds.\n\nOwing to lack of space it is suggested that these tanks be placed on top of the other on an I steel frame and connected together, with a trip valve at the entry.\n\nRegarding a site for a tank as outlined in the third last paragraph of your letter and instructions, the total water used will be around 10,000 to 15,000 gals. per diem, and with the use of two pressure tanks in the boiler room there would be around 4,000 gals. always on hand, and with the centrifugal pump, it would simply be a matter of pumping sometime in the morning and afternoon. There are no pressure tanks at the school. No existing water system is in the school, except the old summer service on the top of the ground, with a small gasoline engine on the lake shore.\n\nPlease instruct me as to any other further information which may be required, as careful note was made of all pertinent data, when visiting the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) W. G. Stuart.\nApril 15, 30\n\nM.J.D.

We have also prepared an estimate of cost for the construction of the works and for the necessary material, copies of which are attached.\n\nThe estimate of cost for the 40,000 gallon elevated tank was submitted by the Dominion Bridge Company and is considered a trifle high. We have therefore requested the Horton Steel Works of Toronto to submit an estimate for this work. With the amalgamation of the Riverside Iron Works and the Manitoba Iron Works with the Dominion Bridge Company, it is now impossible to get competitive bids on this class of work in western Canada.\n\nOur estimate includes the figures submitted by the Dominion Bridge Company, as it was thought advisable to get the scheme under consideration by the Department of Indian Affairs with as little further delay as possible because it is not considered that an alternative bid will reduce the cost of the tower by more than a few hundred dollars. Mr. Towers is ready to take his men on to the job at a moment's notice to start work on the pipeline excavation and the concrete base for the tower and pumping plant.\n\nThe Dominion Bridge Company has advised us that if awarded the contract for the tower, they will manufacture same at their new plant in Calgary and will commence work on it within two or three weeks from date of order.\n\nIn regard to the material for the pipeline, Messrs. Bell and Morris have informed us that the pipes will be shipped from Toronto immediately upon receipt of order.\n\nWould you please forward a copy of the plans and estimate to the Department of Indian Affairs and ascertain from them whether they wish to proceed with the works.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Reclamation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of March 6th regarding the water supply system for the St. Bruno Indian residential school, I enclose here-with copy of a letter received from the Commissioner of Irrigation, together with estimates of the cost of material and labour and a plan showing the proposed layout and details of the method of construction. From this you will see the material is estimated to cost $20,034.46 and the labour of installation $7,422.52.\n\nYou will notice that the Horton Steel works of Toronto have been asked to submit an alternative estimate for the elevated tank and it is possible that this will slightly reduce the estimated cost.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions with regard to this project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have reviewed the expenditure in connection with the building, and I find that in the fiscal year 1929-30 the Department paid nearly $41,000. There has already been paid this fiscal year - since April first - $11,780 and there are unpaid accounts on the file, which will now be paid, amounting to $3,780.\n\nI regret that the Department cannot favourably consider any further time sheets or accounts for materials. The shelving and cupboards and furnishing, the laundry equipment, the electric light and the water supply will have to stand until funds are provided by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Scott\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Mr. Scott\u2014\n\nI hope you will not find me too persistent in coming to ask you to take a very special interest in the matter of securing the furniture for our new house. I was speaking about the opening of our school after vacation to His Lordship Bishop Guy, as we want to receive the pupils in their new quarters and their return to the Mission. He advised me to write to you immediately asking if you could possibly give your full approval which would enable us to make the purchase as soon as possible, and prepare it all during vacation. I might state here that His Lordship said you would probably come out to see him this summer; that would mean a visit to St. Bruno's. What an honor it would be for me all, to open wide the doors of our beautiful school for the first time, to its greatest and most generous benefactor. We are hoping that this trip will not be...\nSister Mary Gilberte,\n\nI am writing to express our anticipation of his visit. We know that His Lordship, Bishop Amy, is an intimate friend of yours. His presence among us seems to make you more at ease. He has been here frequently and we love to receive him. He is so kind, so understanding and sympathetic.\n\nIf it were possible, we would wish to give him a princely reception at each visit, but just now this is almost impossible. The house and its apartments are not being equipped as yet. However, I know you will understand our present predicament and, as you have so often done before, come to our aid.\n\nThe letter sent recently by Mr. MacKenzie somewhat disheartened me at first; it seems so hard to have to put up with another few months of hardship caused by the lack of water and laundry equipment, hiring the laundress. I can speak through experience, but as in the other cases, this problem placed under your care and attention is sure to succeed.\n\nShould my request be granted, kindly tell me which firm you would like to patronize.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nSister Mary Gilberte\nGrouard, Alta., June 26th, 1930.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nDr Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott:\n\nRev. Father Giroux and Rev. Sister Mary Gilberte have referred to me their correspondence with regard to present difficulties re the completion and furnishing of St Bruno's Indian Residential School. Their intention is obviously that I take up the matter with you personally.\n\nAt the time the last letter from the Department was received, removal of the old furnaces had been done and excavation for the new power (or boiler) building started. The principal is at a loss how to proceed as the boilers and furnaces which are already on the ground must be installed before Winter. At this time of the year labor is cheap and the principal is more than anxious to see the work brought to completion.\n\nI understand that lack of funds is responsible for orders lately received at St Bruno. May I suggest that the principal (or our Corporation) be allowed to borrow from the Bank such amount as will be necessary to complete the work or such amount that you may think fit, same to be reimbursed the principal (or the Corporation) when funds will be provided by Parliament.\n\nRegarding the furnishings, a list of which has been supplied the Department by Rev. Sister Mary Gilberte, May I make the same suggestion?\n\nThe Department is to be congratulated on the work done at St Bruno and it would be almost a disaster if same was not brought to a proper completion. I understand that you intend coming to St Bruno this year. I would be more than pleased to meet you there and even bring you to St Bernard's School and Mission.\n\nHoping to be favored with the acceptance of the above suggestions and even begging the advantage of a telegram addressed at Grouard as the matter is pressing, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have taken the matter up with Father Giroux who signed and forwarded them on to your Department on May 30th.\n\nFather Giroux arrived in Town this Morning and has signed the enclosed Duplicate Copies which I am forwarding to you, as no doubt the others have been lost.

Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter of the 9th of May when the accounts of J. P. Fitzgerald were returned to you, as it was considered that the charges were excessive. These accounts have been returned to the Department, but the prices have not been revised. The account amounts to \u00a36,260.56, and a cheque for \u00a3300.00 has been sent to J. P. Fitzgerald in account. Before the balance of the account can be paid it will be necessary for the company to submit revised accounts together with time sheets for all labour and a detailed statement of fare and expenses.\n\nIn the charges for your information I would draw your attention to 4205 feet of 26\" radiation. This radiation is listed at fifty cents per foot, and you will note that their charge is considerably in excess of this amount. The same applies to other items in the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

He represented that the new boilers and other mechanical plant should be installed and that the furnishings should be secured this year and he suggested that the Church might borrow the money until the Department could arrange for an appropriation. You asked His Lordship for an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe following figures have now been received. You will note that practically all the work and equipment that is required to really complete the new wing is requested. However, there is no mention of electric light or water supply, which have been estimated at $2,400 and $27,400, respectively.\n\nLabour since May 17th, including boiler house ...... $6,237.00\n\nInstallation of mechanical plant,\n(including the supplying of laundry equipment and bake oven) ...... 6,800.00\n\nInstallation of water supply and arranging for laundry sewage disposal... 2,750.00\n\nFurnishings ......................... 2,435.00\n\nMiscellaneous ....................... 792.00\n\nTotal .................. $19,014.00\n\nIt is not clear whether the cupboards and shelving, etc., are included in these figures.\n\nWe have already paid approximately $17,500 from this year's Vote for this school. There is no item for the purpose in the Main Estimates and the one in the Supplementaries was disallowed. The only suggestion I can make is that Bishop Guy's proposal, to borrow the money, be approved.\n\nRussell Perrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

No. 62252, 2nd Battalion. I am a carpenter by trade with 20 years experience.\n\nI just finish working on St. Bruno mission school where your department has just built a new school. As I have always sent some blank receipts for the time that was the bonus that were send at your department.\n\nI don't believe having received the amount due to me for the hours that I worked. Will you kindly please tell me how many hours work are registered at my name by your department and the amount paid to me by your department.\n\nAn answer will be much appreciate as soon as it is possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6367, file 762-5, part 2)\nAugust 1, 1930.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 9th ultimo, estimating the cost of completing the work at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. I note that you do not include the electric light or the water supply. I take it for granted that these improvements can stand until next year.\n\nThe item for this school was disallowed in our Supplementary Estimates and the accounts we have already paid this year have had to be charged to the general Appropriation for Indian Education. This Vote is really completely assigned and I regret that the Department is forced to accept Your Lordship's proposal. Arrangements should be made to have the really necessary work completed by church funds. Time sheets and receipts, in duplicate, should be kept, showing the expenditure. I shall arrange to have an item in next year's Appropriation to reimburse the church authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRt. Rev. Jos. Guy, O. M.

Lussier at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alta. The improvement at this school has been undertaken on a day labour basis, and the Reverend Principal is responsible for the engagement of the men. The expenses for the past few weeks are being paid by the church authorities, who expect to be reimbursed by the Department if funds are provided at the next session of Parliament. The labour up to May 17th has been paid by the Department, and I find that the name of P. Lussier occurs on the time sheets for this calendar year, as shown on the attached page.\n\nYour correspondent states that he was threatened with dismissal if he did not sign blank forms at the end of each week. I will ask the Reverend Principal of the School for an explanation if your correspondent so wishes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nP. M. Kennedy, Esq., M.

Macleod\nST. BRUNO'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) Cont'd.\n\nexperience at teaching in Indian schools. There are 45 boys and 63 girls enrolled.\n\nThe school building is an up-to-date, modern frame building, and, being practically new, is in splendid condition. The building is heated with hot water, and lighted with electric light. Water is on tap throughout the building.\n\nThe water supply is pumped from the lake. The installation is at present only a temporary one, but it has worked very satisfactorily during the present winter. It will be necessary to put the pipes down deeper below the frost line and carry them farther out into the lake in order to insure permanency.\n\nThe building provides two large, well equipped dormitories. In the boys' dormitory there are 50 beds, 24 basins, 3 baths, and 3 toilets. In the girls' dormitory there are 65 beds, 28 basins, 3 baths, and 3 toilets.\n\nFire protection consists of stand pipes with hose connections on each floor and a number of chemical fire extinguishers conveniently placed throughout the building. The building is three stories high with a basement. Three outside stairway fire escapes are provided with easy access to them on each floor. An outside stairway is placed at each end of the building, and one in the centre. I was informed that the children are being given instruction in fire drill. I found this building in excellent condition throughout.\n\nAn ample supply of wholesome food is provided. The children are given milk, as well as meat and\nST. BRUNO'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) Cont'd.\n\nand vegetables, daily. They have a well nourished appearance, and I heard no complaints regarding the food supplied at this school.\n\nSeven cows are kept for milking purposes. They have a large garden, but last year the potato crop was a failure, and they have to purchase their supply. They had, however, plenty of carrots and other vegetables for their requirements.\n\nThey have a large laundry room, but the only equipment is five set tubs and some small old wash tubs and hand machines. The Sisters say that washing for 112 children makes heavy work for both the children and the staff, and they would like to be supplied with two medium sized washers, an extractor, mangle and section of drier, a low pressure boiler for heating hot water for the laundry, and a stove for heating the irons. They can do the bulk of their washing then with power and still have sufficient small clothes left to provide instruction for the girls.\n\nThe girls are given instruction in sewing, knitting, and fancy work, as well as in general housework. The boys assist with the garden work and care of the stock.\n\nWood has been exclusively used for fuel until this winter. A seam of coal was discovered about four miles from the school building, and 50 tons were secured at the beginning of the winter. This coal has proved to make very satisfactory fuel.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6367, file 762-5, part 2)\nST. BRUNO'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)

He has two lay brothers and some hired help to do the outside work. A large staff of Sisters of Providence have charge of the inside work. There are four classrooms each with its separate teacher.

The material throughout is of the best grade and no pains have been spared to produce a machine that can be relied upon to give many years of satisfactory service.\n\nThe Main Trunion Journals operate in roller bearings. Less power is required to drive the machine and wear is almost entirely eliminated, with the result that all gears are always in correct mesh and alignment. Broken gears, worn trunion journals and bearing replacements are never necessary on this washer. The main bearings are entirely separated from the tub by packed stuffing boxes, which absolutely prevents oil and grease from entering the washer or water from coming out.\n\nThe Reversing Movement is our Beaver Ball Bearing type in which all the thrust of operating the belt shifter slides is taken by hardened steel balls. The movement is designed so as to give a positive even shifting of the belts, irrespective of wear, so that the cylinder...\nBeaver Roller Bearing Washer\u2014Header on End\n\nruns the same number of revolutions in either direction. The gears are machine cut from solid blanks and the main gear is thirty inches in diameter. The gear has a split hub to facilitate easy removal. A combined gear lock and hand wheel is provided.\n\nThe Cylinder is of the best grade all heart stock long leaf yellow pine with hard Maple ribs. The three lifting ribs are extra deep to ensure rapid washing. The trunions are bolted to heavy brass rings. The hinges are of brass bolted through a brass batton with an enclosed brass lock.\n\nThe Outer Case is of the finest clear Cypress and is furnished with a brass apron at the door opening. Inspection plates are provided in each end so that trunion bolts may be tightened without removing the upper half of the case.\n\nThe Inlet and Outlet Tees are connected by a 1\u00bd inch pipe into which steam can be injected. When steam is being used to heat the water this construction gives a rapid circulation and absolutely prevents any steam from coming in contact with the wood of the cylinder or case. The water inlet is 2 inches in diameter. The steam inlet is \u00be inch. A 3 inch plug type discharge valve is supplied.\n\nThis Washer can be arranged for motor drive, in which case it is driven from the motor through short belts. The motor is carried on a substantial cast iron base bolted firmly to the frame of the machine.\n\nAt a small additional cost these machines may be equipped with a Beaver 6 inch foot operated discharge valve, Beaver Water Level Indicator, visible anywhere in the wash room, Beaver Soap and Soda filling doors, and Monel Metal Lifting Ribs in the cylinder.\n\n| SIZE   | NUMBER OF DOORS | NUMBER OF COM PARTMENTS | PULLEYS | BELTS | SPEED | FLOOR SPACE | WEIGHT |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------------|--------|\n| 36 x 36| One             | One                     | 16 inch | 1\u00bc x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 44 x 72     | 1500 lbs. |\n| 36 x 52| One             | Two                     | 16 inch | 1\u00bc x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 44 x 88     | 1650 lbs. |\n| 40 x 40| One             | One                     | 16 inch | 1\u00bc x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 48 x 76     | 1600 lbs. |\n| 40 x 52| One             | Two                     | 16 inch | 1\u00bc x 1\u00bd | 225 RPM | 48 x 88     | 1750 lbs. |\n\nSINGLE GEARED ONLY\n\nThe above are our standard sizes.

This tends to absorb vibration, allows the Machine to balance easily, and to pick up speed quickly.\n\nThe Wide Square Base distributes the weight over a large area, and allows this Machine to be operated at higher speeds than is possible with a small or round base.\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\n\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP AND CHEMICALS, LTD., WINNIPEG\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor\u2014Continued\n\nThe Basket is of Perforated Copper, heavily tinned and strongly reinforced by steel bands. The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick adjustment or changing of the rubber springs.\n\nThe Beaver circulating oil system ensures complete lubrication of the main bearing at all times. The oil well is very accessible for inspection of the oil level and refilling. From the oil well the oil is led to a sump in the base of the machine, whence it circulates through the bearing, returning to the sump. Owing to the large capacity of the oil well only occasional attention is required.\n\nAll Beaver Extractors have countershafts attached to the curb, and may be for straight or angle drive. The angle drive, as shown in the cut, costs a little more than the straight drive, but effects a saving in floor space, and allows the Extractor to be placed in line with the washers. All Extractors have our improved adjustable friction clutch pulley, which gives a gradual increase in speed without strain to any part of the Machine. Motor drive extractors are direct connected with push button control.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size   | Drive     | Speed of Counter R.P.M. | Diam. of Counter | Foot Space inches | Shipping Weight |\n|--------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| 26 inch| Straight  | 550                     | 7 inch           | 36 x 60           | 1550 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Angle     | 550                     | 7 inch           | 36 x 36           | 1600 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Motor     |                         |                  | 36 x 40           | 1700 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Straight  | 500                     | 7 inch           | 40 x 60           | 1750 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Angle     | 500                     | 7 inch           | 40 x 40           | 1800 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Motor     |                         |                  | 40 x 44           | 1950 lbs.       |\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\n\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP AND CHEMICALS, LTD., WINNIPEG\nMay 27, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your No. 131-4-5, Laundry Equipment, dated May 19th, we quote f.o.b.

The floor will have to be prepared specially for the draining of the water. This work will have to be done under the direction or orders of the Company installing this equipment. In fact the whole installation will have to be supervised by the Company's man. Upon receiving advice from the Department as to the name of the Company chosen I will get in touch with the proper office and send diagram of room and place of drain.\n\nFollowing your letter of recent date I am placing with the J.H.

When I insisted upon knowing what authority had been given them to do so, I found out that they would not insist for our taking same. Therefore, I would consider and approve of your suggestion of taking the plant lately discarded at Duck Lake provided same would be strong enough to accommodate St Bruno School.\n\nI do not know in what condition is the St Bruno equipment but if it were in good order I would suggest that same be sent over to Sturgeon Lake School.\n\nI suppose that a man will be provided by the Department for the new installation at St Bruno and in the case of a new installation at Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\nMr Russell M. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier:\n\nUpon my return I discussed with Rev. Fr Falher the water system question as suggested by you and Mr Scott during my visit in Ottawa.\n\nWe are both of opinion that the present temporary system installed by us could be made permanent by certain alterations and changes that would entail an expense that would range between $1500.00 and $2000.00. The water supply would then be assured satisfactorily for quite a number of years thus relieving the Department from the heavy expense expected.\n\nHowever, the amount referred to above would not include the erection of a water tower or a water tank, the former outside or the latter inside. We have presently a pneumatic tank in the basement. If same could be changed to a larger one I presume we could easily substitute the new pressure tank to the water tower or inside water tank (which would work from the upper story).\n\nHoping that we will be able to meet your desires in allaying the cost of the water system installation, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\nJuly 2, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD.\n\nThe Department wishes to install an electric light plant at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, which is in the federal district of Peace River. A generating plant is being shipped from one of our schools in Saskatchewan, where they have lately connected up with the Hydro.

It is required for the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, at Jeussard, Alta. Will you please make arrangements to have the 15 horse power engine, the dynamo and the two direct current motors properly crated and shipped, by freight, prepaid, to the Principal of the School, the Rev.

Schmidt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, July 2, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to laundry equipment at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. On the 22nd ultimo, the order for this equipment was placed with the Beaver Soap and Chemicals Limited, of Winnipeg, and the Rev. Father Falher, O. M. I., was written to the effect that the Company has been instructed to communicate with him to obtain information regarding shafting, etc., and, at a later date, to send one of their mechanics to make the installation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Joseph Guy, O. M. I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard,\nAlta.\nOttawa, July 2, 1931.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 15th ultimo, with reference to an electric plant for the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. The Department is now arranging to ship, from Dusk Lake, Sask., a 15 horse power engine, a dynamo and two direct current motors. I am also securing the name of a competent local battery service company, who will supply the batteries and will supervise the installation of the entire electric plant.\n\nYour Lordship will receive a separate communication with reference to the advisability of transferring the old electric light plant and batteries from St. Bruno's to the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Joseph Guy, O. M. I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nJuly 5, 1931.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe Your No. 131-4-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe were very glad to receive advice of your acceptance of our tender on Laundry Machinery for St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, and we have written to Reverend Father Falher for the necessary information to permit us to figure on a complete installation for this equipment, including our engineer's services.\n\nWe will advise you further in this regard just as soon as we hear from the Reverend Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBEAVER SOAP AND CHEMICALS LIMITED.\n\nH. B. Wilcox,\nVice President.\nI wish to state that Rev. Fr. Falher, Principal of St. Bruno Residential School, advises me that the batteries of the present plant at his school are in bad condition. I believe we could find a man able to repair same at a minimum cost. Otherwise, new batteries would have to be installed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNew batteries may be unnecessary any\nGROUARD, ALTA\n10th of July, 1931\n\nPERSONAL\n\nMr Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor Scott:\n\nI take the liberty of asking if it would be in order for the Department to give at least a partial payment on accounts promised for St Bruno's and Wabasca Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI must say that we have already paid more than $2,000.00 interest at the Bank for Wabasca and $1,200.00 for St Bruno. The returns from Wabasca are not in yet and I must admit that through the inexperience of the Principal proper receipts were not signed by the man nor labor returns made. I have asked the Principal to prepare a return with affidavit and hope that same will prove satisfactory. Regarding St Bruno everything is in order and labour returns, receipts and invoices in part are presently in Mr Ferrier's office. Pending the sending of the balance could you not send us a partial payment at least to allay the situation.\n\nIf possible I would also ask for an advanced payment of about $12,000.00 or more on the quarterly grant of September covering St Bruno's, St Bernard's, Fort Vermilion, Wabasca and Sturgeon Lake Residential Schools. Of course I presume said amounts were voted by Parliament.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\nJuly 15, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to a partial payment on account of the building activity at the St. Bruno's and Wabasso Indian Residential Schools. I regret that our vote is not yet available, but I can promise that Your Lordship's request will not be overlooked and that cheques will be directed as soon as possible. I have asked Mr. Ferrier to arrange also for advances on the September quarter grant to the schools in which you are interested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRight Rev. Jos.

The equipment on which we quoted you is completely manufactured in Canada by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Ltd., and is of the same type equipment which we have been furnishing to the Indian Schools for some time.\n\nWe surely would be very pleased to receive this order and would appreciate any information you can give us in connection with it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MURPHY.\n\nIn June, 1929, with the concurrence of the Honourable Charles Stewart, the Department arranged to enlarge the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, near Grouard, Alta. In view of the location, the Church authorities were given the responsibility for the undertaking, on a day labour basis. Plans were prepared by the Department Architect and the work was proceeded with. The Department gave instructions that competitive prices were to be secured and that local labour was to be engaged as far as possible. During the fiscal year 1929-30, the expenditure for the new building amounted to $39,980.14. During the past fiscal year, $23,591.20 was expended. Last year, funds were not available to complete the work, but it was extremely desirable that the building activity should be continued. It was therefore arranged that the Oblate Order should pay the bills and then present receipts for reimbursement this year. You will remember that there is an item of $37,000 in the current Appropriation for this purpose and to complete the mechanical plant. Receipts, amounting to $18,544.52, are now to hand, and, with your concurrence, I propose to make reimbursement to His Lordship Bishop J. Guy, O. M. I., of Grouard.\n\nI may say that all of the $37,000 available will not be expended. In addition to the present payment, there will be purchased this year laundry machinery at a cost of $2,275; there will be improvements to the water supply, at a cost of $1,750; and approximately $800 will be required to put the electric lighting plant in good condition. The electric plant is a used one, from another of our schools, where Hydro is available. I expect that the building will be completed at a total cost this year of less than $25,000, which, of course, includes the present payment. I have asked Mr. Ferrier, who is informed concerning the matter, to offer any explanation you require.\n\nA. S.

Mr. Tanguay is demanding that the additional 30\u00a2 an hour be paid him.\n\nI may say that a Mr. Desrosiers of Falher has made a similar complaint to me.\n\nWhat position do you take with regard to this complaint? Do you think that the Department has any responsibility in connection with this matter?\n\nYours truly,\n\n(D. M. Kennedy)\n\nK/A\nMarch 19th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Kennedy,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March 16th, with reference to the claim made by Mr. E. Tanguay with reference to the rate of wages paid him as carpenter working on the St. Bruno Indian residential school.\n\nAs you no doubt remember we have had some previous correspondence on this subject. The building was being erected by the Principal of the school on a day labour basis, and I presume that he paid the local rate for carpenters. This school is near Indiana Station on the Northern Alberta Railway.\n\nI wrote you on September 23rd, last on this subject and on the 18th of the same month with reference to a claim of Mr. P. Lunsier. I think if Mr. Tanguay was paid the local rate for labour he would have no complaint.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD. M.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of March 19th in reply to mine of March 16th.\n\nLast year when I wrote regarding these claims, I was not clear on the point about the exact amount that was paid by the Department for the labour and the actual amount that was paid to the carpenters. There may be something that I don't understand about this matter, but I can hardly agree that when the Department allowed $1.00 per hour for carpenter work on the St. Bruno Indian Residential School, that the carpenters should be satisfied when they received only sixty cents per hour. The point is, that somebody must have received the difference of forty cents per hour and I am wondering what service was given entitling anyone to retain this money.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(D. M.

You seem to be under the impression that the Department allowed either 90\u00a2 or $1.00 an hour for carpenter work. This is not the case, as the labour returns and supporting receipts now before the Department show that Mr. E. Tanguay and the other carpenters received 60\u00a2 an hour. As I mentioned in my letter of the 19th instant, I presume the Principal paid the local rate for carpenters. The Department then reimbursed him at that rate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Your power load alone consisting of motors already connected, require more power than the 7\u00bd K.W. generator would deliver. On top of this you would also have your lighting load. Taking this into consideration we would recommend that you install not less than a 10 K.W. generator. We are making an estimate of a plant of this size, using a semi-Diesel type of engine which uses crude oil for fuel. The first cost of the plant would be a little greater, but the saving of fuel would more than off-set the greater cost.\n\nWe also found that the wiring in parts of your building and the line is in very bad shape. This creates a great fire hazard and we are also quoting you a separate estimate on the clearing up of this work.\n\nThe plant we are quoting you is in stock in Winnipeg, so immediate delivery could be made.\n\nWe are submitting a tentative estimate on repairing and installing your 7\u00bd K.W. plant. If you decide to have the plant installed it would have to be shipped to Edmonton, where we would give you a detailed estimate on complete over-haul.\n\n* MEMBER ALBERTA ELECTRICAL ASSOCIATION *\nHowever no guarantee could be given as to the power delivery or life of the plant. In our estimation the plant is completely worn out and it would be folly on your part to install this plant, more especially since your school is in such an isolated position. Many parts of the plant are missing, there being no water tanks, switch board, piping, silencer, etc., and some parts of the engine are missing also.\n\nEnclosed you will find estimate on plant and a rough sketch of the installation in the space reserved in the engine room for the plant.\n\nHoping to be favored with this valued contract,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMacKillop Electric Co.\n\nper\n\nRRM/CM.\nMacKillop Electric Company\nELECTRIC CONTRACTORS AND DEALERS\n10436 82ND AVENUE\nEdmonton, Alberta\nSept 1931\n\nRev.

As the Department's funds are very limited this year, it is desired to keep expenditures as low as possible. In your quotation for repairing and installing the above you quote a lump sum including batteries. Would you kindly advise me the price separately for repairs and the batteries, also give me more information as to the condition of the plant and the need of repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nMacKillop Electric Co.,\n10436 - 82nd Avenue,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nOur quotation on a new plant of 4 K.W. greater capacity using a Renton Hornsby Semi-Deisel crude oil engine, at a price of $4200.00 is only $1665.00 greater than re-installing the plant now at the school. We consider that this would be the most economical in the long run and there would be ample capacity to handle the load for many years.\n\nWe would also call your attention to the wiring in the engine room, laundry, outside line and pump house as being in a very unsafe condition. The wiring is run open over pipes, cement walls, etc., and is a great life and fire hazard. We also gave a quotation of $528.00 for piping this part of the building and repairing the line.\n\nHoping that we may be favored with this valued contract we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMacKillop Electric Co.\n\nMEMBER ALBERTA ELECTRICAL ASSOCIATION\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Your letter of October 6th, No.-131-4-5\n\nIn answer to your letter re, plant at the Blue Quill Indian School. In checking over this plant we find that there was no switch board, no fuel tank or cooling tank, no piping of any kind, also several small parts of the engine were missing. Also the generator commutator needs turning down and new brushes etc.\n\nAs we stated in our letter to the principal of the school we considered that the engine could not be repaired except at a cost equal to that of a new engine. The generator can be repaired at a very small cost but this generator is not large enough to handle the load now connected at this school. If the plant was repaired and installed you would find that it would be greatly over-loaded from the start and would have to be replaced in a short time.\n\nThe foundation, piping, tank, switch board etc., needed to install this plant, amounting to nearly one thousand dollars would be of no use when installing a larger plant at some future date. Therefore we would recommend that if possible a larger plant should be installed at this time, using a crude oil engine. The generator when repaired could be used in some smaller school with a new engine.\n\nOur quotation on the work amounting to $2535.00, was $750.00 for the batteries, F.O.B. Indiana and $1785.00 for the supply of new parts, installing foundations etc. for the new plant, batteries and engine.\n\nMEMBER ALBERTA ELECTRICAL ASSOCIATION\nOttawa, October 30, 1931.\n\nMacKillop Electric Company,\n10436 - 82nd Ave.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nREFERENCE LIGHTING PLANT ST.

Love & Co., Edmonton Ltd., to pay you the sum of $2,752.00 to be deducted from the contract price of the MacKillop Electric Company which had been assigned to H.G. Love and Co., I beg to state that this order has been received, and when the account is received, payment will be made as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes\nActing Secretary.\n\nMessrs. Mumford, Medland, Limited,\nPortage and Wall Sts.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, December 31st., 1931.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Payment for Addition to St. Bruno's Indian Residential School\n\nEducation cheque No. 2268 for $18,544.52 was issued on August 10th, last, in favour of the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Grouard, Alberta, to reimburse them for expenditures made during 1930 in connection with the enlargement of St. Bruno's school. I desire to draw your attention to the following remarks in connection with this payment:\n\n(1) An explanation of this payment is given on your form 52 accompanying the accounts, from which I infer that your department was liable for the expenditures but that, as funds were not available from the appropriation for 1930-31, the Corporation was requested to pay the accounts and to submit receipts for re-inbursement from this year's funds.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to Section 49, Sub-Section 2, of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act which states that \"all estimates submitted to Parliament shall be for the services coming in course of payment during the fiscal year,\" and to Section 60 which requires me to direct the attention of the House to all payments charged to the appropriation accounts which \"did not occur within the period of the account\". The intention of these sections, it appears to me, is to prevent such payments as the one in question.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI am therefore of opinion that if authority could not have been obtained for the payment of this account in 1930-31, the amount should have been specifically mentioned in the estimates for 1931-32, in order that Parliament might know they were voting moneys for an indebtedness incurred in a previous year. As neither of these courses was followed, I am of opinion that the approval of the Governor in Council should have been obtained before payment was made.\n\n(2) Included in the total payment are two items of $203.27 for material supplied by Gaults Alberta Limited. The vouchers are similar in all details except that one is marked \"copy\". Apparently a duplicate payment of $203.27 has been made. This firm's account of December 17th for $149.73 provided for a discount of three per cent. if paid within ten days of the first of the following month, but though payment was made on January 8th the discount was not deducted, resulting in an overpayment of $4.49.\n\n(3) The accounts submitted by the J.H.Ashdown Hardware Company, which total $455.87, have not been receipted. They contain the following overpayments: accounts for $2.26, $2.15 and $.55 dated March 4th and 6th, 1930 were all previously paid by Education cheque No.1549 of June 9th, 1930; account for $4.34 dated March 18th, 1930 was included twice in account paid by cheque No. 1549; discount of two per cent. on statement of account of September 17th was not deducted, causing an overpayment of $3.05.\n\n(4) Seventeen labour paylists for the period December 1st to March 28th have not been properly certified.\n\n(5) In many cases freight charges by the various firms are not supported by way-bills or receipted vouchers. These should be supplied in all cases.\n\nI desire to again draw your attention to Section 54 and Section 58, subsection 21 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act which provides, respectively, that the\n\ndepartmental\ndepartmental officers shall audit the details of the several accounts in the first place, and that the vouchers bear evidence of having been completely checked. The vouchers covering the payment in question are being returned to you under separate cover in order that the matters referred to in this letter may be adjusted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAuditor General.\nJanuary 12, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Gonthier:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, concerning the payment for the addition to the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. I note that this indebtedness should have been specifically mentioned in the Estimates or the payment authorized by the Governor in Council.\n\nThe Department is writing to the church authorities for a refund of the following amounts: $203.27, which was a duplicate payment; $4.49, which was a discount at 3% and $3.05, which was a discount at 2%, and the following amounts, which were previously paid by Indian Education cheque No. 1549 - $2.26, $2.15 and $5.51, or a total of $815.77. Further, I am writing to the J. H. Ashdown Hardware Company, with a view to securing a refund for $4.34, which was included twice in one of their accounts.\n\nYou refer to the Ashdown accounts totalling $455.87 as not receipted. If you will examine their statement for this amount, where it is turned up, you will find their receipt of November 26, 1930.\n\nThe 17 paylists which have not been properly certified had attached thereto receipts and it was thought by our officers that these would be sufficient in this case. However, I have arranged to have these forms properly certified, and they will be returned to you.\n\nGeorges Gonthier, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nto you in due course.\n\nI now realize that all freight charges should have been supported by way bills, even in a case like this, where reimbursement is being made. It would be extremely difficult, in view of elapsed time, to secure these supporting papers, and, unless you insist, I will not commence correspondence in this connection.\n\nI have noted for future guidance, and have given instructions, concerning your remarks that departmental officers shall audit the details of the several accounts in the first place and that the vouchers bear evidence of having been completely checked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nYou will remember that I discussed with Your Lordship certain overpayments which had been made in connection with the $16,000 cheque which was directed to you in reimbursement for the work during 1930 at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. I have gone over these accounts carefully with the Auditor General's office, and it is true that Your Lordship forwarded double duplicate receipts for the J. H. Ashdown payment of $203.27. This amount will have to be refunded to the Receiver General. Further, there was included in the Ashdown receipts accounts for $2.26; $2.15 and 55\u00a2, which had been paid direct from the Department to Ashdowns some month before. The Auditor General also points out that in two of the Ashdown accounts, you did not take the discount allowed for prompt payment, and the amounts in this connection are $4.86 and $3.05, or a grand total of $7.91. The Department has no option in this matter but to write to Your Lordship, asking for a refund of this amount. Please have your cheque made out to the Receiver General and it will be deposited to Indian Education.\n\nI am enclosing 17 paylists which have not been properly certified, and I should be grateful if you would have Father Falher sign these if he has knowledge of their correctness and return them to me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. Joseph Guy, O. M. I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nJanuary 13, 1932.\n\nA. F.

G. Love & Co., Edmonton Limited. The assignment was forwarded to you on November 23rd last, together with an order for payment to us of $2,752.00. We asked if you would advise us that you had this order on file, and that same would be honored in due course on approval of the work.\n\nNot having had a reply, we are taking the liberty of bringing the matter to your attention, and would appreciate an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCredit Manager\n\nIndian Affairs.

This cheque covered accounts for supplies furnished for the above mentioned Indian Residential School.

Love & Co.,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRegarding the difference in amounts in the invoices for material and labor at the St. Bruno's Mission. We find that on invoice 632 the amount should be $129.31, an error of twenty dollars was made in addition and $129.31 is the correct amount instead of $109.31.\n\nRegarding invoice 835, the amount of $37.50 is correct. The charge for labor should have been shown as $17.00, making the total as submitted correct. This accounts for the error in scoring out amount.\n\nWith reference to invoice 839, this account for fire alarms installed was for four fire gongs, four break glass alarms and test switch installed in metal moulding and conduit connected to the storage batteries of plant. The quotation was given verbally to Father Falher by our workman while he was on the job. The account for this has been O.K.'d by Father Falher.\n\nWe trust you will find these explanations quite clear.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRRM/GM.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Page,\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent:\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of January 28th in connection with the St. Bruno Indian Residential School -- MacKillop Electric Company. We note your different remarks regarding the discrepancies in these accounts. We immediately got in touch with the MacKillop Electric Company, and have had these accounts amended and are returning same herewith.\n\nIn connection with Invoice No. 628, we are enclosing a letter from the MacKillop Electric Company in which they explain this matter. Apparently, there was no specific contract, but was a verbal arrangement between the Rev. Father Falher and the MacKillop Electric Company. No doubt, it was installed in order to cover the necessary inspection for a school of this type in order to give the proper fire alarm to prevent any trouble in any part of the school. We understand the previous arrangement was not according to regulations.\n\nWith reference to Invoice No. 631, this was a clerical error, the correct amount being $129.51. This has been amended, no figures other than the total being changed. On Invoice No. 634, the labor was put in at $17.50 instead of $17.00 and this was also a clerical error. The amount, however, of the bill is $37.50.\n\nWe trust that the above explanation will now put these in order and that they will be passed and a remittance forwarded as soon as convenient.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has been decided to allow the school management a grant of $40 a month towards the salary of this watchman and cheque in payment for the period April 1st to September 30th is being forwarded to the Reverend Principal.\n\nIn future, you should forward, at the end of each quarter, a voucher for this service. It is understood, of course, that you will satisfy yourself that the watchman has been regularly employed and has performed his duties in a satisfactory manner during the quarter for which the voucher is being issued.\n\nFor your guidance in requesting payment for this service in future, I enclose a sample voucher.

Later on when the new school was built at St. Bruno's, a new lighting plant was put in as the other one was old and practically worn out and much too small for the new building. The Reverent Principal now informs me that he has an opportunity of selling this old plant although he has not stated the price obtainable.\n\nI have informed him that I am not in a position to grant this authority, but am submitting the matter to the Department. If it is order for him to sell this old plant, I would ask that his request be granted, as the plant in question is useless there, and will only deteriorate from year to year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nM.

We are communicating with Mr. N. P. L'Heureux, local Indian Agent, requesting full particulars as to the condition of the lighting plant and the amount that would be realized by its sale.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, December 16, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Christianson has forwarded to the Department a letter which he received from the Principal of the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, requesting permission to sell an old lighting plant which he has, surplus to requirements at the school.\n\nIn July, 1931, the Department forwarded a 15 horse power engine, one dynamo and two direct current motors from the Indian Residential School at Duck Lake, Sask., for use at the St. Bruno's School. Please make enquiry and ascertain if this is the equipment the Principal now wishes to dispose of. If not, you should furnish full particulars, stating the nature of the lighting equipment, its condition and the amount the Principal can obtain if it is sold.

He is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the clocks, if in good condition, to certify the account and send same to the Department for payment. The price of these clocks should not exceed that charged for other clocks which have been ordered from you firm by this Department.\n\nFull instructions should be furnished with each clock.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nCanadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., Ltd.,\n266 Sparks St.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 4, 1933.\n\nRight Rev.

Ltd., Ottawa, to supply, from their nearest branch office to Grouard, Alta., four (4) only D-P Watchman's Clocks, each complete with ten stations and one year's supply of record dials. This Company have been requested to forward the clocks, charges prepaid, addressed to you, and to also send to you their account, in triplicate, covering the cost, with receipt attached for the freight charges prepaid. When the clocks have been received, I should be pleased if you would certify the account in the usual manner and forward same to the Department for payment.\n\nI would request that Your Lordship arrange to have the clocks distributed to the residential schools under your auspices, as follows:\n\nSt. Bruno's,\nSt. Bernard's,\nWabasca Lake,\nSturgeon Lake.\n\nIt is hoped that the services of reliable night watchmen have been obtained for each of the above schools. The Department is allowing a grant at the rate of $40 a month towards the salary of each of the night watchmen at these schools, and cheques in payment will be sent at the end of each quarter to the respective principals.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Principal informed that it came from the Pagan School in 1924.\n\n(I) The Engine - Cushman Motor Works, Model 67 No.86, 10 H.P., 600 Revolutions. The valves are pretty well worn out.\n\n(II) Dynamo Generator No.10 - 22-7-61 Type N.C. 27 A. Volta Holland I.S.E., Speed 17000. The Dynamo is from the Canadian General Electric Co.\n\n(III) Motor I, 4 H.P.\n\n(IV) Switch Board\n\n(V) 33 Batteries, almost worn out.\n\nThe Rev. Principal told me he can't get sale for the whole plant but he was offered $50 a piece for the Batteries, and I consider that the whole work needs a general overhauling before anything can be done with it, as the machine is in a poor condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, stating, in detail, the equipment comprised in the old lighting plant on hand at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School. It is noted that this plant was transferred from the Peigan R.C. Residential School to the St. Bruno's School during the year 1924.\n\nRegarding the sale of the batteries, it is considered that it would be advisable to keep the lighting plant intact, unless the Principal is in a position to arrange for the sale of the entire equipment. We are not aware as to what value should be placed on this plant, which you state consists of a 20 H.P. engine, dynamo, 4 H.P. motor, switchboard and batteries. If the Principal is unable to dispose of the entire plant at a fair price, I would request that he arrange to have same stored until the Department is able to make arrangements to have it transferred elsewhere.\n\nIn the event of this plant being sold, the proceeds should be forwarded to the Department for credit of the Receiver-General. However, before completing the sale and delivery of the equipment, you should inform the Department definitely as to the amount that would be received and if you consider same a fair remuneration.\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nA.

A visitor recently advised me that in a building of this size, at least two extinguishers should be placed on each floor. Should you deem it advisable to follow this advice, we shall be glad if you have your more extinguishers sent to us.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nOttawa, May 3, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, regarding the fire extinguishers available for use at St. Bruno's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that at the present time there is only one fire extinguisher located on each floor of the building. It is considered, if these extinguishers are kept in good order, that they should be sufficient for the requirements of the school. Our Appropriation this year has been considerably reduced, and we will have no funds to provide an extra supply of extinguishers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. C.

The house is threatening to collapse and in different places, specially where there are columns, the floor gives in.\n\nI would ask you to send as soon as possible, as the matter is pressing, a building inspector, to report and advise for immediate action.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nMarch 21, 1934.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School.\n\nInstructions are being issued to Inspector Christianson to either visit this school or arrange to have it inspected by a competent person.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

If you find it impossible to go, please let me know if you are aware of any competent person who could visit this school, for a reasonable cost, and report to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM.

It will probably be the last week in April or the first of May before I can arrange to go. There is a good carpenter at High Prairie, Mr. Reykdahl who is on the preferred list, and I shall arrange to have him there at the same time so that we can go over the school thoroughly to see what is actually required, and I shall get him to give me an estimate of the cost of doing the work while I am there. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nJust a few days ago I had a letter from his Lordship stating that he would be in Calgary on the 6th of April, and when I see him I will advise him that I have been instructed to go over the buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDoctor Harold W.

The heating plant, machinery, &c., are all located in the basement of the older part of the building, and the rooms in the basement of the new part are the kitchen, pantry and the girls' and boys' dining rooms. The basement floor is practically at ground level. The foundation under the building is of surface cement. The floor consists of stringers, 12 X 12, placed on the ground, and 2 X 12 floor joists placed on top of the stringers, then a rough floor, paper and edge-grained fir flooring.\n\nOn investigation I found that the floor in the boys' dining room is all rotten; also in the hall next to the dining room and part of the kitchen. The reason for this is that the school is\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nbuilt on ground which slopes towards the lake. Evidently the water has been getting under the foundation and I found that underneath the floor there was nothing but muck. As there was no air passage under the floor, no doubt the ground has been wet there all the year round, which has caused the rotting of the floor. One part of the floor in the dining room, an area of about 6 X 12', had dropped down onto the ground and the joists under the floor in the dining room and part of the kitchen are simply rotten; The wood can be pulled away with your hands, and it would not be long before the whole of the dining room floor would cave in. If this happened it would be disastrous to the rest of the building, as the partitions that are holding the upper floor in place would, of course, gradually sink with the floor, causing destruction to the upper floors and roof.\n\nTo repair this damage, I have the following suggestions to make: That the flooring and joists be taken out of the above-mentioned rooms to be replaced by a layer of gravel and stone, and filled in with cement. The joists should be sunk into the cement and then a wooden floor placed on top of the joists. This would prevent anything of this nature happening again. The present flooring could be used as first flooring as the latter is all rotten, as well as the joists, and we would only have to purchase a new top flooring. The sand, gravel and stone can be procured on the lake shore, which is only a few hundred yards from the school. We can employ Indian labour and teams to haul this to the school. I am attaching hereto a list of the material required. This will have to be purchased in Edmonton and I can arrange for this. The Department will realize that while the work is being proceeded with it might transpire that something else is required which would necessitate the purchasing of additional material. It might be well to put weeping tile drain around the school to keep the water from getting under the remainder of the foundation that is apparently intact.\nIt was very difficult to get at the trouble as the floor is only about 18 inches from the ground, and we had to take up the flooring in several places. I engaged the services of a carpenter from High Prairie, Mr. Reykdal, who had done considerable work for us. I would also recommend that he be engaged to do the work. He does not wish to take out a contract as he does not know exactly what it is going to run up to, so we would pay him the minimum wage for carpenter foremen. All he requires is another carpenter and the rest of the work can all be done by Indians. The wages we should pay the Indians would be $2.50 per day for team, man and wagon, and about $1.50 per day for a single man.\n\nI discussed the matter thoroughly with the Principal, Rev. Father Falher, and he was of the same opinion as I am, that the above method of repairing the school is the only feasible one. However, if our Architect has something better to suggest, we would be pleased to follow any suggestions that would be more suitable than the above-stated plan. The Department will readily understand that we may run into something else when we get the floor out, although I do not think this will happen, as the carpenter got under part of the floor in the girls' dining room which adjoins the boys' dining room.\n\nI am attaching hereto a floor plan of the school which will assist the Department in understanding what I am writing about. It will be necessary for us to rent some jacks to jack up the partitions, as in one or two places I found that they had given away to a small degree. The school owns a cement mixer.\n\nI hope I have made myself quite clear and that the Department will understand that immediate steps should be taken to have this attended to. If the work is carried on as I have suggested, the Agent would have to be\nfurnished with an accountable cheque so as to enable him to pay the workers every Saturday night.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

It is not necessary to place wood joists and wood floor on top of the concrete. The life of a floor laid in this manner is very short. A straight concrete floor with the proper feetings for the partitions would be much more serviceable.\n\nIt is expected that the school will supply some of the labour and in this manner keep the cost within the above mentioned amount. If the services of a foreman are required Mr. Reyhial of High Prairie may be employed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to refer you to my letter No. 405-11A.R.O. of the 7th instant, in connection with the St. Bruno School.

I also note what you have to say about wood joists and floor on top of the concrete. I suggested the straight concrete floor to the school authorities, but the sisters objected strenuously to the concrete and it was so accede to their wishes that I recommended the wooden floor. The delay in answering your letter was caused by the fact that I was away at Saddle Lake Agency and just returned yesterday morning.\n\nI note in the last paragraph of your letter you state that if the services of a foreman are required, Mr. Reykdal of High Prairie may be employed; I take it from this that you question whether or not a foreman is required. In using the word \"foreman\" it was not intended that we were going to employ Mr. Reykdal to stand around and supervise the work. Someone reliable must be in charge, as the whole building could easily be affected when tearing up the flooring, &c., by letting one of the partitions drop, and Mr. Reykdal would be working as well as the others, but would have charge of the men employed.\n\nI am taking steps to have this work gone on with along the line suggested in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nSeptember 7, 1934.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nBishop Guy requests that the following be provided for the ST. BRUNO'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nNew Cow Stable ............ $1,500.00\n\n(see telegram from Bishop Guy, dated September 5, 1934,\non File 131-1-5.)\nThe spring is underground and cannot be seen from the top surface, but evidently is located right along side of the foundation, and naturally the water has to find an outlet. As the school is built on a slope which falls towards the lake it finds its way under the building. In my opinion something should be done to remedy this this fall, and the only way I know of doing it is to put a drain right under the school, as the spring is on the upper side of the slope. If this is not done the whole foundation is going to be affected, and some of the parts have already sagged to such an extent that it is hard to close the doors.\n\nIf authority is given Mr. Reykdal is quite capable of making a satisfactory job of this, as I discussed it with him on my return trip from Fort St. John.\n\nI may say that Dr. McGill was with me at the time I visited the school and he is now familiar with what condition the building is in.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAlberta Inspectorate\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer the Department to my letters of May 7th. and 14th., 405-11A.R.C. in connection with the damage done to the Foundation and floors in the St. Bruno Indian Residential School, in the Lesser Slave agency.\n\nThe Department authorized $500.00 for this work to be carried on, and to hire Mr. Reykdal as working foreman in connection with the work.\n\nThe Department also intimated that a concrete floor would be more suitable and last longer, if a joice and a wooden floor was placed on top of the concrete. I gave this information to the agent and told him to take this up with the principal as I knew the principal was anxious to put a board floor on top of the concrete, and as I have had no reply from them I was of the opinion that the school authorities were satisfied with the instructions of the Department as to the concrete floor.\n\nDuring the time I was away on my holidays a letter came in from the agent stating that the school principal wanted to put the board floor on top of the concrete, also that he wanted to dispense with the services of Mr. Reykdal, as he was getting .65\u00a2 per hour whereas he could hire a competent carpenter for .30\u00a2. I could not comply with this as it was contrary to the wishes of the Department, and the man was not on the approved list. I therefore wired to the agent not to go on with the work any further until the Deputy Minister and I arrived there.\n\nWhile up there with Dr. McGill I looked into the matter and found that the work of putting down the floor in the boys' dining room was not completed, and required either the board floor on top or another layer of concrete, and as only $41.59 was left out of the appropriation of $500.00 I could not authorize the work to be gone on with. The principal evidently is quite determined that he wants a board floor on top of the concrete, Mr. Reykdal advised me that it would take approximately $150.00 to complete the work. If the Department do not feel like putting up any more money I suppose it will be in order to inform the school that they could complete the balance of the work whenever they wish to but that the Department would only be responsible for the balance of the appropriation which is expended.\n\nI realize, however, that putting the board floor on top of the concrete will not be very satisfactory. The money expended to date has been well spent, as it took a lot of gravel and sand to fill up the hole caused by taking out the flooring and parts have been placed on cement foundations etc. to keep the upstairs floor from sagging, but an important point is getting rid of the water from the spring which is under the southeast corner of the building. Putting in the cement floor gets rid of the water from the spring on that side of the building but I understand now that it has worked its way to the other end and in time will ruin the whole foundation of the building.\nSept. 12, 1934\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th ultimo, with reference to the drain under the foundation at the St. Bruno School, I beg to say that the department looks with favour on your recommendation that something be done this fall to remedy the condition.\n\nBefore authorizing the work however I would ask you to give me an approximate estimate of the cost of providing the necessary drain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.H.

I would respectfully ask that this matter be brought to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General as he is familiar with what condition the floor is in. I should then like to be advised as soon as possible as to what steps are to be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, October 12, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your 405-11A. R.C. of the first instant, in connection with the drain under the foundation and also with reference to the flooring of the boys' dining room, at the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the drain under the foundation, you may arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the school of the quantity of three inch piping and the cement required and also for the labour in installing the drain. It is noted you recommend that this drain be put right under the school, to carry off water from a spring under the foundations. Mr. S. J. Reykdahl may be engaged to perform the labour. The total cost for material and labour should be kept within your estimate of $295.00, if possible.\n\nWith reference to the completion of the floor in the boys' dining room, the Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a board floor on top of the cement. It is considered that, if a smooth cement finish was placed over the concrete floor which has been recently put down, this would be satisfactory, and the floor could then be covered with Battleship linoleum. The Department has authorized an expenditure of $500.00 for installing the cement floor - $300.00 of this amount being forwarded to Mr. Agent L'Heureux to pay for labour. This is the full amount that it is possible to provide towards the cost of the flooring; and, if this amount is exceeded in completing the floor, the school authorities will have to be responsible for payment of any expense over that amount. Should you consider it necessary, you may arrange for the purchasing and forwarding of the quantity of linoleum that would be required for this floor - obtaining a good, serviceable grade.\n\nAfter the work in connection with the drain and the flooring is completed, I would request that you forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering all costs. As stated above, $500 is all the Department can provide towards the cost of the cement floor. You should have Mr. Agent L'Heureux forward you time sheets, properly certified, in accounting for the expenditure of the advance of $300, which was sent him - these to be sent to the Department by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

The sum of $500.00 was authorized to repair the floor and before the floor in the dining-room was completed the appropriation was exhausted. The dining-room floor is just rough cement with no finishing top on it. I was authorized to purchase linoleum to cover the floor but there is no use doing this as long as the floor is unfinished as at the present time, and there are no funds available for this work, and the school authorities do not seem to be inclined to do it.\n\nI was just writing the Agent in this connection when I received your letter. The floor that is mentioned in the Agent's letter is what was reported on in my letter above referred to. I now have the following suggestion to make:\n\nMr. Reykdahl has been doing the work for us up in that part of the country as the Department are aware. He is a very good carpenter, but probably lacks experience in handling a matter of this kind. In my opinion the matter of this floor gradually rotting under the building is serious. The drain we put under the floor will probably in time dry up the earth, but this will take some time, and if it is successful it will prevent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nfurther rotting. I think we should have someone with more experience than Mr. Reykdahl to look after the repairing of the floors there, as unless it is attended to properly it will probably ruin the building altogether. As the Department are aware, this was an addition built onto the old school building. I would suggest that the matter be left in abeyance until the frost goes out of the ground next spring, and that Mr. Gardner-Smith be sent up there to look after the repairs. He has had a great deal of experience with the building of our schools and to put the floors of this building into first class shape again so that there is no danger of the foundation caving in will be quite expensive. The only time to do this would be during the summer holidays as the floor would all have to be torn up in the kitchen, hall, &c. Hiring men who are really not competent to do work of this nature is more or less of an experiment, whereas if the work was placed in Mr. E. Gardner-Smith's hands we would be assured of something permanent. I shall be glad to know what the Department think of my suggestion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, February 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 405-11A R.C. of the 15th ultimo, in connection with repairs to the floor under the new wing of the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School and also with reference to proper drainage. It is noted that the sum authorized for the repairs to the floor last summer was used up before the work was completed.\n\nThe Department will give consideration to your suggestion, that Mr. Gardner-Smith be sent up to the school next spring, to look after the work required in placing the floor in good condition and installing proper drainage to prevent the foundation of the building caving in. The cost involved will determine the work that can be carried out, as, owing to the expenditure this year, only a small amount was provided in our Appropriation for the coming year towards repairs at this school.\n\nI would request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Department next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

May 19th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on St. Bruno's Indian School.\n\nSir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions from the Department, I made a trip of inspection to the above school, where I spent two days. All arrangements for my transportation, and for my being met at the station, had been kindly made in advance by Mr. Inspector Christianson. I deemed it advisable to have the man come who did some work on the building last year, and he arrived the next day. This man, Mr. Reykdale, explained what he had done, and his reasons for doing it; and I learned from him all he knew about the situation. The Reverend Principal, Father Fallare, extended every courtesy and assistance.\n\nThe whole trouble is in the newer extension, built about six years ago. On entering its basement an unpleasant odour is very noticeable, coming from trapped water and rotting wood. I made small openings in the basement floor in several places, and with a flash-light I was able to examine the conditions below. I found 7\" of water under part of this floor, and muddy soil under another part. Not wishing to cut the floors more than necessary, I bored 3/4\" holes in other places, and made soundings with an iron rod. The soil conditions vary from several inches of water to only dampness. I was astonished at the extent of the rotting of the wood in so comparatively short a time, which perhaps can be explained by the entire lack of ventilation under the wood floors.\n\nIn an attempt to cope with the water under the floors, Mr. Reykdale had laid a tile drain, carrying it to a ravine about 150' behind the building. The outlet of this drain was not visible, having been carried to a covered place on the side of the ravine. I hired a labourer to dig out the end of the tile drain, and on exposing it, there was not a drop of water being carried. Later I found the other end of the drain at its starting place under the basement, and it was above the present water level, and doing no good.\n\nI was told that last year the floor in the boys' refectory was breaking through from rottenness, and that Mr. Reykdale and helpers had removed the wood floor in this room and had replaced it with a deep concrete sub-floor, with nailing strips bedded in to take a finish lumber floor, but that the appropriation became exhausted, and the rough concrete sub-floor was as far as this work went, and little or no work was done under the rest of this basement, except to lay another little patch of flooring over weak spots which threatened to break through in various places.\nIn examining the conditions under the basement floor I was surprised to observe that instead of concrete being used, the construction is as follows: A laminated sill, about 12\"x 12\" is laid on the ground, and this mud-sill carries 2\"x 12\" joists, over which the shiplap sub-floor and finish fir floor are laid. This mud-sill is generally in contact with the soil, and on this account, and perhaps hastened by lack of ventilation, has become more or less rotten, varying in this respect in different places, and this rotting has spread to the joists and flooring. I enclose a small sample of wood taken from this mud-sill, which is fairly representative of the condition of this important member.\n\nFeeling disinclined to believe that the Department's Architect had specified that the basement floor be laid in this way, I asked if a set of plans were available, and after a little search the blue prints of the addition were given me, which revealed the cause of all the trouble. On Plan #609, Sheet 1, Section at A.A. it shows clearly that the basement floor of the new extension was to consist of 6\" of concrete, instead of which no concrete has been used, and lumber was substituted, as above described. In pointing this out to the Rev. Principal, he said it was the first he knew of this departure from the plans. He said that under the original building a concrete sub-floor was laid, over which was placed fir flooring, and that there has been no trouble of any kind in the basement.\n\nIn addition to the rotting of the basement floors as described, there is still a more serious feature. The interior supporting columns, of which there are eight, go right down to, and are resting on, these rotting mud-sills; and the carrying partitions also depend on the wood below for their support. As these supports disintegrate, the entire structure will be endangered, as you will readily understand. Already there is some settlement, but not very much as yet, but very suggestive of what would eventually develop if allowed to continue.\n\nI was told that in excavating for the extension, some mistake was made, and the excavation was carried down two or three feet too far, and had to be re-filled. As the sub-soil moisture apparently is not very far down, it is possible that water was thus tapped, which may account for the water at present in evidence under this basement. Also, there is no provision for intercepting ground water around the footings by means of tile weeping drains. There are no downspouts from the eavestroughing of the newer building, and these troughs are joined to the troughing of the original building, and I'm sure there must often be overflowing of gutters in the extension.\n\nThe Rev. Principal states that the drains carrying the waste water and sewage from the new addition do not function well, and suggests that they be run separate from the original sewer, and be provided with a separate septic tank and disposal field. Not having had an opportunity of checking the fall of the lines in question I am not prepared to say whether or not this suggested change is necessary.\nThe superstructure of the building seems all in good condition, and I could see no fault with the workmanship. A few doors are sticking, and sagging a little, caused from settlement of the building, but such minor troubles as sticking doors are easily rectified when the cause is removed.\n\nFrom the foregoing descriptions I think you will be able to form a fairly accurate mental picture of the conditions affecting the newer building. Everything seemed all right in the original structure.\n\nTo overcome the troubles I am convinced there is no other way but to remove all the existing flooring in the addition, including the joists and mud-sills. Temporary supports will have to be used to carry the beams above the basement floors, and under the carrying partitions of basement while the changes are being made. Concrete piers will have to be placed to carry the columns, and a footing and dwarf concrete wall to carry the bearing partitions. The water underlying the basement can be drained away by properly laid tile drains, which would not be difficult to do when the floors are out of the way. Then there should be a gravel fill, well tamped, brought up to within 6\" of the finish floor level. The last 6\" should be of good concrete, using an approved concrete hardener for the topping coat. By the means thus briefly outlined the trouble now threatening the building will be overcome, and the structure will then rest on the kind of foundation intended by the Architect.\n\nSubsidiary to the remedial measures suggested, there would be some making good of woodwork on the floor angles; the providing of base throughout the basement; substituting new columns where too much rot has developed; placing two additional downpipes from gutters; placing a tile weeping drain around the footings of west and south walls of new addition to intercept ground water from higher ground behind; possibly some correction of drains as mentioned by the Rev. Principal; the jacking-up of beams and carrying partitions where necessary to restore levels; and minor corrections where found necessary as the work proceeds.\n\nAs to cost, it is difficult to give even an approximate estimate, but I would respectfully suggest that, if possible, the sum of $3000.00 be allocated for this work of restoration, and if it can be completed for less, then the balance could be returned. The Sister Superior thinks that it would best suit the operation of the school if the work could start about July 1st, when the children will be away. If a fair-sized crew were put to work I think it could be completed in one month.\n\nAll the foregoing is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that I have just returned from the Northern part of the Province, and have read Mr. Gardner-Smith's report on the St. Bruno School. I am sure the Department will realize from this the necessity of going on with the work, and I would strongly recommend that the matter be placed in the hands of Mr. Gardner-Smith, as there is no one up in that part of the country who is capable of undertaking this work and seeing that it is done properly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nJune 6, 1955.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill.\n\nRight Reverend Bishop Guy has reported to the Department that the foundations of the St. Bruno Indian Residential School were in such condition that the building was in danger.\n\nMr. E. Gardner Smith was requested to make an inspection of this building, and report. He has made the inspection and has submitted a very detailed report on the existing conditions.\n\nThe whole trouble is in the new extension which was built about six years ago. In erecting this extension the Church authorities substituted wood sills and joists in place of concrete as shown on the plans prepared for the building. These sills being in contact with the soil and through lack of ventilation have become rotten. The rotting has spread to the joists and flooring and a considerable amount of water is lying in the ground under the floor. The most serious feature is the interior supporting columns, of which there are eight, resting on these rotten wood sills, also the carrying partitions. As these sills are disintegrating the entire structure is in danger, and in a very short time the centre of the building will collapse or sag.\n\nThere was also a serious error made when this extension was built when the excavation was carried down two or three feet further than was necessary, and had to be refilled. The foundation is therefore not resting on solid ground. An effort was made last year by the Staff to drain the water from underneath the floor, but the drain was not properly laid and was of no effect.\n\nIt is rather difficult to make an estimate of the cost of repair work of this nature, but it is considered that it should not exceed $5,000.00.\n\nIn a letter received from Mr. Christianson he points out the necessity of immediate action, and recommends that the matter be placed in the hands of Mr. Gardner Smith, as there is no one in that part of\nthe country who is capable of undertaking work of this kind and seeing that it is properly done.\n\nIt will be necessary to remove the entire basement floor of the building, replacing same with concrete on a solid foundation. This is the only way to preserve the building, and I would recommend that Mr. Gardner Smith be authorized to supervise this very important work.\n\nArchitect.\nJune 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department, with reference to the condition of the foundations of the St. Bruno Indian Residential School, near Grouard, Alta.\n\nIt is quite evident that the building is in a very serious condition, and I concur in Mr. Orr's recommendation that the repairs be made immediately, and that Mr. Gardner Smith be employed to supervise the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a memorandum from the Architect of the Department, with reference to the condition of the foundations of the St. Bruno Indian Residential School, near Grouard, Alta.\n\nIt is quite evident that the building is in a very serious condition, and I concur in Mr. Orr's recommendation that the repairs be made immediately, and that Mr. Gardner Smith be employed to supervise the work.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 11, 1935.\n\nMemorandum: The Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to my memorandum of the 6th regarding the repairs required to the addition of the St. Bruno Indian Residential School, at Croward, Alta., I would say that funds for this purpose will be found in the Vote for Indian Education from the unallotted portion.\n\nIn carrying out the repairs a considerable amount of labour will be required, and it would facilitate the work if you could advise me as to whom Mr. Gardner Smith could consult regarding the employment of the necessary labour.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nSubsequent to my visit at your office Saturday last, I take the liberty of suggesting that amount required for repairs at St Bruno School be included in Supplementary Estimates if not too late for same and if too late, taken from sources different from amounts voted in favor of schools under my jurisdiction. I am positive, the Department in its foresight, takes care of emergency cases such as the one I refer to and I hope that you will act accordingly.\n\nYou are aware of my financial difficulties due largely to the fact that we borrowed money at intervals for the construction, upkeep and repairs of buildings in connection with Indian educational and hospitalization work. For the last few years specially the Department has not been over prodigal in its grants in my district. Of course I except this year when you have given consideration to my requests, a fact for which I have already expressed my gratefulness. I would certainly feel sad if this year's generous treatment were allayed by a reduction along the lines that you mentioned in our last interview.\n\nI leave the matter to your kind and generous consideration and wish to thank you in anticipation.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nJune 18th, 1938.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nI am in receipt of Your Lordship's letter of June 11th, with reference to the expenditure for repairs at the St. Bruno school.\n\nI feel inclined to reproach myself as I fear that I may have unintentionally given you a gloomy prognosis regarding the expenditures at this point. I may assure Your Lordship that it is our intention to charge this item to our up population for unforeseen expenditure. However, the sum may run into a considerable figure and the up population referred to may not be sufficient to take care of the whole amount. In the meantime the items for other schools in your diocese will stand and I sincerely hope that it will not be necessary to reduce them for the purpose of meeting the unforeseen expenditure at St. Bruno school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nJune 21, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nI beg to refer to my memorandum of the 11th instant, addressed to the Honourable the Superintendent General, with further reference to the repairs required to the St. Bruno Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would appear that owing to the serious condition of this building that the repairs should be undertaken as soon as possible.\n\nI would ask you, therefore, to kindly furnish me with the information requested in my memorandum of the above date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 27, 1935.\n\nDR.

J. Reykdal, of High Prairie, as to the labour required.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nJuly 3, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to advise that the Department has decided to proceed at the earliest possible date with the repairs required to the foundation of the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School, in accordance with the report and recommendations made by Mr. Gardner Smith.\n\nYou may therefore arrange immediately with Mr. Smith to have this work done under his supervision. In the employment of labour required to carry out the work he should consult with Mr. S.J. Maydial of High Prairie, and all materials, of course, should be purchased from firms on your approved list.\n\nThe work is to be carried out entirely by day labour and vouchers submitted in the usual way for the materials purchased. Mr. Smith will keep proper time sheets for the labour employed, and an accountable cheque for the payment of the labour will be sent to you on application.\n\nMr. Smith should be instructed to keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

The floods took a heavy toll of lives, destroyed farms, railroads, highways, bridges, and settlements. Highway transportation was completely disrupted, and settlers were forced to flee from flood encroaching.\n\nIn (1) a flooded street of Peace River with sandbags from a point stage angles hoping to save their fish. (2) is the scene as sandbag depot failed to hold rising flood waters and rafts and boats were used to salvage property from marooned homes in Peace River. In (3) the floodwaters of Lesser Slave Lake are sweeping over the traffic bridge with automobiles using the bridge as a raft. In (4) shows a section crew of the N.A.R. clearing driftwood from the main line tracks near the town of Widewater. The men are clearing driftwood that has been swept over the tracks. In (5) an aeroplane is making its first flight over Main St., Slave Lake town. A floating community in Slave Lake town is shown in (6). While (7) graphically illustrates how Lesser Slave Lake is creeping in, ready to spread havoc through the countryside submerging long stretches of railway. The parallel lines seen are vegetation growing along the submerged right-of-way.

The Rockcliffe project is a part of the air station.\n\nVirtual termination of the strike was announced as the men were loaded on a truck and brought to Ottawa, five miles from the camp.\n\nThe men will probably be sent now. J. S. Duthie, spokesman for the group, said as they left the camp:\n\nIn Ottawa the men unloaded from the truck under the watchful eye of a single R.C.M.P. officer and one armed man, and disappeared quietly.\n\nThe Rockcliffe strike started Monday morning when 125 of the 508 men registered at the camp went on a mass meeting and presented demands of $1 per day wages, changes in the hospital staff, and other matters.\n\nMontrealer Leads Canucks at Bisley\n\nScores 31 Out of 35 in Kinnaird; Trails Old Country Shots\n\nBUSLEY CAMP, England, July 9.\u2014Lieut.

Several swollen rivers had poured their flood waters into this lake, and its only outlet became choked with debris and silt, and the level of the lake is not yet falling appreciably. After considerable prospecting I located a small bed of gravel just above the water level of the lake, but distant nearly 3 miles, and over a bush trail which we first had to occupy two places before loads could be hauled over the sod places. Just as the hauling of the gravel was well started it was stopped by a half-breed named Cunningham who claimed the gravel was on his land. I took the half-breed in Cree for half an hour, and after he had talked to the half-breed in Cree for half an hour, it was agreed that the hauling could continue on the condition that we employ the owner's two sons and two teams for the hauling. Not being able to find any other gravel I had to accept the ultimatum, or see our job tied up. Sufficient gravel is now on the job.\n\nOur car of cement came through in the interval between wash-outs on the line. The mud-sills, joists and flooring in the basement have all been removed, and some of this lumber was so rotten that it fell to pieces in the handling. The water underlying the basement is now drained away, and I do not anticipate any more trouble in this regard. To-day we should finish the footings under the carrying partitions, and the dwarf concrete wall; also the reinforced footings under two columns. These will have to remain for perhaps a week before we can safely take down the temporary supports now sustaining the weight of the superstructure. In the meantime we have a deep fill to make, after which we can start on the concrete floors.\n\nMy little crew consists of three white men\u2014Scott, Rykedale, and the latter's son, and about eight local Indians.\n\nThe school Sisters have had a temporary summer-kitchen built for them at the rear of the school, into which essential articles were moved, for during our work everything had to be moved out of the basement of the affected building, including the range, sink, etc.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEncl.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nJoussard, Alta., Aug. 21, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Repairs to St. Bruno Indian School.\n\nSir:\n\nThe work of restoring the affected part of the above school is now well advanced, and should be entirely completed by the first week in September.\n\nAll the floors in the affected basement have been removed, including the joists and mud-sills. These joists consisted of 2\"x 10\", spaced at 24\" centres, without bridging. A few 2\"x 12\" were mixed with the others, but had been notched down to the same level, which, of course, weakened them accordingly. Most of the joists had become rotten, also the mud-sills in most places, while other parts were still sound.\n\nWith the floors out of the way we were able to deal with the stagnant water underlying this basement, and with less trouble than I expected, we were successful in draining away all this foul-smelling water.\n\nFour lines of studding were necessary to hold up the superstructure during the repair work, also posts to carry the beams. The bottoms of the carrying partitions were generally so rotten that we had to cut off the lower 3 feet, putting in fresh plates and new studs, and new joint. Beneath the carrying partitions we put concrete footings 2\"x 10\", and on these footings we ran dwarf concrete walls 7\" thick, to meet the under plates of these partitions. We also jacked up these partitions where necessary to restore levels, about 2\u00bd\" being the maximum settlement to correct.\n\nUnder the supporting columns we placed concrete piers, 36\"x 36\"x 18\", each reinforced with 10 steel bars.\n\nNext came the filling of the space previously occupied by the joists and sills. This took 100 loads of coarse heavy sand, and I kept three Indians busy with tampers while this material was being spread. It will make excellent insulation between the damp undersoil and the concrete floor.\n\nWe are now laying the concrete floors 6\" deep, including 1\u00bd\" topping coat treated with Master Mix Concrete Hardener, which will not only give a dust-proof surface, but is a waterproofing as well. These floors should be finished in two more days. The school staff have a strange antipathy to concrete floors, and wanted me to lay nailing strips in the concrete, with wood floors. I refused to consider this, and told them I thought they should have had lesson enough already with wood floors in a basement! The Sister Superior pointed out that in the kitchen especially the hard concrete would be very trying on the feet of those working there, and asked if they might have lino on this floor, and a narrow strip of lino along the adjoining corridor. I replied that I thought I might anticipate the Department's consent to this request provided...\nit would not run us over the original estimate for the entire work of restoration. As it now seems certain that we shall not exceed the estimate, I have ordered AA battleship for the kitchen floor and 3\" strip for the basement corridor. This material will be laid on a carpet-felt base, and both materials will be cemented down. The school people are cooperating in every possible way, and are lending us their concrete mixer, supplying oil, gas, etc., so perhaps the providing them with the lino is a sort of quid pro quo in return for what they are doing.\n\nWe have yet to dig a trench around two sides of the newer building, and to lay a tile weeping drain along the corresponding footings to intercept ground water from the higher ground behind. While the concrete wall is exposed we shall give it a heavy coating of hot asphalt pitch, and shall use gravel for back-filling this trench to within a foot or two of grade. This should insure against any further encroachment of ground water into this basement. The soil here generally inclines to dampness, and water lies but a short distance from the surface.\n\nWe have also to place another downpipe from the eavestrough of the newer building, which we shall connect with the tile weeping drain.\n\nInside the building we are installing new base, as most of the old base was too rotten to use again. Then there will be a few days' painting and varnishing, and the restoring of the kitchen and pantry fixtures which we had to cut off and move out of our way.\n\nAs already stated, the work should be entirely finished by the first week in September, and the building will then be in excellent condition in every way.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nJOUSSARD, ALTA., AUG 26 27 1935\n\nR.

H. Vaughan\nper N. L.\nAccounting Department.\n\nIHV-L.\nMr. R. Guerney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYou will have received my night letter sent yesterday calling attention to the inadequacy of the kitchen flue in the new building. I am told that trouble has been experienced with this chimney because of insufficient draft, and as a larger new three-oven range is about to be installed, with a 9\" pipe, I feel sure that the existing 6\" x 8\" flue will prove insufficient. I hesitated before sending you the message, but realizing that I was sent here to rectify the defective features of the newer building, I deemed it incumbent on me to inform you regarding this chimney, especially as it appears to me none too safe from a fire hazard viewpoint, and then to be guided by your instructions.\n\nAs mentioned in my telegram, the walls of the chimney are of single brick, and as it passes through woodwork, it is contrary to safe practice. Also, it is another instance of the disregard of the construction clearly shown on the blueprint, where the flue scales 12\"x 12\", with an 8\" wall. On hearing from you, we shall either leave the chimney alone and hope for the best, or take it down and rebuild it according to the blue print, just as you instruct.\n\nPerhaps I should also mention in this connection that both the bakery and laundry chimneys are of similar construction to that of the kitchen, although again the blue print called for 12\"x 12\" flues and an 8\" walls. However, as I have heard no complaint regarding the draft of these chimneys I am not proposing to take them down, but thought of removing sufficient of the enclosing J-joint so I can inspect them for safety, and if they appear to need it, they could be cement-plastered over the brickwork as an extra precaution against fire eating through the single joints of their 4\" walls. The main heating chimney appears to have been properly constructed, and of ample dimensions.\n\nOn the plan of the new addition it is written that the footings of the extension were to be carried down to the same level as those of the existing building. This requirement was disregarded, and the footings were stepped up 18\", and are poor footings at that, consisting largely of cobbles stones, with a minimum of cement mixed with them. I believe it is largely if not entirely from this departure from the plans which allowed ground water to pass under the floors of the addition.\n\nIn digging the trench around the outside walls of the new addition we encountered considerable water seeping out of the ground, which is now being drained away by our newly placed weeping drain, over which we have put a heavy covering of gravel, so I feel sure the basement will remain dry in the future.\n\nThe main departure from the plans was in the substituting of wood instead of concrete for the basement floors. I could mention other minor faults in construction, but they are relatively unimportant. The conclusion, however, is inescapable...\nthat had the contractor carried out the construction in accordance with the plans supplied by the Architect, the $3000.00 expenditure now being undertaken would have been entirely avoided, and there would not be the present fire hazard from faulty chimneys. I feel it my duty to bring these matters sharply to your attention so that in the future you may take whatever steps you deem necessary to insure that important constructional requirements will not be disregarded.\n\nBefore receiving this letter Bishop Guy will have called on you, and will have mentioned the proposal to extend the kitchen 20' longer. I supplied him with rough sketches of the proposed extension, and an estimate of its cost.\n\nThe work in hand should be completed by the end of the first week in September, and unless detained for the rebuilding of the kitchen chimney, or the extending of the kitchen, or both, I expect to return to Calgary at the time mentioned.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.Gardner-Smith,\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos.

Gardner Smith  \nAgent  \nInspector of Construction\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nSt. Bruno Indian School,\nJoussard, Alta. Sep't 30, 1935\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nAs previously advised, the work of restoration of the defective basement of the above school was completed during the first week in Sep't.\n\nActing on the Department's instructions, we took down the kitchen chimney and rebuilt it with the 12\"x 12\" flue called for in the drawings in place of the 8\"x 8\" that had been built. I'm quite certain that had we not done this there would have been insufficient draft for the larger new range recently procured, with its 12\" smoke outlet, especially as trouble in this respect had already been experienced with the smaller range with a 7\" outlet. Now the new chimney affords excellent draft, and the kitchen Sister is very happy over the change. No local bricklayer being procurable, I had to bring one from Edmonton, and pay his travelling expenses, but he gave excellent service. In order to avoid making the chimney excessively bulky passing through the rooms above, we constructed it in single brick, lined with 12\" x 12\" vitrified flue lining, which as you know, meets the requirements of safe construction. We used cement mortar tempered with about 10% lime.\n\nRegarding the bakery chimney, as the part above the roof was disintegrating badly from the action of the weather on the lime mortar, we took it down to the level of the roof, and rebuilt it in cement mortar. While we had it down we were able to view the inside of the flue, by the aid of a flash-light and mirror, and, apart from being smaller than called for, and of single brick construction, there seemed no visible fire hazard. I also examined the brickwork of this chimney at a lower level, and decided against taking the whole chimney down, as the joints seemed all well filled and reasonably safe. The School Superior states that this chimney too gives insufficient draft, and smokes badly when the bake-oven is first lighted. I noticed,\nthat the bake-oven is situated some distance, with a long run of horizontal piping, and I suggested that they move the oven close to the chimney for better draft, which they are going to do.\n\nWith reference to the cost of the restoration work, I stated in my Report of May 19th that it might run to $3000.00, but that if it could be done for less, then the balance could be returned. Including the chimney costs, and the providing of lino for the kitchen and corridor, neither of which were allowed for in the estimate, the total cost will be several hundred dollars under the $3000.00. One delayed invoice is still to be received, which I expect to receive tomorrow, and then the account can be completed, and the returns sent to the Department. The cooperation of the school people, and the free use of their facilities, helped to keep the cost down.\n\nDuring the past three weeks my small crew and myself have been engaged in building the 20' extension to the school kitchen, as arranged between Bishop Guy and the Department. This work will be completed in another week, after which I will send a brief report on this latter work, and a photo of the annex to the larger building. This work, too, promises to come well within the estimate of $1500.00. I expect to leave for Calgary on Oct. 9th.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Guerney Orr Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: St. Bruno School Repairs.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a segregation of costs of the restoration work at the above school, in labour and materials.\n\nA few tools, and 2 pairs of rubber boots, which were necessary for the use of Indian labourers, I have left at the Indian Office, Driftfield. The value of these articles is about $20.00, but I did not think it worth while to credit it to our job.\n\nThe work has come well within the estimate I gave last May of a possible $3000.00, as we did not run into any unforeseen difficulties, nor did we have to alter the sewage disposal from the newer building, which the Rev. Principal had thought necessary last May. Including the rebuilding and enlarging of the kitchen chimney, and the providing of lino for the kitchen and Corridor, the total cost of labour and materials is $2995.62 at this date, exclusive of my own expense a/c which is paid direct by the Department. The work is now completed, and the school Staff are very pleased and gratified with the result.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Gardiner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nMontreal, Que.,\nAugust 31st, 1935.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D., M.C., V.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to my interview of the 28th instant in connection with a small addition to the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School in order to enlarge the kitchen, I wish to make a formal application for the above purpose.\n\nThis addition will be 20' x 20' and the cost is estimated at $1,500 by Mr. Gardner Smith, who would take charge of the work and bring it to completion. I enclose plans and estimate of the work made up by this gentleman and would request your approval for this expenditure.\n\nI would suggest that I borrow the above amount, have the work done and submit all expenditures to the Department and would be willing to wait for reimbursement until next year's estimates are voted. This, of course, would enable you to include said amount in the estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nST.

The canopy is vented with a 16\" pipe through the ceiling and roof, and will relieve the kitchen of much excess heat, and odours of cooking.\n\nOne or two small bills had not been received when I made up the Statement of Cost, but with these added, the total cost will be approximately $1400.00.\n\nThe main saving in construction costs was in the concrete cutting, for which I had allowed $198.00 in the Estimate. This wall is splayed, running from 9\" on top where it meets the framing, to about 24\" on the bottom. I rounded up all the drills on the place, got them sharpened and tempered, and was all set for a tough cutting job, but found the wall to be so full of large round stones with just enough cement to hold them together, that scarcely any actual cutting was necessary. We were able to knock the wall to pieces with sledges, and as the big stones came rolling out most of the concrete came away at the same time. Though not the kind of concrete work that I am accustomed to, yet because of its wide base it is quite equal to carrying the frame superstructure.\n\nWith the completion of the kitchen enlargement my duties at St. Bruno School were finished, and I have returned to Calgary. I much appreciate the employment that I have had, and trust it may be my privilege to serve the Department.\nfurther whenever and wherever my services can be utilized.\n\nThe Time-Sheets and Invoices have been left with Bishop Guy's Secretary, Rev. A. Charest, and will eventually be forwarded to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner-Smith\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Gardner-Smith was sent from here early in the summer to repair this, and the work has been carried out in a very efficient manner, and I hope we will have no further trouble in this regard.\n\nEverything about the institution, inside and out, was in very good condition. I went over the laundry machinery, boilers, engines, &c., and everything seemed to be in order. The school maintains the services of a lay-brother and an engineer, both of whom are competent in this line of work, and they keep the machinery in a good state of repair.\n\nAs you know, the out-buildings at this institution were poor and in a dilapidated condition. I found that a new barn, 50' x 36', was under erection and just nearing completion. This is to be up-to-date in every way, with hay loft, extensions, cement floor, &c. I do not know.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\nknow whether the Department are paying for this barn, but at any rate it is being erected. No doubt in due course the other out-buildings will all be replaced as well.\n\nThe amount of land being cultivated by this institution is 50 acres, and 10 acres of new land has been brushed. The potato crop was not as good as last year on account of the wet weather, and I found this to be the case all over the Peace River country: There was so much rain during the summer that the potatoes rotted in the ground. They had an abundance of other garden truck, however.\n\nI visited the class-rooms and spent some little time with the children, and everything seemed to be going along very well.\n\nThe girls receive an exceptionally good training in household science, but here, as in the other two schools in that Agency, the boys receive very little outside training with the exception of doing a few chores, attending to the gardens, milking cows, &c. Some years ago the Department issued instructions to the schools that the girls were to be taught how to milk cows. I find this is being absolutely neglected in most cases, and I believe the time has come when we should check up on this a little more closely. I am doing this at every institution I inspect, and most of them have promised to see that the girls do the milking during the summer, but it might be well for the Department to again write to the schools.\n\nThe children all looked healthy and well-dressed.\ndressed and seemed to be getting sufficient food. The School have 46 head of cattle, of which 25 are cows, and 10 were being milked at the time of my inspection and the milk is all given to the children in one form or another. They also have some pigs and chickens.\n\nThe Staff at this institution consists of the Rev. Father Paul Serrand, as Principal; 15 Sisters of Charity; 1 nightwatchman, 2 lay brothers and 2 hired men. I might bring to the attention of the Department that one of the Sisters is a Graduate Nurse.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, ALTA., November 13th, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of St. Bruno's Indian Residential School at Joussard, in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency:\n\nThis is a very fine institution! You will recall when you were there they were having difficulty with the floors giving way. Mr. Gardner-Smith was sent from here early in the summer to repair this, and the work has been carried out in a very efficient manner, and I hope we will have no further trouble in this regard.\n\nEverything about the institution, inside and out, was in very good condition. I went over the laundry machinery, boilers, engines, &c., and everything seemed to be in order. The school maintains the services of a lay-brother and an engineer, both of whom are competent in this line of work, and they keep the machinery in a good state of repair.\n\nAs you know, the out-buildings at this institution were poor and in a dilapidated condition. I found that a new barn, 60' X 36', was under erection and just nearing completion. This is to be up-to-date in every way, with hay loft, extensions, cement floor, &c. I do not know.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 3))\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nknow whether the Department are paying for this barn, but at any rate it is being erected. No doubt in due course the other out-buildings will all be replaced as well.\n\nThe amount of land being cultivated by this institution is 50 acres, and 10 acres of new land has been brushed. The potato crop was not as good as last year on account of the wet weather, and I found this to be the case all over the Peace River country: There was so much rain during the summer that the potatoes rotted in the ground. They had an abundance of other garden truck, however.\n\nI visited the class-rooms and spent some little time with the children, and everything seemed to be going along very well.\n\nThe girls receive an exceptionally good training in household science, but here, as in the other two schools in that Agency, the boys receive very little outside training with the exception of doing a few chores, attending to the gardens, milking cows, &c. Some years ago the Department issued instructions to the schools that the girls were to be taught how to milk cows. I find this is being absolutely neglected in most cases, and I believe the time has come when we should check up on this a little more closely. I am doing this at every institution I inspect, and most of them have promised to see that the girls do the milking during the summer, but it might be well for the Department to again write to the schools.\n\nThe children all looked healthy and well-dressed.\ndressed and seemed to be getting sufficient food. The School have 46 head of cattle, of which 25 are cows, and 10 were being milked at the time of my inspection and the milk is all given to the children in one form or another. They also have some pigs and chickens.\n\nThe Staff at this institution consists of the Rev. Father Paul Serrand, as Principal; 15 Sisters of Charity; 1 nightwatchman, 2 lay brothers and 2 hired men. I might bring to the attention of the Department that one of the Sisters is a Graduate Nurse. Father Serrand, the Principal, is a new man there! Some years ago he was Assistant Principal at Sturgeon Lake, St. Bruno's and St. Bernard's, and since then he has been stationed in White parishes, his last one being at Dawson Creek. I was very favourably impressed with the new Principal, and I consider that men of his type are a real asset in the work we are endeavouring to carry out.\n\nThere is also a new Sister Superior: Rev. Sister Peter of Rome was promoted to Mother Provincial, and Sister Agnes, one of the teachers there \u2014 an Irish sister \u2014 was promoted to Sister Superior, and I am quite sure she will render good service as such. The Principal and the Sister Superior made a few requests which I am forwarding to the Department in a separate letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

No payment was received either covering his Voucher No. 453.\n\nI have also received a similar letter from the T.

L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 26, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your #1060 of the 19th instant, Voucher 375, for $181.27, was returned to you for signature under cover of official letter of October 10th, last. The Department has no record of this voucher having been sent back to this office.\n\nVoucher 453 was paid by cheque #25384. This cheque was mailed on the 8th instant.\n\nVoucher 356 was misplaced on our files and, consequently, payment has not yet been made.

Parker,\nBooth Bldg., Ottawa.\n\nGentlemen:-\n\nIn connection with your order No. 2005, covering one box of Time Clock Dials, we wish to advise that we shipped these dials to Rev. P. Serrand, Joussard, Alta., and forwarded invoices in quadruplicate addressed to his attention.\n\nWe have today received a letter from Rev. P. Serrand, advising that the goods have been received in good order, but understands that such goods are supplied to the Indian Mission free of charge, and has returned our invoices.\n\nWe are herewith enclosing the invoices which were returned to us, as you will, no doubt, wish to handle this matter through your Department.\n\nTrusting this is in order, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Canadian FAIRBANKS-MORSE Company Ltd.,\n\nCecil W. Coughlin.\n\nMONTREAL, QUEBEC, SAINT JOHN, HALIFAX, OTTAWA, TORONTO, HAMILTON, WINDSOR, WINNIPEG, REGINA, SASKATOON, EDMONTON, CALGARY, VANCOUVER, VICTORIA.\nMr Harold W.

McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI take the liberty of calling your attention on the fact that the batteries at Joussard Residential School are out of commission or will be in the very near future. We are getting very poor light and soon will have none. Said batteries have been well looked after and have been used quite a long time over the regular one they are guaranteed for.\n\nI would therefore ask for a new set of batteries of 56 or rather as was the case in Croward and for the same reason two sets of 56 making a total of 112. I suggest Ironclad Batteries and I am sure I am meeting with the approval of the Department Architect.\n\nPlease give that matter your kind and effective attention and oblige.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBishop of Croward.\nAugust 11th, 1926.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of July 17th and as an explanation of the delay in replying I would say that I have just returned from making official visits to agencies in Manitoba and Western Ontario.\n\nYour letter was marked 'Personal', otherwise it would have been brought to the attention of the Schools Branch, which I am now having done.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06",
