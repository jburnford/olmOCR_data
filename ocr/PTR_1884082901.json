The granting of so many permits seems to have pleased friends, and the others grumble at having so restricted a permit both in quantity and time, and assure their neighbors more generously dealt with. But there is no doubt that the liquor is legally and illegally brought into the country, the time has no doubt arrived when liquor should be allowed to be sold. The poisonous substances sold at present are far more dangerous than the liquor illegally purchased, and whiskey is most pernicious to great numbers of draughty consumers.\n\nThe Calgary Herald in an article on this topic, condemns the system of granting permits for so short a period of time, and asserts that the Council had pondered too much to the wants of the temperance in communities. Mr. Turner adds that the Council is to blame for the sentiments of the temperance people and is alarmed at the proposal to close breweries; illicit distilling, being in the writers opinion better than legalized distilling. We hold that no man who wishes for a permit for the purpose to which it is to be used, but the medicinal permit nine cases out ten, is a falsification. We cannot understand how the temperance people have got so misled, indeed they seem to have got their desires all along, but the sentiment of illicit distillation being better than legalized breweries, we consider an examination of the temperance advocate of the old school lets off. The drunkenness in this country is not caused by the liquor procured by permits, but is the effect of the strict law forcing the poor to drink poisonous gin, lemon and last, but least chloroform. Who that has resided in these Territories some time and travelled in them, has not met the drunks, old and young, drunk, loud or silent, of no value whatever, and found them using drugs when very poisonous whiskey is not procurable? In this country to be made an asylum for inebriates, and the consumption of other industrial killers of the soul to be forbidden for ever with prohibition laws, and begrudged their glass of beer, through the croakings of Mr. Drink water, and a few bacchanalian shouts in the air, is absurd beyond belief. We visited some years ago the city of Gothenburg in Sweden, to inquire into the working of the total prohibition liquor law which had been in force there for some time, and found that the system had made matters worse, through the introduction of poisonous intoxicants and drugs, the latter being used to a fearful extent, particularly chloral. Visit France, where on a Sunday all can have their coffee pure and straight, and find in Bible loving Scotland in any of the crowded cities on a Sunday, where saloons are closed and whiskey unprocurable, and witness the lapsed masses having a good time, the thieves going about their work, and the police cells filled to overflowing at night. Better a thousand times to have the licensed houses opened, than have the people drugged and maimed. That the consumption of beverages would be illicit distilling and drunkenness, to a great extent cannot be doubted, for many who drank only beer before coming to this country, now drink whiskey and could hardly prefer it to cement. No temperance liquor law will ever stop drinking, a higher principle must guide a people. \"Righteousness exalteth a nation,\" education exalteth a nation, and these great factors must be looked to in diminishing intemperance in any Kingdom in the world.\n\nSCHOOL DISCIPLINE.\n\nThere can be but few, and those chiefly miserable bachelors, who will not be able to stand the strain of discipline given by a well known English judge, to the effect that in the eyes of the law, the detention of a pupil after school hours as punishment for failure in his lessons ordered to be studied at home, amounts to an assault on the part of the teacher. We believe that although painful it may be to school teachers, will be approved without qualification by child- ren, parents, and masters, whilst the legal magistrates will thank us by calling their attention to it, by improving their acquaintance with their legal duties, which they have been too apted to so cheerfully undertake, how- ever disagreeable they may be. We have no doubt, however, that the law will delegate authority to the teacher, even to the length of making children prepare for examinations, and send the child who objected to it to a parent, so that we allow the youngsters to ascertain the value of their studies before planning to crow. Of course it is impossible to lay down the exact limit of time during which a child may be sent to study profitably and safely, when so much depends upon the capacity of the child, the subject of study, the illustration during lesson and study, and the nature of the subjects studied. About one thing however there can exist no difference whatever, that is, the absolute necessity of discipline. The habit, generally the result of thoughtless speaking in put (or very mildly) a discharging bomb thrown upon people in the shape of children, is as injurious in its effects as its victims, and we have known instances of people so utterly lost to all sense of right and wrong as to send messages to teachers through their own children. To return to the matter of discipline, it must be remembered on the face of it nothing to those who know anything of the exhausting nature of brain work to suppose that ill properly attended to, the brain will not in a few years will receive more harm than good from having to apply themselves for more than a few minutes at a time. Likewise, of course as the brain gets older and stronger from use, the hours of study must be increased, and probably some home preparation of tasks fairly expected, but even then the influence of the young mind by the more advanced ability is prevented, must be carefully considered in connec- tion with the study of languages and composition. Each subject, each science and the practical teaching of each branch of knowledge, science may safely be added to the book work. The whole subject is so difficult to reduce to rules that it must be left entirely to the discretion of teachers, and we may feel very thankful that Prince Albert already possesses educational advantages, and that there is a vast prospect of the already existing facilities being in\n\nDr. A.

McGUIRE, General Traffic Manager.\n\nW. W. TEAGARDEN, General Agent.\n\nSt. Paul, Minn.\nTHE ENGLISH CHURCH.\n\nMany think in Britain the purchase of church livings, as it is called out there, should be abolished; at least it is opposed to the sale of the cure of souls. Non-conformists may look upon it in the same light, but it is not so in the Church of England. The subject has again been before the British Parliament, and two bills regulating the sale of church livings have been introduced, and both have been referred to the same committee. Singularly enough, no proposition is made to put an end to the sale of church livings by agreement. The feeling appears to be general that the heirs of the person who built the church or endowed it have the right to nominate to the Bishop the vicar or curate. No one is eligible to the post unless he is a member of the Established Church, which doctrine and ordinance are not approved by the officials of the Church. The equity and propriety of dispensing with the sale of livings to a vacant ecclesiastical benefice, apart from the estate of the original patron, is almost universally admitted. There are many reasons why church livings are sold. The estate may belong to minor heiresses, who would prefer to use the income to pay off debts, and there is no one of the requisite age and judgment to make the expenditure and present the claims. The proprietors of the land itself in debt, unwilling to part with his hereditary fall or ancient estate, he may take an interest in obtaining money for the support of the poor or freethinker; he may think the selection of the parish priest would be a better safeguard than the patron. There are also many reasons for the purchase of advowsons. Many persons of means desire to secure a living in an established church and the young men who are preparing to enter on that life are willing to pay handsomely for the privilege of nominating candidates. Wealthy relatives often desire to give a position of their own choosing, a short time in perpetuity. The choice ought to be handy for the youngest son of the spouse who has a large family.\n\nThere are also many beneficiaries in the Church of England, viz., belonging to the Crown, 1,144; to the bishops, 2,234; to deaneries, chapels, &c., 931; to the corporations, 750; to private persons, 7,000. There is a fund known as \"Queen Anne's Bounty,\" set aside for the purchase of advowsons and turning them over to the crown. Normally the Queen does not interfere in the matter, but names the candidates to the livings that are purchased by the trustees of this fund. The Church of England, Catholic or Protestant, is still officially united with the State. His bishops sit as members of parliament, and the State has a hand in the appointment of bishops. Having few external features, the English bishops have not claimed the right to select their own ministers. Notwithstanding the great importance of political and religious matters, there has been little change in the opinions of clergymen in regard to the question of buying and selling livings. The mechanics, farmers, and small traders are thought to be not competent to perform the duties of religious teachers. These are obliged to submit to the appointing power to the crown, and the pulpit might be filled by persons who are not fitted for the office. The bishop again, if he had all the appointments, might desire men who would be acceptable to the State and the crown, and he would likely practice nepotism. The patron of the church, who resides in the town, has the right to make efficient choice and to make a wise selection.\n\nThe abolition of the bills before Parliament proposes to abolish the right of the patron of a church to make presentations to the bishop in case of a vacancy, or even to purchase the sale of advowsons. The objections are directed to the present method of appointing ministers to take charge of parishes, and the patron's right to choose members of the Established Church, certain not from communions to good standing. The latter are said to be unable to present such things, and using them as a shield it seems easy for others to complain.\n\nThe Catholics and the Dissenters are interested in relation to their choice of a pastor. The bishop appoints whom he pleases, and there is scarcely any question regarding the matter of pastors. But in churches where the democratic principle prevails in regard to the selection of pastors, there is no end to dissensions and quarrels. The practice has been for a dozen or so of ministers to preach trial sermons, and then the congregations of these churches as opportunity to select a minister. When the day for election arrives, there is a meeting of the \"Cure\" and the elector is elected. Election is rejected to, as it is in a house meeting. Our party wins, and our losses do not affect the elector, because he is a Christian. They often secure and form a new church or unite with the rival one, and thus the division continues in order to cause trouble. Possibly churches are better satisfied with their pastors when they elect them by popular vote, than when they select them by popular vote. The sale of church livings does not appear to be as bad as it is supposed, as it is not always made by some one who does not understand its workings.\n\nThe Heirship.\n\nA special appeal for American donations will be sent for one year free to every body who will send us the names and addresses of 10 married ladies and 50 cents (two shillings) taken.
