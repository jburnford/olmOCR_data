BOHN, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN.\n\nMDCCCL.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe following papers, with two exceptions, were written in England, and formed but part of an intended series for which I had made notes and memorandums. Before I could mature a plan, however, circumstances compelled me to send them piecemeal to the United States, where they were published from time to time in portions or numbers. It was not my intention to publish them in England, being conscious that much of their contents could be interesting only to American readers, and, in truth, being deterred by the severity with which American productions had been treated by the British press.\n\nBy the time the contents of the first volume had appeared in this occasional manner, they began to find their way across the Atlantic, and to be inserted, with many kind encomiums, in the London Literary Gazette. It was said, also, that a London bookseller intended to publish them in a collective form. I determined, therefore, to bring them forward myself, that they might at least have the benefit of my superintendence and revision. I accordingly took the printed numbers which I had received from the United States to Mr. John Murray, the eminent publisher, from whom I had already received friendly attentions, and left them with him for examination, informing him that should he be inclined to bring them before the public, I had materials enough on hand for a second volume. Several days having elapsed without any communication from Mr. Murray, I addressed a note to him, in which I construed his silence into a tacit rejection of my work, and begged that the numbers I had left with him might be returned to me. The following was his reply:\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI entertain you to believe that I feel truly obliged by your kind intentions towards me, and that I entertain the most unfeigned respect for your most tasteful talents. My house is completely filled with workpeople at this time, and I have only an office to transact business in; and yesterday I was wholly occupied, or I should have done myself the pleasure of seeing you.\n\nIf it would not suit me to engage in the publication of your present work, it is only because I do not see that scope in the nature of it which would enable me to make these satisfactory accounts between us, without which I really feel no satisfaction in engaging; but I will do all I can to promote their circulation, and shall be most ready to attend to any future plan of yours.\n\nWith much regard, I remain, dear sir,\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nJohn Murray.\n\nThis was disheartening, and might have deterred me from any further prosecution of the matter, had the question of republication in Great Britain proved entirely with me; but I apprehended the appearance of a spasmodic edition. I now thought of Mr. Archibald Constable as publisher, having been treated by him with much hospitality during a visit to Edinburgh; but first I determined to submit my work to Sir Walter (then Mr.) Scott, being encouraged to do so by the cordial reception I had experienced from him.\nat Abbotsford a few years previously, and by the favourable opinion he had expressed to others of my earlier writings. I accordingly sent him the printed numbers of the Sketch Book in a parcel by coach, and at the same time wrote to him, hinting that since I had had the pleasure of partaking of his hospitality, a reverse had taken place in my affairs, which made the successful exercise of my pen all-important to me; I begged him, therefore, to look over the literary articles I had forwarded to him, and, if he thought they would bear European republication, to ascertain whether Mr. Constable would be inclined to be the publisher.\n\nThe parcel containing my work went by coach to Scott's address in Edinburgh; the letter went by mail to his residence in the country. By the very first post I received a reply, before he had seen my work.\n\n\"I was down at Kelso,\" said he, \"when your letter reached Abbotsford. I am now on my way to town, and will converse with Constable, and do all in my power to forward your views\u2014I assure you nothing will give me more pleasure.\"\n\nThe hint, however, about a reverse of fortune had struck the quick apprehension of Scott, and, with that practical and efficient good-will which belonged to his nature, he had already devised a way of aiding me. A weekly periodical, he went on to inform me, was about to be set up in Edinburgh, supported by the most respectable talents, and amply furnished with all the necessary information. The appointment of the editor, for which ample funds were provided, would be five hundred pounds sterling a year, with the reasonable prospect of further advantages. This situation, being apparently at his disposal, he frankly offered to me. The work, however, he intimated, was to have somewhat of a political bearing, and he expressed an apprehension that the tone it was desired to adopt might not suit me. \"Yet I risk the question,\" added he, \"because I know no man so well qualified for this important task, and perhaps because it will necessarily bring you to Edinburgh. If my proposal does not suit, you need only keep the matter secret, and there is no harm done. 'And for my love I pray you wrong me not.' If, on the contrary, you think it could be made to suit you, let me know as soon as possible, addressing Castle-street, Edinburgh.\"\n\nIn a postscript, written from Edinburgh, he adds, \"I am just come here, and have glanced over the Sketch Book. It is positively beautiful, and increases my desire to crisp you, if it be possible. Some difficulties there always are in managing such a matter, especially at the outset; but we will obviate them as much as we possibly can.\"\n\nThe following is from an imperfect draught of my reply, which underwent some modifications in the copy sent.\n\n\"I cannot express how much I am gratified by your letter. I had begun to feel as if I had taken an unwarrantable liberty; but, somehow or other, there is a genial sunshine about you that warms every creeping thing into heart and confidence. Your literary proposal both surprises and flatters me, as it evinces a much higher opinion of my talents than I have myself.\"\n\nI then went on to explain that I found myself peculiarly unfitted for the situation offered to me, not merely by my political opinions, but by the very constitution and habits of my mind. \"My whole course of life,\" I observed, \"has been desultory, and I am unfitted for any periodically recurring task, or any stipulated labour of body or mind. I have no command of my talents, such as they are, and have to watch the varyings of my mind as I would those of a weathercock. Practice and training may bring me more into rule; but...\"\nrule; but at present I am as useless for regular service as one of my own country Indians, or a Don Cosseck.\n\n\"I must, therefore, keep on pretty much as I have begun; writing when I can, not when I would. I shall occasionally shift my residence, and write whatever is suggested by objects before me, or whatever rises in my imagination; and hope to write better and more copiously by-and-by.\n\n\"I am playing the egotist, but I know no better way of answering your proposal than by showing what a very good-for-nothing kind of being I am. Should Mr. Constable feel inclined to make a bargain for the wares I have on hand, he will encourage me to further enterprise; and it will be something like trading with a gipsy for the fruits of his prowling, who may at one time have nothing but a wooden bowl to offer, and at another time a silver tankard.\"\n\nIn reply, Scott expressed regret, but not surprise, at my declining what might have proved a troublesome duty. He then recurred to the original subject of our correspondence; entered into a detail of the various terms upon which arrangements were made between authors and booksellers, that I might take my choice; expressing the most encouraging confidence of the success of my work, and of previous works which I had produced in America. \"I did no more,\" added he, \"than open the trenches with Constable; but I am sure if you will take the trouble to write to him, you will find him disposed to treat your overtures with every degree of attention. Or, if you think it of consequence, in the first place, to see me, I shall be in London in the course of a month, and whatever my experience can command is most heartily at your command. But I can add little to what I have said above, except my earnest recommendation to Constable to enter into the negotiation.\"\n\nBefore the receipt of this most obliging letter, however, I had determined to look to no leading bookseller for a launch, but to throw my work before the public at my own risk, and let it sink or swim according to its merits. I wrote to that effect to Scott, and soon received a reply:\n\n\"I observe with pleasure that you are going to come forth in Britain. It certainly not the very best way to publish on one's own account; for the booksellers set their face against the circulation of such works as do not pay an ensuing toll to themselves. But they have lost the art of altogether damming up the road in such cases between the author and the public, which they were once able to do as effectually as Diabolus in John Bunyan's Holy War closed up the windows of my Lord Understanding's mansion. I am sure of the thing, that you have only to be known to the British public to be admired by them, and I would not say so unless I really was of that opinion.\n\n\"If you ever see a witty but rather local publication called Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, you will find some notice of your works in the last number: the author is a friend of mine, to whom I have introduced you in\n\nI cannot avoid subjoining in a note a succeeding paragraph of Scott's letter, which, though it does not relate to the main subject of our correspondence, was too characteristic to be omitted. Some time previously I had sent Miss Sophia Scott small duodecimo American editions of her father's poems published in Edinburgh in quarto volumes; showing the \"ignorance\" of the American press, by which a quart of wine is conjured into a pint bottle. Scott observes:\u2014\"In my hurry, I have not thanked you in Sophia's name for the kind attention which furnished her with the American volumes. I am not quite sure I can add my own, since you have made her acquainted with much more of Pope's folly than she would otherwise have learned; for I had taken special care they should never see any of those things during their earlier years. I think I told you that Walter is sweeping the firmament with a feather like a maypole, and intending the perpetration with a sword like a scythe\u2014in other words, he has become a whirlwind banner in the...\"\nyour literary capacity. His name is Lockhart, a young man of very considerable talent, and who will soon be intimately connected with my family. My faithful friend Knickerbocker is to be next examined and illustrated. Constable was extremely willing to enter into consideration of a treaty for your works, but I foresee will be still more so when\n\nYour name is up, and may go\nFrom Toledo to Madrid.\n\nAnd that will soon be the case. I trust to be in London about the middle of the month, and promise myself great pleasure in once again shaking you by the hand.\"\n\nThe first volume of the Sketch Book was put to press in London as I had resolved, at my own risk, by a bookseller unknown to fame, and without any of the usual arts by which a work is trumpeted into notice. Still some attention had been called to it by the extracts which had previously appeared in the Literary Gazette, and by the kind word spoken by the editor of that periodical, and it was getting into fair circulation, when my worthy bookseller failed before the first month was over, and the sale was interrupted.\n\nAt this juncture Scott arrived in London. I called to him for help, as I was sticking in the mire, and, more propitious than Hercules, he put his own shoulder to the wheel. Through his favourable representations, Murray was quickly induced to undertake the future publication of the work which he had previously declined. A further edition of the first volume was struck off, and the second volume was put to press, and from that time Murray became my publisher, conducting himself in all his dealings with that fair, open, and liberal spirit which had obtained for him the well-merited appellation of the Prince of Booksellers.\n\nThus, under the kind and cordial auspices of Sir Walter Scott, I began my literary career in Europe; and I feel that I am but discharging, in a trifling degree, my debt of gratitude to the memory of that golden-hearted man in acknowledging my obligations to him.\u2014But who of his literary contemporaries ever applied to him for aid or counsel that did not experience the most prompt, generous, and effectual assistance?\n\nW. I.\n\nSkylarkside, 1846.\nCONTENTS\n\nThe Author's Account of Himself ...........................................

Even when a mere child I began my\ntravels, and made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and\nunknown regions of my native city, to the frequent alarm of my\nparents, and the enrolment of the town-crier. As I grew into\nboyhood, I extended the range of my observations. My holiday\nafternoons were spent in rambles about the surrounding country.\nI made myself familiar with all its places famous in history or\nfable. I knew every spot where a murder or robbery had been\ncommitted, or a ghost seen. I visited the neighbouring villages,\nand added greatly to my stock of knowledge by noting their\nhabits and customs, and conversing with their sages and great\nmen. I even journeyed one long summer's day to the summit of\nthe most distant hill, whence I stretched my eye over many a\nmile of terra incognita, and was astonished to find how vast a\nworld I inhabited.\n\nThis rambling propensity strengthened with my years. Books\nof voyages and travels became my passion, and in devouring\ntheir contents I neglected the regular exercises of the school.\nHow wistfully would I wander about the pier-heads in fine\nweather, and watch the parting ships bound to distant climes\u2014\nwith what longing eyes would I gaze after their lessening sails,\nand waste myself in imagination to the ends of the earth!\n\nFurther reading and thinking, though they brought this vague\nimagination into more reasonable bounds, only served to make it\nmore decided. I visited various parts of my own country; and\nhad I been merely a lover of fine scenery, I should have felt little\ndesire to seek elsewhere its gratification; for on no country have\nthe charms of Nature been more prodigally lavished. Her mighty\nlakes, like oceans of liquid silver; her mountains, with their\nbright a\u00ebrial tints; her valleys, teeming with wild fertility; her\ntremendous cataracts, thundering in their solitudes; her boundless plains, waving with spontaneous verdure; her broad deep rivers, rolling in solemn silence to the ocean; her trackless forests, where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence; her skies, kindling with the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine;\u2014no, never need an American look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural scenery.\n\nBut Europe held forth the charms of storied and poetical association. There were to be seen the masterpieces of art, the refinements of highly-cultivated society, the quaint peculiarities of ancient and local custom. My native country was full of youthful promise: Europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age. Her very ruins told the history of times gone by, and every mouldering stone was a chronicle. I longed to wander over the scenes of renowned achievement\u2014to tread, as it were, in the footsteps of antiquity\u2014to loiter about the ruined castle\u2014to meditate on the falling tower\u2014to escape, in short, from the commonplace realities of the present, and lose myself among the shadowy grandeur of the past.\n\nI had, beside all this, an earnest desire to see the great men of the earth. We have, it is true, our great men in America: not a city but has an ample share of them. I have mingled among them in my time, and been almost withered by the shade into which they cast me; for there is nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great one, particularly the great man of the city. But I was anxious to see the great men of Europe; for I had read in the works of various philosophers, that all animals degenerated in America, and man among the number. A great man of Europe, thought I, must therefore be as superior to a great man of America as a peak of the Alps to a highland of the Hudson; and in this idea I was confirmed, by observing the comparative importance and swelling magnitude of many English travellers among us, who, I was assured, were very little people in their own country. I will visit this land of wonders, thought I, and see the gigantic race from which I am degenerated.\n\nIt has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion gratified. I have wandered through different countries, and witnessed many of the shifting scenes of life. I cannot say that I have studied them with the eye of a philosopher; but rather with the sauntering gait with which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll from the window of one print-shop to another, caught, sometimes by the delineations of beauty, sometimes by...\nthe distortions of caricature, and sometimes by the loveliness of landscape. As it is the fashion for modern tourists to travel pencil in hand, and bring home their portfolios filled with sketches, I am disposed to get up a few for the entertainment of my friends. When, however, I look over the hints and memorandums I have taken down for the purpose, my heart almost fails me at finding how my idle humour has led me aside for the great objects studied by every regular traveller who would make a book. I fear I shall give equal disappointment with an unlucky landscape painter who had travelled on the continent, but, following the bent of his vagrant inclination, had sketched in nooks, and corners, and by-places. His sketch-book was accordingly crowded with cottages, and landscapes, and obscure ruins; but he had neglected to paint St. Peter's or the Coliseum, the cascade of Terni or the bay of Naples, and had not a single glacier or volcano in his whole collection.\n\nTHE VOYAGE.\n\nShips, ships, I will describe you\nAmidst the noise;\nI will come and try you,\nWhat you are protecting,\nAnd projecting.\nWhat's your end and aim.\nOne goes abroad for merchandise and trading,\nAnother stays to keep his country from invading,\nA third is coming home with rich and wealthy trading.\nHailoe! my friend, whither wilt thou go?\u2014Old Poem.\n\nTo an American visiting Europe the long voyage he has to make is an excellent preparative. The temporary absence of worldly scenes and employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive new and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters that separates the hemispheres is like a blank page in existence. There is no gradual transition by which, as in Europe, the features and population of one country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another. From the moment you lose sight of the land you have left, all is vacancy until you step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once into the bustle and novelties of another world.\n\nIn travelling by land, there is a continuity of scene, and a connected succession of persons and incidents, that carry on the story of life, and lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, it is true, \"a lengthening chain\" at each remove of our pilgrimage; but the chain is unbroken: we can trace it back sometimes by link by link, and we feel that the last still grapples us to home.\nBut a wide sea voyage severs us at once. It makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of settled life, and sent adrift upon a doubtful world. It interposes a gulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and our homes\u2014a gulf subject to tempest, and fear, and uncertainty, rendering distance palpable, and return precarious.\n\nSuch, at least, was the case with myself. As I saw the last blue line of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon, it seemed as if I had closed one volume of the world and its contents, and had time for meditation before I opened another. That land, too, now vanishing from my view, which contained all most dear to me in life\u2014what vicissitudes might occur in it\u2014what changes might take place in me, before I should visit it again! Who can tell, when he sets forth to wander, whither he may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence; or when he may return; or whether it may ever be his lot to revisit the scenes of his childhood?\n\nI said that at sea all is vacancy; I should correct the expression. To one given to day-dreaming, and fond of losing himself in reveries, a sea voyage is full of subjects for meditation; but then they are the wonders of the deep and of the air, and rather tend to abstract the mind from worldly themes. I delighted to loll over the quarter-railing, or climb to the main-top, of a calm day, and muse for hours together on the tranquil bosom of a summer's sea; to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and people them with a creation of my own;\u2014to watch the gentle undulating billows, rolling their silver volumes, as if to die away on those happy shores.\n\nThere was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe with which I looked down, from my giddy height, on the monsters of the deep at their uncouth gambols. Shoals of porpoises tumbling about the bow of the ship; the grampus slowly heaving his huge form above the surface; or the ravenous shark, darting, like a spectre, through the blue waters. My imagination would conjure up all that I had heard or read of the watery world beneath me; of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys; of the shapeless monsters that lurk among the very foundations of the earth; and of those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and sailors.\n\nSometimes a distant sail, gliding along the edge of the ocean, would be another theme of idle speculation. How interesting this fragment of a world, hastening to rejoin the great mass of existence! What a glorious monument of human invention;\nwhich has in a manner triumphed over wind and wave; has brought the ends of the world into communion; has established an interchange of blessings, pouring into the sterile regions of the north all the luxuries of the south; has diffused the light of knowledge and the charities of cultivated life; and has thus bound together those scattered portions of the human race, between which Nature seemed to have thrown an insurmountable barrier.\n\nWe one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance. At sea everything that breaks the monotony of the surrounding expanse attracts attention. It proved to be the mast of a ship that must have been completely wrecked, for there were the remains of handkerchiefs by which some of the crew had fastened themselves to this spar, to prevent their being washed off by the waves. There was no trace by which the name of the ship could be ascertained. The wreck had evidently drifted about for many months; clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it, and long sea-weeds flaunted at its sides. But where, thought I, are the crew? Their struggle has long been over\u2014they have gone down amidst the roar of the tempest\u2014their bones lie whitening among the caverns of the deep. Silence, oblivion, like the waves, have closed over them, and no one can tell the story of their end. What sighs have been wasted after that ship! what prayers offered up at the deserted fireside of home! How often has the mistress, the wife, the mother, pored over the daily news to catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep! How has expectation darkened into anxiety\u2014anxiety into dread\u2014and dread into despair! Alas! not one memento may ever return for love to cherish. All that may ever be known is, that she sailed from her port \"and was never heard of more!\"\n\nThe sight of this wreck, as usual, gave rise to many dismal anecdotes. This was particularly the case in the evening, when the weather, which had hitherto been fair, began to look wild and threatening, and gave indications of one of those sudden storms which will sometimes break in upon the serenity of a summer voyage. As we sat round the dull light of a lamp in the cabin, that made the gloom more ghastly, every one had his tale of shipwreck and disaster. I was particularly struck with a short one related by the captain.\n\n\"As I was once sailing,\" said he, \"in a fine stout ship across the banks of Newfoundland, one of those heavy fogs which\nprevail in those parts rendered it impossible for us to see far ahead even in the daytime, but at night the weather was so thick that we could not distinguish any object at twice the length of the ship. I kept lights at the mast-head, and a constant watch forward to look out for fishing smacks, which are accustomed to lie at anchor on the banks. The wind was blowing a smacking breeze, and we were going at a great rate through the water. Suddenly the watch gave the alarm of 'a sail ahead!'\u2014it was scarcely uttered before we were upon her. She was a small schooner, at anchor, with her broadside towards us. The crew were all asleep, and had neglected to hoist a light. We struck her just amid-ships. The force, the size, and weight of our vessel bore her down below the waves; we passed over her and were hurried on our course. As the crushing wreck was sinking beneath us, I had a glimpse of two or three half-naked wretches rushing from her cabin; they just started from their beds to be swallowed shrieking by the waves. I heard their drowning cry mingling with the wind. The blast that bore it to our ears swept us out of all further hearing. I shall never forget that cry! It was some time before we could put the ship about, she was under such headway. We returned, as nearly as we could guess, to the place where the smack had anchored. We cruised about for several hours in the dense fog. We fired signal-guns, and listened if we might hear the halloo of any survivors; but all was silent\u2014we never saw or heard anything of them more.\"\n\nI confess these stories, for a time, put an end to all my fine fancies. The storm increased with the night. The sea was lashed into tremendous confusion. There was a fearful sullen sound of rushing waves and broken surges. Deep called unto deep. At times the black volume of clouds overhead seemed rent asunder by flashes of lightning, which quivered along the foaming billows, and made the succeeding darkness doubly terrible. The thunders bellowed over the wild waste of waters, and were echoed and prolonged by the mountain waves. As I saw the ship staggering and plunging among these roaring caverns, it seemed miraculous that she regained her balance, or preserved her buoyancy. Her yards would dip into the water; her bow was almost buried beneath the waves. Sometimes an impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm her, and nothing but a dexterous movement of the helm preserved her from the shock.\n\nWhen I retired to my cabin, the awful scene still followed me.\nThe whistling of the wind through the rigging sounded like funeral wailings. The creaking of the masts, the straining and groaning of bulk-heads, as the ship laboured in the weltering sea, were frightful. As I heard the waves rushing along the sides of the ship, and roaring in my very ear, it seemed as if Death were raging round this floating prison, seeking for his prey; the mere starting of a nail, the yawning of a seam, might give him entrance.\n\nA fine day, however, with a tranquil sea and favouring breeze, soon put all these dismal reflections to flight. It is impossible to resist the gladdening influence of fine weather and fair wind at sea. When the ship is decked out in all her canvas, every sail swelled, and careering gaily over the curling waves, how lofty, how gallant she appears\u2014how she seems to lord it over the deep!\n\nI might fill a volume with the reveries of a sea voyage, for with me it is almost a continual reverie\u2014but it is time to get to shore.\n\nIt was a fine sunny morning when the thrilling cry of \"land!\" was given from the mast-head. None but those who have experienced it can form an idea of the delicious throng of sensations which rush into an American's bosom when he first comes in sight of Europe. There is a volume of associations with the very name. It is the land of promise, teeming with everything of which his childhood has heard, or on which his studious years have pondered.\n\nFrom that time until the moment of arrival it was all feverish excitement. The ships of war that prowled like guardian giants along the coast; the headlands of Ireland stretching out into the Channel; the Welsh mountains towering into the clouds; all were objects of intense interest. As we sailed up the Mersey, I reconnoitred the shores with a telescope. My eye dwelt with delight on neat cottages, with their trim shrubberies and green grass-plots. I saw the mouldering ruins of an abbey overrun with ivy, and the taper spire of a village church rising from the brow of a neighbouring hill\u2014all were characteristic of England.\n\nThe tide and wind were so favourable that the ship was enabled to come at once to the pier. It was thronged with people; some, idle lookers-on\u2014others, eager expectants of friends or relatives. I could distinguish the merchant to whom the ship was consigned; I knew him by his calculating brow and restless air. His hands were thrust into his pockets; he was whistling thoughtfully, and walking to and fro, a small space having been\naccorded him by the crowd in deference to his temporary importance. There were repeated cheerings and salutations interchanged between the shore and the ship, as friends happened to recognize each other. I particularly noticed one young woman of humble dress, but interesting demeanour. She was leaning forward from among the crowd; her eye hurried over the ship as it neared the shore, to catch some wished-for countenance. She seemed disappointed and agitated; when I heard a faint voice call her name. It was from a poor sailor who had been ill all the voyage, and had excited the sympathy of everyone on board. When the weather was fine, his messmates had spread a mattress for him on deck in the shade, but of late his illness had so increased, that he had taken to his hammock, and only breathed a wish that he might see his wife before he died. He had been helped on deck as we came up the river, and was now leaning against the shrouds, with a countenance so wasted, so pale, so ghastly, that it was no wonder even the eye of affection did not recognize him. But, at the sound of his voice, her eye darted on his features; it read at once a whole volume of sorrow; she clasped her hands, uttered a faint shriek, and stood wringing them in silent agony.\n\nAll now was hurry and bustle. The meetings of acquaintances\u2014the greetings of friends\u2014the consultations of men of business. I alone was solitary and idle. I had no friend to meet, no cheering to receive. I stepped upon the land of my forefathers, but felt that I was a stranger in the land.\n\nROSCOE.\n\nIn the service of mankind to be\nA guardian god below; still to employ\nThe mind's brave ardour in heroic aims,\nSuch as may raise us o'er the grovelling herd,\nAnd make us shine for ever\u2014that is life.\u2014Thomson.\n\nOne of the first places to which a stranger is taken in Liverpool is the Athen\u00e6um. It is established on a liberal and judicious plan; it contains a good library and spacious reading-room, and is the great literary resort of the place. Go there at what hour you may, you are sure to find it filled with grave-looking personages deeply absorbed in the study of newspapers.\n\nAs I was once visiting this haunt of the learned, my attention was attracted to a person just entering the room. He was advanced in life, tall, and of a form that might once have been commanding, but it was a little bowed by time\u2014perhaps by care.\nHe had a noble Roman style of countenance; a head that would have pleased a painter; and though some slight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought had been busy there, yet his eye still beamed with the fire of a poetic soul. There was something in his whole appearance that indicated a being of a different order from the bustling race around him.\n\nI inquired his name, and was informed that it was Roscoe. I drew back with an involuntary feeling of veneration. This, then, was an author of celebrity; this was one of those men whose voices have gone forth to the ends of the earth; with whose minds I have communed even in the solitudes of America. Accustomed, as we are in our country, to know European writers only by their works, we cannot conceive of them, as of other men, engrossed by trivial or sordid pursuits, and jostling with the crowd of common minds in the dusty paths of life. They pass before our imaginations like superior beings, radiant with the emanations of their genius, and surrounded by a halo of literary glory.\n\nTo find, therefore, the elegant historian of the Medici mingling among the busy sons of traffic, at first shocked my poetical ideas; but it is from the very circumstances and situation in which he has been placed, that Mr. Roscoe derives his highest claims to admiration. It is interesting to notice how some minds seem most to create themselves, springing up under every disadvantage, and working their solitary but irresistible way through a thousand obstacles. Nature seems to delight in disappointing the avidities of art, with which it would rear legitimate dulness to maturity; and to glory in the vigour and luxuriance of her chance productions. She scatters the seeds of genius to the winds, and though some may perish among the stony places of the world, and some be choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity, yet others will now and then strike root even in the clefts of the rock, struggle bravely up into sunshine, and spread over their sterile birthplace all the beauties of vegetation.\n\nSuch has been the case with Mr. Roscoe. Born in a place apparently ungenial to the growth of literary talent; in the very market-place of trade; without fortune, family connections, or patronage; self-prompted, self-sustained, and almost self-taught, he has conquered every obstacle, achieved his way to eminence, and, having become one of the ornaments of the nation, has turned the whole force of his talents and influence to advance and embellish his native town.\nIndeed, it is this last trait in his character which has given him the greatest interest in my eyes, and induced me particularly to point him out to my countrymen. Eminent as are his literary merits, he is but one among the many distinguished authors of this intellectual nation. They, however, in general, live but for their own fame, or their own pleasures. Their private history presents no lesson to the world, or, perhaps, a humiliating one of human frailty and inconsistency. At best, they are prone to steal away from the bustle and commonplace of busy existence; to indulge in the selfishness of lettered ease; and to revel in scenes of mental, but exclusive enjoyment.\n\nMr. Roscoe, on the contrary, has claimed none of the accorded privileges of talent. He has shut himself up in no garden of thought, no elysium of fancy; but has gone forth into the highways and thoroughfares of life; he has planted bowers by the way-side, for the refreshment of the pilgrim and the sojourner, and has opened pure fountains, where the labouring man may turn aside from the dust and heat of the day, and drink of the living streams of knowledge. There is a \"daily beauty in his life,\" on which mankind may meditate and grow better. It exhibits no lofty and almost useless, because inimitable, example of excellence; but presents a picture of active, yet simple and imitable virtues, which are within every man's reach, but which, unfortunately, are not exercised by many, or this world would be a paradise.\n\nBut his private life is peculiarly worthy the attention of the citizens of our young and busy country, where literature and the elegant arts must grow up side by side with the coarser plants of daily necessity; and must depend for their culture, not on the exclusive devotion of time and wealth, nor the quickening rays of titled patronage, but on hours and seasons snatched from the pursuit of worldly interests, by intelligent and public-spirited individuals.\n\nHe has shown how much may be done for a place in hours of leisure by one master spirit, and how completely it can give its own impress to surrounding objects. Like his own Lorenzo de' Medici, on whom he seems to have fixed his eye as an a pure model of antiquity, he has interwoven the history of his life with the history of his native town, and has made the foundations of its fame the monuments of his virtues. Wherever you go in Liverpool, you perceive traces of his footsteps in all that is elegant and liberal. He found the tide of wealth flowing merely in the\nchannels of traffic; he has diverted from it invigorating rills to refresh the garden of literature. By his own example and constant exertions, he has effected that union of commerce and the intellectual pursuits, so eloquently recommended in one of his latest writings;* and has practically proved how beautifully they may be brought to harmonize, and to benefit each other. The noble institutions for literary and scientific purposes, which reflect such credit on Liverpool, and are giving such an impulse to the public mind, have mostly been originated, and have all been effectively promoted, by Mr. Roscoe; and when we consider the rapidly increasing opulence and magnitude of that town, which promises to vie in commercial importance with the metropolis, it will be perceived that in awakening an ambition of mental improvement among its inhabitants, he has effected a great benefit to the cause of British literature.\n\nIn America, we know Mr. Roscoe only as the author\u2014in Liverpool he is spoken of as the banker; and I was told of his having been unfortunate in business. I could not pity him, as I heard some rich men do. I considered him far above the reach of my pity. Those who live only for the world, and in the world, may be cast down by the frowns of adversity; but a man like Roscoe is not to be overcome by the reverses of fortune. They do but drive him in upon the resources of his own mind; to the superior society of his own thoughts; which the best of men are apt sometimes to neglect, and to roam abroad in search of less worthy associates. He is independent of the world around him. He lives with antiquity and posterity; with antiquity, in the sweet communion of studious retirement; and with posterity, in the generous aspirations after future renown. The solitude of such a mind is its state of highest enjoyment. It is then visited by those elevated meditations which are the proper aliment of noble souls, and are, like manna, sent from heaven, in the wilderness of this world.\n\nWhile my feelings were yet alive on the subject, it was my fortune to light on further traces of Mr. Roscoe. I was riding out with a gentleman, to view the environs of Liverpool, when he turned off, through a gate, into some ornamented grounds. After riding a short distance, we came to a spacious mansion of freestone, built in the Grecian style. It was not in the purest taste, yet it had an air of elegance, and the situation was delightful. A fine lawn sloped away from it, studded with clumps of\n\n* Address on the opening of the Liverpool Institution.\ntrees, so disposed as to break a soft fertile country into a variety of landscapes. The Mersey was seen winding a broad quiet sheet of water through an expanse of green meadow-land; while the Welsh mountains, blended with clouds, and melting into distance, bordered the horizon.\n\nThis was Roscoe's favourite residence during the days of his prosperity. It had been the seat of elegant hospitality and literary retirement. The house was now silent and deserted. I saw the windows of the study, which looked out upon the soft scenery I have mentioned. The windows were closed\u2014the library was gone. Two or three ill-favoured beings were loitering about the place, whom my fancy pictured into retainers of the law. It was like visiting some classic fountain, that had once welled its pure waters in a sacred shade, but finding it dry and dusty, with the lizard and the toad brooding over the shattered marbles.\n\nI inquired after the fate of Mr. Roscoe's library, which had consisted of scarce and foreign books, from many of which he had drawn the materials for his Italian histories. It had passed under the hammer of the auctioneer, and was dispersed about the country. The good people of the vicinity thronged like wreckers to get some part of the noble vessel that had been driven on shore. Did such a scene admit of ludicrous associations, we might imagine something whimsical in this strange irruption in the regions of learning. Pigmies rummaging the armory of a giant, and contending for the possession of weapons which they could not wield. We might picture to ourselves some knot of speculators, debating with calculating brow over the quaint binding and illuminated margin of an obsolete author; of the air of intense, but baffled sagacity, with which some successful purchaser attempted to dive into the black-letter bargain he had secured.\n\nIt is a beautiful incident in the story of Mr. Roscoe's misfortunes, and one which cannot fail to interest the studious mind, that the parting with his books seems to have touched upon his tenderest feelings, and to have been the only circumstance that could provoke the notice of his muse. The scholar only knows how dear these silent, yet eloquent, companions of pure thoughts and innocent hours become in the seasons of adversity. When all that is worldly turns to dross around us, these only retain their steady value. When friends grow cold, and the converse of intimates languishes into vapid civility and commonplace,\nthese only continue the unaltered countenance of happier days,\nand cheer us with that true friendship which never deceived hope,\nnor deserted sorrow.\n\nI do not wish to censure; but surely, if the people of Liver-\npool had been properly sensible of what was due to Mr. Roscoe\nand themselves, his library never would have been sold. Good\nworldly reasons may, doubtless, be given for the circumstance,\nwhich it would be difficult to combat with others that might seem\nmerely fanciful; but it certainly appears to me such an oppor-\ntunity as seldom occurs, of cheering a noble mind struggling\nunder misfortunes, by one of the most delicate, but most expres-\nsive tokens of public sympathy. It is difficult, however, to\nestimate a man of genius properly who is daily before our eyes.\nHe becomes mingled and confounded with other men. His great\nqualities lose their novelty; we become too familiar with the\ncommon materials which form the basis even of the loftiest cha-\nracter. Some of Mr. Roscoe's townsmen may regard him merely\nas a man of business; others as a politician; all find him engaged\nlike themselves in ordinary occupations, and surpassed, perhaps,\nby themselves on some points of worldly wisdom. Even that\namiable and unostentatious simplicity of character which gives\nthe nameless grace to real excellence, may cause him to be under-\nvalued by some coarse minds, who do not know that true worth\nis always void of glare and pretension. But the man of letters\nwho speaks of Liverpool, speaks of it as the residence of Roscoe.\nThe intelligent traveller who visits it inquires where Roscoe is to\nbe seen. He is the literary landmark of the place, indicating its\nexistence to the distant scholar. He is, like Pompey's column at\nAlexandria, towering alone in classic dignity.\n\nThe following sonnet, addressed by Mr. Roscoe to his books\non parting with them, is alluded to in the preceding article:\nIf anything can add effect to the pure feeling and elevated\nthought here displayed, it is the conviction that the whole is\nno effusion of fancy, but a faithful transcript from the writer's\nheart:\n\nTO MY BOOKS.\n\nAs one who, destined from his friends to part,\nRegrets his loss, but hopes again erewhile\nTo share their converse and enjoy their smile,\nAnd temper as he may affliction's dart;\nThus, loved associates, chiefs of elder art,\nTeachers of wisdom, who could once beguile\nMy tedious hours, and lighten every toil,\nI now resign you; nor with fainting heart;\nTHE SKETCH BOOK.\n\nFor past a few short years, or days, or hours,\nAnd happier seasons may their dawn unfold,\nAnd all your sacred fellowship restore;\nWhen, freed from earth, unlimited its powers,\nMind shall with mind direct communion hold,\nAnd kindred spirits meet to part no more.\n\nTHE WIFE.\n\nThe treasures of the deep are not so precious\nAs are the conceal'd comforts of a man\nLocked up in woman's love. I scent the air\nOf blessings, when I come but near the house.\nWhat a delicious breath marriage sends forth...\nThe violet bed's not sweeter. MIDDLETON.\n\nI have often had occasion to remark the fortitude with which women sustain the most overwhelming reverses of fortune. Those disasters which break down the spirit of a man, and prostrate him in the dust, seem to call forth all the energies of the softer sex, and give such intrepidity and elevation to their character, that at times it approaches to sublimity. Nothing can be more touching than to behold a soft and tender female, who had been all weakness and dependence, and alive to every trivial roughness, while treading the prosperous paths of life, suddenly rising in mental force, to be the comforter and support of her husband under misfortune, and abiding, with unshrinking firmness, the bitterest blasts of adversity.\n\nAs the vine, which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak, and been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the hardy plant is rifted by the thunderbolt, cling round it with its caressing tendrils, and bind up its shattered boughs; so is it beautifully ordered by Providence, that woman, who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in his happier hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten with sudden calamity; winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature, tenderly supporting the drooping head, and binding up the broken heart.\n\nI was once congratulating a friend, who had around him a blooming family, knit together in the strongest affection. \"I can wish you no better lot,\" said he, with enthusiasm, \"than to have a wife and children. If you are prosperous, there they are to share your prosperity; if otherwise, there they are to comfort you.\" And, indeed, I have observed that a married man falling into misfortune is more apt to retrieve his situation in the world than a single one; partly because he is more stimulated to exertion by the necessities of the helpless and beloved beings who depend upon him for subsistence; relieved by the thought that he is still alive by the consciousness of his humiliation, which he cannot help feeling, and which he cannot help wishing to waste away; and his benevolence is roused by the sight of an innocent child.\n\nThose occasions when I was once engaged in a beautiful scene, in the midst of which there was that of my own imagination of innocence, and to those dear ones about the hearth.\n\nThe very expression of her countenance, the combination of grace and beauty which she was about to display, the rapture with which she looked at her sprightly infant, the midst of a scene which alone she could see, her arm, her eye, her person. The whole seemed to express the tenderness, the sweetness, of early and pure love.\n\nIt was now several months since his property had been swept from his hands. For a time he lived in a haggard state, and a protracted sickness made the necessity of assistance for his comfort evident. She saw, however, that he did not well, and she took his sight, and tried to cheerfully\nsistence; but chiefly because his spirits are soothed and relieved by domestic endearments, and his self-respect kept alive by finding, that though all abroad is darkness and humiliation, yet there is still a little world of love at home, of which he is the monarch. Whereas a single man is apt to run to waste and self-neglect; to fancy himself lonely and abandoned, and his heart to fall to ruin like some deserted mansion, for want of an inhabitant.\n\nThese observations call to mind a little domestic story, of which I was once a witness. My intimate friend, Leslie, had married a beautiful and accomplished girl, who had been brought up in the midst of fashionable life. She had, it is true, no fortune, but that of my friend was ample; and he delighted in the anticipation of indulging her in every elegant pursuit, and administering to those delicate tastes and fancies that spread a kind of witchery about the sex.\u2014\u201cHer Life,\u201d said he, \u201cshall be like a fairy tale.\u201d\n\nThe very difference in their characters produced an harmonious combination: he was of a romantic and somewhat serious cast; she was all life and gladness. I have often noticed the mute rapture with which he would gaze upon her in company, of which her sprightly powers made her the delight; and how, in the midst of applause, her eye would still turn to him, as if there alone she sought favour and acceptance. When leaning on his arm, her slender form contrasted finely with his tall manly person. The fond confiding air with which she looked up to him seemed to call forth a flush of triumphant pride and cherishing tenderness, as if he doted on his lovely burden for its very helplessness. Never did a couple set forward on the flowery path of early and well-suited marriage with a fairer prospect of felicity.\n\nIt was the misfortune of my friend, however, to have embarked his property in large speculations; and he had not been married many months, when, by a succession of sudden disasters, it was swept from him, and he found himself reduced almost to penury. For a time he kept his situation to himself, and went about with a haggard countenance and a breaking heart. His life was but a protracted agony; and what rendered it more insupportable was the necessity of keeping up a smile in the presence of his wife; for he could not bring himself to overwhelm her with the news. She saw, however, with the quick eyes of affection, that all was not well with him. She marked his altered looks and stifled sighs, and was not to be deceived by his sickly and vapid attempts at cheerfulness. She tasked all her sprightly powers and tender\nblandishments to win him back to happiness; but she only drove\nthe arrow deeper into his soul. The more he saw cause to love\nher, the more torturing was the thought that he was soon to make\nher wretched. A little while, thought he, and the smile will\nvanish from that cheek\u2014the song will die away from those lips\n\u2014the lustre of those eyes will be quenched with sorrow\u2014and the\nhappy heart, which now beats lightly in that bosom, will be\nweighed down like mine, by the cares and miseries of the world.\n\nAt length he came to me one day, and related his whole situa-\ntion in a tone of the deepest despair. When I heard him through,\nI inquired, \"Does your wife know all this?\" At the question\nhe burst into an agony of tears. \"For God's sake!\" cried he,\n\"if you have any pity on me, don't mention my wife; it is the\nthought of her that drives me almost to madness!\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said I. \"She must know it sooner or later:\nyou cannot keep it long from her, and the intelligence may break\nupon her in a more startling manner than if imparted by your-\nself; for the accents of those we love soften the harshest tidings.\nBesides, you are depriving yourself of the comforts of her sym-\npathy; and not merely that, but also endangering the only bond\nthat can keep hearts together\u2014an unreserved community of\nthought and feeling. She will soon perceive that something is\nsecretly preying upon your mind; and true love will not brook\nreserve; it feels undervalued and outraged when even the sorrows\nof those it loves are concealed from it.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, my friend! to think what a blow I am to give to\nall her future prospects\u2014how I am to strike her very soul to the\nearth, by telling her that her husband is a beggar; that she is to\nforego all the elegancies of life\u2014all the pleasures of society\u2014to\nshrink with me into indigence and obscurity! To tell her that\nI have dragged her down from the sphere in which she might\nhave continued to move in constant brightness\u2014the light of every\neye, the admiration of every heart!\u2014How can she bear poverty?\nshe has been brought up in all the refinements of opulence. How\ncan she bear neglect? she has been the idol of society. Oh! it\nwill break her heart\u2014it will break her heart!\u2014\"\n\nI saw his grief was eloquent, and I let it have its flow; for\nsorrow relieves itself by words. When his paroxysm had sub-\nsided, and he had relapsed into moody silence, I resumed the sub-\nject gently, and urged him to break his situation at once to his\nwife. He shook his head mournfully, but positively.\n\n\"But how are you to keep it from her? It is necessary she\nTHE WIFE.\n\nshould know it, that you may take the steps proper to the alteration of your circumstances. You must change your style of living\u2014nay,\" observing a pang to pass across his countenance, \"don't let that afflict you. I am sure you have never placed your happiness in outward show\u2014you have yet friends, warm friends, who will not think the worse of you for being less splendidly lodged: and surely it does not require a palace to be happy with Mary\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"I could be happy with her,\" cried he, convulsively, \"in a novel\u2014I could go down with her into poverty and the dust!\u2014I could\u2014I could\u2014God bless her! God bless her!\" cried he, bursting into a transport of grief and tenderness.\n\n\"And believe me, my friend,\" said I, stepping up, and grasping him warmly by the hand, \"believe me she can be the same with you. Ay, more: it will be a source of pride and triumph to her\u2014it will call forth all the latent energies and fervent sympathies of her nature; for she will rejoice to prove that she loves you for yourself. There is in every true woman's heart a spark of heavenly fire, which lies dormant in the broad daylight of prosperity; but which kindles up, and beams and blazes in the dark hour of adversity. No man knows what the wife of his bosom is\u2014no man knows what a ministering angel she is\u2014until she has gone with her through the fiery trials of this world.\"\n\nThere was something in the earnestness of my manner, and the figurative style of my language, that caught the excited imagination of Leslie. I knew the auditor I had to deal with; and following up the impression I had made, I finished by persuading him to go home and unburden his sad heart to his wife.\n\nI must confess, notwithstanding all I had said, I felt some little solicitude for the result. Who can calculate on the fortitude of one whose whole life has been a round of pleasures? Her gay spirits might revolt at the dark downward path of low humility suddenly pointed out before her, and might cling to the sunny regions in which they had hitherto revelled. Besides, ruin a fashionable life is accompanied by so many galling mortifications, to which in other ranks it is a stranger. In short, I could not meet Leslie the next morning without trepidation. He had made the disclosure.\n\n\"And how did she bear it?\"\n\n\"Like an angel! It seemed rather to be a relief to her mind, for she threw her arms round my neck, and asked if this was all that had lately made me unhappy. But, poor girl,\" added he,\n\"she cannot realize the change we must undergo. She has no idea of poverty but in the abstract; she has only read of it in poetry, where it is allied to love. She feels as yet no privation; she suffers no loss of accustomed conveniences nor elegancies. When we come practically to experience its sordid cares, its paltry wants, its petty humiliations\u2014then will be the real trial.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"now that you have got over the severest task, that of breaking it to her, the sooner you let the world into the secret the better. The disclosure may be mortifying, but then it is a single misery, and soon over; whereas you otherwise suffer it in anticipation every hour in the day. It is not poverty so much as pretence that harasses a ruined man\u2014the struggle between a proud mind and an empty purse\u2014the keeping up a hollow show that must soon come to an end. Have the courage to appear poor, and you disarm poverty of its sharpest sting.\"\n\nOn this point I found Lealie perfectly prepared. He had no false pride himself, and as to his wife, she was only anxious to conform to their altered fortunes.\n\nSome days afterwards he called upon me in the evening. He had disposed of his dwelling-house, and taken a small cottage in the country, a few miles from town. He had been busied all day in sending out furniture. The new establishment required few articles, and those of the simplest kind. All the splendid furniture of his late residence had been sold, excepting his wife's harp. That, he said, was too closely associated with the idea of herself; it belonged to the little story of their loves; for some of the sweetest moments of their courtship were those when he had leaned over that instrument and listened to the melting tones of her voice. I could not but smile at this instance of romantic gallantry in a doting husband.\n\nHe was now going out to the cottage, where his wife had been all day superintending its arrangement. My feelings had become strongly interested in the progress of this family story, and, as it was a fine evening, I offered to accompany him.\n\nHe was wearied with the fatigues of the day, and, as he walked out, fell into a fit of gloomy musing.\n\n\"Poor Mary!\" at length broke, with a heavy sigh, from his lips.\n\n\"And what of her?\" asked I; \"has anything happened to her?\"\n\n\"What,\" said he, darting an impatient glance, \"is it nothing to be reduced to this paltry situation\u2014to be caged in a miserable cottage\u2014to be obliged to toil almost in the menial concerns of her wretched habitation?\"\n\"The Wife.\"\n\n\"Has she then repined at the change?\"\n\n\"Repined! she has been nothing but sweetness and good humour. Indeed, she seems in better spirits than I have ever known her; she has been to me all love, and tenderness, and comfort!\"\n\n\"Admirable girl!\" exclaimed I. \"You call yourself poor, my friend; you never were so rich\u2014you never knew the boundless treasures of excellence you possess in that woman.\"\n\n\"Oh! but, my friend, if this first meeting at the cottage were over, I think I could then be comfortable. But this is her first day of real experience; she has been introduced into an humble dwelling\u2014she has been employed all day in arranging its miserable equipments\u2014she has for the first time known the fatigues of domestic employment\u2014she has for the first time looked round her on a home destitute of everything elegant\u2014almost of everything convenient; and may now be sitting down, exhausted and spiritless, brooding over a prospect of future poverty.\"\n\nThere was a degree of probability in this picture that I could not gainsay, so we walked on in silence.\n\nAfter turning from the main road up a narrow lane, so thickly shaded with forest trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion, we came in sight of the cottage. It was humble enough in its appearance for the most pastoral poet, and yet it had a pleasing rural look. A wild vine had overrun one end with a profusion of foliage; a few trees threw their branches gracefully over it; and I observed several pots of flowers tastefully disposed about the door, and on the grass-plot in front. A small wicket gate opened upon a foot-path that wound through some shrubbery to the door. Just as we approached, we heard the sound of music\u2014Leslie grasped my arm; we paused and listened. It was Mary's voice singing, in a style of the most touching simplicity, a little dearer of which her husband was peculiarly fond.\n\nI felt Leslie's hand tremble on my arm. He stepped forward to hear more distinctly. His step made a noise on the gravel walk. A bright beautiful face glanced out at the window and vanished\u2014a light footstep was heard\u2014and Mary came tripping forth to meet us; she was in a pretty rural dress of white, a few wild flowers were twisted in her fine hair, a fresh bloom was on her cheek, her whole countenance beamed with smiles\u2014I had never seen her look so lovely.\n\n\"My dear George,\" cried she, \"I am so glad you are come! I have been watching and watching for you, and running down...\"\nthe lane and looking out for you. I've set out a table under a beautiful tree behind the cottage, and I've been gathering some of the most delicious strawberries, for I know you are fond of them\u2014and we have such excellent cream\u2014and everything is so sweet and still here\u2014Oh!\" said she, putting her arm within his, and looking up brightly in his face, \"Oh, we shall be so happy!\"\n\nPoor Leslie was overcome. He caught her to his bosom\u2014he folded his arms round her\u2014he kissed her again and again\u2014he could not speak, but the tears gushed into his eyes, and he has often assured me that though the world has since gone prosperously with him, and his life has indeed been a happy one, yet never has he experienced a moment of more exquisite felicity.\n\nRIP VAN WINKLE.\n\n[The following Tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New York, who was very curious in the Dutch history of the province, and the manners of the descendants from its primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie so much among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty on his favourite topics, whereas he found the old burghers, and still more their wives, rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true history. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family, snugly shut up in its low-roofed farmhouse, under a spreading sycamore, he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter, and studied it with the zeal of a book-worm.\n\nThe result of all these researches was a history of the province during the reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since. There have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work, and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be. Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little questioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is now admitted into all historical collections as a book of unquestionable authority.\n\nThe old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work, and now that he is dead and gone, it cannot do much harm to his memory to say, that his time might have been much better employed in weightier labours. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby his own way; and though it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his neighbours, and griev\u00e8 the spirit of some friends, for whom he felt the truest deference and affection; yet his errors and follies are remembered \"more in sorrow than in anger,\" and it begins to be suspected that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his memory may be appreciated by critics, it is still held dear by many folk whose good opinion is well worth having, particularly by certain biscuit-bakers, who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their new-year cakes, and have thus given him a chance for immortality, almost equal to the being stamped on a Waterloo medal or a Queen Anne's farthing.]\n\nRIP VAN WINKLE:\n\nA POSTHUMOUS WRITING OF DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\n\nBy Woden, God of Saxons,\nFrom whence comes Wodensday, that is Wodensday.\nTruth is a thing that ever I will keep\nUnto thylike day in which I creep into\nMy sepulchre\u2014\n\nCASTWIGHT.\n\nWHOEVER has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill mountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a noble height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change of season, every change of weather, seems to affect them. The magic of spring is there regarded as the most meters. In the evening a cloudless, starry summit, light up like a beacon.\n\nAt the close of the day described the roofs gleamed and melted like a little wave of the Dutch about the house. (may be) of the original yellow brick, visible from the opposite bank. In that case, we tell the people who there lived, the Prince of Gales, the name of Rip Van Winkle's wife, Tuyvesant, who was his ancestor; he was a good-natured, kind-hearted husband, knowing that his popularity; mediating about their temper, and every furnace, till the sermon had long-since subsided, respects, be sure Rip Van Winkle was right. Certain it is, wives of the heart in all\nweather, indeed, every hour of the day, produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains, and they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect barometers. When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky; but sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.\n\nAt the foot of these fairy mountains, the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle-roofs gleam among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upper land melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape. It was a little village, of great antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in the early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant, (may he rest in peace!) and there were some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years, built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland, having latticed windows and gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.\n\nIn that same village and in one of these very houses (which, I must tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple good-natured man; he was, moreover, a kind neighbour, and an obedient hen-pecked husband. Indeed, to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity; for those men are most apt to be obsequious and accommodating abroad, who are under the discipline of shrews at home. Their tempers, doubtless, are rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation, and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the virtues of patience and long-suffering. A termagant wife may, therefore, in some respects, be considered a tolerable blessing; and if so, Rip Van Winkle was thrice blessed.\n\nCertain it is that he was a great favourite among all the good wives of the village, who, as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all family squabbles; and never failed, whenever they\ntalked those matters over in their evening gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van Winkle. The children of the village, too, would shout with joy whenever he approached. He assisted at their sports, made their playthings, taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories of ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the village, he was surrounded by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts, clambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with impunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighbourhood.\n\nThe great error in Rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labour. It could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar's lance, and fish all day without a murmur, even though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would carry a fowling-piece on his shoulder for hours together, trudging through woods and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons. He would never refuse to assist a neighbour even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at all country frolics for husking Indian corn, or building stone fences; the women of the village, too, used to employ him to run their errands, and to do such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them. In a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own; but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.\n\nIn fact, he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country; everything about it went wrong, and would go wrong, in spite of him. His fences were continually falling to pieces; his cows would either go astray, or get among the cabbages; weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere else; the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some out-door work to do; so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled away under his management, acre by acre, until there was little more left than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the worst conditioned farm in the neighbourhood.\n\nHis children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to nobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised to inherit the habits, with the old clothes of his father. He was generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels, equipped in a pair of his father's cast-off galligaskins, which he had much rather wear than any other train in his wardrobe.\n\nRip Van Winkle was a foolish, whimsical fellow, who would eat bread or breakfast without salt, and would not have his dinner eaten. If left to himself, he would be contentment itself, and would talk about his farm and his cattle, and on his family and his neighbours pleasantly going through life like a torrental stream, which flows on replying to every thing that is thrown into it, and which has grown into a river, and has cast up his banks, and has provoked a flood, and has carried off his former self, and has left which, in short, is Rip Van Winkle.\n\nRip's eldest son, who was much handsomer than the rest of them, as he thought, and who was with an air of authority, would stray. The second son, who was a dog, he was very fond of, but what he thought of the third, the errors of which he could not see, his wife knew best. Between his wife and himself there were many a silent quarrel, and many a nourish of the spirit, and many a helping provocation.\n\nTimes were now come when matrimony was looked upon as a kind of a sharp practice, and a constant unprofitable expense, and driven from the world by the changes, philosophic, which held sway a rubicon, and which they used to call the walking list of the stories about\nhad much ado to hold up with one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.\n\nRip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish, well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would rather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he would have whistled life away in perfect contentment; but his wife kept continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness, and the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning, noon, and night, her tongue was incessantly going, and everything he said or did was sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way of replying to all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use, had grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast up his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a fresh volley from his wife; so that he was fain to draw off his forces, and take to the outside of the house\u2014the only side, which, in truth, belongs to a hen-pecked husband.\n\nRip's sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much hen-pecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of his master's going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit befitting an honourable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever scoured the woods\u2014but what courage can withstand the ever-during and all-besetting horrors of a woman's tongue? The moment Wolf entered the house, his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground, or curled between his legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a side-long glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle, he would fly to the door with enveloping precipitation.\n\nTimes grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village; which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his Majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade through a long lazy summer's day, walking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any\nstatesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary; and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some months after they had taken place.\n\nThe opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree; so that the neighbours could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as by a sundial. It is true he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has his adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his opinions. When anything that was read or related displeased him, he was observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and to send forth short, frequent, and angry puffs, but when pleased he would inhale the smoke slowly and tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid clouds; and sometimes, taking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the fragrant vapour curl about his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of perfect approbation.\n\nFrom even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his termagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the assemblage and call the members all to naught; nor was that august personage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of this terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her husband in habits of idleness.\n\nPoor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only alternative, to escape from the labour of the farm and clamour of his wife, was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods. Here he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer in persecution. \"Poor Wolf,\" he would say, \"thy mistress leads thee a dog's life of it; but never mind, my lad, whilst I live thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee!\" Wolf would wag his tail, look wistfully in his master's face, and if dogs can feel pity, I verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.\n\nIn a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day, Rip had unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill mountains, where he was engaged in shooting, when reports of a crowd came to his ears. In the afternoon, when that crowd had dispersed, the trees were covered with rich weed, far below, and the reflection of the blue hills was seen in the blue lake. On the summit of the wild, lonely mountain, the impending evening was setting in, and their long shadows fell across the dark lake, while heavy sighs came from Van Winkle below. As he walked along, looking, looking, looking, across the scene, and then looking through the trees, \"Van Winkle!\" he cried, raising a loud voice, \"Van Winkle! come down into the valley over him; for he has received a stroke, and is under the necessity of being surprised to see his presence; but he will be obliged of his own accord.\"\n\nOn nearer examination, the rarity of the sight appeared; a built old fence, and a press was discovered, surrounded the valley, containing a volume, deep in the branches at the top, seemed full of...\nskill mountains. He was after his favourite sport of squirrel-shooting, and the still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun. Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a green knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a precipice. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.\n\nOn the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild, lonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending cliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun. For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually advancing; the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the valleys; he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the village, and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the terrors of Dame Van Winkle.\n\nAs he was about to descend, he heard a voice from a distance, calling, \"Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\" He looked around, but could see nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He thought his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again to descend, when he heard the same cry ringing through the still evening air; \"Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\"\u2014at the same time Wolf bristled up his back, and, giving a loud growl, scurried to his master's side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human being in this lonely and unfrequented place; but supposing it to be some one of the neighbourhood in need of his assistance, he hastened down to yield it.\n\nOn nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of the stranger's appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion\u2014a cloth jerkin, strapped round the waist\u2014several pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulder a stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and\nassist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip complied with his usual alacrity; and mutually relieving each other, they clambered up a narrow gully, apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft, between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for an instant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient thunder-showers which often take place in mountain heights, he proceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brink of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud. During the whole time Rip and his companion had laboured on in silence, for though the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying a keg of liquor up this wild mountain; yet there was something strange and incomprehensible about the unknown, that inspired awe and checked familiarity.\n\nOn entering the amphitheatre, new objects of wonder presented themselves. On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking personages playing at nine-pins. They were dressed in a quaint outlandish fashion; some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their belts, and most of them had enormous breeches, of similar style with that of the guide's. Their visages, too, were peculiar: one had a large head, broad face, and small piggish eyes; the face of another seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white sugar-loaf hat, set off with a little red cock's tail. They all had beards, of various shapes and colours. There was one who seemed to be the commander. He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten countenance; he wore a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and high-heeled shoes, with roses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of the figures in an old Flemish painting, in the parlour of Dominie Van Schaick, the village parson, and which had been brought over from Holland at the time of the settlement.\n\nWhat seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that though these folks were evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of the scene but the noise of the balls, which resounded like distant thunder.\n\nAs Rip hesitated, a statue-like figure approached, accompanied by a company of men, who bore a keg of liquor. By degrees Rip ventured to approach, which he did with caution. He was not long in discovering that the party was engaged in a game of nine-pins, and that the keg of liquor was intended for their refreshment. He looked around, and saw a barrel inside the mountain, containing the liquor, but he made no attempt to get at it. He whistled softly, and the echoes answered him. He determined to wait until, if he could, he would get it.\nAs Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted from their play, and stared at him with such fixed, statue-like gaze, and such strange, uncouth, lack-lustre countenances, that his heart turned within him, and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the contents of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to him to wait upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the liquor in profound silence, and then returned to their game.\n\nBy degrees Rip's awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had much of the flavour of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked another; and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at length his senses were overpowerd, his eyes swam in his head, his head gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.\n\nOn waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first seen the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes\u2014it was a bright sunny morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft, and beasting the pure mountain breeze. \"Surely,\" thought Rip, \"I have not slept here all night.\" He recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with a keg of liquor\u2014the mountain ravine\u2014the wild retreat among the rocks\u2014the two-begone party at nine-pins\u2014the flagon\u2014\"Oh! that flagon! that wicked flagon!\" thought Rip; \"what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?\"\n\nHe looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well-delled fowling-piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel incrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock wormeaten. He now suspected that the grave roysters of the mountain had put a trick upon him, and, having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun. Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him, and shouted his name, but all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was to be seen.\n\nHe determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol, and, if he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and\nwanting in his usual activity. \"These mountain beds do not agree with me,\" thought Rip; \"and if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.\" With some difficulty he got down into the glen: he found the gully up which he and his companion had ascended the preceding evening; but, to his astonishment, a mountain stream was now foaming down it\u2014leaping from rock to rock, and filling the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch, sassafras, and witch-hazel, and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the wild grape-vines that twisted their coils or tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind of network in his path.\n\nAt length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs to the amphitheatre; but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks presented a high impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad deep basin, black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then, poor Rip was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog; he was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff at the poor man's perplexities. What was to be done?\u2014the morning was passing away, and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up his dog and his gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty firelock, and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps homeward.\n\nAs he approached the village he met a number of people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and, whenever they cast their eyes upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same\u2014when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!\n\nHe had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange children ran at his heels, hooting after him; and pointing at his gray beard. The dogs, too, not one of which he recognised for an old acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered; it was larger and more populous.\nThere were rows of houses which he had never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had disappeared. Strange names were over the doors\u2014strange faces at the windows\u2014everything was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began to doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched. Surely this was his native village, which he had left but the day before. There stood the Kaatskill mountains\u2014there ran the silver Hudson at a distance\u2014there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always been. Rip was sorely perplexed. \"That flagon last night,\" thought he, \"has addled my poor head sadly!\"\n\nIt was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house, which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay\u2014the roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A half-starved dog that looked like Wolf, was skulking about it. Rip called him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. This was an unkind cut indeed\u2014\"My very dog,\" sighed poor Rip, \"has forgotten me!\"\n\nHe entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and apparently abandoned. The desolation overcame all his connubial fears\u2014he called loudly for his wife and children\u2014the lonely chambers rang for a moment with his voice, and then all again was silence.\n\nHe now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village inn\u2014but it too was gone. A large rickety wooden building stood in its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken and mended with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, \"The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.\" Instead of the great tree that used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there was now reared a tall naked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap, and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage of stars and stripes\u2014all this was strange and incomprehensible. He recognised on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George, under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe; but even this was singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre, the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON.\nThere was, as usual, a crowd of folks about the door, but none that Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double chin, and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco-smoke instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, a lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens\u2014elections\u2014members of congress\u2014liberty\u2014Bunker's Hill\u2014heroes of seventy-six\u2014and other words, which were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.\n\nThe appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled beard, his rusty fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded round him, eyeing him from head to foot with great curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired \"on which side he voted?\" Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe, inquired in his ear, \"Whether he was Federal or Democrat?\" Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing, self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating, as it were, into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone, \"What brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?\"\u2014\"Alas! gentlemen,\" cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, \"I am a poor quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!\"\n\nHere a general shout burst from the by-standers\u2014\"A tory! a tory! a spy! a refugee! hustle him! away with him!\" It was with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and, having assumed a tenfold austerity of brow, demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came there for, and whom he was seeking? The poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came there in search of some of his neighbours, who used to keep about the tavern.\n\n\"Well\u2014who are they?\u2014name them.\"\nRip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, \"Where's Nicholas Vedder?\"\n\nThere was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied in a thin piping voice, \"Nicholas Vedder! why, he is dead and gone these eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used to tell all about him, but that's rotten and gone too.\"\n\n\"Where's Brom Dutcher?\"\n\n\"Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he was killed at the storming of Stony Point\u2014others say he was drowned in a squall at the foot of Antony's Nose. I don't know\u2014he never came back again.\"\n\n\"Where's Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?\"\n\n\"He went off to the wars too, was a great militia general, and now in Congress.\"\n\nRip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him too, by treating of such enormous spaces of time, and of matters which he could not understand: war\u2014congress\u2014Stony Point;\u2014he had no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair \"Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?\"\n\n\"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!\" exclaimed two or three, \"Oh, to be sure! that's Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.\"\n\nRip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he went up the mountain: apparently as lazy, and certainly as sagged. The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name?\n\n\"God knows,\" exclaimed he, at his wit's end; \"I'm not myself\u2014I'm somebody else\u2014that's me yonder\u2014no\u2014that's somebody else got into my shoes\u2014I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and they've changed my gun, and everything's changed, and I'm changed, and I can't tell what's my name, or who I am!\"\n\nThe bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief, at the very suggestion of which the self-important man in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical moment a fresh comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man. She\nhad a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began to cry. \"Hush, Rip,\" cried she, \"hush, you little fool; the old man won't hurt you.\" The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all awakened a train of recollections in his mind.\n\n\"What is your name, my good woman?\" asked he.\n\n\"Judith Gardiner.\"\n\n\"And your father's name?\"\n\n\"Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it's twenty years since he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since\u2014his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.\"\n\nRip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering voice:\n\n\"Where's your mother?\"\n\n\"Oh, she too had died but a short time since; she broke a blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a New-England pedler.\"\n\nThere was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest man could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her child in his arms. \"I am your father!\" cried he\u2014\"Young Rip Van Winkle once\u2014old Rip Van Winkle now!\u2014Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?\"\n\nAll stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment, exclaimed, \"Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle\u2014it is himself! Welcome home again, old neighbour\u2014Why, where have you been these twenty long years?\"\n\nRip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night. The neighbours stared when they heard it; some were seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks: and the self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over, had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth, and shook his head\u2014upon which there was a general shaking of the head throughout the assemblage.\n\nIt was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the historian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighbourhood. He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most satisfactory manner.\nmanner. He assured the company that it was a fact, handed down from his ancestor the historian, that the Kaatskill mountains had always been haunted by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the Half-moon; being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river, and the great city called by his name. That his father had once seen them in their old Dutch dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the mountain; and that he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their balls, like distant peals of thunder.\n\nTo make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned to the more important concerns of the election. Rip's daughter took him home to live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout cheery farmer for her husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the archins that used to climb upon his back. As to Rip's son and heir, who was the ditto of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on the farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to anything else but his business.\n\nRip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of time; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with whom he soon grew into great favour.\n\nHaving nothing to do at home, and being arrived at that happy age when a man can be idle with impunity, he took his place once more on the bench at the inn door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of the old times \"before the war.\" It was some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could be made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his torpor. How that there had been a revolutionary war\u2014that the country had thrown off the yoke of old England\u2014and that, instead of being a subject of his Majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States. Rip, in fact, was no politician; the changes of states and empires made but little impression on him; but there was one species of despotism under which he had long groaned, and that was\u2014petticoat government. Happily that was at an end; he had got his neck out of the yoke of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever he pleased without dreading the tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her\nname was mentioned, however, he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and cast up his eyes; which might pass either for an expression of resignation to his fate, or joy at his deliverance.\n\nHe used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Mr. Doolittle's hotel. He was observed at first to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighbourhood but knew it by heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighbourhood, when life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.\n\nNote.\u2014The foregoing tale, one would suspect, had been suggested to Mr. Knickerbocker by a little German superstition about the Emperor Frederick der Rothbart, and the Kypphauser mountain; the subjoined note, however, which he had appended to the tale, shows that it is an absolute fact, narrated with his usual fidelity:\n\n\"The story of Rip Van Winkle may seem incredible to many, but nevertheless I give it my full belief, for I know the vicinity of our old Dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and appearances. Indeed, I have heard many stranger stories than this in the villages along the Hudson, all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt. I have even talked with Rip Van Winkle myself, who, when I last saw him, was a very venerable old man, and so perfectly rational and consistent on every other point, that I think no conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain; nay, I have seen a certificate on the subject, taken before a country justice, and signed with a cross, in the justice's own handwriting. The story, therefore, is beyond the possibility of doubt.\"\n\nPostscript.\u2014The following are travelling notes from a memorandum-book of Mr. Knickerbocker:\n\n\"The Kaatsberg, or Catskill Mountains, have always been a region full of fable. The Indians considered them the abode of spirits, who influenced the weather, spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape, and sending good or bad hunting seasons. They were ruled by an old aquaw spirit, said to be their mother. She dwelt on the highest peak of the Catskills, and had charge of the doors of day and night, to open and shut them at the proper hour. She hung up the new moons in the skies, and cut up the old ones into stars. In times of drought, if properly propitiated, she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and morning dew, and send them off from the crest of the mountains, flake after flake, like flakes of carded cotton, to float in the air, until, dissolved by the heat of the sun, they would fall in gentle showers, causing the grass to spring, the fruits to ripen, and the corn to grow an inch an hour. If displeased, however, she would brew up clouds black as ink, sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the midst of its web; and when these clouds broke, wo betide the valley!\n\n\"In old times, say the Indian traditions, there was a kind of Manitou or Spirit, who kept about the wildest recesses of the Catskill Mountains, and took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kinds of evils and vexations upon the red men.

Near the base of this rock, where the snakes baskings in the sun, and where the birds make their nests, there is a small cave, which place was held sacred by the Indians. Here the Manitou pursued his games, and here he would hide himself when his way penetrated into the dark recesses of the forest, or the crotches of the trees. When he wished to make his retreat he let loose a loud yell, which caused the birds to fly away and the snakes to slither away, and made its way to the nearest stream known by the name of the Manitou's Run.\"\n\nPostscript.\u2014The following are travelling notes from a memorandum-book of Mr. Knickerbocker:\n\n\"The Kaatsberg, or Catskill Mountains, have always been a region full of fable.

Great curiosity has been awakened of late with respect to the United States, and the London press has teemed with volumes of travels through the Republic; but they seem intended to diffuse error rather than knowledge; and so successful have they been that, notwithstanding the constant intercourse between the nations, there is no people concerning whom the great mass of the British public have less pure information, or entertain more numerous prejudices.\n\nEnglish travellers are the best and the worst in the world. Where no motives of pride or interest intervene, none can equal them for profound and philosophical views of society, or faithful and graphical descriptions of external objects; but when either the interest or reputation of their own country comes in collision with that of another, they go to the opposite extreme, and forget their usual probity and candour in the indulgence of splenetic remark, and an illiberal spirit of ridicule.\n\nHence, their travels are more honest and accurate the more remote the country described. I would place implicit confidence in an Englishman's description of the regions beyond the cataracts of the Nile; of unknown islands in the Yellow Sea; of the interior of India; or of any other tract which other travellers might be apt to picture out with the illusions of their fancies, but I would cautiously receive his account of his immediate neighbours, and of those nations with which he is in habits of most frequent intercourse. However I might be disposed to trust his probity, I dare not trust his prejudices.\n\nIt has also been the peculiar lot of our country to be visited by the worst kind of English travellers. While men of philo-\nsophical spirit and cultivated minds have been sent from England to ransack the poles, to penetrate the deserts, and to study the manners and customs of barbarous nations, with which she can have no permanent intercourse of profit or pleasure, it has been left to the broken-down tradesman, the scheming adventurer, the wandering mechanic, the Manchester and Birmingham agent, to be her oracles respecting America. From such sources she is content to receive her information respecting a country in a singular state of moral and physical development; a country in which one of the greatest political experiments in the history of the world is now performing, and which presents the most profound and momentous studies to the statesman and the philosopher.\n\nThat such men should give prejudicial accounts of America is not a matter of surprise. The themes it offers for contemplation are too vast and elevated for their capacities. The national character is yet in a state of fermentation; it may have its frothiness and sediment, but its ingredients are sound and wholesome; it has already given proofs of powerful and generous qualities; and the whole promises to settle down into something substantially excellent. But the causes which are operating to strengthen and ennoble it, and its daily indication of admirable properties, are all lost upon these purblind observers, who are only affected by the little asperities incident to its present situation. They are capable of judging only of the surface of things; of those matters which come in contact with their private interests and personal gratifications. They miss some of the snug conveniences and petty comforts which belong to an old, highly-finished, and over-populous state of society; where the ranks of useful labour are crowded, and many earn a painful and servile subsistence by studying the very caprices of appetite and self-indulgence. These minor comforts, however, are all-important in the estimation of narrow minds, which either do not perceive, or will not acknowledge, that they are more than counterbalanced among us by great and generally diffused blessings.\n\nThey may, perhaps, have been disappointed in some unreasonable expectation of sudden gain. They may have pictured America to themselves an El Dorado, where gold and silver abounded, and the natives were lacking in sagacity; and where they were to become strangely and suddenly rich, in some unforeseen but easy manner. The same weakness of mind that indulges absurd expectations produces petulance in disappointment. Such persons become embittered against the country on finding that there, as everywhere else, a man must sow before he can reap; must win wealth from the common earth, intelligent and industrious.\n\nPerhaps, this is the prompt disposition prevalent among them, with unwonted energy, all their lives, in the society, and become arrogant to the lowliness of society where they see any chance, such as\n\nOne would imagine such sources, or rather, must be received with the motives of the curiosity and observation which would be rigorously admitted in such a case; very reverse, as an instance of human sagacity with which the traveller will be comparatively unimpressed by the measurements of time and how sternly the contributions of nature are met with eagerness and enthusiasm of coarse and vulgar kind; their own is placed at stake. Nay, they will be eager on which to expend their generous cause.\n\nI shall not, I think, this topic; nor should it interest apparent, or even injurious effect, upon the national feelings, or personal attacks. They are merely misrepresentations of the webs woven round our continually outlaid\nmust win wealth by industry and talent; and must contend with the common difficulties of nature, and the shrewdness of an intelligent and enterprising people.\n\nPerhaps, through mistaken or ill-directed hospitality, or from the prompt disposition to cheer and countenance the stranger, prevalent among my countrymen, they may have been treated with unwonted respect in America; and having been accustomed all their lives to consider themselves below the surface of good society, and brought up in a servile feeling of inferiority, they become arrogant on the common boon of civility; they attribute to the lowliness of others their own elevation; and underrate a society where there are no artificial distinctions, and where, by any chance, such individuals as themselves can rise to consequence.\n\nOne would suppose, however, that information coming from such sources, on a subject where the truth is so desirable, would be received with caution by the censors of the press; that the motives of these men, their veracity, their opportunities of inquiry and observation, and their capacities for judging correctly, would be rigorously scrutinized before their evidence was admitted in such sweeping extent against a kindred nation. The very reverse, however, is the case, and it furnishes a striking instance of human inconsistency. Nothing can surpass the vigilance with which English critics will examine the credibility of the traveller who publishes an account of some distant and comparatively unimportant country. How warily will they compare the measurements of a pyramid, or the descriptions of a ruin; and how sternly will they censure any inaccuracy in these contributions of merely curious knowledge; while they will receive with eagerness and unhesitating faith the gross misrepresentations of coarse and obscure writers, concerning a country with which their own is placed in the most important and delicate relations. Nay, they will even make these apocryphal volumes text-books on which to enlarge with a zeal and an ability worthy of a more generous cause.\n\nI shall not, however, dwell on this irksome and hackneyed topic; nor should I have adverted to it, but for the undue interest apparently taken in it by my countrymen, and certain injurious effects which I apprehend it might produce upon the national feeling. We attach too much consequence to these attacks. They cannot do us any essential injury. The tissue of misrepresentation attempted to be woven round us are like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant. Our country continually outgrows them. One falsehood after another falls off\nof itself. We have but to live on, and every day we live a whole volume of refutation. All the writers of England united, if we could for a moment suppose their great minds stooping to so unworthy a combination, could not conceal our rapidly-growing importance and matchless prosperity. They could not conceal that these are owing, not merely to physical and local, but also to moral causes\u2014to the political liberty, the general diffusion of knowledge, the prevalence of sound moral and religious principles, which give force and sustained energy to the character of a people, and which, in fact, have been the acknowledged and wonderful supporters of their own national power and glory.\n\nBut why are we so exquisitely alive to the aspersions of England? Why do we suffer ourselves to be so affected by the contumely she has endeavoured to cast upon us? It is not in the opinion of England alone that honour lives, and reputation has its being. The world at large is the arbiter of a nation's fame; with its thousand eyes it witnesses a nation's deeds, and from their collective testimony is national glory or national disgrace established.\n\nFor ourselves, therefore, it is comparatively of but little importance whether England does us justice or not; it is, perhaps, of far more importance to herself. She is instilling anger and resentment into the bosom of a youthful nation, to grow with its growth and strengthen with its strength. If in America, as some of her writers are labouring to convince her, she is hereafter to find an invidious rival and a gigantic foe, she may thank those very writers for having provoked rivalryship and irritated hostility. Every one knows the all-pervading influence of literature at the present day, and how much the opinions and passions of mankind are under its control. The mere contests of the sword are temporary; their wounds are but in the flesh, and it is the pride of the generous to forgive and forget them; but the slanders of the pen pierce to the heart; they rankle longest in the noblest spirits; they dwell ever present in the mind, and render it morbidly sensitive to the most trifling collision. It is but seldom that any one overt act produces hostilities between two nations; there exists, most commonly, a previous jealousy and ill-will; a predisposition to take offence. Trace these to their cause, and how often will they be found to originate in the mischievous effusions of mercenary writers; who, secure in their closets, and for ignominious bread, concoct and circulate the venom that is to inflame the generous and the brave.\n\nI am not laying too much stress upon this point; for it applies\nmost emphatically to our particular case. Over no nation does the press hold a more absolute control than over the people of America; for the universal education of the poorest classes makes every individual a reader. There is nothing published in England on the subject of our country that does not circulate through every part of it. There is not a calumny dropped from English pen, nor an unworthy sarcasm uttered by an English statesman, that does not go to blight good-will, and add to the mass of latent resentment. Possessing, then, as England does, the fountain-head whence the literature of the language flows, how completely is it in her power, and how truly is it her duty, to make it the medium of amiable and magnanimous feeling\u2014a stream where the two nations might meet together and drink in peace and kindness. Should she, however, persist in turning it into waters of bitterness, the time may come when she may repent her folly. The present friendship of America may be of but little moment to her, but the future destinies of that country do not admit of a doubt; over those of England there lower some shadows of uncertainty. Should, then, a day of gloom arrive; should those reverses overtake her from which the proudest empires have not been exempt, she may look back with regret at her infatuation, in repulsing from her side a nation she might have grappled to her bosom, and thus destroying her only chance for real friendship beyond the boundaries of her own dominions.\n\nThere is a general impression in England, that the people of the United States are inimical to the parent country. It is one of the errors which have been diligently propagated by designing writers. There is, doubtless, considerable political hostility, and a general soreness at the illiberality of the English press; but, generally speaking, the prepossessions of the people are strongly in favour of England. Indeed, at one time, they amounted, in many parts of the Union, to an absurd degree of bigotry. The bare name of Englishman was a passport to the confidence and hospitality of every family, and too often gave a transient currency to the worthless and the ungrateful. Throughout the country there was something of enthusiasm connected with the idea of England. We looked to it with a hallowed feeling of tenderness and veneration, as the land of our forefathers\u2014the august repository of the monuments and antiquities of our race\u2014the birthplace and mausoleum of the sages and heroes of our paternal history. After our own country, there was none in whose glory we more delighted\u2014none whose good opinion we were more anxious to possess\u2014none towards which our hearts\nyearned with such throbings of warm consanguinity. Even during the late war, whenever there was the least opportunity for kind feelings to spring forth, it was the delight of the generous spirits of our country to show that, in the midst of hostilities, they still kept alive the sparks of future friendship.\n\nIs all this to be at an end? Is this golden band of kindred sympathies, so rare between nations, to be broken for ever? Perhaps it is for the best\u2014it may dispel an illusion which might have kept us in mental vassalage; which might have interfered occasionally with our true interests, and prevented the growth of proper national pride. But it is hard to give up the kindred tie! and there are feelings dearer than interest\u2014closer to the heart than pride\u2014that will still make us cast back a look of regret, as we wander farther and farther from the paternal roof, and lament the waywardness of the parent that would repel the affections of the child.\n\nShort-sighted and injudicious, however, as the conduct of England may be in this system of aspersion, recrimination on our part would be equally ill-judged. I speak not of a prompt and spirited vindication of our country, nor the keenest castigation of her slanderers\u2014but I allude to a disposition to retaliate in kind; to retort sarcasm, and inspire prejudice; which seems to be spreading widely among our writers. Let us guard particularly against such a temper, for it would double the evil instead of redressing the wrong. Nothing is so easy and inviting as the retort of abuse and sarcasm; but it is a paltry and an unprofitable contest. It is the alternative of a morbid mind, fretted into petulance, rather than warmed into indignation. If England is willing to permit the mean jealousies of trade, or the rancorous animosities of politics, to deprave the integrity of her press, and poison the fountain of public opinion, let us beware of her example. She may deem it her interest to diffuse error, and engender antipathy, for the purpose of checking emigration; we have no purpose of the kind to serve. Neither have we any spirit of national jealousy to gratify\u2014for as yet, in all our rivalships with England, we are the rising and the gaining party. There can be no end to answer, therefore, but the gratification of resentment\u2014a mere spirit of retaliation; and even that is impotent. Our retorts are never republished in England; they fall short, therefore, of their aim; but they foster a querulous and peevish temper among our writers; they sour the sweet flow of our early literature, and sow thorns and brambles among its blossoms. What is still worse, they circulate through our own country, and excite prejudices. Governed, as we should be taught, Knowledge is therefore, knowing the condition of his country.\n\nThe members of the candid and impartial, the sovereigns of all come to all questions of judgments. In England, we must be delicate characters, that affect the adjusting of determined hearts, attentive to prejudices.\n\nOpening, the portion of the world which should be our object, destitute of national, overt acts of hostility, which spring from inveterate dispositions. Rant ages, who go beyond their limits, on the contrary, enlightened and habitable world, have been in sight, and we forego nothing off the nation, except the old world.\n\nBut, above all, so far as to excellent and noble people, necessary and models, in Europe. The England. The ours. The\ncountry, and, as far as they have effect, excite virulent national prejudices. This last is the evil most especially to be deprecated. Governed, as we are, entirely by public opinion, the utmost care should be taken to preserve the purity of the public mind. Knowledge is power, and truth is knowledge; whoever, therefore, knowingly propagates a prejudice, wilfully saps the foundation of his country's strength.\n\nThe members of a republic, above all other men, should be candid and dispassionate. They are, individually, portions of the sovereign mind and sovereign will, and should be enabled to come to all questions of national concern with calm and unbiased judgments. From the peculiar nature of our relations with England, we must have more frequent questions of a difficult and delicate character with her than with any other nation; questions that affect the most acute and excitable feelings; and as, in the adjusting of these, our national measures must ultimately be determined by popular sentiment, we cannot be too anxiously attentive to purify it from all latent passion or prepossession.\n\nOpening, too, as we do, an asylum for strangers from every portion of the earth, we should receive all with impartiality. It should be our pride to exhibit an example of one nation, at least, destitute of national antipathies, and exercising not merely the overt acts of hospitality, but those more rare and noble courtesies which spring from liberality of opinion.\n\nWhat have we to do with national prejudices? They are the inveterate diseases of old countries, contracted in rude and ignorant ages, when nations knew but little of each other, and looked beyond their own boundaries with distrust and hostility. We, on the contrary, have sprung into national existence in an enlightened and philosophic age, when the different parts of the habitable world, and the various branches of the human family, have been indefatigably studied and made known to each other; and we forego the advantages of our birth, if we do not shake off the national prejudices, as we would the local superstitions of the old world.\n\nBut, above all, let us not be influenced by any angry feelings, so far as to shut our eyes to the perception of what is really excellent and amiable in the English character. We are a young people, necessarily an imitative one, and must take our examples and models, in a great degree, from the existing nations of Europe. There is no country more worthy of our study than England. The spirit of her constitution is most analogous to ours. The manners of her people\u2014their intellectual activity\u2014\ntheir freedom of opinion\u2014their habits of thinking on those subjects which concern the dearest interests and most sacred charities of private life, are all congenial to the American character; and, in fact, are all intrinsically excellent; for it is in the moral feeling of the people that the deep foundations of British prosperity are laid; and however the superstructure may be time-worn, or overrun by abuses, there must be something solid in the basis, admirable in the materials, and stable in the structure of an edifice, that so long has towered unshaken amidst the tempests of the world.\n\nLet it be the pride of our writers, therefore, discarding all feelings of irritation, and disdaining to retaliate the illiberality of British authors, to speak of the English nation without prejudice, and with determined candour. While they rebuke the indiscriminating bigotry with which some of our countrymen admire and imitate everything English, merely because it is English, let them frankly point out what is really worthy of approbation. We may thus place England before us as a perpetual volume of reference, wherein are recorded sound deductions from ages of experience; and while we avoid the errors and absurdities which may have crept into the page, we may draw thence golden maxims of practical wisdom, wherewith to strengthen and to embellish our national character.\n\nRURAL LIFE IN ENGLAND.\n\nOh! friendly to the best pursuits of man,\nFriendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,\nDomestic life in rural pleasures past!\u2014Cowper.\n\nThe stranger who would form a correct opinion of the English character, must not confine his observations to the metropolis. He must go forth into the country; he must sojourn in villages and hamlets; he must visit castles, villas, farm-houses, cottages; he must wander through parks and gardens; along hedges and green lanes; he must loiter about country churches; attend wakes and fairs, and other rural festivals; and cope with the people in all their conditions, and all their habits and humours.\n\nIn some countries the large cities absorb the wealth and fashion of the nation; they are the only fixed abodes of elegant and intelligent society, and the country is inhabited almost entirely by boorish peasantry. In England, on the contrary, the metropolis is a mere gathering-place, or general rendezvous of the polite classes, where they devote a small portion of the year to a hurry of gaiety and dissipation, and having indulged this kind of carnival, retire over the whole rural life. The Englishman lives over the whole neighbourhood.\n\nThe Englishman lives in the country. They possess a keen relish for the soil. This passion for the cities, born of the streets, enters into the rural occupations. The vicinity of the town and seal in the soil of his fruitful success of a few individuals, the din and traffic of the great quarters of London, frequently a bare field, its grass-ploughed and laid out with verdure.\n\nThose who are in an unfavourable state are absorbed in the dissipation that dissipates them. He has, then, leisure. Wherever he goes, there where else; he is wandering, calculating his visits allotted. London, is commonplace, their casual commonplace character\u2014its rush into a flow.\n\nIt is in the natural feeling of duties and negociations, reserve, and collect round.\ncarnival, return again to the apparently more congenial habits of rural life. The various orders of society are therefore diffused over the whole surface of the kingdom, and the most retired neighbourhoods afford specimens of the different ranks.\n\nThe English, in fact, are strongly gifted with the rural feeling. They possess a quick sensibility to the beauties of nature, and a keen relish for the pleasures and employments of the country. This passion seems inherent in them. Even the inhabitants of cities, born and brought up among brick walls and bustling streets, enter with facility into rural habits, and evince a tact for rural occupation. The merchant has his snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis, where he often displays as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of his flower-garden, and the maturing of his fruits, as he does in the conduct of his business and the success of a commercial enterprise. Even those less fortunate individuals, who are doomed to pass their lives in the midst of din and traffic, contrive to have something that shall remind them of the green aspect of nature. In the most dark and dingy quarters of the city, the drawing-room window resembles frequently a bank of flowers; every spot capable of vegetation has its grass-plot and flower-bed; and every square its mimic park, laid out with picturesque taste, and gleaming with refreshing verdure.\n\nThose who see the Englishman only in town are apt to form an unfavourable opinion of his social character. He is either absorbed in business, or distracted by the thousand engagements that dissipate time, thought, and feeling, in this huge metropolis. He has, therefore, too commonly a look of hurry and abstraction. Wherever he happens to be, he is on the point of going somewhere else; at the moment he is talking on one subject, his mind is wandering to another; and while paying a friendly visit, he is calculating how he shall economize time so as to pay the other visits allotted in the morning. An immense metropolis, like London, is calculated to make men selfish and uninteresting. In their casual and transient meetings they can but deal briefly in commonplaces. They present but the cold superficies of character\u2014its rich and genial qualities have no time to be warmed into a flow.\n\nIt is in the country that the Englishman gives scope to his natural feelings. He breaks loose gladly from the cold formalities and negative civilities of town; throws off his habits of shy reserve, and becomes joyous and free-hearted. He manages to collect round him all the conveniences and elegancies of polite\nlife, and to banish its restraints. His country-seat abounds with every requisite, either for studious retirement, tasteful gratification, or rural exercise. Books, paintings, music, horses, dogs, and sporting implements of all kinds, are at hand. He puts no constraint either upon his guests or himself, but in the true spirit of hospitality provides the means of enjoyment, and leaves every one to partake according to his inclination.\n\nThe taste of the English in the cultivation of land, and in what is called landscape gardening, is unrivalled. They have studied nature intently, and discover an exquisite sense of her beautiful forms and harmonious combinations. Those charms, which in other countries she lavishes in wild solitudes, are here assembled round the haunts of domestic life. They seem to have caught her coy and furtive graces, and spread them, like witchery, about their rural abodes.\n\nNothing can be more imposing than the magnificence of English park scenery. Vast lawns that extend like sheets of vivid green, with here and there clumps of gigantic trees, heaping up rich piles of foliage; the solemn pomp of groves and woodland glades, with the deer trooping in silent herds across them; the hare bounding away to the covert; or the pheasant, suddenly bursting upon the wing; the brook, taught to wind in natural meanderings, or expand into a glassy lake; the sequestered pool, reflecting the quivering trees, with the yellow leaf sleeping on its bosom, and the trout roaming fearlessly about its limpid waters, while some rustic temple or sylvan statue, grown green and dank with age, gives an air of classic sanctity to the seclusion.\n\nThese are but a few of the features of park scenery; but what most delights me, is the creative talent with which the English decorate the unostentatious abodes of middle life. The rudest habitation, the most unpromising and scanty portion of land, in the hands of an Englishman of taste, becomes a little paradise. With a nicely discriminating eye, he seizes at once upon its capabilities, and pictures in his mind the future landscape. The sterile spot grows into loveliness under his hand; and yet the operations of art which produce the effect are scarcely to be perceived. The cherishing and training of some trees; the cautious pruning of others; the nice distribution of flowers and plants of tender and graceful foliage; the introduction of a green slope of velvet turf; the partial opening to a peep of blue distance, or silver gleam of water: all these are managed with a delicate tact, a pervading yet quiet assiduity, like the magic touchings with which a painter finishes up a favourite picture.\n\nThe residence in the country has been the economy, that with his that their embellishing door, the little trained up a lattice, the planted about throw in a set these bespeak sources, and ever Love, and the cottage of\n\nThe fondness English has character. gentlemen. characterize the of elegance and complexion, much in the recreations of a healthful simplicity of manner town cannot country, too, freely, to be each other. so marked which property has established the classes of farmers, down banded the intermediate confessed, is formerly; the absorbed the annihilated I believe, are mentioned.\n\nIn rural o\nThe residence of people of fortune and refinement in the country has diffused a degree of taste and elegance in rural economy, that descends to the lowest class. The very labourer, with his thatched cottage and narrow slip of ground, attends to their embellishment. The trim hedge, the grass-plot before the door, the little flower-bed bordered with snug box, the woodbine trained up against the wall, and hanging its blossoms about the lattice, the pot of flowers in the window, the holly, providentially planted about the house, to cheat winter of its dreariness, and to throw in a semblance of green summer to cheer the fireside: all these bespeak the influence of taste, flowing down from high sources, and pervading the lowest levels of the public mind. If ever Love, as poets sing, delights to visit a cottage, it must be the cottage of an English peasant.\n\nThe fondness for rural life among the higher classes of the English has had a great and salutary effect upon the national character. I do not know a finer race of men than the English gentlemen. Instead of the softness and effeminacy which characterize the men of rank in most countries, they exhibit a union of elegance and strength, a robustness of frame and freshness of complexion, which I am inclined to attribute to their living so much in the open air, and pursuing so eagerly the invigorating recreations of the country. These hardy exercises produce also a healthful tone of mind and spirits, and a manliness and simplicity of manners, which even the follies and dissipations of the town cannot easily pervert, and can never entirely destroy. In the country, too, the different orders of society seem to approach more freely, to be more disposed to blend and operate favourably upon each other. The distinctions between them do not appear to be so marked and impassable as in the cities. The manner in which property has been distributed into small estates and farms has established a regular gradation from the nobleman, through the classes of gentry, small landed proprietors, and substantial farmers, down to the labouring peasantry; and while it has thus banded the extremes of society together, has infused into each intermediate rank a spirit of independence. This, it must be confessed, is not so universally the case at present as it was formerly; the larger estates having, in late years of distress, absorbed the smaller; and, in some parts of the country, almost annihilated the sturdy race of small farmers. These, however, I believe, are but casual breaks in the general system I have mentioned.\n\nIn rural occupation there is nothing mean and debasing. It\nleads a man forth among scenes of natural grandeur and beauty; it leaves him to the workings of his own mind, operated upon by the purest and most elevating of external influences. Such a man may be simple and rough, but he cannot be vulgar. The man of refinement, therefore, finds nothing revolting in an intercourse with the lower orders in rural life, as he does when he casually mingles with the lower orders of cities. He lays aside his distance and reserve, and is glad to waive the distinctions of rank, and to enter into the honest, heartfelt enjoyments of common life. Indeed, the very amusements of the country bring men more and more together; and the sound of hound and horn blend all feelings into harmony. I believe this is one great reason why the nobility and gentry are more popular among the inferior orders in England than they are in any other country; and why the latter have endured so many excessive pressures and extremities, without repining more generally at the unequal distribution of fortune and privilege.\n\nTo this mingling of cultivated and rustic society may also be attributed the rural feeling that runs through British literature; the frequent use of illustrations from rural life; those incomparable descriptions of nature that abound in the British poets, that have continued down from \"the Flower and the Leaf\" of Chaucer, and have brought into our closets all the freshness and fragrance of the dewy landscape. The pastoral writers of other countries appear as if they had paid nature an occasional visit, and become acquainted with her general charms; but the British poets have lived and revelled with her\u2014they have wooed her in her most secret haunts\u2014they have watched her minutest caprices. A spray could not tremble in the breeze\u2014a leaf could not rustle to the ground\u2014a diamond drop could not patter in the stream\u2014a fragrance could not exhale from the humble violet, nor a daisy unfold its crimson tints to the morning, but it has been noticed by these impassioned and delicate observers, and wrought up into some beautiful morality.\n\nThe effect of this devotion of elegant minds to rural occupations has been wonderful on the face of the country. A great part of the island is rather level, and would be monotonous, were it not for the charms of culture: but it is studded and gemmed, as it were, with castles and palaces, and embroidered with parks and gardens. It does not abound in grand and sublime prospects, but rather in little home scenes of rural repose and sheltered quiet. Every antique farm-house and moss-grown cottage is a picture; and as the roads are continually winding, and the views are varied, the traveller is delighted by the contemplation of the most captivating love scenes.\n\nThe greatest charm of the English landscape is the feeling that the whole is filled with life and movement, with ideas of action and thought. The principles, of honesty and simplicity, seem to be the groundwork of the national character; the old church or the ancient castle, with its Gothic towers, its massive walls, its windows in scrupulous proportion, are worthy of the soil; its tombs are the sepulchres of the yeomanry, who have died in the same attitude as their ancestors, antiquated, but still vigorous; the owner and occupant of the house, the lord of the yard, across pasture and meadow, rising to an imposing height, with its venerable trees, under which the peasant worships the antique fates of the rural domain, but looking down on a peaceful scene: all this is a calm and serene picture of the bred virtues and the kindly feelings for the poor.\n\nIt is this spirit of benevolence that is sending its influence over the peasantry in the form of cheerfulness, and the prosperity of the church; but it is not confined to gathering about the altar; it has spread to the humble cottages, and has there have spread a like influence.\n\nIt is this spirit of benevolence that is sending its influence over the peasantry in the form of cheerfulness, and the prosperity of the church; but it is not confined to gathering about the altar; it has spread to the humble cottages, and there have spread a like influence.\n\nIt is this spirit of benevolence that is sending its influence over the peasantry in the form of cheerfulness, and the prosperity of the church; but it is not confined to gathering about the altar; it has spread to the humble cottages, and there have spread a like influence.\nand the view is shut in by groves and hedges, the eye is delighted by a continual succession of small landscapes of captivating loveliness.\n\nThe great charm, however, of English scenery is the moral feeling that seems to pervade it. It is associated in the mind with ideas of order, of quiet, of sober, well-established principles, of hoary usage and reverend custom. Everything seems to be the growth of ages of regular and peaceful existence. The old church of remote architecture, with its low, massive portal, its Gothic tower, its windows rich with tracery and painted glass, in scrupulous preservation, its stately monuments of warriors and worthies of the olden time, ancestors of the present lords of the soil; its tombstones, recording successive generations of sturdy yeomanry, whose progeny still plough the same fields, and kneel at the same altar\u2014the parsonage, a quaint, irregular pile, partly antiquated, but repaired and altered in the tastes of various ages and occupants\u2014the stile and footpath leading from the churchyard, across pleasant fields, and along shady hedge-rows, according to an immemorial right of way\u2014the neighbouring village, with its venerable cottages, its public green sheltered by trees, under which the forefathers of the present race have sported\u2014the antique family mansion, standing apart in some little rural domain, but looking down with a protecting air on the surrounding scene: all these common features of English landscape evince a calm and settled security, and hereditary transmission of home-bred virtues and local attachments, that speak deeply and touchingly for the moral character of the nation.\n\nIt is a pleasing sight of a Sunday morning, when the bell is sending its sober melody across the quiet fields, to behold the peasantry in their best finery, with ruddy faces and modest cheerfulness, thronging tranquilly along the green lanes to church; but it is still more pleasing to see them in the evenings, gathering about their cottage doors, and appearing to exult in the humble comforts and embellishments which their own hands have spread around them.\n\nIt is this sweet home-feeling, this settled repose of affection in the domestic scene, that is, after all, the parent of the steadiest virtues and purest enjoyments; and I cannot close these desultory remarks better than by quoting the words of a modern English poet, who has depicted it with remarkable felicity:\n\nThrough each gradation, from the castle hall,\nThe city dome, the villa crowned with shade,\nBut chief from modest mansions numberless,\nIn town or hamlet, shelting middle life,\nTHE BROKEN HEART.\n\nI never heard\nOf any true affection, but 'twas nipt\nWith care, that, like the caterpillar, eats\nThe leaves of the spring's sweetest book\u2014the rose.\u2014MIDDLETON.\n\nIt is a common practice with those who have outlived the susceptibility of early feeling, or have been brought up in the gay heartlessness of dissipated life, to laugh at all love stories, and to treat the tales of romantic passion as mere fictions of novelists and poets. My observations on human nature have induced me to think otherwise. They have convinced me, that however the surface of the character may be chilled and frozen by the cares of the world, or cultivated into mere smiles by the arts of society, still there are dormant fires lurking in the depths of the coldest bosom, which, when once enkindled, become impetuous, and are sometimes desolating in their effects. Indeed, I am a true believer in the blind deity, and go to the full extent of his doctrines. Shall I confess it?\u2014I believe in broken hearts, and the possibility of dying of disappointed love. I do not, however, consider it a malady often fatal to my own sex; but I firmly believe that it withers down many a lovely woman into an early grave.\n\nMan is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but the embellishment of his early life, or a song piped in the intervals of the acts. He seeks for fame, for fortune, for space in the world's thought, and dominion over his fellow-men. But a woman's whole life is a history of the affections. The heart is her world: it is there her ambition strives for empire; it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures. She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless\u2014for it is a bankruptcy of the heart.\n\nTo a man the disappointment of love may occasion some bitter pangs: it will be but a momentary pang, and he will turn to the prospects of future success. But to a woman, the wound will fix its root in her thoughts, and she will be driven by it into a state of mind full of painful sensations. She will regard the object of her affection as taking it with her, and will be unable to forget it. It will be the most parts of her life.\n\nBut women are more susceptible than men to the influence of love. She is more easily moved by the tenderest feelings; and if the object of her affection prove unfaithful, she will look for consolation in the arms of another. She will be left unhappy in her situation, and will be unable to forget the one she has captured, and the one she has lost.\n\nHow many a woman's life is a tale of woe! How many a woman pale\u2014how many a woman's beauty fades! How many a woman can tell the cause of her sorrow? How many a woman's heart will clasp its treasure close, and bury it in the recesses of her soul, that is preying upon her peace? How many a woman's life is ruined from the world's neglect! How many a woman's heart is broken by the delicate female feelings! How many a woman's life is a tale of woe! She scarcely begins to feel the influence of the worm which has taken root in the recesses of her soul, and which is slowly consuming her life among the ruins of her former happiness. How many a woman's life has failed. The worm has eaten away the very foundation of her existence, and she is left to wander through the world, a prey to the worm which has destroyed her peace. How many a woman's life is a tale of woe! How many a woman's heart is filled with the worm which has destroyed her peace! How many a woman's life is a tale of woe!\n\nShe is like a tree in a lonely grove; graceful and beautiful, yet the worm preying upon its roots, and it should be removed before it destroys the branches to the root.\npangs: it wounds some feelings of tenderness\u2014it blasts some prospects of felicity; but he is an active being\u2014he may dissipate his thoughts in the whirl of varied occupation, or may plunge into a tide of pleasure; or, if the scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations, he can shift his abode at will, and taking as it were the wings of the morning, can \"fly to the uttermost parts of the earth, and be at rest.\"\n\nBut woman's is comparatively a fixed, a secluded, and meditative life. She is more the companion of her own thoughts and feelings; and if they are turned to ministers of sorrow, where shall she look for consolation? Her lot is to be wooed and won; and if unhappy in her love, her heart is like some fortress that has been captured, and sacked, and abandoned, and left desolate.\n\nHow many bright eyes grow dim\u2014how many soft cheeks grow pale\u2014how many lovely forms fade away into the tomb, and none can tell the cause that blighted their loveliness! As the dove will clasp its wings to its side, and cover and conceal the arrow that is preying on its vitals, so is it the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs of wounded affection. The love of a delicate female is always shy and silent. Even when fortunate, she scarcely breathes it to herself; but when otherwise, she buries it in the recesses of her bosom, and there lets it cower and brood among the ruins of her peace. With her the desire of the heart has failed. The great charm of existence is at an end. She neglects all the cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits, quicken the pulses, and send the tide of life in healthful currents through the veins. Her rest is broken\u2014the sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy dreams\u2014\"dry sorrow drinks her blood,\" until her enfeebled frame sinks under the slightest external injury. Look for her, after a little while, and you find friendship weeping over her untimely grave, and wondering that one, who but lately glowed with all the radiance of health and beauty, should so speedily be brought down to \"darkness and the worm.\" You will be told of some wintry chill, some casual indisposition, that laid her low;\u2014but no one knows of the mental malady which previously sapped her strength, and made her so easy a prey to the spoiler.\n\nShe is like some tender tree, the pride and beauty of the grove; graceful in its form, bright in its foliage, but with the worm preying at its heart. We find it suddenly withering, when it should be most fresh and luxuriant. We see it drooping its branches to the earth, and shedding leaf by leaf, until, wasted...\nand perished away, it falls even in the stillness of the forest; and as we muse over the beautiful ruin, we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt that could have smitten it with decay.\n\nI have seen many instances of women running to waste and self-neglect, and disappearing gradually from the earth, almost as if they had been exhaled to heaven; and have repeatedly fancied that I could trace their death through the various declensions of consumption, cold, debility, languor, melancholy, until I reached the first symptoms of disappointed love. But an instance of the kind was lately told to me; the circumstances are well known in the country where they happened, and I shall but give them in the manner in which they were related.\n\nEvery one must recollect the tragic story of young E\u2014\u2014, the Irish patriot; it was too touching to be soon forgotten. During the troubles in Ireland, he was tried, condemned; and executed on a charge of treason. His fate made a deep impression on public sympathy. He was so young\u2014so intelligent\u2014so generous\u2014so brave\u2014so everything that we are apt to like in a young man. His conduct under trial, too, was so lofty and intrepid. The noble indignation with which he repelled the charge of treason against his country\u2014the eloquent vindication of his name\u2014and his pathetic appeal to posterity, in the hopeless hour of condemnation\u2014all these entered deeply into every generous bosom, and even his enemies lamented the stern policy that dictated his execution.\n\nBut there was one heart whose anguish it would be impossible to describe. In happier days and fairer fortunes he had won the affections of a beautiful and interesting girl, the daughter of a late celebrated Irish barrister. She loved him with the disinterested fervour of a woman's first and early love. When every worldly maxim arrayed itself against him; when blasted in fortune, and disgrace and danger darkened around his name, she loved him the more ardently for his very sufferings. If, then, his fate could awaken the sympathy even of his foes, what must have been the agony of her, whose whole soul was occupied by his image! Let those tell who have had the portals of the tomb suddenly closed between them and the being they most loved on earth\u2014who have sat at its threshold, as one shut out in a cold and lonely world, whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed.\n\nBut then the horrors of such a grave! so frightful, so dishonoured! there was nothing for memory to dwell on that could soothe the pang of separation\u2014none of those tender though melancholy circumstances, which endear the parting scene\u2014nothing to melt sorrow into joy, or to revive the dead.\nmelt sorrow into those blessed tears, sent like the dews of heaven to revive the heart in the parting hour of anguish.\n\nTo render her widowed situation more desolate, she had incurred her father's displeasure by her unfortunate attachment, and was an exile from the paternal roof. But could the sympathy and kind offices of friends have reached a spirit so shocked and driven in by horror, she would have experienced no want of consolation, for the Irish are a people of quick and generous sensibilities. The most delicate and cherishing attentions were paid her by families of wealth and distinction. She was led into society, and they tried by all kinds of occupation and amusement to dissipate her grief, and wean her from the tragical story of her love. But it was all in vain. There are some strokes of calamity which scathe and scorch the soul\u2014which penetrate to the vital seat of happiness\u2014and blast it, never again to put forth bud or blossom. She never objected to frequent the haunts of pleasure, but was as much alone there as in the depths of solitude; walking about in a sad reverie, apparently unconscious of the world around her. She carried with her an inward woe that mocked at all the blandishments of friendship, and \"heeded not the song of the charmer, charm he never so wisely.\"\n\nThe person who told me her story had seen her at a masquerade. There can be no exhibition of far-gone wretchedness more striking and painful than to meet in such a scene. To find it wandering like a spectre, lonely and joyless, where all around is gay\u2014to see it dressed out in the trappings of mirth, and looking so wan and woe-begone, as if it had tried in vain to cheat the poor heart into a momentary forgetfulness of sorrow. After strolling through the splendid rooms and giddy crowd with an air of utter abstraction, she sat herself down on the steps of an orchestra, and, looking about for some time with a vacant air, that showed her insensibility to the garish scene, she began, with the capriciousness of a sickly heart, to warble a little plaintive air. She had an exquisite voice; but on this occasion it was so simple, so touching, it breathed forth such a soul of wretchedness, that she drew a crowd mute and silent around her, and melted every one into tears.\n\nThe story of one so true and tender could not but excite great interest in a country remarkable for enthusiasm. It completely won the heart of a brave officer, who paid his addresses to her, and thought that one so true to the dead could not but prove affectionate to the living. She declined his attentions; for her\nthoughts were irrevocably engrossed by the memory of her former lover. He, however, persisted in his suit. He solicited not her tenderness, but her esteem. He was assisted by her conviction of his worth, and her sense of her own destitute and dependent situation, for she was existing on the kindness of friends. In a word, he at length succeeded in gaining her hand, though with the solemn assurance that her heart was unalterably another's.\n\nHe took her with him to Sicily, hoping that a change of scene might wear out the remembrance of early woes. She was an amiable and exemplary wife, and made an effort to be a happy one; but nothing could cure the silent and devouring melancholy that had entered into her very soul. She wasted away in a slow, but hopeless decline, and at length sunk into the grave, the victim of a broken heart.\n\nIt was on her that Moore, the distinguished Irish poet, composed the following lines:\n\nShe is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,\nAnd lovers around her are sighing:\nBut sadly she turns from their gaze, and weeps,\nFor her heart in his grave is lying.\nShe sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,\nEvery note which he loved awakening\u2014\nAh! little they think, who delight in her strains,\nHow the heart of the minstrel is breaking!\nHe had lived for his love, for his country he died\u2014\nThey were all that to life had entwined him\u2014\nNor soon shall the tears of his country be dried,\nNor long will his love stay behind him!\nOh! make her a grave where the sunbeams rest,\nWhen they promise a glorious morrow;\nThey'll shine o'er her sleep, like a smile from the west,\nFrom her own loved island of sorrow!\n\nTHE ART OF BOOK-MAKING.\n\nIf that severe doom of Synesius be true\u2014\"It is a greater offence to steal dead men's labour than their clothes,\"\u2014what shall become of most writers?\u2014BURTON'S ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY.\n\nI have often wondered at the extreme fecundity of the press, and how it comes to pass that so many heads, on which nature seemed to have inflicted the curse of barrenness, should teem with voluminous productions. As a man travels on, however, in the journey of life, his objects of wonder daily diminish, and he is continually finding out some very simple cause for some great matter of marvel. Thus have I chanced, in my peregrinations about this great metropolis, to blunder upon a scene which unfolded to me some of the mysteries of the book-making craft, and at once put an end to my astonishment.\nI was one summer's day loitering through the great saloons of the British Museum, with that listlessness with which one is apt to saunter about a museum in warm weather; sometimes lolling over the glass cases of minerals, sometimes studying the hieroglyphics on an Egyptian mummy, and sometimes trying, with nearly equal success, to comprehend the allegorical paintings on the lofty ceilings. Whilst I was gazing about in this idle way, my attention was attracted to a distant door, at the end of a suite of apartments. It was closed, but every now and then it would open, and some strange-favoured being, generally clothed in black, would steal forth, and glide through the rooms, without noticing any of the surrounding objects. There was an air of mystery about this that piqued my languid curiosity, and I determined to attempt the passage of that strait, and to explore the unknown regions beyond. The door yielded to my hand, with that facility with which the portals of enchanted castles yield to the adventurous knight-errant. I found myself in a spacious chamber, surrounded with great cases of venerable books. Above the cases, and just under the cornice, were arranged a great number of black-looking portraits of ancient authors. About the room were placed long tables, with stands for reading and writing, at which sat many pale, studious personages, poring intently over dusty volumes, rummaging among mouldy manuscripts, and taking copious notes of their contents. A hushed stillness reigned through this mysterious apartment, excepting that you might hear the racing of pens over sheets of paper, or occasionally, the deep sigh of one of these sages, as he shifted his position to turn over the page of an old folio; doubtless arising from that hollowness and flatulency incident to learned research.\n\nNow and then one of these personages would write something on a small slip of paper, and ring a bell, whereupon a familiar would appear, take the paper in profound silence, glide out of the room, and return shortly loaded with ponderous tomes, upon which the other would fall tooth and nail with famished voracity. I had no longer a doubt that I had happened upon a body of magi, deeply engaged in the study of occult sciences. The scene reminded me of an old Arabian tale, of a philosopher shut up in an enchanted library, in the bosom of a mountain, which opened only once a year; where he made the spirits of the place bring him books of all kinds of dark knowledge, so that at the end of the year, when the magic portal once more swung open on its hinges, he issued forth so versed in forbidden lore, as to be able\nto soar above the heads of the multitude, and to control the powers of nature.\n\nMy curiosity being now fully aroused, I whispered to one of the familiars, as he was about to leave the room, and begged an interpretation of the strange scene before me. A few words were sufficient for the purpose. I found that these mysterious personages, whom I had mistaken for magi, were principally authors, and in the very act of manufacturing books. I was, in fact, in the reading-room of the great British Library\u2014an immense collection of volumes of all ages and languages, many of which are now forgotten, and most of which are seldom read: one of these sequestered pools of obsolete literature, to which modern authors repair, and draw buckets full of classic lore, or \"pure English, undefiled,\" wherewith to swell their own scanty rills of thought.\n\nBeing now in possession of the secret, I sat down in a corner, and watched the process of this book manufactory. I noticed one lean, bilious-looking wight, who sought none but the most worm-eaten volumes, printed in black-letter. He was evidently constructing some work of profound erudition, that would be purchased by every man who wished to be thought learned, placed upon a conspicuous shelf of his library, or laid open upon his table, but never read. I observed him, now and then, draw a large fragment of biscuit out of his pocket, and gnaw; whether it was dinner, or whether he was endeavouring to keep off that exhaustion of the stomach produced by much pondering over dry works, I leave to harder students than myself to determine.\n\nThere was one dapper little gentleman in bright-coloured clothes, with a chirping, gossiping expression of countenance, who had all the appearance of an author on good terms with his bookseller. After considering him attentively, I recognized in him a diligent getter-up of miscellaneous works, which bustled off well with the trade. I was curious to see how he manufactured his wares. He made more stir and show of business than any of the others; dipping into various books, fluttering over the leaves of manuscripts, taking a morsel out of one, a morsel out of another, \"line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\" The contents of his book seemed to be as heterogeneous as those of the witches' caldron in Macbeth. It was here a finger and there a thumb, toe of frog and blind-worm's sting, with his own gossip poured in like \"baboon's blood,\" to make the medley \"slab and good.\"\n\nAfter all, thought I, may not this pilfering disposition be implanted in authors for wise purposes; may it not be the way\nin which Providence has taken care that the seeds of knowledge and wisdom shall be preserved from age to age, in spite of the inevitable decay of the works in which they were first produced? We see that nature has wisely, though whimsically, provided for the conveyance of seeds from clime to clime, in the maws of certain birds; so that animals which, in themselves, are little better than carrion, and apparently the lawless plunderers of the orchard and the cornfield, are, in fact, nature's carriers, to disperse and perpetuate her blessings. In like manner, the beauties and fine thoughts of ancient and obsolete authors are caught up by these flights of predatory writers, and cast forth again to flourish and bear fruit in a remote and distant tract of time. Many of their works, also, undergo a kind of metempsychosis, and spring up under new forms. What was formerly a ponderous history, revives in the shape of a romance\u2014an old legend changes into a modern play\u2014and a sober philosophical treatise furnishes the body for a whole series of bouncing and sparkling essays. Thus it is in the clearing of our American woodlands; where we burn down a forest of stately pines, a progeny of dwarf oaks start up in their place; and we never see the prostrate trunk of a tree mouldering into soil, but it gives birth to a whole tribe of fungi.\n\nLet us not, then, lament over the decay and oblivion into which ancient writers descend; they do but submit to the great law of nature, which declares that all sublunary shapes of matter shall be limited in their duration, but which decrees, also, that their elements shall never perish. Generation after generation, both in animal and vegetable life, passes away, but the vital principle is transmitted to posterity, and the species continue to flourish. Thus, also, do authors beget authors, and having produced a numerous progeny, in a good old age they sleep with their fathers, that is to say, with the authors who preceded them and from whom they had stolen.\n\nWhilst I was indulging in these rambling fancies, I had leaned my head against a pile of reverend folios. Whether it was owing to the soporific emanations from these works; or to the profound quiet of the room; or to the languor arising from much wandering; or to an unlucky habit of napping at improper times and places, with which I am grievously afflicted\u2014so it was, that I fell into a doze. Still, however, my imagination continued busy, and indeed the same scene remained before my mind's eye, only a little changed in some of the details. I dreamt that the chamber was still decorated with the portraits of ancient authors, but that the number was increased. The long tables had disappeared,\nand, in place of the sage magi, I beheld a ragged, threadbare throng, such as may be seen plying about the great repository of cast-off clothes, Monmouth-street. Whenever they seized upon a book, by one of those incongruities common to dreams, methought it turned into a garment of foreign or antique fashion with which they proceeded to equip themselves. I noticed, however, that no one pretended to clothe himself from any particular suit, but took a sleeve from one, a cape from another, a skirt from a third, thus decking himself out piecemeal, while some of his original rags would peep out from among his borrowed finery.\n\nThere was a portly, rosy, well-fed parson, whom I observed ogling several mouldy polemical writers through an eye-glass. He soon contrived to slip on the voluminous mantle of one of the old fathers, and, having purloined the gray beard of another, endeavoured to look exceedingly wise; but the smirking commonplace of his countenance set at naught all the trappings of wisdom. One sickly-looking gentleman was busied embroidering a very flimsy garment with gold thread, drawn out of several old court-dresses of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Another had trimmed himself magnificently from an illuminated manuscript, had stuck a nosegay in his bosom, culled from \"The Paradise of Daintie Devices,\" and, having put Sir Philip Sidney's hat on one side of his head, strutted off with an exquisite air of vulgar elegance. A third, who was but of puny dimensions, had bolstered himself out bravely with the spoils from several obscure tracts of philosophy, so that he had a very imposing front; but he was lamentably tattered in rear, and I perceived that he had patched his small-clothes with scraps of parchment from a Latin author.\n\nThere were some well-dressed gentlemen, it is true, who only helped themselves to a gem or so, which sparkled among their own ornaments, without eclipsing them. Some, too, seemed to contemplate the costumes of the old writers, merely to imbibe their principles of taste, and to catch their air and spirit; but I grieve to say, that too many were apt to array themselves from top to toe, in the patchwork manner I have mentioned. I shall not omit to speak of one genius, in drab breeches and gaiters, and an Arcadian hat, who had a violent propensity to the pastoral, but whose rural wanderings had been confined to the classic haunts of Primrose-hill, and the solitudes of the Regent's-park. He had decked himself in wreaths and ribands from all the old pastoral poets, and, hanging his head on one side, went about with a fantastical lack-a-daisical air, \"babbling about green fields.\" But the personage that most struck my attention\nwas a pragmatical old gentleman, in clerical robes, with a remarkably large and square, but bald head. He entered the room wheezing and puffing, elbowed his way through the throng, with a look of sturdy self-confidence, and, having laid hands upon a thick Greek quarto, clapped it upon his head, and swept majestically away in a formidable frizzled wig.\n\nIn the height of this literary masquerade, a cry suddenly resounded from every side, of \"Thieves! thieves!\" I looked, and lo! the portraits about the wall became animated! The old authors thrust out, first a head, then a shoulder, from the canvas, looked down curiously, for an instant, upon the motley throng, and then descended with fury in their eyes, to claim their rifled property. The scene of scampering and hubbub that ensued baffles all description. The unhappy culprits endeavoured in vain to escape with plunder. On one side might be seen half a dozen old monks, stripping a modern professor; on another, there was sad devastation carried into the ranks of modern dramatic writers. Beaumont and Fletcher, side by side, raged round the field like Castor and Pollux; and sturdy Ben Jonson enacted more wonders than when a volunteer with the army in Flanders. As to the dapper little compiler of farragos, mentioned some time since, he had arrayed himself in as many patches and colours as Harlequin, and there was as fierce a contention of claimants about him, as about the dead body of Patroclus. I was grieved to see many men, to whom I had been accustomed to look up with awe and reverence, fain to steal off with scarce a rag to cover their nakedness. Just then my eye was caught by the pragmatical old gentleman in the Greek grizzled wig, who was scrambling away in sore affright with half a score of authors in full cry after him! They were close upon his haunches: in a twinkling off went his wig; at every turn some strip of raiment was peeled away; until in a few moments, from his domineering pomp, he shrunk into a little, parsy, \"chopped bald shot,\" and made his exit with only a few tags and rags fluttering at his back.\n\nThere was something so ludicrous in the catastrophe of this learned Theban, that I burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, which broke the whole illusion. The tumult and the scuffle were at an end. The chamber resumed its usual appearance. The old authors shrunk back into their picture-frames, and hung in shadowy solemnity along the walls. In short, I found myself wide awake in my corner, with the whole assemblage of bookworms gazing at me with astonishment. Nothing of the dream\nhad been real but my burst of laughter, a sound never before heard in that grave sanctuary, and so abhorrent to the ears of wisdom, as to electrify the fraternity.\n\nThe librarian now stepped up to me, and demanded whether I had a card of admission. At first I did not comprehend him, but I soon found that the library was a kind of literary \"preserve,\" subject to game-laws, and that no one must presume to hunt there without special license and permission. In a word, I stood convicted of being an arrant poacher, and was glad to make a precipitate retreat, lest I should have a whole pack of authors let loose upon me.\n\n---\n\n**A ROYAL POET.**\n\nThough your body be confined,\nAnd soft love a prisoner bound,\nYet the beauty of your mind\nNeither check nor chain hath found.\nLook out nobly, then, and dare\nEven the fetters that you wear.\u2014FLETCHER.\n\nOn a soft sunny morning, in the genial month of May, I made an excursion to Windsor Castle. It is a place full of storied and poetical associations. The very external aspect of the proud old pile is enough to inspire high thought. It rears its irregular walls and massive towers, like a mural crown, round the brow of a lofty ridge, waves its royal banner in the clouds, and looks down with a lordly air upon the surrounding world.\n\nOn this morning the weather was of that voluptuous vernal kind which calls forth all the latent romance of a man's temperament, filling his mind with music, and disposing him to quote poetry and dream of beauty. In wandering through the magnificent saloons and long echoing galleries of the castle, I passed with indifference by whole rows of portraits of warriors and statesmen, but lingered in the chamber where hang the likenesses of the beauties which graced the gay court of Charles the Second, and as I gazed upon them, depicted with amorous half-dishevelled tresses, and the sleepy eye of love, I blessed the pencil of Sir Peter Lely, which had thus enabled me to bask in the reflected rays of beauty. In traversing also the \"large green courts,\" with sunshine beaming on the gray walls, and glancing along the velvet turf, my mind was engrossed with the image of the tender, the gallant, but hapless Surrey, and his account of his loiterings about them in his stripling days, when enamoured of the Lady Geraldine\u2014\n\n\"With eyes cast up unto the maiden's tower,\nWith calm sighs, such as men drew in love.\"\nIn this mood of mere poetical susceptibility, I visited the ancient Keep of the Castle, where James the First of Scotland, the pride and theme of Scottish poets and historians, was for many years of his youth detained a prisoner of state. It is a large gray tower, that has stood the brunt of ages, and is still in good preservation. It stands on a mound which elevates it above the other parts of the castle, and a great flight of steps leads to the interior. In the armory, a Gothic hall, furnished with weapons of various kinds and ages, I was shown a coat of armour hanging against the wall which had once belonged to James. Hence I was conducted up a staircase to a suite of apartments of faded magnificence, hung with storied tapestry, which formed his prison, and the scene of that passionate and fanciful amour which has woven into the web of his story the magical hues of poetry and fiction.\n\nThe whole history of this amiable but unfortunate prince is highly romantic. At the tender age of eleven he was sent from home by his father, Robert III., and destined for the French court, to be reared under the eye of the French monarch, secure from the treachery and danger that surrounded the royal house of Scotland. It was his misfortune in the course of his voyage to fall into the hands of the English, and he was detained prisoner by Henry IV., notwithstanding that a truce existed between the two countries.\n\nThe intelligence of his capture, coming in the train of many sorrows and disasters, proved fatal to his unhappy father. \"The news,\" we are told, \"was brought to him while at supper, and did so overwhelm him with grief, that he was almost ready to give up the ghost into the hands of the servant that attended him. But being carried to his bed-chamber, he abstained from all food, and in three days died of hunger and grief, at Rothesay.\"\n\nJames was detained in captivity above eighteen years; but though deprived of personal liberty, he was treated with the respect due to his rank. Care was taken to instruct him in all the branches of useful knowledge cultivated at that period, and to give him those mental and personal accomplishments deemed proper for a prince. Perhaps, in this respect, his imprisonment was an advantage, as it enabled him to apply himself more exclusively to his improvement, and quietly to imbibe that rich fund of knowledge, and to cherish those elegant tastes which have given such a lustre to his memory. The picture drawn of him in early life by the Scottish historians is highly captivating,\n\n* Buchanan.\nand seems rather the description of a hero of romance, than of a character in real history. He was well learnt, we are told, \"to fight with the sword, to joust, to tournay, to wrestle, to sing and dance; he was an expert mediciner, right crafty in playing both of lute and harp, and sundry other instruments of music, and was expert in grammar, oratory, and poetry.\"*\n\nWith this combination of manly and delicate accomplishments, fitting him to shine both in active and elegant life, and calculated to give him an intense relish for joyous existence, it must have been a severe trial, in an age of bustle and chivalry, to pass the spring-time of his years in monotonous captivity. It was the good fortune of James, however, to be gifted with a powerful poetic fancy, and to be visited in his prison by the choicest inspirations of the muse. Some minds corrode and grow inactive under the loss of personal liberty; others grow morbid and irritable; but it is the nature of the poet to become tender and imaginative in the loneliness of confinement. He banquets upon the honey of his own thoughts, and, like the captive bird, pours forth his soul in melody.\n\nHave you not seen the nightingale,\nA pilgrim coop'd into a cage,\nHow doth she chant her wonted tale,\nIn that her lonely hermitage!\nEven there her charming melody doth prove\nThat all her boughs are trees, her cage a grove.\u2020\n\nIndeed, it is the divine attribute of the imagination, that it is irrepressible, unconfinable; that when the real world is shut out, it can create a world for itself, and with a necromantic power, can conjure up glorious shapes and forms, and brilliant visions, to make solitude populous, and irradiate the gloom of the dungeon. Such was the world of pomp and pageant that lived round Tasso in his dismal cell at Ferrara, when he conceived the splendid scenes of his \"Jerusalem;\" and we may consider the \"King's Quair,\" composed by James during his captivity at Windsor, as another of those beautiful breakings-forth of the soul from the restraint and gloom of the prison-house.\n\nThe subject of the poem is his love for the Lady Jane Beaufort, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, and a princess of the blood royal of England, of whom he became enamoured in the course of his captivity. What gives it a peculiar value is, that it may be considered a transcript of the royal bard's true feelings, and the story of his real loves and fortunes. It is not often that sovereigns write poetry, or that poets deal in fact. It is gratifying to the pride of a common man to find a monarch thus suing,\n\n* Ballenden's Translation of Hector Boyce. \u2020 Roger l'Estrange.\nas it were, for admission into his closet, and seeking to win his favour by administering to his pleasures. It is a proof of the honest equality of intellectual competition, which strips off all the trappings of factitious dignity, brings the candidate down to a level with his fellow-men, and obliges him to depend on his own native powers for distinction. It is curious, too, to get at the history of a monarch's heart, and to find the simple affections of human nature throbbing under the ermine. But James had learnt to be a poet before he was a king; he was schooled in adversity, and reared in the company of his own thoughts. Monarchs have seldom time to parley with their hearts, or to meditate their minds into poetry; and had James been brought up amidst the adulation and gaiety of a court, we should never, in all probability, have had such a poem as the \"Quair.\"\n\nI have been particularly interested by those parts of the poem which breathe his immediate thoughts concerning his situation, or which are connected with the apartment in the tower. They have thus a personal and local charm, and are given with such circumstantial truth, as to make the reader present with the captive in his prison, and the companion of his meditations.\n\nSuch is the account which he gives of his weariness of spirit, and of the incident which first suggested the idea of writing the poem. It was the still midwatch of a clear moonlight night; the stars, he says, were twinkling as fire in the high vault of heaven, and \"Cynthia rinsing her golden locks in Aquarius.\" He lay in bed wakeful and restless, and took a book to beguile the tedious hours. The book he chose was Boetius's \"Consolations of Philosophy,\" a work popular among the writers of that day, and which had been translated by his great prototype Chaucer. From the high eulogium in which he indulges, it is evident this was one of his favourite volumes while in prison; and indeed it is an admirable text-book for meditation under adversity. It is the legacy of a noble and enduring spirit, purified by sorrow and suffering, bequeathing to its successors in calamity the maxims of sweet morality, and the trains of eloquent but simple reasoning by which it was enabled to bear up against the various ills of life. It is a talisman which the unfortunate may treasure up in his bosom, or, like the good King James, lay upon his nightly pillow.\n\nAfter closing the volume, he turns its contents over in his mind, and gradually falls into a fit of musing on the fickleness of fortune, the vicissitudes of his own life, and the evils that had overtaken him even in his tender youth. Suddenly he hears the bell ringing to matins; but its sound, chiming in with his melan-\ncholy fancies, seems to him like a voice exhorting him to write his story. In the spirit of poetic errantry he determines to comply with this intimation; he therefore takes pen in hand, makes with it a sign of the cross to implore a benediction, and sallies forth into the fairy land of poetry. There is something extremely fanciful in all this, and it is interesting as furnishing a striking and beautiful instance of the simple manner in which whole trains of poetical thought are sometimes awakened, and literary enterprises suggested to the mind.\n\nIn the course of his poem he more than once bewails the peculiar hardness of his fate; thus doomed to lonely and inactive life, and shut up from the freedom and pleasure of the world, in which the meanest animal indulges unrestrained. There is a sweetness, however, in his very complaints; they are the lamentations of an amiable and social spirit at being denied the indulgence of its kind and generous propensities; there is nothing in them harsh nor exaggerated; they flow with a natural and touching pathos, and are perhaps rendered more touching by their simple brevity. They contrast finely with those elaborate and iterated repining, which we sometimes meet with in poetry;\u2014the effusions of morbid minds sickening under miseries of their own creating, and venting their bitterness upon an unoffending world. James speaks of his privations with acute sensibility, but having mentioned them, passes on, as if his manly mind disdained to brood over unavoidable calamities. When such a spirit breaks forth into complaint, however brief, we are aware how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur. We sympathise with James, a romantic, active, and accomplished prince, cut off in the lustihood of youth from all the enterprise, the noble uses, and vigorous delights of life; as we do with Milton, alive to all the beauties of nature and glories of art, when he breathes forth brief, but deep-toned lamentations over his perpetual blindness.\n\nHad not James evinced a deficiency of poetical artifice, we might almost have suspected that these lowering of gloomy reflection were meant as preparative to the brightest scene of his story; and to contrast with that refulgence of light and loveliness, that exhilarating accompaniment of bird and song, and foliage and flower, and all the revel of the year, with which he ushers in the lady of his heart. It is this scene, in particular, which throws all the magic of romance about the old castle keep. He had risen, he says, at daybreak, according to custom, to escape from the dreary meditations of a sleepless pillow. \"Be-\n\nwailing in his heart for remedy,\" \"fortifying himself to the window,\" he looked wistfully upon the tower. It was a narrow and green alley, with hawthorn bushes and wild roses growing along it. It was the month of May, and he interpreted the month of his enamoured thoughts.\n\nWorn out by his cares,\n\nAnd pining for his ease,\n\nAs he gazes on the scene before him, he gradually recovers from his reveries, which had been so deep. He wonders what it can be that makes May, and melting spring, be so great a festival to the most insensible of enjoyments?\n\nOh! lovely month of May!\n\nLovely month of May!\n\nHail, lovely month of May!\n\nOr is it only the\n\n\u2022 Lay, person.\n\nNote.\u2014\nwailing in his chamber thus alone,\" despairing of all joy and remedy, \"fortired of thought and wobegone,\" he had wandered to the window, to indulge the captive's miserable solace of gazing wistfully upon the world from which he is excluded. The window looked forth upon a small garden which lay at the foot of the tower. It was a quiet, sheltered spot, adorned with arbours and green alleys, and protected from the passing gaze by trees and hawthorn hedges.\n\nNow was there made, fast by the tower's wall,\nA garden faire, and in the corners set\nAn arbour green, with wandes long and small\nRailed about, and so with leaves beset\nWas all the place, and hawthorn hedges knotted,\nThat lyf was none, walking there forbye\nThat might within scarce any wight spyse.\nSo thick the branches and the leaves green,\nBoth shaded all the alleys that there were,\nAnd midst of every arbour might be seen\nThe sharpe, grene, swete juniper,\nGrowing so fair, with branches here and there,\nThat as it seemed to a lyf without,\nThe boughs did spread the arbour all about.\nAnd on the small grene twistin' set\nThe lytel swete nightingales, and sung\nSo loud and clear, the hymnis consecrate\nOf lovin use, now soft, now loud among,\nThat all the garden and the walls rung\nRight of their song\u2014\n\nIt was the month of May, when everything was in bloom; and he interprets the song of the nightingale into the language of his enamoured feeling:\n\nWorship, all ye that lovers be, this May,\nFor of your bliss the kalends are began,\nAnd sing with us, away, winter, away,\nCome, summer, come, the sweet season and sun.\n\nAs he gazes on the scene, and listens to the notes of the birds, he gradually relapses into one of those tender and undefinable reveries, which fill the youthful bosom in this delicious season. He wonders what this love may be, of which he has so often read, and which thus seems breathed forth in the quickening breath of May, and melting all nature into ecstasy and song. If it really be so great a felicity, and if it be a boon thus generally dispensed to the most insignificant beings, why is he alone cut off from its enjoyments?\n\nOft would I think, O Lord, what may this be,\nThat love is of such noble myght and kynde?\nLoving his folke, and such prosperites.\nIs it of him, as we in booke do find:\nMay he ware hertes netten? and unhayed:\nHath he upon our hertes such maiestye?\nOr is all this but feynit fatastye?\n\n* Lyt, person. \u2020 Twigs, small boughs or twigs. \u2021 Setten, incline.\n\nNote.\u2014The language of the quotations is generally modernized.\nFor gift he be of so greate excellence,\nThat he of every wight hath care and charge,\nWhat have I gilt* to him, or done offense,\nThat I am thrall'd, and birds go at large?\n\nIn the midst of his musing, as he casts his eye downward, he beholds \"the fairest and the freshest young floure\" that ever he had seen. It is the lovely Lady Jane, walking in the garden to enjoy the beauty of that \"fresh May morrowe.\" Breaking thus suddenly upon his sight, in the moment of loneliness and excited susceptibility, she at once captivates the fancy of the romantic prince, and becomes the object of his wandering wishes, the sovereign of his ideal world.\n\nThere is, in this charming scene, an evident resemblance to the early part of Chaucer's Knight's Tale; where Palamon and Arcite fall in love with Emilia, whom they see walking in the garden of their prison. Perhaps the similarity of the actual fact to the incident which he had read in Chaucer may have induced James to dwell on it in his poem. His description of the Lady Jane is given in the picturesque and minute manner of his master; and being doubtless taken from the life, is a perfect portrait of a beauty of that day. He dwells, with the fondness of a lover, on every article of her apparel, from the net of pearl, splendent with emeralds and sapphires, that confined her golden hair, even to the \"goodly chaine of small orfeverye\"\u2020 about her neck, whereby there hung a ruby in shape of a heart, that seemed, he says, like a spark of fire burning upon her white bosom. Her dress of white tissue was looped up to enable her to walk with more freedom. She was accompanied by two female attendants, and about her sported a little hound decorated with bells; probably the small Italian hound of exquisite symmetry, which was a parlour favourite and a pet among the fashionable dames of ancient times. James closes his description by a burst of general eulogium:\n\nIn her was youth, beauty, with humble port,\nBounty, riches, and womanly feature;\nGod better know than my pen can report,\nWisdom, largesse, estate,\u2021 and cunning, sure,\nIn every point so guided her measure,\nIn word, in deed, in shape, in countenance,\nThat Nature might no more her child advance.\n\nThe departure of the Lady Jane from the garden puts an end to this transient riot of the heart. With her departs the amorous illusion that had shed a temporary charm over the scene of his captivity, and he relapses into loneliness, now rendered tenfold more intolerable by this passing beam of unattainable beauty.\n\n* Gift, what injury have I done, &c.\n\u2020 Wrought gold. \u2021 Largesse, bounty. \u00a7 Estate, dignity. \u00a7 Cunning, discretion.\nThrough the long and weary day he repines at his unhappy lot; and when evening approaches, and Phoebus, as he beautifully expresses it, had \"bade farewell to every leaf and flower,\" he still lingers at the window, and, laying his head upon the cold stone, gives vent to a mingled flow of love and sorrow, until, gradually lulled by the mute melancholy of the twilight hour, he lapses, \"half sleeping, half swoon,\" into a vision, which occupies the remainder of the poem, and in which is allegorically shadowed out the history of his passion.\n\nWhen he wakes from his trance, he rises from his stony pillow, and, pacing his apartment, full of dreary reflections, questions his spirit whither it has been wandering; whether, indeed, all that has passed before his dreaming fancy has been conjured up by preceding circumstances; or whether it is a vision, intended to comfort and assure him in his despondency. If the latter, he prays that some token may be sent to confirm the promise of happier days, given him in his slumbers. Suddenly, a turtle-dove, of the purest whiteness, comes flying in at the window, and alights upon his hand, bearing in her bill a branch of red gillyflower, on the leaves of which is written, in letters of gold, the following sentence:\n\nAwake! awake! I bring, loves, I bring\nThe news glad that blissful is, and sure\nOf thy comfort; now laugh, and play, and sing,\nFor in the heaven decrees is thy cure.\n\nHe receives the branch with mingled hope and dread; reads it with rapture: and this, he says, was the first token of his succeeding happiness. Whether this is a mere poetic fiction, or whether the Lady Jane did actually send him a token of her favour in this romantic way, remains to be determined according to the faith or fancy of the reader. He concludes his poem by intimating that the promise conveyed in the vision and by the flower is fulfilled, by his being restored to liberty, and made happy in the possession of the sovereign of his heart.\n\nSuch is the poetical account given by James of his love-adventures in Windsor Castle. How much of it is absolute fact, and how much the embellishment of fancy, it is fruitless to conjecture: let us not, however, reject every romantic incident as incompatible with real life; but let us sometimes take a poet at his word. I have noticed merely those parts of the poem immediately connected with the tower, and have passed over a large part, written in the allegorical vein, so much cultivated at that day. The language, of course, is quaint and antiquated, so that\nthe beauty of many of its golden phrases will scarcely be perceived at the present day; but it is impossible not to be charmed with the genuine sentiment, the delightful artlessness and urbanity, which prevail throughout it. The descriptions of nature, too, with which it is embellished, are given with a truth, a discrimination, and a freshness, worthy of the most cultivated periods of the art.\n\nAs an amatory poem, it is edifying in these days of coarser thinking, to notice the nature, refinement, and exquisite delicacy which pervade it; banishing every gross thought or immodest expression, and presenting female loveliness, clothed in all its chivalrous attributes of almost supernatural purity and grace.\n\nJames flourished nearly about the time of Chaucer and Gower, and was evidently an admirer and studier of their writings. Indeed, in one of his stanzas he acknowledges them as his masters; and in some parts of his poem we find traces of similarity to their productions, more especially to those of Chaucer. There are always, however, general features of resemblance in the works of contemporary authors, which are not so much borrowed from each other as from the times. Writers, like bees, toll their sweets in the wide world; they incorporate with their own conceptions the anecdotes and thoughts current in society; and thus each generation has some features in common, characteristic of the age in which it lived.\n\nJames belongs to one of the most brilliant eras of our literary history, and establishes the claims of his country to a participation in its primitive honours. Whilst a small cluster of English writers are constantly cited as the fathers of our verse, the name of their great Scottish compeer is apt to be passed over in silence; but he is evidently worthy of being enrolled in that little constellation of remote but never-failing luminaries, who shine in the highest firmament of literature, and who, like morning-stars, sang together at the bright dawning of British poetry.\n\nSuch of my readers as may not be familiar with Scottish history (though the manner in which it has of late been woven with captivating fiction has made it a universal study) may be curious to learn something of the subsequent history of James, and the fortunes of his love. His passion for the Lady Jane, as it was the solace of his captivity, so it facilitated his release, it being imagined by the court that a connexion with the blood-royal of England would attach him to its own interests. He was ultimately restored to his liberty and crown, having previously espoused the Lady Jane, who accompanied him to Scotland, and made him a most tender and devoted wife.\n\nHe found himself having taken long interregnums, and place them to found the best. He attached the temperate movement of the arts, could diffuse comfort to the humblest rank of the common people into their career, himself of the patronized and watching with Having in this case of the common factious nobility, which they had flagrant offence to the crown. mission, but when conspiracy was which was his being too old instigated his Robert Graham.

The suit of armour was polished, as if to be gallant and robustly paced the deserted streets, leaned upon the\nHe found his kingdom in great confusion, the feudal chieftains having taken advantage of the troubles and irregularities of a long interregnum to strengthen themselves in their possessions, and place themselves above the power of the laws. James sought to found the basis of his power in the affections of his people. He attached the lower orders to him by the reformation of abuses, the temperate and equable administration of justice, the encouragement of the arts of peace, and the promotion of everything that could diffuse comfort, competency, and innocent enjoyment through the humblest ranks of society. He mingled occasionally among the common people in disguise; visited their firesides; entered into their cares, their pursuits, and their amusements; informed himself of the mechanical arts, and how they could best be patronized and improved; and was thus an all-pervading spirit, watching with a benevolent eye over the meanest of his subjects. Having in this generous manner made himself strong in the hearts of the common people, he turned himself to curb the power of the factious nobility; to strip them of those dangerous immunities which they had usurped; to punish such as had been guilty of flagrant offences; and to bring the whole into proper obedience to the crown. For some time they bore this with outward submission, but with secret impatience and brooding resentment. A conspiracy was at length formed against his life, at the head of which was his own uncle, Robert Stewart, Earl of Athol, who, being too old himself for the perpetration of the deed of blood, instigated his grandson, Sir Robert Stewart, together with Sir Robert Graham, and others of less note, to commit the deed. They broke into his bedchamber at the Dominican Convent, near Perth, where he was residing, and barbarously murdered him by oft-repeated wounds. His faithful queen, rushing to throw her tender body between him and the sword, was twice wounded in the ineffectual attempt to shield him from the assassin; and it was not until she had been forcibly torn from his person, that the murder was accomplished.\n\nIt was the recollection of this romantic tale of former times, and of the golden little poem which had its birthplace in this tower, that made me visit the old pile with more than common interest. The suit of armour hanging up in the hall, richly gilt and embellished, as if to figure in the tournay, brought the image of the gallant and romantic prince vividly before my imagination. I paced the deserted chambers where he had composed his poem; I leaned upon the window, and endeavoured to persuade myself it\nwas the very one where he had been visited by his vision; I looked out upon the spot where he had first seen the Lady Jane. It was the same genial and joyous month; the birds were again vying with each other in strains of liquid melody; everything was bursting into vegetation, and budding forth the tender promise of the year. Time, which delights to obliterate the sterner memorials of human pride, seems to have passed lightly over this little scene of poetry and love, and to have withheld his desolating hand. Several centuries have gone by, yet the garden still flourishes at the foot of the tower. It occupies what was once the moat of the keep; and though some parts have been separated by dividing walls, yet others have still their arbours and shaded walks, as in the days of James, and the whole is sheltered, blooming, and retired. There is a charm about a spot that has been printed by the footsteps of departed beauty, and consecrated by the inspirations of the poet, which is heightened, rather than impaired, by the lapse of ages. It is, indeed, the gift of poetry to hallow every place in which it moves; to breathe around nature an odour more exquisite than the perfume of the rose, and to shed over it a tint more magical than the blush of morning.\n\nOthers may dwell on the illustrious deeds of James as a warrior and a legislator; but I have delighted to view him merely as the companion of his fellow-men, the benefactor of the human heart, stooping from his high estate to sow the sweet flowers of poetry and song in the paths of common life. He was the first to cultivate the vigorous and hardy plant of Scottish genius, which has since become so prolific of the most wholesome and highly-flavoured fruit. He carried with him into the sterner regions of the north all the fertilizing arts of southern refinement. He did everything in his power to win his countrymen to the gay, the elegant, and gentle arts, which soften and refine the character of a people, and wreath a grace round the loftiness of a proud and warlike spirit. He wrote many poems, which, unfortunately for the fulness of his fame, are now lost to the world; one, which is still preserved, called \"Christ's Kirk of the Green,\" shows how diligently he had made himself acquainted with the rustic sports and pastimes which constitute such a source of kind and social feeling among the Scottish peasantry; and with what simple and happy humour he could enter into their enjoyments. He contributed greatly to improve the national music; and traces of his tender sentiment and elegant taste are said to exist in those witching airs still piped among the wild mountains and lonely glens of Scotland. He has thus connected with the endearing incidents of song, and the Scottish melodies at my heart, have visited would visit the poetical devotee of the Lady Jane.\n\nThere are few things than an Englishman at the seat of power appearance of those richly peculiar charm of a country filled with cold and silent sensations. The age of every age is dimmed with glass. In view of high-born dark and coloured masses instance of human pride is the most humbling.\n\nThe congregation of rank, who furnished with their arms united who filled the pews and of the pews of the aisles.\n\nThe service had a snug guest at all\nthus connected his image with whatever is most gracious and endearing in the national character; he has embalmed his memory in song, and floated his name to after-ages in the rich streams of Scottish melody. The recollection of these things was kindling at my heart as I paced the silent scene of his imprisonment. I have visited Vancluse with as much enthusiasm as a pilgrim would visit the shrine at Loretto; but I have never felt more poetical devotion than when contemplating the old tower and the little garden at Windsor, and musing over the romantic loves of the Lady Jane and the Royal Poet of Scotland.\n\nTHE COUNTRY CHURCH.\n\nA gentleman!\nWhat, o' the woolpack? or the sugar-chest?\nOr lists of velvet? which is't, pound or yard,\nYou vend your gentry by?\u2014BEEGAN'S BUSH.\n\nThere are few places more favourable to the study of character than an English country church. I was once passing a few weeks at the seat of a friend, who resided in the vicinity of one, the appearance of which particularly struck my fancy. It was one of those rich morsels of quaint antiquity which give such a peculiar charm to English landscape. It stood in the midst of a country filled with ancient families, and contained, within its cold and silent aisles, the congregated dust of many noble generations. The interior walls were incrusted with monuments of every age and style. The light streamed through windows dimmed with armorial bearings, richly emblazoned in stained glass. In various parts of the church were tombs of knights, and high-born dames, of gorgeous workmanship, with their effigies in coloured marble. On every side the eye was struck with some instance of aspiring mortality; some haughty memorial which human pride had erected over its kindred dust, in this temple of the most humble of all religions.\n\nThe congregation was composed of the neighbouring people of rank, who sat in pews, sumptuously lined and cushioned, furnished with richly-gilded prayer-books, and decorated with their arms upon the pew doors; of the villagers and peasantry who filled the back seats, and a small gallery beside the organ; and of the poor of the parish, who were ranged on benches in the aisles.\n\nThe service was performed by a snuffling well-fed vicar, who had a snug dwelling near the church. He was a privileged guest at all the tables of the neighbourhood, and had been the\nkeenest fox-hunter in the country; until age and good living had disabled him from doing anything more than ride to see the hounds throw off, and make one at the hunting dinner.\n\nUnder the ministry of such a pastor, I found it impossible to get into the train of thought suitable to the time and place: so, having, like many other feeble Christians, compromised with my conscience, by laying the sin of my own delinquency at another person's threshold, I occupied myself by making observations on my neighbours.\n\nI was as yet a stranger in England, and curious to notice the manners of its fashionable classes. I found, as usual, that there was the least pretension where there was the most acknowledged title to respect. I was particularly struck, for instance, with the family of a nobleman of high rank, consisting of several sons and daughters. Nothing could be more simple and unassuming than their appearance. They generally came to church in the plainest equipage, and often on foot. The young ladies would stop and converse in the kindest manner with the peasantry, caress the children, and listen to the stories of the humble cottagers. Their countenances were open and beautifully fair, with an expression of high refinement, but, at the same time, a frank cheerfulness, and an engaging affability. Their brothers were tall, and elegantly formed. They were dressed fashionably, but simply; with strict neatness and propriety, but without any mannerism or foppishness. Their whole demeanour was easy and natural, with that lofty grace, and noble frankness, which bespeak freeborn souls that have never been checked in their growth by feelings of inferiority. There is a healthful hardiness about real dignity, that never dreads contact and communion with others, however humble. It is only spurious pride that is morbid and sensitive, and shrinks from every touch. I was pleased to see the manner in which they would converse with the peasantry about those rural concerns and field-sports, in which the gentlemen of this country so much delight. In these conversations there was neither haughtiness on the one part, nor servility on the other; and you were only reminded of the difference of rank by the habitual respect of the peasant.\n\nIn contrast to these was the family of a wealthy citizen, who had amassed a vast fortune; and, having purchased the estate and mansion of a ruined nobleman in the neighbourhood, was endeavouring to assume all the style and dignity of an hereditary lord of the soil. The family always came to church on princes. They were rolled majestically along in a carriage emblazoned with arms. The part of the head was a fat coachman, with a wig, curling back with a sleek black livery, without a horse behind. The peculiar state of the bits, arched over, was not common to the family of ordinary.\n\nI could not help the pageant was before me. It was a vast edifice of wall\u2014a great throng of horses, gliding on gravel. This was the coachman, who were fretted in a prancing trot, followed by a crowd of villagers and farmers to the right and left of the gate, their heads produced an air of haunches.\n\nThere was nothing to pull down the spirit of earth of this vast round red face, and pompous air of the Stock Market. Comfortable dame, but little pride, broad, honest, hearty; and she had a house, a fine garden, her: it was not easy. Life was to be lived today.\n\nTwo dangers certainly were there\u2014admiration, and\nwith arms. The crest glittered in silver radiance from every part of the harness where a crest could possibly be placed. A fat coachman, in a three-cornered hat, richly laced, and a flaxen wig, curling close round his rosy face, was seated on the box, with a sleek Danish dog beside him. Two footmen, in gorgeous liveries, with huge bouquets, and gold-headed canes, lolled behind. The carriage rose and sunk on its long springs with peculiar stateliness of motion. The very horses champed their bits, arched their necks, and glanced their eyes more proudly than common horses; either because they had caught a little of the family feeling, or were reined up more tightly than ordinary.\n\nI could not but admire the style with which this splendid pageant was brought up to the gate of the churchyard. There was a vast effect produced at the turning of an angle of the wall;\u2014a great smacking of the whip, straining and scrambling of horses, glistening of harness, and flashing of wheels through gravel. This was the moment of triumph and vainglory to the coachman. The horses were urged and checked until they were fretted into a foam. They threw out their feet in a prancing trot, dashing about pebbles at every step. The crowd of villagers sauntering quietly to church, opened precipitately to the right and left, gaping in vacant admiration. On reaching the gate, the horses were pulled up with a suddenness that produced an immediate stop, and almost threw them on their haunches.\n\nThere was an extraordinary hurry of the footmen to alight, pull down the steps, and prepare everything for the descent on earth of this august family. The old citizen first emerged his round red face from out the door, looking about him with the pompous air of a man accustomed to rule on 'Change, and shake the Stock Market with a nod. His consort, a fine, fleshy, comfortable dame, followed him. There seemed, I must confess, but little pride in her composition. She was the picture of broad, honest, vulgar enjoyment. The world went well with her; and she liked the world. She had fine clothes, a fine house, a fine carriage, fine children, everything was fine about her: it was nothing but driving about, and visiting and feasting. Life was to her a perpetual revel; it was one long Lord Mayor's day.\n\nTwo daughters succeeded to this goodly couple. They certainly were handsome; but had a supercilious air, that chilled admiration, and disposed the spectator to be critical. They were\nultra-fashionable in dress; and, though no one could deny the richness of their decorations, yet their appropriateness might be questioned amidst the simplicity of a country church. They descended loftily from the carriage, and moved up the line of peasantry with a step that seemed dainty of the soil it trod on. They cast an excursive glance around, that passed coldly over the burly faces of the peasantry, until they met the eyes of the nobleman's family, when their countenances immediately brightened into smiles, and they made the most profound and elegant courtesies, which were returned in a manner that showed they were but slight acquaintances.\n\nI must not forget the two sons of this aspiring citizen, who came to church in a dashing curriole, with outriders. They were arrayed in the extremity of the mode, with all that pedantry of dress which marks the man of questionable pretensions to style. They kept entirely by themselves, eyeing every one askance that came near them, as if measuring his claims to respectability; yet they were without conversation, except the exchange of an occasional cant phrase. They even moved artificially; for their bodies, in compliance with the caprice of the day, had been disciplined into the absence of all ease and freedom. Art had done everything to accomplish them as men of fashion, but nature had denied them the nameless grace. They were vulgarly shaped, like men formed for the common purposes of life, and had that air of supercilious assumption which is never seen in the true gentleman.\n\nI have been rather minute in drawing the pictures of these two families, because I considered them specimens of what is often to be met with in this country\u2014the unpretending great, and the arrogant little. I have no respect for titled rank, unless it be accompanied with true nobility of soul; but I have remarked in all countries where artificial distinctions exist, that the very highest classes are always the most courteous and unassuming. Those who are well assured of their own standing are least apt to trespass on that of others: whereas nothing is so offensive as the aspirations of vulgarity, which thinks to elevate itself by humiliating its neighbour.\n\nAs I have brought these families into contrast, I must notice their behaviour in church. That of the nobleman's family was quiet, serious, and attentive. Not that they appeared to have any fervour of devotion, but rather a respect for sacred things and sacred places, inseparable from good breeding. The others,\nTHE WIDOW AND HER SON.\n\nPittie old age, within whose silver hairs\nHonour and reverence evermore have rained.\nMARLOWE'S TAMBOURINE.\n\nThose who are in the habit of remarking such matters must have noticed the passive quiet of an English landscape on Sunday. The clacking of the mill, the regularly recurring stroke of the flail, the din of the blacksmith's hammer, the whistling of the ploughman, the rattling of the cart, and all other sounds of rural labour are suspended. The very farm-dogs bark less frequently, being less disturbed by passing travellers. At such times I have almost fancied the winds sunk into quiet, and that\nthe sunny landscape, with its fresh green tints melting into blue haze, enjoyed the hallowed calm.\n\nSweet day, so pure, so calm, so bright,\nThe bridal of the earth and sky.\n\nWell was it ordained that the day of devotion should be a day of rest. The holy repose which reigns over the face of nature has its moral influence; every restless passion is charmed down, and we feel the natural religion of the soul gently springing up within us. For my part, there are feelings that visit me in a country church, amid the beautiful serenity of nature, which I experience nowhere else; and if not a more religious, I think I am a better man on Sunday than on any other day of the seven.\n\nDuring my recent residence in the country I used frequently to attend at the old village church. Its shadowy aisles; its mouldering monuments; its dark oaken panelling, all reverend with the gloom of departed years, seemed to fit it for the haunt of solemn meditation; but being in a wealthy aristocratic neighbourhood, the glitter of fashion penetrated even into the sanctuary; and I felt myself continually thrown back upon the world by the frigidity and pomp of the poor worms around me. The only being in the whole congregation who appeared thoroughly to feel the humble and prostrate piety of a true Christian was a poor decrepit old woman, bending under the weight of years and infirmities. She bore the traces of something better than abject poverty. The lingerings of decent pride were visible in her appearance. Her dress, though humble in the extreme, was scrupulously clean. Some trivial respect, too, had been awarded her, for she did not take her seat among the village poor, but sat alone on the steps of the altar. She seemed to have survived all love, all friendship, all society; and to have nothing left her but the hopes of heaven. When I saw her feebly rising and bending her aged form in prayer; habitually conning her prayer-book, which her palsied hand and failing eyes would not permit her to read, but which she evidently knew by heart; I felt persuaded that the faltering voice of that poor woman arose to heaven far before the responses of the clerk, the swell of the organ, or the chanting of the choir.\n\nI am fond of loitering about country churches, and this was so delightfully situated, that it frequently attracted me. It stood on a knoll, round which a small stream made a beautiful bend, and then wound its way through a long reach of soft meadow scenery. The church was surrounded by yew-trees which seemed almost coeval with itself. Its tall Gothic spire shot up lightly from among them, and pointed it. I was seated near some labourers who were engaged in the most remote and distant parts of the churchyard, and from the number of their heads I could see that the indigent and the friendless were told that the parishioner was a widow. While the coffin was being carried out of the church, which excited a loud noise, the bell announced the approaching obsequies of poor Mrs. Somers. The coffin of the parishioner was borne by a party of men, with an air of deliberation, and in the trapping of a horse, who feebly tottered behind the deceased\u2014her husband\u2014on the steps of the church. The man who was endeavoring to assist the poor had joined his hands in a running hand in prayer, and now pausing to look at the mourner.\n\nAs the funeral procession came from the church, I turned away in hand, and a feeling of sadness\u2014a mere act of charity\u2014a mere survivor was present in the form, but coldly. I heard a few steps from behind me, heard at the grave, heard the sublime and touching memory of words.\n\nI approached the grave. On it were inscribed the name of Mrs. Somers, aged seventy-three. I assisted to kneel by her side. Her hands were clasped, and the rocking of the church was heard as she was gasping for breath, as if she was gasping for the breath of a mother's love.\n\nPreparation was made for the burial. There was a sound of...\nfrom among them, with rooks and crows generally wheeling about it. I was seated there one still sunny morning, watching two labourers who were digging a grave. They had chosen one of the most remote and neglected corners of the churchyard; where, from the number of nameless graves around, it would appear that the indigent and friendless were huddled into the earth. I was told that the new-made grave was for the only son of a poor widow. While I was meditating on the distinctions of worldly rank, which extend thus down into the very dust, the toll of the bell announced the approach of the funeral. They were the obsequies of poverty, with which pride had nothing to do. A coffin of the plainest materials, without pall or other covering, was borne by some of the villagers. The sexton walked before with an air of cold indifference. There were no mock mourners in the trappings of affected woe; but there was one real mourner who feebly tottered after the corpse. It was the aged mother of the deceased\u2014the poor old woman whom I had seen seated on the steps of the altar. She was supported by an humble friend, who was endeavouring to comfort her. A few of the neighbouring poor had joined the train, and some children of the village were running hand in hand, now shouting with unthinking mirth, and now pausing to gaze, with childish curiosity, on the grief of the mourner.\n\nAs the funeral train approached the grave, the parson issued from the church porch, arrayed in the surplice, with prayer-book in hand, and attended by the clerk. The service, however, was a mere act of charity. The deceased had been destitute, and the survivor was penniless. It was shuffled through, therefore, in form, but coldly and unfeelingly. The well-fed priest moved but a few steps from the church door; his voice could scarcely be heard at the grave; and never did I hear the funeral service, that sublime and touching ceremony, turned into such a frigid mummerie of words.\n\nI approached the grave. The coffin was placed on the ground. On it were inscribed the name and age of the deceased\u2014\"George Somers, aged twenty-six years.\" The poor mother had been assisted to kneel down at the head of it. Her withered hands were clasped, as if in prayer, but I could perceive by a feeble rocking of the body, and a convulsive motion of the lips, that she was gazing on the last relics of her son, with the yearnings of a mother's heart.\n\nPreparations were made to deposit the coffin in the earth. There was that bustling stir which breaks so harshly on the\nfeelings of grief and affection; directions given in the cold tones of business; the striking of spades into sand and gravel; which, at the grave of those we love, is, of all sounds, the most withering. The bustle around seemed to waken the mother from a wretched reverie. She raised her glazed eyes, and looked about with a faint wildness. As the men approached with cords to lower the coffin into the grave, she wrung her hands, and broke into an agony of grief. The poor woman who attended her took her by the arm, endeavouring to raise her from the earth, and to whisper something like consolation\u2014\"Nay, now\u2014nay, now\u2014don't take it so sorely to heart.\" She could only shake her head and wring her hands, as one not to be comforted.\n\nAs they lowered the body into the earth, the creaking of the cords seemed to agonize her; but when, on some accidental obstruction, there was a justling of the coffin, all the tenderness of the mother burst forth; as if any harm could come to him who was far beyond the reach of worldly suffering.\n\nI could see no more\u2014my heart swelled into my throat\u2014my eyes filled with tears\u2014I felt as if I were acting a barbarous part in standing by and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish. I wandered to another part of the churchyard, where I remained until the funeral train had dispersed.\n\nWhen I saw the mother slowly and painfully quitting the grave, leaving behind her the remains of all that was dear to her on earth, and returning to silence and destitution, my heart ached for her. What, thought I, are the distresses of the rich! they have friends to soothe\u2014pleasures to beguile\u2014a world to divert and dissipate their griefs. What are the sorrows of the young! Their growing minds soon close above the wound\u2014their elastic spirits soon rise beneath the pressure\u2014their green and ductile affections soon twine round new objects. But the sorrows of the poor, who have no outward appliances to soothe\u2014the sorrows of the aged, with whom life at best is but a wintry day, and who can look for no after-growth of joy\u2014the sorrows of a widow, aged, solitary, destitute, mourning over an only son, the last solace of her years; these are indeed sorrows which make us feel the impotency of consolation.\n\nIt was some time before I left the churchyard. On my way homeward I met with the woman who had acted as comforter: she was just returning from accompanying the mother to her lonely habitation, and I drew from her some particulars connected with the affecting scene I had witnessed.\n\nThe parents of the deceased had resided in the village from childhood. They had been supported by various rural employments, and had supported their family in a happy and blameless manner up to the stage of life. A good woman, \"kind to every one,\" whose one's heart good, tall, so straight\u2014for she was also a good woman, her good man's friend, for a finer lad than he.\"\n\nUnfortunately, however, and agricultural labour is a small craft that cannot be long in this employment, she carried off to sea, and beyond that the sea was her main prop. The sea was her friend and melancholy. She was in her age and strength, she came upon the point of death throughout the whole of the oldest inhabitants of the place she had passed away in it, where she had wants of nature. The garden of her little garden she cultivate for her own use; these circumstances vegetables for her own use; faced the gardener, who seemed to be looking out in seaman's clothes, the air of one broken down hastened toward death. He sank on his knees, and the woman gazed up at him. \"My dear, dear George?\" It was utterly shattered by what he said at length, dragging out the scenes of his\nchildhood. They had inhabited one of the neatest cottages, and by various rural occupations, and the assistance of a small garden, had supported themselves creditably and comfortably, and led a happy and blameless life. They had one son, who had grown up to be the staff and pride of their age.\u2014\u201cOh, sir!\u201d said the good woman, \u201che was such a comely lad, so sweet-tempered, so kind to every one around him, so dutiful to his parents! It did one\u2019s heart good to see him of a Sunday, dressed out in his best, so tall, so straight, so cheery, supporting his old mother to church\u2014for she was always fonder of leaning on George\u2019s arm than on her good man\u2019s; and, poor soul, she might well be proud of him, for a finer lad there was not in the country round.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the son was tempted, during a year of scarcity and agricultural hardship, to enter into the service of one of the small craft that plied on a neighbouring river. He had not been long in this employ when he was entrapped by a press-gang, and carried off to sea. His parents received tidings of his seizure, but beyond that they could learn nothing. It was the loss of their main prop. The father, who was already infirm, grew heartless and melancholy, and sunk into his grave. The widow, left lonely in her age and feebleness, could no longer support herself, and came upon the parish. Still there was a kind feeling toward her throughout the village, and a certain respect as being one of the oldest inhabitants. As no one applied for the cottage, in which she had passed so many happy days, she was permitted to remain in it, where she lived solitary and almost helpless. The few wants of nature were chiefly supplied from the scanty productions of her little garden, which the neighbours would now and then cultivate for her. It was but a few days before the time at which these circumstances were told me, that she was gathering some vegetables for her repast, when she heard the cottage door which faced the garden suddenly opened. A stranger came out, and seemed to be looking eagerly and wildly around. He was dressed in seaman\u2019s clothes, was emaciated and ghastly pale, and bore the air of one broken by sickness, and hardships. He saw her, and hastened towards her, but his steps were faint and faltering; he sank on his knees before her, and sobbed like a child. The poor woman gazed upon him with a vacant and wandering eye\u2014\u201cOh my dear, dear mother! don\u2019t you know your son? your poor boy George?\u201d It was, indeed, the wreck of her once noble lad, who, shattered by wounds, by sickness, and foreign imprisonment, had, at length, dragged his wasted limbs homeward, to repose among the scenes of his childhood.\nI will not attempt to detail the particulars of such a meeting, where joy and sorrow were so completely blended: still he was alive! he was come home! he might yet live to comfort and cherish her old age! Nature, however, was exhausted in him; and if anything had been wanting to finish the work of fate, the desolation of his native cottage would have been sufficient. He stretched himself on the pallet on which his widowed mother had passed many a sleepless night, and he never rose from it again.\n\nThe villagers, when they heard that George Somers had returned, crowded to see him, offering every comfort and assistance that their humble means afforded. He was too weak, however, to talk\u2014he could only look his thanks. His mother was his constant attendant; and he seemed unwilling to be helped by any other hand.\n\nThere is something in sickness that breaks down the pride of manhood; that softens the heart, and brings it back to the feelings of infancy. Who that has languished, even in advanced life, in sickness and despondency; who that has pined on a weary bed in the neglect and loneliness of a foreign land; but has thought on the mother \"that looked on his childhood,\" that smoothed his pillow, and administered to his helplessness? Oh! there is an enduring tenderness in the love of a mother to her son that transcends all other affections of the heart. It is neither to be chilled by selfishness, nor daunted by danger, nor weakened by worthlessness, nor stifled by ingratitude. She will sacrifice every comfort to his convenience; she will surrender every pleasure to his enjoyment; she will glory in his fame, and exult in his prosperity:\u2014and, if misfortune overtake him, he will be the dearer to her from misfortune; and if disgrace settle upon his name, she will still love and cherish him in spite of his disgrace; and if all the world beside cast him off, she will be all the world to him.\n\nPoor George Somers had known what it was to be in sickness, and none to soothe\u2014lonely and in prison, and none to visit him. He could not endure his mother from his sight; if she moved away, his eye would follow her. She would sit for hours by his bed, watching him as he slept. Sometimes he would start from a feverish dream, and look anxiously up until he saw her bending over him; when he would take her hand, lay it on his bosom, and fall asleep with the tranquillity of a child. In this way he died.\n\nMy first impulse on hearing this humble tale of affliction was to visit the cottage of the mourner, and administer pecuniary assistance, and to make every inquiry, that the poor widow might do everything in her power to best how to comfort her, and not intrude.\n\nThe next Sunday, to my surprise, I saw her at church in her accustomed seat.\n\nShe had made herself a shawl for her son; and now she sat between pious matrons\u2014a faded black dress, and no attempts to excuse or conceal it. When the stately hatchment of the late mourned magnate appeared, the poor widow, bowing to God, and offering up her broken heart, felt that she was worth them all.\n\nI related her case to the congregation, and they gave themselves to render her assistance in her afflictions. In the evening she missed from her usual haunts in the neighbourhood, and was seen to have quietly broken down and loved, in that hour when they are never parted.\n\nIn a preceding chapter we spoke of the country, and of the town where is its salubrious air, where the very heart of the world is day, the gigantic noise, the intolerable din and clamour, are shut. The freshness of the air, and the sun, nothing can break down a sober, yet cheerful pedestrian we met there.\nA SUNDAY IN LONDON.*\n\nIn a preceding paper I have spoken of an English Sunday in the country, and its tranquillizing effect upon the landscape; but where is its sacred influence more strikingly apparent than in the very heart of that great Babel, London? On this sacred day, the gigantic monster is charmed into repose. The intolerable din and struggle of the week are at an end. The shops are shut. The fires of forges and manufactories are extinguished; and the sun, no longer obscured by murky clouds of smoke, pours down a sober, yellow radiance into the quiet streets. The few pedestrians we meet, instead of hurrying forward with anxious\n\n* Part of a sketch omitted in the preceding editions.\ncountenances, move leisurely along; their brows are smoothed from the wrinkles of business and care; they have put on their Sunday looks, and Sunday manners, with their Sunday clothes, and are cleansed in mind as well as in person.\n\nAnd now the melodious clangour of bells from church towers summons their several flocks to the fold. Forth issues from his mansion the family of the decent tradesman, the small children in the advance; then the citizen and his comely spouse, followed by the grown-up daughters, with small morocco-bound prayer-books laid in the folds of their pocket-handkerchiefs. The housemaid looks after them from the window, admiring the finery of the family, and receiving, perhaps, a nod and smile from her young mistresses, at whose toilet she has assisted.\n\nNow rumbles along the carriage of some magnate of the city, peradventure an alderman or a sheriff, and now the patter of many feet announces a procession of charity scholars, in uniforms of antique cut, and each with a prayer-book under his arm.\n\nThe ringing of bells is at an end; the rumbling of the carriage has ceased; the pattering of feet is heard no more; the flocks are folded in ancient churches, cramped up in by-lanes and corners of the crowded city, where the vigilant beadle keeps watch, like the shepherd's dog, round the threshold of the sanctuary. For a time everything is hushed; but soon is heard the deep pervading sound of the organ, rolling and vibrating through the empty lanes and courts; and the sweet chanting of the choir making them resound with melody and praise. Never have I been more sensible of the sanctifying effect of church music, than when I have heard it thus poured forth, like a river of joy, through the inmost recesses of this great metropolis, elevating it, as it were, from all the sordid pollutions of the week; and bearing the poor world-worn soul on a tide of triumphant harmony to heaven.\n\nThe morning service is at an end. The streets are again alive with the congregations returning to their homes, but soon again relapse into silence. Now comes on the Sunday dinner, which, to the city tradesman, is a meal of some importance. There is more leisure for social enjoyment at the board. Members of the family can now gather together, who are separated by the laborious occupations of the week. A school-boy may be permitted on that day to come to the paternal home; an old friend of the family takes his accustomed Sunday seat at the board, tells over his well-known stories, and rejoices young and old with his well-known jokes.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon the fresh air and environs.

Satirists may say what they please about the rural enjoyments of a London citizen on Sunday, but to me there is something delightful in beholding the poor prisoner of the crowded and dusty city enabled thus to come forth once a week and throw himself upon the green bosom of nature. He is like a child restored to the mother's breast; and they who first spread out these noble parks and magnificent pleasure-grounds which surround this huge metropolis, have done at least as much for its health and morality, as if they had expended the amount of cost, in hospitals, prisons, and penitentiaries.\n\nTHE BOAR'S HEAD TAVERN, EASTCHEAP.\n\nA SHAKSPEARIAN RESEARCH.\n\nA tavern is the rendezvous, the exchange, the staple of good fellows. I have heard my great-grandfather tell, how his great-great-grandfather should say, that it was an old proverb when his great-grandfather was a child, that \"it was a good wind that blew a man to the wine.\"\u2014MOTHER BOSWELL.\n\nIt is a pious custom, in some Catholic countries, to honour the memory of saints by votive lights burnt before their pictures. The popularity of a saint, therefore, may be known by the number of these offerings. One, perhaps, is left to moulder in the darkness of his little chapel; another may have a solitary lamp to throw its blinking rays athwart his effigy; while the whole blaze of adoration is lavished at the shrine of some beatified father of renown. The wealthy devotee brings his huge luminary of wax; the eager zealot his seven-branched candlestick; and even the mendicant pilgrim is by no means satisfied that sufficient light is thrown upon the deceased, unless he hangs up his little lamp of smoking oil. The consequence is, that in the eagerness to enlighten, they are often apt to obscure; and I have occasionally seen an unlucky saint almost smoked out of countenance by the officiousness of his followers.\n\nIn like manner has it fared with the immortal Shakspeare. Every writer considers it his bounden duty to light up some portion of his character or works, and to rescue some merit from oblivion. The commentator, opulent in words, produces vast tomes of dissertations; the common herd of editors send up mists of obscurity from their notes at the bottom of each page; and every casual scribbler brings his farthing rushlight of eulogy or research, to swell the cloud of incense and of smoke.\nAs I honour all established usages of my brethren of the quill, I thought it but proper to contribute my mite of homage to the memory of the illustrious bard. I was for some time, however, sorely puzzled in what way I should discharge this duty. I found myself anticipated in every attempt at a new reading; every doubtful line had been explained a dozen different ways, and perplexed beyond the reach of elucidation; and as to fine passages, they had all been amply praised by previous admirers; nay, so completely had the bard, of late, been overlarded with panegyric by a great German critic, that it was difficult now to find even a fault that had not been argued into a beauty.\n\nIn this perplexity, I was one morning turning over his pages, when I casually opened upon the comic scenes of Henry IV., and was, in a moment, completely lost in the mad-cap revelry of the Boar's Head Tavern. So vividly and naturally are these scenes of humour depicted, and with such force and consistency are the characters sustained, that they become mingled up in the mind with the facts and personages of real life. To few readers does it occur, that these are all ideal creations of a poet's brain, and that, in sober truth, no such knot of merry roisterers ever enlivened the dull neighbourhood of Eastcheap.\n\nFor my part, I love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry. A hero of fiction that never existed is just as valuable to me as a hero of history that existed a thousand years since: and, if I may be excused such an insensibility to the common ties of human nature, I would not give up fat Jack for half the great men of ancient chronicle. What have the heroes of yore done for me, or men like me? They have conquered countries of which I do not enjoy an acre; or they have gained laurels of which I do not inherit a leaf; or they have furnished examples of hair-brained prowess, which I have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to follow. But, old Jack Falstaff!\u2014kind Jack Falstaff!\u2014sweet Jack Falstaff!\u2014has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment; he has added vast regions of wit and good humour, in which the poorest man may revel; and has bequeathed a never-failing inheritance of jolly laughter, to make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity.\n\nA thought suddenly struck me: \"I will make a pilgrimage to Eastcheap,\" said I, closing the book, \"and see if the old Boar's Head Tavern still exists. Who knows but I may light upon some legendary traces of Dame Quickly and her guests; at any rate, there will be a kindred pleasure, in treading the halls once vociferous, now silent, and smelling to the soul.\"\n\nThe resolution once made, I forbear to trouble the reader with the counterpanes in my mind of the faded pictures of what perils I encountered in the renowned Guildhall, the wonder of the world, and how I visited the imitation of the same.\n\nLet it suffice to say, Eastcheap, that among the names of the places there bears testimony to the old Stowe, \"wherethough cookes cried for their other victuals, as butter and sawtrie.\" In those roaring days of yore, Eastcheap has given place to the pots and the saucepans, and the accurate ear heard, save, here and there, chanting the old rhyme:\n\nI sought in Eastcheap,\nThe only relic of the days\nwhich formerly were,\nthe parting lips of the renowned old Dame Quickly.\n\nFor the history of Falstaff referred to a certain Falstaff, born and brought up in Eastcheap, indisputable evidence of which is seated in a little house opposite upon a yard about three feet square, while a glass of ale was being consumed through a viator's window, comprised, in a word, in a world in which Falstaff was for the better.\n\nTo be very brief,\nhalls once vocal with their mirth, to that the toper enjoys in smelling to the empty caulk once filled with generous wine.\"\n\nThe resolution was no sooner formed than put in execution. I forbear to treat of the various adventures and wonders I encountered in my travels; of the haunted regions of Cock-lane; of the faded glories of Little Britain, and the parts adjacent; what perils I ran in Cateaton-street and Old Jewry; of the renowned Guildhall and its two stunted giants, the pride and wonder of the city, and the terror of all unlucky archers; and how I visited London stone, and struck my staff upon it, in imitation of that arch rebel, Jack Cade.\n\nLet it suffice to say, that I at length arrived in merry Eastcheap, that ancient region of wit and wassail, where the very names of the streets relished of good cheer, as Pudding-lane bears testimony even at the present day. For Eastcheap, says old Stowe, \"was always famous for its convivial doings. The cookes cried hot ribbes of beef roasted, pies well baked, and other victuals: there was clattering of pewter pots, harpe, pipe, and sawtrie.\" Alas! how sadly is the scene changed since the roaring days of Falstaff and old Stowe! The madcap roister has given place to the plodding tradesman; the clattering of pots and the sound of \"harpe and sawtrie,\" to the din of carts and the accursed dingling of the dustman's bell; and no song is heard, save, haply, the strain of some siren from Billingsgate, chanting the eulogy of deceased mackerel.\n\nI sought in vain for the ancient abode of Dame Quickly. The only relic of it is a boar's head, carved in relief in stone, which formerly served as the sign, but at present is built into the parting line of two houses, which stand on the site of the renowned old tavern.\n\nFor the history of this little abode of good fellowship, I was referred to a tallow-chandler's widow, opposite, who had been born and brought up on the spot, and was looked up to as the indisputable chronicler of the neighbourhood. I found her seated in a little back parlour, the window of which looked out upon a yard about eight feet square, laid out as a flower-garden; while a glass door opposite afforded a distant peep of the street, through a vista of soap and tallow candles: the two views, which comprised, in all probability, her prospects in life, and the little world in which she had lived, and moved, and had her being, for the better part of a century.\n\nTo be versed in the history of Eastcheap, great and little,\nfrom London stone even unto the Monument, was, doubtless, in her opinion, to be acquainted with the history of the universe. Yet, with all this, she possessed the simplicity of true wisdom, and that liberal communicative disposition which I have generally remarked in intelligent old ladies, knowing in the concerns of their neighbourhood.\n\nHer information, however, did not extend far back into antiquity. She could throw no light upon the history of the Boar's Head, from the time that Dame Quickly espoused the valiant Pistol, until the great fire of London, when it was unfortunately burnt down. It was soon rebuilt, and continued to flourish under the old name and sign, until a dying landlord, struck with remorse for double scores, bad measures, and other iniquities, which are incidental to the sinful race of publicans, endeavoured to make his peace with Heaven, by bequeathing the tavern to St. Michael's Church, Crooked-lane, toward the supporting of a chaplain. For some time the vestry meetings were regularly held there; but it was observed that the old Boar never held up his head under church government. He gradually declined, and finally gave his last gasp about thirty years since. The tavern was then turned into shops; but she informed me that a picture of it was still preserved in St. Michael's Church, which stood just in the rear. To get a sight of this picture was now my determination; so, having informed myself of the abode of the sexton, I took my leave of the venerable chronicler of Eastcheap, my visit having doubtless raised greatly her opinion of her legendary lore, and furnished an important incident in the history of her life.\n\nIt cost me some difficulty, and much curious inquiry, to ferret out the humble hanger-on to the church. I had to explore Crooked-lane, and divers little alleys, and elbows, and dark passages with which this old city is perforated, like an ancient cheese, or a worm-eaten chest of drawers. At length I traced him to the corner of a small court, surrounded by lofty houses, where the inhabitants enjoy about as much of the face of heaven, as a community of frogs at the bottom of a well. The sexton was a meek, acquiescing little man, of a bowing, lowly habit: yet he had a pleasant twinkling in his eye, and, if encouraged, would now and then hazard a small pleasantry; such as a man of his low estate might venture to make in the company of high churchwardens, and other mighty men of the earth. I found him in company with the deputy organist, seated apart, like Milton's angels, discoursing, no doubt, on high doctrinal points, and settling the question for the lower orders, matter without understanding. They finished their discourse to the churchwarden's wishes, I recollect.\n\nThe churchwarden, at a distance from the fishmongers of Smithfield, of glory, and the monument of the dead, with as much reverence as poets feel of the monument of the living. I cannot help, dear men, to observe, that the ashes of the great who so manifestly died in Smithfield; and that only Lord Mayor, the sovereigns of all pacific of all peace.\n\nAdjoining to the back window of the tombstone of the sexton is now nearly closed his business call of his countrymen.\n\n* The following unhappily was destroyed by fire.\nand settling the affairs of the church over a friendly pot of ale\u2014for the lower classes of English seldom deliberate on any weighty matter without the assistance of a cool tankard to clear their understandings. I arrived at the moment when they had finished their ale and their argument, and were about to repair to the church to put it in order; so, having made known my wishes, I received their gracious permission to accompany them.\n\nThe church of St. Michael's, Crooked-lane, standing a short distance from Billingsgate, is enriched with the tombs of many fishmongers of renown; and as every profession has its galaxy of glory, and its constellation of great men, I presume the monument of a mighty fishmonger of the olden time is regarded with as much reverence by succeeding generations of the craft, as poets feel on contemplating the tomb of Virgil, or soldiers the monument of a Marlborough or Turenne.\n\nI cannot but turn aside, while thus speaking of illustrious men, to observe that St. Michael's, Crooked-lane, contains also the ashes of that doughty champion, William Walworth, knight, who so manfully clove down the sturdy wight, Wat Tyler, in Smithfield; a hero worthy of honourable blazon, as almost the only Lord Mayor on record famous for deeds of arms:\u2014the sovereigns of Cockney being generally renowned as the most pacific of all potentates.*\n\nAdjoining the church, in a small cemetery, immediately under the back window of what was once the Boar's Head, stands the tombstone of Robert Preston, whilom drawer at the tavern. It is now nearly a century since this trusty drawer of good liquor closed his bustling career, and was thus quietly deposited within call of his customers. As I was clearing away the weeds from\n\n* The following was the ancient inscription on the monument of this worthy, which, unhappily was destroyed in the great conflagration:\u2014\n\n\"Herrunder lyth a man of Fame,\nWilliam Walworth called by name;\nFishmonger he was in lyfetime here,\nAnd twice Lord Major, as in books appeare;\nWho with courage stout and manly myght,\nSlew Jack Straw in Kyng Richard's sight.\nFor which act done, and truw entent,\nThe Kyng made him knyght incoustiment;\nAnd gave him armes, as here you see,\nTo declare his fact and chivalrie.\nHe left this lyf the yere of our God\nThirteen hundred four score and three odd.\"\n\nAn error in the foregoing inscription has been corrected by the venerable Stowe. \"Whereas,\" saith he, \"it hath been far spread abroad by public opinion, that the rebel smitten down so manfully by Sir William Walworth, the then worthy Lord Major, was named Jack Straw, and not Wat Tyler, I thought good to reconcile this rash-conceived doubts by such testimony as I find in ancient and good records. The principal leaders, or captains of the commons were, Wat Tyler as the first man; the second was John, or Jack, Straw, &c. &c.\"\u2014STOWE'S LONDON.\nhis epitaph, the little sexton drew me on one side with a mysterious air; and informed me in a low voice, that once upon a time, on a dark wintry night, when the wind was unruly, howling, and whistling, hanging about doors and windows, and twirling weathercocks, so that the living were frightened out of their beds, and even the dead could not sleep quietly in their graves, the ghost of honest Preston, which happened to be airing itself in the churchyard, was attracted by the well-known call of \"waiter\" from the Boar's Head, and made its sudden appearance in the midst of a roaring club, just as the parish clerk was singing a stave from the \"Mirre garland of Captain Death,\" to the discomfiture of sundry train-band captains, and the conversion of an infidel attorney, who became a zealous Christian on the spot, and was never known to twist the truth afterwards, except in the way of business.\n\nI beg it may be remembered that I do not pledge myself for the authenticity of this anecdote, though it is well known that the churchyards and by-corners of this old metropolis are very much infested with perturbed spirits; and every one must have heard of the Cock-lane ghost, and the apparition that guards the regalia in the Tower, which has frightened so many bold sentinels almost out of their wits.\n\nBe all this as it may, this Robert Preston seems to have been a worthy successor to the nimble-tongued Francis, who attended upon the revels of Prince Hal; to have been equally prompt with his \"Anon, anon, sir,\" and to have transcended his predecessor in honesty; for Falstaff, the veracity of whose taste no man will venture to impeach, flatly accuses Francis of putting lime in his sack; whereas honest Preston's epitaph lands him for the sobriety of his conduct, the soundness of his wine, and the fairness of his measure.* The worthy dignitaries of the church, however, did not appear much captivated by the sober virtues of the tapster; the deputy organist, who had a moist look out of the eye, made some shrewd remark on the abstemiousness of a\n\n* As this inscription is rife with excellent morality, I transcribe it for the admonition of delinquent tapsters.

No such painting was to be found in the church of St. Michael. \"Marry and amen!\" said I, \"here endeth my research!\" So I was giving the matter up, with the air of a baffled antiquary, when my friend the sexton, perceiving me to be curious in everything relative to the old tavern, offered to show me the choice vessels of the vestry, which had been handed down from remote times, when the parish meetings were held at the Boar's Head. These were deposited in the parish club-room, which had been transferred, on the decline of the ancient establishment, to a tavern in the neighbourhood.\n\nA few steps brought us to the house, which stands No. 12, Miles-lane, bearing the title of the Masons' Arms, and is kept by Master Edward Honeyball, the \"bully-rock\" of the establishment. It is one of those little taverns which abound in the heart of the city, and form the centre of gossip and intelligence of the neighbourhood. We entered the bar-room, which was narrow and darkling; for in these close lanes but few rays of reflected light are enabled to struggle down to the inhabitants, whose broad day is at best but a tolerable twilight. The room was partitioned into boxes, each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth ready for dinner. This showed that the guests were of the good old stamp, and divided their day equally, for it was but just one o'clock. At the lower end of the room was a clear coal fire, before which a breast of lamb was roasting. A row of bright brass candlesticks and pewter mugs glistened along the mantelpiece, and an old-fashioned clock ticked in one corner. There was something primitive in this medley of kitchen, parlour, and hall, that carried me back to earlier times, and pleased me. The place, indeed, was humble, but everything had that look of order and neatness, which bespeaks the superintendence of a notable English housewife. A group of amphibious-looking beings, who might be either fishermen or sailors, were regaling themselves in one of the boxes. As I was a visitor of rather higher pretensions, I was ushered into a little misshapen backroom, having at least nine corners. It was lighted by a sky-light, furnished with antiquated leather chairs, and ornamented with the portrait of a fat pig. It was evidently appropriated to particular customers,\nand I found a shabby gentleman, in a red nose and oil-cloth hat, seated in one corner, meditating on a half-empty pot of porter.\n\nThe old sexton had taken the landlady aside, and with an air of profound importance imparted to her my errand. Dame Honeyball was a likely, plump, bustling little woman, and no bad substitute for that paragon of hostesses, Dame Quickly. She seemed delighted with an opportunity to oblige; and hurrying up stairs to the archives of her house, where the precious vessels of the parish club were deposited, she returned, smiling and courtseying, with them in her hands.\n\nThe first she presented me was a japanned iron tobacco-box, of gigantic size, out of which, I was told, the vestry had smoked at their stated meetings, since time immemorial; and which was never suffered to be profaned by vulgar hands, or used on common occasions. I received it with becoming reverence; but what was my delight, at beholding on its cover the identical painting of which I was in quest! There was displayed the outside of the Boar's Head Tavern, and before the door was to be seen the whole convivial group, at table, in full revel; pictured with that wonderful fidelity and force, with which the portraits of renowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco-boxes, for the benefit of posterity. Lest, however, there should be any mistake, the cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of Prince Hal and Falstaff on the bottoms of their chairs.\n\nOn the inside of the cover was an inscription, nearly obliterated, recording that this box was the gift of Sir Richard Gore, for the use of the vestry meetings at the Boar's Head Tavern, and that it was \"repaired and beautified by his successor, Mr. John Packard, 1767.\" Such is a faithful description of this august and venerable relic; and I question whether the learned Scriblerius contemplated his Roman shield, or the Knights of the Round Table the long-sought san-greal, with more exultation.\n\nWhile I was meditating on it with enraptured gaze, Dame Honeyball, who was highly gratified by the interest it excited, put in my hands a drinking-cup or goblet, which also belonged to the vestry, and was descended from the old Boar's Head. It bore the inscription of having been the gift of Francis Wythers, knight, and was held, she told me, in exceeding great value, being considered very \"antyke.\" This last opinion was strengthened by the shabby gentleman in the red nose and oil-cloth hat, and whom I strongly suspected of being a lineal descendant from the valiant Bardolph. He suddenly aroused from his meditation on the pot of porter, and, casting a knowing look at the goblet, exclaimed, \"Ah, there article!\"\n\nThe great revelry by most is nothing short of research; for other than the made his loving would, of course, her remains, a\n\nMine hostess had been handsomely entertained by the vestrymen who were of the ancient commentators, utt.

She also entertained me with many particulars concerning the worthy vestrymen who have seated themselves thus quietly on the stools of the ancient roisters of Eastcheap, and, like so many commentators, utter clouds of smoke in honour of Shakspeare. These I forbear to relate, lest my readers should not be as curious in these matters as myself. Suffice it to say, the neighbours, one and all, about Eastcheap, believe that Falstaff and his merry crew actually lived and revelled there. Nay, there are several legendary anecdotes concerning him still extant among the oldest frequenters of the Masons' Arms, which they give as transmitted down from their forefathers; and Mr. M'Kash, an Irish hair-dresser, whose shop stands on the site of the old Boar's Head, has several dry jokes of Fat Jack's, not laid down in the books, with which he makes his customers ready to die of laughter.\n\nI now turned to my friend the sexton to make some further inquiries, but I found him sunk in pensive meditation. His head had declined a little on one side; a deep sigh heaved from the very bottom of his stomach; and, though I could not see a tear trembling in his eye, yet a moisture was evidently stealing from a corner of his mouth. I followed the direction of his eye through the door, which stood open, and found it fixed wistfully on the savoury breast of lamb, roasting in dripping richness before the fire.\n\nI now called to mind that, in the eagerness of my recondite investigation, I was keeping the poor man from his dinner. My bowels yearned with sympathy, and, putting in his hand a small\n\n* Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-shell fire, on Wednesday, in Whitman-week, when the prince broke thy head for likening his father to a singing man at Windsor; thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me, and make me my lady, thy wife. Canst thou deny it?\u2014Henry IV., Part 2.\ntoken of my gratitude and goodness, I departed, with a hearty benediction on him, Dame Honeyball, and the parish club of Crooked-lane;\u2014not forgetting my shabby, but sententious friend, in the oil-cloth hat and copper nose.\n\nThus have I given a \"tedious brief\" account of this interesting research, for which, if it prove too short and unsatisfactory, I can only plead my inexperience in this branch of literature, so deservedly popular at the present day. I am aware that a more skilful illustrator of the immortal bard would have swelled the materials I have touched upon, to a good merchantable bulk; comprising the biographies of William Walworth, Jack Straw, and Robert Preston; some notice of the eminent fishmongers of St. Michael's; the history of Eastcheap, great and little; private anecdotes of Dame Honeyball, and her pretty daughter, whom I have not even mentioned; to say nothing of a damsel tending the breast of lamb (and whom, by the way, I remarked to be a comely lass, with a neat foot and ankle);\u2014the whole enlivened by the riots of Wat Tyler, and illuminated by the great fire of London.\n\nAll this I leave, as a rich mine, to be worked by future commentators; nor do I despair of seeing the tobacco-box, and the \"parcel-gilt goblet,\" which I have thus brought to light, the subjects of future engravings, and almost as fruitful of voluminous dissertations and disputes as the shield of Achilles, or the far-famed Portland vase.\n\n---\n\nTHE MUTABILITY OF LITERATURE.\n\nA COLLOQUIUM IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\n\nI know that all beneath the moon decays,\nAnd what by mortals in this world is sought\nIn Time's great period shall return to sought:\nI know that all the muse's heavenly lays,\nWith toll of sprite which are so dearly bought,\nAs idle sounds, of few or none are sought,\nThat there is nothing lighter than mere praise.\n\nDrummond of Hawthornden.\n\nThere are certain half-dreaming moods of mind, in which we naturally steal away from noise and glare, and seek some quiet haunt, where we may indulge our reveries and build our air-castles undisturbed. In such a mood I was loitering about the old grey cloisters of Westminster Abbey, enjoying that luxury of wandering thought which one is apt to dignify with the name of reflection; when suddenly an interruption of madcap boys from Westminster School, playing at foot-ball, broke in upon the monastic stillness of the place, making the vaulted passages and mouldering towers a refuge from the tumults of the press, to the library, a crumbling secular passage leading to a doomsday-beck, a double locked door on the other side. We now ascended a second door,\n\nI found myself in a massive joisted gallery, a row of Gothic windows, and which appeared ancient pictures, and robes hung over the gallery were the most princely more worn by the solitary table, ink, and a few chairs fitted for quietude deep among the tumult of the shouts of the schoolboys, the sound of a clock on the roofs of the abbey, fainter and fainter toll, and a profound silence.\n\nI had taken a piece of parchment, with my venerable elbow beguiled by the place, into a treasure of volumes in the library, and apparently did consider the liars like mummies, moulder in dust.\n\nHow much, aside with such weary days!\nmouldering tombs echo with their merriment. I sought to take refuge from their noise by penetrating still deeper into the solitudes of the pile, and applied to one of the vergers for admission to the library. He conducted me through a portal rich with the crumbling sculpture of former ages, which opened upon a gloomy passage leading to the chapter-house and the chamber in which doomsday-book is deposited. Just within the passage is a small door on the left. To this the verger applied a key; it was double locked, and opened with some difficulty, as if seldom used. We now ascended a dark narrow staircase, and, passing through a second door, entered the library.\n\nI found myself in a lofty antique hall, the roof supported by massive joists of old English oak. It was soberly lighted by a row of Gothic windows at a considerable height from the floor, and which apparently opened upon the roofs of the cloisters. An ancient picture of some reverend dignitary of the church in his robes hung over the fireplace. Around the hall and in a small gallery were the books, arranged in carved oaken cases. They consisted principally of old polemical writers, and were much more worn by time than use. In the centre of the library was a solitary table, with two or three books on it, an inkstand without ink, and a few pens parched by long disuse. The place seemed fitted for quiet study and profound meditation. It was buried deep among the massive walls of the abbey, and shut up from the tumult of the world. I could only hear now and then the shouts of the school-boys faintly swelling from the cloisters, and the sound of a bell tolling for prayers, echoing soberly along the roofs of the abbey. By degrees the shouts of merriment grew fainter and fainter, and at length died away; the bell ceased to toll, and a profound silence reigned through the dusky hall.\n\nI had taken down a little thick quarto curiously bound in parchment, with brass clasps, and seated myself at the table in a venerable elbow-chair. Instead of reading, however, I was beguiled by the solemn monastic air, and lifeless quiet of the place, into a train of musing. As I looked around upon the old volumes in their mouldering covers, thus ranged on the shelves, and apparently never disturbed in their repose, I could not but consider the library a kind of literary catacomb, where authors, like mummies, are piously entombed, and left to blacken and moulder in dusty oblivion.\n\nHow much, thought I, has each of these volumes, now thrust aside with such indifference, cost some aching head! how many weary days! how many sleepless nights! How have their\nauthors buried themselves in the solitude of cells and cloisters; shut themselves up from the face of man, and the still more blessed face of nature; and devoted themselves to painful research and intense reflection! And all for what? to occupy an inch of dusty shelf\u2014to have the title of their works read now and then in a future age, by some drowsy churchman or casual straggler like myself; and in another age to be lost, even to remembrance. Such is the amount of this boasted immortality. A mere temporary rumour, a local sound; like the tone of that bell which has just tolled among these towers, filling the ear for a moment\u2014lingering transiently in echo\u2014and then passing away like a thing that was not!\n\nWhile I sat half murmuring, half meditating these unprofitable speculations, with my head resting on my hand, I was thrumming with the other hand upon the quarto, until I accidentally loosened the clasps; when, to my utter astonishment, the little book gave two or three yawns, like one awaking from a deep sleep; then a husky hem; and at length began to talk. At first its voice was very hoarse and broken, being much troubled by a cobweb which some studious spider had woven across it, and having probably contracted a cold from long exposure to the chills and damps of the abbey. In a short time, however, it became more distinct, and I soon found it an exceedingly fluent conversable little tome. Its language, to be sure, was rather quaint and obsolete, and its pronunciation what in the present day would be deemed barbarous; but I shall endeavour, as far as I am able, to render it in modern parlance.\n\nIt began with railings about the neglect of the world\u2014about merit being suffered to languish in obscurity, and other such commonplace topics of literary repining, and complained bitterly that it had not been opened for more than two centuries. That the dean only looked now and then into the library, sometimes took down a volume or two, trifled with them for a few moments, and then returned them to their shelves. \"What a plague do they mean,\" said the little quarto, which I began to perceive was somewhat choleric, \"what a plague do they mean by keeping several thousand volumes of us shut up here, and watched by a set of old vergers, like so many beauties in a harem, merely to be looked at now and then by the dean? Books were written to give pleasure and to be enjoyed, and I would have a rule passed that the dean should pay each of us a visit at least once a year; or if he is not equal to the task, let them once in a while turn loose the worms, and we may not die.\"\n\n\"Softly, sir,\" said I, \"how much better would it be By being studied, and treasured, and revered, shrined in the eyes of contemporaries, and not long since readers?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the quarto, \"I was written in the great contemplative abbey. I was there more than two centuries, if you will uttering a few words.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said I, \"the calculation of words is no more. The worms are striken in your case, present in every case, immured like ourselves instead of living. We gratefully have seen the establishment of our kind by quiet fostering, and amazingly good contemporaries as if they were living. What do we say? We have toiled hard, and written nearly a whole pyramid of books, which has long since been variously librated by antiquary. Our historian, and poet, declined two visits for posterity.\"\n\n\"What of Henry of England, wrote in the world has...\"\nloose the whole school of Westminster among us, that at any rate we may now and then have an airing.\"\n\n\"Softly, my worthy friend,\" replied I, \"you are not aware how much better you are off than most books of your generation. By being stored away in this ancient library, you are like the treasured remains of those saints and monarchs which lie enshrined in the adjoining chapels; while the remains of your contemporary mortals, left to the ordinary course of nature, have long since returned to dust.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the little tome, ruffling his leaves and looking big, \"I was written for all the world, not for the bookworms of an abbey. I was intended to circulate from hand to hand, like other great contemporary works; but here have I been clasped up for more than two centuries, and might have silently fallen a prey to these worms that are playing the very vengeance with my intestines, if you had not by chance given me an opportunity of uttering a few last words before I go to pieces.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" rejoined I, \"had you been left to the circulation of which you speak, you would long ere this have been no more. To judge from your physiognomy, you are now well stricken in years; very few of your contemporaries can be at present in existence, and those few owe their longevity to being immured like yourself in old libraries, which, suffer me to add, instead of likening to harems, you might more properly and gratefully have compared to those infirmaries attached to religious establishments for the benefit of the old and decrepit, and where, by quiet fostering and no employment, they often endure to an amazingly good-for-nothing old age. You talk of your contemporaries as if in circulation\u2014where do we meet with their works? What do we hear of Robert Groste, of Lincoln? No one could have toiled harder than he for immortality. He is said to have written nearly two hundred volumes. He built, as it were, a pyramid of books to perpetuate his name; but, alas! the pyramid has long since fallen, and only a few fragments are scattered in various libraries, where they are scarcely disturbed even by the antiquary. What do we hear of Giraldus Cambrensis, the historian, antiquary, philosopher, theologian, and poet? He declined two bishoprics, that he might shut himself up and write for posterity; but posterity never inquires after his labours. What of Henry of Huntingdon, who, besides a learned history of England, wrote a treatise on the contempt of the world, which the world has revenged by forgetting him? What is quoted of\nJoseph of Exeter, styled the miracle of his age in classical composition? Of his three great heroic poems, one is lost for ever, excepting a mere fragment; the others are known only to a few of the curious in literature; and as to his love verses and epigrams, they have entirely disappeared. What is in current use of John Wallis the Franciscan, who acquired the name of the tree of life? Of William of Malmesbury;\u2014of Simeon of Durham;\u2014of Benedict of Peterborough;\u2014of John Hanvill of St. Albans;\u2014of\u2014\n\n\"Prithee, friend,\" cried the quarto, in a testy tone, \"how old do you think me? You are talking of authors that lived long before my time, and wrote either in Latin or French, so that they in a manner expatriated themselves, and deserved to be forgotten;* but I, sir, was ushered into the world from the press of the renowned Wynkyn de Worde. I was written in my own native tongue at a time when the language had become fixed; and indeed I was considered a model of pure and elegant English.\"\n\n(I should observe that these remarks were couched in such intolerably antiquated terms, that I have had infinite difficulty in rendering them into modern phraseology.)\n\n\"I cry your mercy,\" said I, \"for mistaking your age; but it matters little; almost all the writers of your time have likewise passed into forgetfulness, and De Worde's publications are mere literary rarities among book collectors. The purity and stability of language, too, on which you found your claims to perpetuity, have been the fallacious dependence of authors of every age, even back to the times of the worthy Robert of Gloucester, who wrote his history in rhymes of mongrel Saxon.\u2020 Even now many talk of Spenser's 'well of pure English undefiled,' as if the language ever sprang from a well or fountain-head, and was not rather a mere confluence of various tongues, perpetually subject to changes and intermixtures. It is this which has made English literature so extremely mutable, and the reputation built upon it so fleeting. Unless thought can be committed to something more permanent and unchangeable than such a medium, even thought must share\n\n* In Latin and French hath many sovereigns wittes had great delyne to endite, and have many noble thinges fulfile, but certes there be some that speake their poesye in French, of which speche the Frenchmen have as good a fantasie as we have in heuring of Frenchmen's Englyshe.\u2014CHaucer's TESVAMENT OF LOVE.\n\n\u2020 Hollinshed, in his Chronicle, observes, \"Afterwards, also, by diligent travell of Geoffry Chaucer and of John Gower, in the time of Richard the Second, and after them of John Boccace and John Lydgate, monk of Berrie, our said tonge was brought to an excellent passe, notwithstanding that it never came unto the type of perfection until the time of Queen Elizabeth, wherein John Jewel, Bishop of Sarum, John Fox, and sundrie learned and excellent writers, have fully accomplished the nature of the same to their great praise and immortal commendation.\"\nthe fate of everything else, and fall into decay. This should serve as a check upon the vanity and exultation of the most popular writer. He finds the language in which he has embarked his fame gradually altering, and subject to the dilapidations of time and the caprice of fashion. He looks back and beholds the early authors of his country, once the favourites of their day, supplanted by modern writers. A few short ages have covered them with obscurity, and their merits can only be relished by the quaint taste of the bookworm. And such, he anticipates, will be the fate of his own work, which, however it may be admired in its day, and held up as a model of purity, will, in the course of years, grow antiquated and obsolete, until it shall become almost as unintelligible in its native land as an Egyptian obelisk, or one of those Runic inscriptions said to exist in the deserts of Tartary. I declare,\" added I, with some emotion, \"when I contemplate a modern library, filled with new works, in all the bravery of rich gilding and binding, I feel disposed to sit down and weep, like the good Xerxes, when he surveyed his army, pranked out in all the splendour of military array, and reflected that in one hundred years not one of them would be in existence!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the little quarto, with a heavy sigh, \"I see how it is; these modern scribblers have superseded all the good old authors. I suppose nothing is read now-a-days but Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia, Sackville's stately plays, and Mirror for Magistrates, or the fine-spun euphuisms of the 'unparalleled John Lyly.'\"\n\n\"There you are again mistaken,\" said I; \"the writers whom you suppose in vogue, because they happened to be so when you were last in circulation, have long since had their day. Sir Philip Sydney's Arcadia, the immortality of which was so fondly predicted by his admirers,* and which, in truth, is full of noble thoughts, delicate images, and graceful turns of language, is now scarcely ever mentioned. Sackville has strutted into obscurity; and even Lyly, though his writings were once the delight of a court, and apparently perpetuated by a proverb, is now scarcely known even by name. A whole crowd of authors who wrote and wrangled at the time, have likewise gone down, with all their writings and their controversies. Wave after wave of succeeding literature has rolled over them, until they are buried\n\n* Live ever sweete booke; the simple image of his gentle witt, and the golden pillar of his noble courage; and ever notify unto the world that thy writer was the secretary of eloquence, the breath of the muses, the honey-bee of the daintiest flowers of witt and arte, the pith of morale and intellectual virtues, the arms of Bellona in the field, the tongue of Diana in the chamber, the spirits of Praxiteles in ease, and the paragon of excellency in print.\u2014MARVY PIZZER'S SUPERBREGATION.\nso deep that it is only now and then that some industrious diver after fragments of antiquity brings up a specimen for the gratification of the curious.\n\n\"For my part,\" I continued, \"I consider this mutability of language a wise precaution of Providence for the benefit of the world at large, and of authors in particular. To reason from analogy, we daily behold the varied and beautiful tribes of vegetables springing up, flourishing, adorning the fields for a short time, and then fading into dust, to make way for their successors. Were not this the case, the fecundity of nature would be a grievance instead of a blessing. The earth would groan with rank and excessive vegetation, and its surface become a tangled wilderness. In like manner the works of genius and learning decline, and make way for subsequent productions. Language gradually varies, and with it fade away the writings of authors who have flourished their allotted time; otherwise the creative powers of genius would overstock the world, and the mind would be completely bewildered in the endless mazes of literature. Formerly there were some restraints on this excessive multiplication. Works had to be transcribed by hand, which was a slow and laborious operation; they were written either on parchment, which was expensive, so that one work was often erased to make way for another; or on papyrus, which was fragile and extremely perishable. Authorship was a limited and unprofitable craft, pursued chiefly by monks in the leisure and solitude of their cloisters. The accumulation of manuscripts was slow and costly, and confined almost entirely to monasteries. To these circumstances it may, in some measure, be owing that we have not been inundated by the intellect of antiquity; that the fountains of thought have not been broken up, and modern genius drowned in the deluge. But the inventions of paper and the press have put an end to all these restraints. They have made every one a writer, and enabled every mind to pour itself into print, and diffuse itself over the whole intellectual world. The consequences are alarming. The stream of literature has swollen into a torrent\u2014augmented into a river\u2014expanded into a sea. A few centuries since, five or six hundred manuscripts constituted a great library; but what would you say to libraries such as actually exist, containing three or four hundred thousand volumes; legions of authors at the same time busy; and the press going on with fearfully increasing activity, to double and quadruple the number? Unless some unforeseen mortality should break out among the progeny of the muse, now that she has become so prolific, I tremble for posterity. It will not be long before, with the increased military checks on the encouragement of literacies, good or bad, as what it may, the press will inevitably bring forth the employment of a man of passage for anything but the best will be little better.\"\n\n\"My very soul drearily in my bosom, you are rather the man who was making a translation, however, that shook their heads, that knew little, obliged to run away, was Shakespeare.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, the literature of the ordinary term of life, then, who seem to have roots in human nature, see on the bank of roots, penetrating the very foundation of them from being held up many ages to perpetuity. Behold defying the use the language of many an indifferent vicinity. But the tint of age, and commentators, who, the noble plant.\"\n\nHere the little until at length he\ntremble for posterity. I fear the mere fluctuation of language will not be sufficient. Criticism may do much. It increases with the increase of literature, and resembles one of those salutary checks on population spoken of by economists. All possible encouragement, therefore, should be given to the growth of critics, good or bad. But I fear all will be in vain; let criticism do what it may, writers will write, printers will print, and the world will inevitably be overstocked with good books. It will soon be the employment of a lifetime merely to learn their names. Many a man of passable information, at the present day, reads scarcely anything but reviews; and before long a man of erudition will be little better than a more walking catalogue.\"\n\n\"My very good sir,\" said the little quarto, yawning most drearily in my face, \"excuse my interrupting you, but I perceive you are rather given to prose. I would ask the fate of an author who was making some noise just as I left the world. His reputation, however, was considered quite temporary. The learned shook their heads at him, for he was a poor half-educated varlet, that knew little of Latin, and nothing of Greek, and had been obliged to run the country for deer-stealing. I think his name was Shakspeare. I presume he soon sunk into oblivion.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said I, \"it is owing to that very man that the literature of his period has experienced a duration beyond the ordinary term of English literature. There rise authors now and then, who seem proof against the mutability of language, because they have rooted themselves in the unchanging principles of human nature. They are like gigantic trees that we sometimes see on the banks of a stream; which, by their vast and deep roots, penetrating through the mere surface, and laying hold on the very foundations of the earth, preserve the soil around them from being swept away by the ever-flowing current, and hold up many a neighbouring plant, and, perhaps, worthless weed to perpetuity. Such is the case with Shakspeare, whom we behold defying the encroachments of time, retaining in modern use the language and literature of his day, and giving duration to many an indifferent author, merely from having flourished in his vicinity. But even he, I grieve to say, is gradually assuming the tint of age, and his whole form is overrun by a profusion of commentators, who, like clambering vines and creepers, almost bury the noble plant that upholds them.\"\n\nHere the little quarto began to hoave his sides and chuckle, until at length he broke out into a plethoric fit of laughter that\nhad well nigh choked him, by reason of his excessive corpulency. \"Mighty well!\" cried he, as soon as he could recover breath, \"mighty well! and so you would persuade me that the literature of an age is to be perpetuated by a vagabond deer-stealer! by a man without learning; by a poet, forsooth\u2014a poet!\" And here he wheezed forth another fit of laughter.\n\nI confess that I felt somewhat nettled at this rudeness, which, however, I pardoned on account of his having flourished in a less polished age. I determined, nevertheless, not to give up my point.\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed I, positively, \"a poet; for of all writers he has the best chance for immortality. Others may write from the head, but he writes from the heart, and the heart will always understand him. He is the faithful portrayer of nature, whose features are always the same, and always interesting. Prose writers are voluminous and unwieldy; their pages are crowded with commonplaces, and their thoughts expanded into tediousness. But with the true poet everything is terse, touching, or brilliant. He gives the choicest thoughts in the choicest language. He illustrates them by everything that he sees most striking in nature and art. He enriches them by pictures of human life, such as it is passing before him. His writings, therefore, contain the spirit, the aroma, if I may use the phrase, of the age in which he lives. They are caskets which enclose within a small compass the wealth of the language\u2014its family jewels, which are thus transmitted in a portable form to posterity. The setting may occasionally be antiquated, and require now and then to be renewed, as in the case of Chaucer; but the brilliancy and intrinsic value of the gems continue unaltered. Cast a look back over the long reach of literary history. What vast valleys of dulness, filled with monkish legends and academical controversies! what bogs of theological speculations! what dreary wastes of metaphysics! Here and there only do we behold the heaven-illumined bards, elevated like beacons on their widely-separate heights, to transmit the pure light of poetical intelligence from age to age.\"*\n\n* Thow earth and water deeps,\nThe pen by skill doth pass:\nAnd fealty nips the world's abuse,\nAnd shows us in a glass,\nThe vertu and the vice\nOf every wight alive;\nThe honeycomb that bee doth make\nIs not so sweet in hyve,\nAs are the golden leaves\nThat drop from poet's head!\nWhich doth surmount our common talkes\nAs farre as dross doth lead.\u2014Churchyard.\nI was just about to launch forth into eulogiums upon the poets of the day, when the sudden opening of the door caused me to turn my head. It was the verger, who came to inform me that it was time to close the library. I sought to have a parting word with the quarto, but the worthy little tome was silent, the clasps were closed; and it looked perfectly unconscious of all that had passed. I have been to the library two or three times since, and have endeavoured to draw it into further conversation, but in vain; and whether all this rambling colloquy actually took place, or whether it was another of those odd day-dreams to which I am subject, I have never to this moment been able to discover.\n\nRURAL FUNERALS.\n\nHere's a few flowers! but about midnight more:\nThe herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night\nAre strowings fit'test for graves\u2014\u2014\nYou were as flowers now wither'd; even so\nThese herbists shall which we upon you strew.\u2014CYMELINE.\n\nAmong the beautiful and simple-hearted customs of rural life which still linger in some parts of England, are those of strewing flowers before the funerals, and planting them at the graves of departed friends. These, it is said, are the remains of some of the rites of the primitive church; but they are of still higher antiquity, having been observed among the Greeks and Romans, and frequently mentioned by their writers, and were, no doubt, the spontaneous tributes of unlettered affection, originating long before art had tasked itself to modulate sorrow into song, or story it on the monument. They are now only to be met with in the most distant and retired places of the kingdom, where fashion and innovation have not been able to throng in, and trample out all the curious and interesting traces of the olden time.\n\nIn Glamorganshire, we are told, the bed whereon the corpse lies is covered with flowers, a custom alluded to in one of the wild and plaintive ditties of Ophelia:\n\nWhite his shroud as the mountain snow,\nLarded all with sweet flowers;\nWhich bewept to the grave did go,\nWith true-love showers.\n\nThere is also a most delicate and beautiful rite observed in some of the remote villages of the south, at the funeral of a female who has died young and unmarried. A chaplet of white flowers is borne before the corpse by a young girl nearest in age, size, and resemblance, and is afterwards hung up in the church.\nover the accustomed seat of the deceased. These chaplets are sometimes made of white paper, in imitation of flowers, and inside of them is generally a pair of white gloves. They are intended as emblems of the purity of the deceased, and the crown of glory which she has received in heaven.\n\nIn some parts of the country, also, the dead are carried to the grave with the singing of psalms and hymns; a kind of triumph, \"to show,\" says Bourne, \"that they have finished their course with joy, and are become conquerors.\" This, I am informed, is observed in some of the northern counties, particularly in Northumberland, and it has a pleasing, though melancholy effect, to hear, of a still evening, in some lonely country scene, the mournful melody of a funeral dirge swelling from a distance, and to see the train slowly moving along the landscape.\n\nThere is also a solemn respect paid by the traveller to the passing funeral in these sequestered places; for such spectacles, occurring among the quiet abodes of nature, sink deep into the soul. As the mourning train approaches, he pauses, uncovered, to let it go by; he then follows silently in the rear; sometimes quite to the grave, at other times for a few hundred yards, and, having paid this tribute of respect to the deceased, turns and resumes his journey.\n\nThe rich vein of melancholy which runs through the English character, and gives it some of its most touching and ennobling graces, is finely evidenced in these pathetic customs, and in the solicitude shown by the common people for an honoured and a peaceful grave. The humblest peasant, whatever may be his lowly lot while living, is anxious that some little respect may be paid to his remains. Sir Thomas Overbury, describing the \"faire and happy milkmaid,\" observes, \"thus lives she, and all her care is, that she may die in the spring time, to have store of flowers stucke upon her winding-sheet.\" The poets, too, who always breathe the feeling of a nation, continually advert to this fond solicitude about the grave. In \"The Maid's Tragedy,\" by Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a beautiful instance of the kind, describing the capricious melancholy of a broken-hearted girl:\n\nWhen she sees a bank\nStuck full of flowers, she, with a sigh, will tell\nHer servants, what a pretty place it were\nTo bury lovers in; and make her maids\nPluck 'em, and strew her over like a curse.\nThe custom of decorating graves was once universally prevalent: osiers were carefully bent over them to keep the turf uninjured, and about them were planted evergreens and flowers. \"We adorn their graves,\" says Evelyn, in his Sylva, \"with flowers and redolent plants, just emblems of the life of man, which has been compared in Holy Scriptures to those fading beauties, whose roots being buried in dishonour, rise again in glory.\" This usage has now become extremely rare in England; but it may still be met with in the churchyards of retired villages, among the Welsh mountains; and I recollect an instance of it at the small town of Ruthen, which lies at the head of the beautiful vale of Clewedy. I have been told also by a friend, who was present at the funeral of a young girl in Glamorganshire, that the female attendants had their aprons full of flowers, which, as soon as the body was interred, they stuck about the grave.\n\nHe noticed several graves which had been decorated in the same manner. As the flowers had been merely stuck in the ground, and not planted, they had soon withered, and might be seen in various states of decay; some drooping, others quite perished. They were afterwards to be supplanted by holly, rosemary, and other evergreens; which on some graves had grown to great luxuriance, and overshadowed the tombstones.\n\nThere was formerly a melancholy fancifulness in the arrangement of these rustic offerings, that had something in it truly poetical. The rose was sometimes blended with the lily, to form a general emblem of frail mortality. \"This sweet flower,\" says Evelyn, \"borne on a branch set with thorns, and accompanied with the lily, are natural hieroglyphics of our fugitive, umbra-tile, anxious, and transitory life, which, making so fair a show for a time, is not yet without its thorns and crosses.\" The nature and colour of the flowers, and of the ribands with which they were tied, had often a particular reference to the qualities or story of the deceased, or were expressive of the feelings of the mourner. In an old poem, entitled, \"Corydon's Doleful Knell,\" a lover specifies the decorations he intends to use:\n\nA garland shall be framed\nBy art and nature's skill,\nOf sundry-colored flowers,\nIn tokens of good-will.\nAnd sundry-colored ribands\nOn it I will bestow;\nBut chalyb blacks and yellows\nWith her to grave shall go.\nI'll deck her tomb with flowers,\nThe nearest ever seen!\nAnd with my tears as showers,\nI'll keep them fresh and green.\nThe white rose, we are told, was planted at the grave of a virgin; her chaplet was tied with white ribands, in token of her spotless innocence; though sometimes black ribands were intermingled, to bespeak the grief of the survivors. The red rose was occasionally used in remembrance of such as had been remarkable for benevolence; but roses in general were appropriated to the graves of lovers. Evelyn tells us that the custom was not altogether extinct in his time, near his dwelling in the county of Surrey, \"where the maidens yearly planted and decked the graves of their defunct sweethearts with rose-bushes.\" And Camden likewise remarks, in his Britannia: \"Here is also a certain custom, observed time out of mind, of planting rose-trees upon the graves, especially by the young men and maids who have lost their loves; so that this churchyard is now full of them.\"\n\nWhen the deceased had been unhappy in their loves, emblems of a more gloomy character were used, such as the yew and cypress; and if flowers were strewn, they were of the most melancholy colours. Thus, in poems by Thomas Stanley, Esq. (published in 1651), is the following stanza:\n\nYet strew\nUpon my dismal grave\nSuch offerings as you have,\nForsaken cypresses and sad yews;\nFor kinder flowers can take no birth\nOr growth from such unhappy earth.\n\nIn \"The Maid's Tragedy,\" a pathetic little air is introduced, illustrative of this mode of decorating the funerals of females who had been disappointed in love:\n\nLay a garland on my hearse,\nOf the dismal yew,\nMaidens, willow branches wear,\nSay I died true.\nMy love was false, but I was firm,\nFrom my hour of birth,\nUpon my buried body lie\nLightly, gentle earth.\n\nThe natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate the mind; and we have a proof of it in the purity of sentiment and the unaffected elegance of thought which pervaded the whole of these funeral observances. Thus, it was an especial precaution, that none but sweet-scented evergreens and flowers should be employed. The intention seems to have been to soften the horrors of the tomb, to beguile the mind from brooding over the disgraces of perishing mortality, and to associate the memory of the deceased with the most delicate and beautiful objects in nature. There is a dismal process going on in the grave, cre-\n\ndust can retreat shrinks from form we have awakened when her i' the earth\n\nHerrick, also, in his flow of poetical thoughts on the dead in the grave, says:\n\nI might crow the poets, who wrote delightedly frequent quoted more than giving a passage trite; which ill in these floral magic of language stands pre-eminent.\n\nThere is certainly and spontaneous monuments of art is warm, and the osier round the labour of the chiselled sculptured marble.\n\nIt is greatly and touching hand in the most remote poetical custom\ndust can return to its kindred dust, which the imagination shrinks from contemplating; and we seek still to think of the form we have loved with those refined associations which it awakened when blooming before us in youth and beauty. \"Lay her i' the earth,\" says Laertes, of his virgin sister,\n\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\nMay violets spring!\n\nHerrick, also, in his \"Dirge of Jephtha,\" pours forth a fragrant flow of poetical thought and image, which in a manner embalms the dead in the recollections of the living.\n\nSleep in thy peace, thy bed of spice,\nAnd make this place all Paradise!\nMay sweets grow here! and smoke from hence\nFat frankincense.\nLet balme and cassis send their scent\nFrom out thy maiden monument.\nMay all thy maids at wonted hours\nCome forth to strew thy tombe with flowers!\nMay virgins, when they come to mourn,\nMale incense burn\nUpon thine altar! then return\nAnd leave thee sleeping in thine arm.\n\nI might crowd my page with extracts from the older British poets, who wrote when these rites were more prevalent, and delighted frequently to allude to them; but I have already quoted more than is necessary. I cannot, however, refrain from giving a passage from Shakspeare, even though it should appear trite; which illustrates the emblematical meaning often conveyed in these floral tributes; and at the same time possesses that magic of language and appositeness of imagery for which he stands pre-eminent.\n\nWith fairest flowers,\nWhilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,\nI'll sweeten thy sad grave; thou shalt not lack\nThe flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor\nThe asured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor\nThe leaf of eglantine; whom not to slander\nOnswest'nd not thy breath.\n\nThere is certainly something more affecting in these prompt and spontaneous offerings of nature, than in the most costly monuments of art; the hand strews the flower while the heart is warm, and the tear falls on the grave as affection is binding the osier round the sod; but pathos expires under the slow labour of the chisel, and is chilled among the cold conceits of sculptured marble.\n\nIt is greatly to be regretted, that a custom so truly elegant and touching has disappeared from general use, and exists only in the most remote and insignificant villages. But it seems as if poetical custom always shuns the walks of cultivated society.\nIn proportion as people grow polite they cease to be poetical. They talk of poetry, but they have learnt to check its free impulses, to distrust its sallying emotions, and to supply its most affecting and picturesque usages, by studied form and pompous ceremonial. Few pageants can be more stately and frigid than an English funeral in town. It is made up of show and gloomy parade; mourning carriages, mourning horses, mourning plumes, and hireling mourners, who make a mockery of grief. \"There is a grave digged,\" says Jeremy Taylor, \"and a solemn mourning, and a great talk in the neighbourhood, and when the daies are finished, they shall be, and they shall be remembered no more.\" The associate in the gay and crowded city is soon forgotten; the hurrying succession of new inmates and new pleasures effaces him from our minds, and the very scenes and circles in which he moved are incessantly fluctuating. But funerals in the country are solemnly impressive. The stroke of death makes a wider space in the village circle, and is an awful event in the tranquil uniformity of rural life. The passing bell tolls its knell in every ear; it steals with its pervading melancholy over hill and vale, and saddens all the landscape.\n\nThe fixed and unchanging features of the country also perpetuate the memory of the friend with whom we once enjoyed them; who was the companion of our most retired walks, and gave animation to every lonely scene. His idea is associated with every charm of nature; we hear his voice in the echo which he once delighted to awaken; his spirit haunts the grove which he once frequented; we think of him in the wild upland solitude, or amidst the pensive beauty of the valley. In the freshness of joyous morning, we remember his beaming smiles and bounding gaiety; and when sober evening returns, with its gathering shadows and subduing quiet, we call to mind many a twilight hour of gentle talk and sweet-souled melancholy.\n\nAnother cause that perpetuates the memory of the deceased in the country is that the grave is more immediately in sight of the survivors. They pass it on their way to prayer; it meets their eyes when their hearts are softened by the exercises of devotion; they linger about it on the Sabbath, when the mind is disengaged from worldly cares, and most disposed to turn aside from present pleasures and present loves, and to sit down among the solemn ministrations of the sanctuary kneel and pray for several Sundays. The rite of strewing flowers is always renewed, even when the senseless object vividly to mind the dear relatives and friends who died, and if a neighbour offers to offer compensation.\n\nI have dwelt on this subject because it is one of the last that the grave is the only thing that passion of the soul can feel. The impulses of men are continually refreshed by the sight of it, but the love that it excites is a bracer. The sight of it is filled with the charm of death, and disgust from the thought that truly spiritual love desire, and retires into the heart of the soul.\n\nThe sorrow of death refuses to be dispelled by every other affair, and it is a duty to keep off from the solitude. When the infant that perished in recollection is a child, how forget the most tender of lament? When the dear friend over whose grave closing upon his heart, as it were, accepts of consolation? No, the love which attributes of the soul are not soothed, and when the silent, gentle tear of death, the convulsive agonies of the loved, is softened, the soul was in the dark.\nthe solemn mementos of the past. In North Wales the peasantry kneel and pray over the graves of their deceased friends for several Sundays after the interment; and where the tender rite of strewing and planting flowers is still practised, it is always renewed on Easter, Whitsuntide, and other festivals, when the season brings the companion of former festivity more vividly to mind. It is also invariably performed by the nearest relatives and friends; no menials nor hirelings are employed; and if a neighbour yields assistance, it would be deemed an insult to offer compensation.\n\nI have dwelt upon this beautiful rural custom, because, as it is one of the last, so it is one of the holiest offices of love. The grave is the ordeal of true affection. It is there that the divine passion of the soul manifests its superiority to the instinctive impulses of mere animal attachment. The latter must be continually refreshed and kept alive by the presence of its object; but the love that is seated in the soul can live on long remembrance. The mere inclinations of sense languish and decline with the charms which excited them, and turn with shuddering disgust from the dismal precincts of the tomb: but it is thence that truly spiritual affection rises, purified from every sensual desire, and returns, like a holy flame, to illumine and sanctify the heart of the survivor.\n\nThe sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal\u2014every other affliction to forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open\u2014this affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother who would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from her arms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child that would willingly forget the most tender of parents, though to remember be but to lament? Who, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over whom he mourns? Who, even when the tomb is closing upon the remains of her he most loved; when he feels his heart, as it were, crushed in the closing of its portal; would accept of consolation that must be bought by forgetfulness?\u2014No, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights; and when the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of recollection; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive meditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness\u2014who would root out such a\nsorrow from the heart? Though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gaiety, or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom, yet who would exchange it, even for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry? No, there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living. Oh, the grave!\u2014the grave!\u2014It buries every error\u2014covers every defect\u2014extinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave even of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he should ever have warred with the poor handful of earth that lies mouldering before him!\n\nBut the grave of those we loved\u2014what a place for meditation! There it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue and gentleness, and the thousand endearments lavished upon us almost unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy\u2014there it is that we dwell upon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene. The bed of death, with all its stifled griefs\u2014its noiseless attendance\u2014its mute, watchful assiduities. The last testimonies of expiring love! The feeble, fluttering, thrilling\u2014oh! how thrilling!\u2014pressure of the hand! The faint, faltering accents, struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection! The last fond look of the glazing eye, turning upon us even from the threshold of existence!\n\nAy, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate. There settle the account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited\u2014every past endearment unregarded, of that departed being, who can never\u2014never\u2014never return to be soothed by thy contrition!\n\nIf thou art a child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul; or a furrow to the silvered brow of an affectionate parent\u2014if thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth\u2014if thou art a friend, and hast ever wronged, in thought, or word, or deed, the spirit that generously confided in thee\u2014if thou art a lover, and hast ever given one unmerited pang to that true heart which now lies cold and still beneath thy feet;\u2014then be sure that every unkind look, every ungracious word, every ungentele action, will come thronging back upon thy memory, and knocking dolefully at thy soul\u2014then be sure that thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave, and utter more deep, mournful words.\n\nThen weave about nature about the grave, with these tender words, by the bitterest tears henceforth be mindful of thy duties to the dead.\n\nIn writing this, I shall give full detail of the ceremonies merely to furnish the particular rites, to which has been given present form, and make them and casual a note of what is and learnedly inculcated.\n\nI must observe, adorning graves in England. Indeed, I have observed even by the grave lose its simplicity in his travels in London and recesses for bowers of greenery covered with the picture of filial piety, is as useful as it is to the sex. \"When the celebrated Iflana might trace much of my attention was mound of earth, protected from the her parent; and a monument more\n\nI will barely add once met among the village of Gersau Lucern, at the foot of miniature republic accessible on the\ngrave, and utter the unheard groan, and pour the unavailing tear; more deep, more bitter, because unheard and unavailing.\n\nThen weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of nature about the grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these tender, yet futile tributes of regret; but take warning by the bitterness of this thy contrite affliction over the dead, and henceforth be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living.\n\nIn writing the preceding article, it was not intended to give a full detail of the funeral customs of the English peasantry, but merely to furnish a few hints and quotations illustrative of particular rites, to be appended, by way of note, to another paper, which has been withheld. The article swelled insensibly into its present form, and this is mentioned as an apology for so brief and casual a notice of these usages, after they have been amply and learnedly investigated in other works.\n\nI must observe, also, that I am well aware that this custom of adorning graves with flowers prevails in other countries besides England. Indeed, in some it is much more general, and is observed even by the rich and fashionable; but it is then apt to lose its simplicity, and to degenerate into affectation. Bright, in his travels in Lower Hungary, tells us of monuments of marble, and recesses formed for retirement, with seats placed among bowers of green-house plants; and that the graves generally are covered with the gayest flowers of the season. He gives a casual picture of filial piety, which I cannot but describe; for I trust it is as useful as it is delightful, to illustrate the amiable virtues of the sex. \"When I was at Berlin,\" says he, \"I followed the celebrated Iffland to the grave. Mingled with some pomp, you might trace much real feeling. In the midst of the ceremony, my attention was attracted by a young woman, who stood on a mound of earth, newly covered with turf, which she anxiously protected from the feet of the passing crowd. It was the tomb of her parent; and the figure of this affectionate daughter presented a monument more striking than the most costly work of art.\"\n\nI will barely add an instance of sepulchral decoration that I once met among the mountains of Switzerland. It was at the village of Gersau, which stands on the borders of the Lake of Lucern, at the foot of Mount Rigi. It was once the capital of a miniature republic, shut up between the Alps and the Lake, and accessible on the land side only by foot-paths. The whole force\nof the republic did not exceed six hundred fighting men; and a few miles of circumference, scooped out, as it were, from the bosom of the mountains, comprised its territory. The village of Gersau seemed separated from the rest of the world, and retained the golden simplicity of a purer age. It had a small church, with a burying-ground adjoining. At the heads of the graves were placed crosses of wood or iron. On some were affixed miniatures, rudely executed, but evidently attempts at likenesses of the deceased. On the crosses were hung chaplets of flowers\u2014some withering, others fresh, as if occasionally renewed. I paused with interest at this scene; I felt that I was at the source of poetical description, for these were the beautiful but unaffected offerings of the heart which poets are fain to record. In a gayer and more populous place, I should have suspected them to have been suggested by factitious sentiment, derived from books; but the good people of Gersau knew little of books; there was not a novel nor a love poem in the village; and I question whether any peasant of the place dreamt, while he was twining a fresh chaplet for the grave of his mistress, that he was fulfilling one of the most fanciful rites of poetical devotion, and that he was practically a poet.\n\nTHE INN KITCHEN.\n\nShall I not take mine ease in mine inn?\u2014Falstaff.\n\nDuring a journey that I once made through the Netherlands, I had arrived one evening at the Pomme d'Or, the principal inn of a small Flemish village. It was after the hour of the table d'h\u00f4te, so that I was obliged to make a solitary supper from the relics of its ampler board. The weather was chilly.; I was seated alone in one end of a great gloomy dining-room, and, my repast being over, I had the prospect before me of a long dull evening, without any visible means of enlivening it. I summoned mine host, and requested something to read; he brought me the whole literary stock of his household, a Dutch family Bible, an almanac in the same language, and a number of old Paris newspapers. As I sat dozing over one of the latter, reading old news and stale criticisms, my ear was now and then struck with bursts of laughter which seemed to proceed from the kitchen. Every one that has travelled on the continent must know how favourite a resort the kitchen of a country inn is to the middle and inferior order of travellers; particularly in that equivocal kind of weather, when a fire becomes agreeable toward evening. I threw aside the newspapers, and took a peep at the composed party assembled in a diligence, surrounded by of inns. They might have been worshipping. A resplendent brass copper tea-kettle stood upon the ground. Its yellow rays glided duskily away, casting mellow radiance, which reflected back from the midst of obscurely hanging pendants in heavy chains, appended to it,\n\nMany of them were filled with sound, which was occasioned by the clatter of a dry wenches adventures; and by the bursts of honey-sweet music in that temple of song.\n\nAs I had no intention of evening, I took advantage of travellers' leisure. All of them, however, except one, who thought it derived its origin from the peculiar air of the voluptuous old Swede, who was dressed in a short belt found his way from hips to the ankles, with a double chin, whose hair was lighted by a travelling-cap and more than once by auditors; and which times he called the buxom kite.\n\nI wish my friend\naside the newspaper, and explored my way to the kitchen, to take a peep at the group that appeared to be so merry. It was composed partly of travellers who had arrived some hours before in a diligence, and partly of the usual attendants and hangers-on of inns. They were seated round a great burnished stove, that might have been mistaken for an altar, at which they were worshipping. It was covered with various kitchen vessels of resplendent brightness; among which steamed and hissed a huge copper tea-kettle. A large lamp threw a strong mass of light upon the group, bringing out many odd features in strong relief. Its yellow rays partially illumined the spacious kitchen, dying duskily away into remote corners; except where they settled in mellow radiance on the broad side of a flitch of bacon, or were reflected back from well-scoured utensils that gleamed from the midst of obscurity. A strapping Flemish lass, with long golden pendants in her ears, and a necklace with a golden heart suspended to it, was the presiding priestess of the temple.\n\nMany of the company were furnished with pipes, and most of them with some kind of evening potation. I found their mirth was occasioned by anecdotes, which a little swarthy Frenchman, with a dry weazen face and large whiskers, was giving of his love adventures; at the end of each of which there was one of those bursts of honest unceremonious laughter, in which a man indulges in that temple of true liberty, an inn.\n\nAs I had no better mode of getting through a tedious blustering evening, I took my seat near the stove, and listened to a variety of travellers' tales, some very extravagant, and most very dull. All of them, however, have faded from my treacherous memory except one, which I will endeavour to relate. I fear, however, it derived its chief zest from the manner in which it was told, and the peculiar air and appearance of the narrator. He was a corpulent old Swiss, who had the look of a veteran traveller. He was dressed in a tarnished green travelling-jacket, with a broad belt round his waist, and a pair of overalls, with buttons from the hips to the ankles. He was of a full rubicund countenance, with a double chin, aquiline nose, and a pleasant twinkling eye. His hair was light, and curled from under an old green velvet travelling-cap stuck on one side of his head. He was interrupted more than once by the arrival of guests, or the remarks of his auditors; and paused now and then to replenish his pipe; at which times he had generally a roguish leer, and a sly joke for the buxom kitchen-maid.\n\nI wish my readers could imagine the old fellow lolling in a\nhuge arm-chair, one arm akimbo, the other holding a curiously twisted tobacco-pipe, formed of genuine \u00e9cume de mer, decorated with silver chain and silken tassel\u2014his head cocked on one side, and a whimsical cut of the eye occasionally, as he related the following story.\n\nTHE SPECTRE BRIDEGROOM.\n\nA TRAVELLER'S TALE.*\n\nHe that suppers for is slight,\nHe lies full cold, I trow, this night!\nYe treen to chamber I him led,\nThis night Gray-Steel has made his bed.\n\nSIR EDDIE, SIR GRANAME, AND SIR GRAY-STEEL.\n\nOn the summit of one of the heights of the Odenwald, a wild and romantic tract of Upper Germany, that lies not far from the confluence of the Maine and the Rhine, there stood, many, many years since, the Castle of the Baron Von Landshort. It is now quite fallen to decay, and almost buried among beech-trees and dark firs; above which, however, its old watch-tower may still be seen struggling, like the former possessor, I have mentioned, to carry a high head, and look down upon the neighbouring country.\n\nThe baron was a dry branch of the great family of Katzellenbogen,\u2020 and inherited the relics of the property, and all the pride of his ancestors. Though the warlike disposition of his predecessors had much impaired the family possessions, yet the baron still endeavoured to keep up some show of former state. The times were peaceable, and the German nobles, in general, had abandoned their inconvenient old castles, perched like eagles' nests among the mountains, and had built more convenient residences in the valleys: still the baron remained proudly drawn up in his little fortress, cherishing, with hereditary inveteracy, all the old family feuds; so that he was on ill terms with some of his nearest neighbours, on account of disputes that had happened between their great-great-grandfathers.\n\nThe baron had but one child, a daughter; but nature, when she grants but one child, always compensates by making it a prodigy; and so it was with the daughter of the baron. All the nurses, gossips, and country cousins, assured her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all Germany; and who should know better than they? She had, moreover, been brought up\n\n* The credulous reader, well versed in good-for-nothing lore, will perceive that the above tale must have been suggested to the old Swiss by a little French anecdote, a circumstance said to have taken place at Paris.\n\n\u2020 i.e., CAT's-ELBOW\u2014the name of a family of those parts very powerful in former times. The appellation, we are told, was given in compliment to a peerless dame of the family, celebrated for her fine arm.\nwith great care under the superintendence of two maiden aunts, who had spent some years of their early life at one of the little German courts, and were skilled in all the branches of knowledge necessary to the education of a fine lady. Under their instructions she became a miracle of accomplishments. By the time she was eighteen, she could embroider to admiration, and had worked whole histories of the saints in tapestry, with such strength of expression in their countenances, that they looked like so many souls in purgatory. She could read without great difficulty, and had spelled her way through several church legends, and almost all the chivalric wonders of the Heldentheater. She had even made considerable proficiency in writing; could sign her own name without missing a letter, and so legibly that her aunts could read it without spectacles. She excelled in making little elegant good-for-nothing lady-like nicknacks of all kinds; was versed in the most abstruse dancing of the day; played a number of airs on the harp and guitar; and knew all the tender ballads of the Minnielieders by heart.\n\nHer aunts, too, having been great flirts and coquettes in their younger days, were admirably calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict censors of the conduct of their niece; for there is no duenna so rigidly prudent, and inexorably decorous, as a superannuated coquette. She was rarely suffered out of their sight; never went beyond the domains of the castle, unless well attended, or rather well watched; had continual lectures read to her about strict decorum and implicit obedience; and, as to the men\u2014pah!\u2014she was taught to hold them at such a distance, and in such absolute distrust, that, unless properly authorized, she would not have cast a glance upon the handsomest cavalier in the world\u2014no, not if he wore even dying at her feet.\n\nThe good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent. The young lady was a pattern of docility and correctness. While others were wasting their sweetness in the glare of the world, and liable to be plucked and thrown aside by every hand, she was coyly blooming into fresh and lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate spinsters, like a rose-bud blushing forth among guardian thorns. Her aunts looked upon her with pride and exultation, and vaunted that though all the other young ladies in the world might go astray, yet, thank Heaven, nothing of the kind could happen to the heiress of Katzenellenbogen.\n\nBut, however scantily the Baron Von Landshort might be provided with children, his household was by no means a\nsmall one; for Providence had enriched him with abundance of poor relations. They, one and all, possessed the affectionate disposition common to humble relatives; were wonderfully attached to the baron, and took every possible occasion to come in swarms and enliven the castle. All family festivals were commemorated by these good people at the baron's expense; and when they were filled with good cheer, they would declare that there was nothing on earth so delightful as these family meetings, these jubilees of the heart.\n\nThe baron, though a small man, had a large soul, and it swelled with satisfaction at the consciousness of being the greatest man in the little world about him. He loved to tell long stories about the stark old warriors whose portraits looked grimly down from the walls around, and he found no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense. He was much given to the marvellous, and a firm believer in all those supernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in Germany abounds. The faith of his guests exceeded even his own; they listened to every tale of wonder with open eyes and mouth, and never failed to be astonished, even though repeated for the hundredth time. Thus lived the Baron Von Landshort, the oracle of his table, the absolute monarch of his little territory, and happy, above all things, in the persuasion that he was the wisest man of the age.\n\nAt the time of which my story treats, there was a great family gathering at the castle, on an affair of the utmost importance; it was to receive the destined bridegroom of the baron's daughter. A negotiation had been carried on between the father and an old nobleman of Bavaria, to unite the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children. The preliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio. The young people were betrothed without seeing each other, and the time was appointed for the marriage ceremony. The young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army for the purpose, and was actually on his way to the baron's to receive his bride. Missives had even been received from him, from Wurtzburg, where he was accidentally detained, mentioning the day and hour when he might be expected to arrive.\n\nThe castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a suitable welcome. The fair bride had been decked out with uncommon care. The two aunts had superintended her toilet, and quarrelled the whole morning about every article of her dress. The young lady had taken advantage of their contest to follow the bent of her own taste, and fortunately it was a good one. She looked as lovely as expectation had promised.\n\nThe suffusion of the heaving of the sea betrayed the approach of night. The aunts were anxious; the aunts are always anxious. They were grateful to herself, what more to her lover.\n\nThe baron, however, in truth, nothing but a bustling little fellow, the world was in a whirl. The castle with all its servants from the cook to the buzzed about as if they were fortunate as a bee.\n\nIn the meantime, the baron had rung with the sound of a crowded with the noise of the oceans of Rhine and Main. Heidelberg turned its head, and was ready to receive him. In the true spirit of the baron to make his appearance, he had poured himself into the wald, now just beginning. The baron mounted his horse, hopes of catching up with him. Once he thought of counting from the number of horses that came along the road; but, as they climbed the mountain, they disappeared in the last ray of sunlight. It was twilight\u2014the evening star\u2014nothing appeared. He was going homeward.\n\nWhile the baron was in perplexity, a very strange thing happened. A part of the Odenwald...\nas lovely as youthful bridegroom could desire; and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre of her charms.\n\nThe suffusions that mantled her face and neck, the gentle heaving of the bosom, the eye now and then lost in reverie, all betrayed the soft tumult that was going on in her little heart. The aunts were continually hovering around her; for maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in affairs of this nature. They were giving her a world of staid counsel how to deport herself, what to say, and in what manner to receive the expected lover.\n\nThe baron was no less busied in preparations. He had, in truth, nothing exactly to do; but he was naturally a fuming, bustling little man, and could not remain passive when all the world was in a hurry. He worried from top to bottom of the castle with an air of infinite anxiety; he continually called the servants from their work to exhort them to be diligent; and buzzed about every hall and chamber as idly restless and unfortunate as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day.\n\nIn the meantime the fatted calf had been killed; the forests had rung with the clamour of the huntsmen; the kitchen was crowded with good cheer; the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of Rhein-wein and Ferne-wein; and even the great Heidelberg tun had been laid under contribution. Everything was ready to receive the distinguished guest with Saus and Braus in the true spirit of German hospitality\u2014but the guest delayed to make his appearance. Hour rolled after hour. The sun, that had poured his downward rays upon the rich forest of the Odenwald, now just gleamed along the summits of the mountains. The baron mounted the highest tower, and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a distant sight of the count and his attendants. Once he thought he beheld them; the sound of horns came floating from the valley, prolonged by the mountain echoes. A number of horsemen were seen far below, slowly advancing along the road; but when they had nearly reached the foot of the mountain, they suddenly struck off in a different direction. The last ray of sunshine departed\u2014the bats began to flit by in the twilight\u2014the road grew dimmer and dimmer to the view, and nothing appeared stirring in it, but now and then a peasant lagging homeward from his labour.\n\nWhile the old castle of Landshott was in this state of perplexity, a very interesting scene was transacting in a different part of the Odenwald.\nThe young Count Von Altenburg was tranquilly pursuing his route in that sober jog-trot way in which a man travels towards matrimony when his friends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his hands, and a bride is waiting for him as certainly as a dinner at the end of his journey. He had encountered at Wurtzburg a youthful companion in arms, with whom he had seen some service on the frontiers; Herman Von Starkenfaust, one of the stoutest hands and worthiest hearts of German chivalry, who was now returning from the army. His father's castle was not far distant from the old fortress of Landshott, although an hereditary feud rendered the families hostile and strangers to each other.\n\nIn the warm-hearted moment of recognition, the young friends related all their past adventures and fortunes, and the count gave the whole history of his intended nuptials with a young lady whom he had never seen, but of whose charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions.\n\nAs the route of the friends lay in the same direction, they agreed to perform the rest of their journey together; and, that they might do it the more leisurely, set off from Wurtzburg at an early hour, the count having given directions for his retinue to follow and overtake him.\n\nThey beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their military scenes and adventures; but the count was apt to be a little tedious, now and then, about the reputed charms of his bride, and the felicity that awaited him.\n\nIn this way they had entered among the mountains of the Odenwald, and were traversing one of its most lonely and thickly-wooded passes. It is well known that the forests of Germany have always been as much infested by robbers as its castles by spectres; and, at this time, the former were particularly numerous, from the hordes of disbanded soldiers wandering about the country. It will not appear extraordinary, therefore, that the cavaliers were attacked by a gang of these stragglers, in the midst of the forest. They defended themselves with bravery, but were nearly overpowered, when the count's retinue arrived to their assistance. At sight of them the robbers fled, but not until the count had received a mortal wound. He was slowly and carefully conveyed back to the city of Wurtzburg, and a friar summoned from a neighbouring convent, who was famous for his skill in administering to both soul and body; but half of his skill was superfluous; the moments of the unfortunate count were numbered.\n\nWith his constant to the last, his not keeping most ardent men, and appeared speedily and said he, \"I shall my last words with impressive, and to soothe him and gave him it in acknowledgment his bride\u2014his that he might fancied act of Starkenfaust fate of his comrade he had under complexed; for he hostile people, their hopes. his bosom to cautiously shut admirer of the enterprise in adventure.\n\nPrevious to the holy fraternity friend, who was some of his ill count took charge.\n\nIt is now high of Katzenellenb more for their left airing himself.\n\nNight closed ascended from the been delayed from The meats were whole household induced by family orders for the f\nWith his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair instantly to the castle of Landshort, and explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his appointment with his bride. Though not the most ardent of lovers, he was one of the most punctilious of men, and appeared earnestly solicitous that his mission should be speedily and courteously executed. \"Unless this is done,\" said he, \"I shall not sleep quietly in my grave!\" He repeated these last words with peculiar solemnity. A request, at a moment so impressive, admitted of no hesitation. Starkenfaust endeavoured to soothe him to calmness; promised faithfully to execute his wish, and gave him his hand in solemn pledge. The dying man pressed it in acknowledgment, but soon lapsed into delirium\u2014raved about his bride\u2014his engagements\u2014his plighted word; ordered his horse, that he might ride to the castle of Landshort; and expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the saddle.\n\nStarkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier's tear on the untimely fate of his comrade; and then pondered on the awkward mission he had undertaken. His heart was heavy, and his head perplexed; for he was to present himself an unbidden guest among hostile people, and to damp their festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes. Still there were certain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this far-famed beauty of Katzenellenbogen, so cautiously shut up from the world; for he was a passionate admirer of the sex, and there was a dash of eccentricity and enterprise in his character that made him fond of all simple adventure.\n\nPrevious to his departure he made all due arrangements with the holy fraternity of the convent for the funeral solemnities of his friend, who was to be buried in the cathedral of Wurtzburg, near some of his illustrious relatives; and the mourning retinue of the count took charge of his remains.\n\nIt is now high time that we should return to the ancient family of Katzenellenbogen, who were impatient for their guest, and still more for their dinner; and to the worthy little baron, whom we left airing himself on the watch-tower.\n\nNight closed in, but still no guest arrived. The baron descended from the tower in despair. The banquet, which had been delayed from hour to hour, could no longer be postponed. The meats were already overdone; the cook in an agony; and the whole household had the look of a garrison that had been reduced by famine. The baron was obliged reluctantly to give orders for the feast without the presence of the guest. All were\nseated at table, and just on the point of commencing, when the sound of a horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger. Another long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes, and was answered by the warder from the walls. The baron hastened to receive his future son-in-law.\n\nThe drawbridge had been let down, and the stranger was before the gate. He was a tall gallant cavalier, mounted on a black steed. His countenance was pale, but he had a beaming, romantic eye, and an air of stately melancholy. The baron was a little mortified that he should have come in this simple, solitary style. His dignity for a moment was ruffled, and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper respect for the important occasion, and the important family with which he was to be connected. He pacified himself, however, with the conclusion, that it must have been youthful impatience which had induced him thus to spur on sooner than his attendants.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said the stranger, \"to break in upon you thus unseasonably\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHere the baron interrupted him with a world of compliments and greetings, for, to tell the truth, he prided himself upon his courtesy and eloquence. The stranger attempted, once or twice, to stem the torrent of words, but in vain; so he bowed his head, and suffered it to flow on. By the time the baron had come to a pause, they had reached the inner court of the castle; and the stranger was again about to speak, when he was once more interrupted by the appearance of the female part of the family, leading forth the shrinking and blushing bride. He gazed on her for a moment as one entranced; it seemed as if his whole soul beamed forth in the gaze, and rested upon that lovely form. One of the maiden aunts whispered something in her ear; she made an effort to speak; her moist blue eye was timidly raised; gave a shy glance of inquiry on the stranger; and was cast again to the ground. The words died away; but there was a sweet smile playing about her lips, and a soft dimpling of the cheek that showed her glance had not been unsatisfactory. It was impossible for a girl of the fond age of eighteen, highly predisposed for love and matrimony, not to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier.\n\nThe late hour at which the guest had arrived left no time for parley. The baron was peremptory, and deferred all particular conversation until the morning, and led the way to the untasted banquet.\n\nIt was served up in the great hall of the castle. Around the walls hung the arms of Katzenellenbogen, the field and innumerable spears, and tales of sylvan warfare; and grinned horrible pair of antlers of a youthful bridegroom.\n\nThe cavalier was absorbed in admiration that could not be loud; but whereas the softest whisper of tenderness and gravity in his effect upon the young couple were compared in love with each other.\n\nThe feast went on; they were all blessed with purses and mounds stories, and never had such effect. If there was any astonishment; laugh exactly in the great men, was to be always enforced by the heimer; and even the jolly old wine, is poorer and keener on similar occasions; that almost convulsed or two roared out at the baron, that abounds.\n\nAmidst all this singular and unseasonable deeper cast of dejected\nwalls hung the hard-favoured portraits of the heroes of the house of Katzenellenbogen, and the trophies which they had gained in the field and in the chase. Hacked corslets, splintered jousting spears, and tattered banners, were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare; the jaws of the wolf, and the tusks of the boar, grinned horribly among cross-bows and battle-axes, and a huge pair of antlers branched immediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom.\n\nThe cavalier took but little notice of the company, or the entertainment. He scarcely tasted the banquet, but seemed absorbed in admiration of his bride. He conversed in a low tone that could not be overheard\u2014for the language of love is never loud; but where is the female ear so dull that it cannot catch the softest whisper of the lover? There was a mingled tenderness and gravity in his manner, that appeared to have a powerful effect upon the young lady. Her colour came and went as she listened with deep attention. Now and then she made some blushing reply, and when his eye was turned away, she would steal a sidelong glance at his romantic countenance, and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness. It was evident that the young couple were completely enamoured. The aunts, who were deeply versed in the mysteries of the heart, declared that they had fallen in love with each other at first sight.\n\nThe feast went on merrily, or, at least, noisily, for the guests were all blessed with those keen appetites that attend upon light purses and mountain air. The baron told his best and longest stories, and never had he told them so well, or with such great effect. If there was anything marvellous, his auditors were lost in astonishment; and if anything facetious, they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place. The baron, it is true, like most great men, was too dignified to utter any joke but a dull one; it was always enforced, however, by a bumper of excellent Hockheimer; and even a dull joke, at one's own table, served up with jolly old wine, is irresistible. Many good things were said by poorer and keener wits, that would not bear repeating, except on similar occasions; many sly speeches whispered in ladies' ears, that almost convulsed them with suppressed laughter; and a song or two roared out by a poor, but merry and broad-faced cousin of the baron, that absolutely made the maiden aunts hold up their fans.\n\nAmidst all this revelry, the stranger guest maintained a most singular and unseasonable gravity. His countenance assumed a deeper cast of dejection as the evening advanced; and, strange as\nit may appear, even the baron's jokes seemed only to render him the more melancholy. At times he was lost in thought, and at times there was a perturbed and restless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease. His conversations with the bride became more and more earnest and mysterious. Lowering clouds began to steal over the fair serenity of her brow, and tremours to run through her tender frame.\n\nAll this could not escape the notice of the company. Their gaiety was chilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom; their spirits were infected; whispers and glances were interchanged, accompanied by shrugs and dubious shakes of the head. The song and the laugh grew less and less frequent; there were dreary pauses in the conversation, which were at length succeeded by wild tales and supernatural legends. One dismal story produced another still more dismal, and the baron nearly frightened some of the ladies into hysterics with the history of the goblin horseman that carried away the fair Leonora; a dreadful story, which has since been put into excellent verse, and is read and believed by all the world.\n\nThe bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention. He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the baron, and, as the story drew to a close, began gradually to rise from his seat; growing taller and taller, until, in the baron's entranced eye, he seemed almost to tower into a giant. The moment the tale was finished he heaved a deep sigh, and took a solemn farewell of the company. They were all amazement. The baron was perfectly thunderstruck.\n\n\"What! going to leave the castle at midnight? why, everything was prepared for his reception; a chamber was ready for him if he wished to retire.\"\n\nThe stranger shook his head mournfully and mysteriously; \"I must lay my head in a different chamber to-night!\"\n\nThere was something in this reply, and the tone in which it was uttered, that made the baron's heart misgive him; but he rallied his forces, and repeated his hospitable entreaties.\n\nThe stranger shook his head silently, but positively, at every offer; and, waving his farewell to the company, stalked slowly out of the hall. The maiden aunts were absolutely petrified\u2014the bride hung her head, and a tear stole to her eye.\n\nThe baron followed the stranger to the great court of the castle, where the black charger stood pawing the earth, and snorting with impatience. When they had reached the portal, whose deep archway was dimly lighted by a cresset, the stranger paused, and addressed the roof rendered\n\n\"Now that reason of my movement\u2014\"\n\n\"Why,\" said place?\"\n\n\"It admits must away to\n\n\"Ay,\" said morrow\u2014to-morrow\u2014\n\n\"No! no!\" engagement is I am a dead man at Wurtzburg\u2014waiting for me\u2014\n\nHe sprang off and the clattering of the night-black\n\nThe baron rose and related what sickened at the the opinion of famous in Germ wood-demons, a good people of time immemorial that it might be that the very so melancholy indignation of who looked upon was fain to abjure the faith of the But whatever completely put missives, confirm and his intermen The dismay shut himself up rejoice with him tress. They were in the hall, shak\naddressed the baron in a hollow tone of voice, which the vaulted roof rendered still more sepulchral.\n\n\"Now that we are alone,\" said he, \"I will impart to you the reason of my going. I have a solemn, an indispensable engagement\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the baron, \"cannot you send some one in your place?\"\n\n\"It admits of no substitute\u2014I must attend it in person\u2014I must away to Wurtzburg cathedral\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the baron, plucking up spirit, \"but not until to-morrow\u2014to-morrow you shall take your bride there.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" replied the stranger, with tenfold solemnity, \"my engagement is with no bride\u2014the worms! the worms expect me! I am a dead man\u2014I have been slain by robbers\u2014my body lies at Wurtzburg\u2014at midnight I am to be buried\u2014the grave is waiting for me\u2014I must keep my appointment!\"\n\nHe sprang on his black charger, dashed over the drawbridge and the clattering of his horse's hoofs was lost in the whistling of the night-blast.\n\nThe baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation, and related what had passed. Two ladies fainted outright, others sickened at the idea of having banqueted with a spectre. It was the opinion of some, that this might be the wild huntsman, famous in German legend. Some talked of mountain sprites, of wood-demons, and of other supernatural beings, with which the good people of Germany have been so grievously harassed since time immemorial. One of the poor relations ventured to suggest that it might be some sportive evasion of the young cavalier, and that the very gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy a personage. This, however, drew on him the indignation of the whole company, and especially of the baron, who looked upon him as little better than an infidel; so that he was fain to abjure his heresy as speedily as possible, and come into the faith of the true believers.\n\nBut whatever may have been the doubts entertained, they were completely put to an end by the arrival, next day, of regular missives, confirming the intelligence of the young count's murder, and his interment in Wurtzburg cathedral.\n\nThe dismay at the castle may well be imagined. The baron shut himself up in his chamber. The guests, who had come to rejoice with him, could not think of abandoning him in his distress. They wandered about the courts, or collected in groups in the hall, shaking their heads and shrugging their shoulders, at\nthe troubles of so good a man; and sat longer than ever at table, and ate and drank more stoutly than ever, by way of keeping up their spirits. But the situation of the widowed bride was the most pitiable. To have lost a husband before she had even embraced him\u2014and such a husband! if the very spectre could be so gracious and noble, what must have been the living man? She filled the house with lamentations.\n\nOn the night of the second day of her widowhood she had retired to her chamber, accompanied by one of her aunts, who insisted on sleeping with her. The aunt, who was one of the best tellers of ghost-stories in all Germany, had just been recounting one of her longest, and had fallen asleep in the very midst of it. The chamber was remote, and overlooked a small garden. The niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the rising moon, as they trembled on the leaves of an aspen-tree before the lattice. The castle clock had just tolled midnight, when a soft strain of music stole up from the garden. She rose hastily from her bed, and stepped lightly to the window. A tall figure stood among the shadows of the trees. As it raised its head, a beam of moonlight fell upon the countenance. Heaven and earth! she beheld the Spectre Bridegroom! A loud shriek at that moment burst upon her ear, and her aunt, who had been awakened by the music, and had followed her silently to the window, fell into her arms. When she looked again, the spectre had disappeared.\n\nOf the two females, the aunt now required the most soothing, for she was perfectly beside herself with terror. As to the young lady, there was something, even in the spectre of her lover, that seemed endearing. There was still the semblance of manly beauty; and though the shadow of a man is but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a love-sick girl, yet, where the substance is not to be had, even that is consoling. The aunt declared she never would sleep in that chamber again; the niece, for once, was refractory, and declared as strongly that she would sleep in no other in the castle: the consequence was, that she had to sleep in it alone: but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story of the spectre, lest she should be denied the only melancholy pleasure left her on earth\u2014that of inhabiting the chamber over which the guardian shade of her lover kept its nightly vigils.\n\nHow long the good old lady would have observed this promise is uncertain, for she dearly loved to talk of the marvellous, and there is a triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story; it\nTHE SPECTRE BRIDEGROOM.\n\nis, however, still quoted in the neighbourhood, as a memorable instance of female secrecy, that she kept it to herself for a whole week; when she was suddenly absolved from all further restraint, by intelligence brought to the breakfast-table one morning that the young lady was not to be found. Her room was empty\u2014the bed had not been slept in\u2014the window was open, and the bird had flown!\n\nThe astonishment and concern with which the intelligence was received, can only be imagined by those who have witnessed the agitation which the mishaps of a great man cause among his friends. Even the poor relations paused for a moment from the indefatigable labours of the trencher; when the aunt, who had at first been struck speechless, wrung her hands, and shrieked out, \"The goblin! the goblin! she's carried away by the goblin!\"\n\nIn a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden, and concluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride. Two of the domestics corroborated the opinion, for they had heard the clattering of a horse's hoofs down the mountain about midnight, and had no doubt that it was the spectre on his black charger, bearing her away to the tomb. All present were struck with the direful probability; for events of the kind are extremely common in Germany, as many well-authenticated histories bear witness.\n\nWhat a lamentable situation was that of the poor baron! What a heart-rending dilemma for a fond father, and a member of the great family of Katzenellenbogen! His only daughter had either been rapt away to the grave, or he was to have some wood-demon for a son-in-law, and perchance, a troop of goblin grandchildren. As usual, he was completely bewildered, and all the castle in an uproar. The men were ordered to take horse, and scour every road and path and glen of the Odenwald. The baron himself had just drawn on his jack-boots, girded on his sword, and was about to mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest, when he was brought to a pause by a new apparition. A lady was seen approaching the castle, mounted on a palfrey, attended by a cavalier on horseback. She galloped up to the gate, sprang from her horse, and falling at the baron's feet, embraced his knees. It was his lost daughter, and her companion\u2014the Spectre Bridgroom! The baron was astounded. He looked at his daughter, then at the spectre, and almost doubted the evidence of his senses. The latter, too, was wonderfully improved in his appearance since his visit to the world of spirits. His dress was splendid, and set off a noble figure of manly symmetry. He was no longer pale and melancholy. His\nfine countenance was flushed with the glow of youth, and joy rioted in his large dark eye.\n\nThe mystery was soon cleared up. The cavalier (for, in truth, as you must have known all the while, he was no goblin) announced himself as Sir Herman Von Starkenfaust. He related his adventure with the young count. He told how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the unwelcome tidings, but that the eloquence of the baron had interrupted him in every attempt to tell his tale. How the sight of the bride had completely captivated him, and that to pass a few hours near her, he had tacitly suffered the mistake to continue. How he had been sorely perplexed in what way to make a decent retreat, until the baron's goblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit. How, fearing the feudal hostility of the family, he had repeated his visits by stealth\u2014had haunted the garden beneath the young lady's window\u2014had wooed\u2014had won\u2014had borne away in triumph\u2014and, in a word, had wedded the fair.\n\nUnder any other circumstances the baron would have been inflexible, for he was tenacious of paternal authority, and devoutly obstinate in all family feuds; but he loved his daughter; he had lamented her as lost; he rejoiced to find her still alive; and, though her husband was of a hostile house, yet, thank heaven, he was not a goblin. There was something, it must be acknowledged, that did not exactly accord with his notions of strict veracity, in the joke the knight had passed upon him of his being a dead man; but several old friends present, who had served in the wars, assured him that every stratagem was excusable in love, and that the cavalier was entitled to especial privilege, having lately served as a trooper.\n\nMatters, therefore, were happily arranged. The baron pardoned the young couple on the spot. The revels at the castle were resumed. The poor relations overwhelmed this new member of the family with loving-kindness; he was so gallant, so generous\u2014and so rich. The aunts, it is true, were somewhat scandalized that their system of strict seclusion and passive obedience should be so badly exemplified, but attributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows grated. One of them was particularly mortified at having her marvellous story marred, and that the only spectre she had ever seen should turn out a counterfeit; but the niece seemed perfectly happy at having found him substantial flesh and blood\u2014and so the story ends.\n\nOn one latter part of almost minge the year, I paid Abbey.

B., 1596.\n\nOn one of those sober and rather melancholy days, in the latter part of autumn, when the shadows of morning and evening almost mingle together, and throw a gloom over the decline of the year, I passed several hours in rambling about Westminster Abbey. There was something congenial to the season in the mournful magnificence of the old pile; and as I passed its threshold, seemed like stepping back into the regions of antiquity, and losing myself among the shades of former ages.\n\nI entered from the inner court of Westminster School, through a long, low, vaulted passage, that had an almost subterranean look, being dimly lighted in one part by circular perforations in the massive walls. Through this dark avenue I had a distant view of the cloisters, with the figure of an old verger, in his black gown, moving along their shadowy vaults, and seeming like a spectre from one of neighbouring tombs. The approach to the abbey through these gloomy monastic remains prepares the mind for its solemn contemplation. The cloisters still retain something of the quiet and seclusion of former days. The grey walls are discoloured by damps, and crumbling with age; a coat of hoary moss has gathered over the inscriptions of the mural monuments, and obscured the death's heads and other funereal emblems. The sharp touches of the chisel are gone from the rich tracery of the arches; the roses which adorned the keystones have lost their leafy beauty; everything bears marks of the gradual dilapidations of time, which yet has something touching and pleasing in its very decay.\n\nThe sun was pouring down a yellow autumnal ray into the square of the cloisters; beaming upon a scanty plot of grass in the centre, and lighting up an angle of the vaulted passage with a kind of dusky splendour. From between the arcades the eye\nglanced up to a bit of blue sky or a passing cloud, and beheld\nthe sun-gilt pinnacles of the abbey towering into the azure\nheaven.\n\nAs I paced the cloisters, sometimes contemplating this mingled\npicture of glory and decay, and sometimes endeavouring to\ndecipher the inscriptions on the tombstones, which formed the\npavement beneath my feet, my eye was attracted to three figures,\nrudely carved in relief, but nearly worn away by the footsteps of\nmany generations. They were the effigies of three of the early\nabbots; the epitaphs were entirely effaced; the names alone\nremained, having no doubt been renewed in later times. (Vitalis.\nAbbas. 1082, and Gislebertus Crispinus. Abbas. 1114, and\nLaurentius. Abbas. 1176.) I remained some little while, musing\nover these casual relics of antiquity, thus left like wrecks upon\nthis distant shore of time, telling no tale but that such beings had\nbeen and had perished; teaching no moral but the futility of that\npride which hopes still to exact homage in its ashes, and to live\nin an inscription. A little longer, and even these faint records\nwill be obliterated, and the monument will cease to be a memorial.\nWhilst I was yet looking down upon these gravestones, I was\nroused by the sound of the abbey clock, reverberating from\nbuttress to buttress, and echoing among the cloisters. It is almost\nstartling to hear this warning of departed time sounding among\nthe tombs, and telling the lapse of the hour, which, like a billow,\nhas rolled us onward towards the grave. I pursued my walk to\nan arched door opening to the interior of the abbey. On entering\nhere, the magnitude of the building breaks fully upon the mind,\ncontrasted with the vaults of the cloister. The eyes gaze with\nwonder at clustered columns of gigantic dimensions, with arches\nspringing from them to such an amazing height; and man\nwandering about their bases, shrunk into insignificance in com-\nparison with his own handiwork. The spaciousness and gloom\nof this vast edifice produce a profound and mysterious awe. We\nstep cautiously and softly about, as if fearful of disturbing the\nhallowed silence of the tomb; while every footfall whispers along\nthe walls, and chatters among the sepulchres, making us more\nsensible of the quiet we have interrupted.\n\nIt seems as if the awful nature of the place presses down upon\nthe soul, and hushes the beholder into noiseless reverence. We\nfeel that we are surrounded by the congregated bones of the great\nmen of past times, who have filled history with their deeds, and\nthe earth with their renown.\n\nAnd yet it almost provokes a smile at the vanity of human\nambition, to see how they are crowded together and jostled in the dust; what parsimony is observed in doling out a scanty nook, a gloomy corner, a little portion of earth, to those whom, when alive, kingdoms could not satisfy; and how many shapes, and forms, and artifices, are devised to catch the casual notice of the passenger, and save from forgetfulness, for a few short years, a name which once aspired to occupy ages of the world's thought and admiration.\n\nI passed some time in Poets' Corner, which occupies an end of one of the transepts or cross aisles of the abbey. The monuments are generally simple; for the lives of literary men afford no striking themes for the sculptor. Shakspeare and Addison have statues erected to their memories; but the greater part have busts, medallions, and sometimes mere inscriptions. Notwithstanding the simplicity of these memorials, I have always observed that the visitors to the abbey remained longest about them. A kinder and fonder feeling takes place of that cold curiosity or vague admiration with which they gaze on the splendid monuments of the great and the heroic. They linger about these as about the tombs of friends and companions; for indeed there is something of companionship between the author and the reader. Other men are known to posterity only through the medium of history, which is continually growing faint and obscure; but the intercourse between the author and his fellow-men is ever new, active, and immediate. He has lived for them more than for himself; he has sacrificed surrounding enjoyments, and shut himself up from the delights of social life, that he might the more intimately commune with distant minds and distant ages. Well may the world cherish his renown; for it has been purchased, not by deeds of violence and blood, but by the diligent dispensation of pleasure. Well may posterity be grateful to his memory; for he has left it an inheritance, not of empty names and sounding actions, but whole treasures of wisdom, bright gems of thought, and golden veins of language.\n\nFrom Poets' Corner, I continued my stroll towards that part of the abbey which contains the sepulchres of the kings. I wandered among what once were chapels, but which are now occupied by the tombs and monuments of the great. At every turn I met with some illustrious name; or the cognizance of some powerful house renowned in history. As the eye darts into these dusky chambers of death, it catches glimpses of quaint effigies; some kneeling in niches, as if in devotion; others stretched upon the tombs, with hands piously pressed together; warriors in\narmour, as if reposing after battle; prelates with crosiers and mitres; and nobles in robes and coronets, lying as it were in state. In glancing over this scene, so strangely populous, yet where every form is so still and silent, it seems almost as if we were treading a mansion of that fabled city, where every being had been suddenly transmuted into stone.\n\nI paused to contemplate a tomb on which lay the effigy of a knight in complete armour. A large buckler was on one arm; the hands were pressed together in supplication upon the breast: the face was almost covered by the morion; the legs were crossed, in token of the warrior's having been engaged in the holy war. It was the tomb of a crusader; of one of those military enthusiasts, who so strangely mingled religion and romance, and whose exploits form the connecting link between fact and fiction; between the history and the fairy tale. There is something extremely picturesque in the tombs of these adventurers, decorated as they are with rude armorial bearings and Gothic sculpture. They comport with the antiquated chapels in which they are generally found; and in considering them, the imagination is apt to kindle with the legendary associations, the romantic fiction, the chivalrous pomp and pageantry, which poetry has spread over the wars for the sepulchre of Christ. They are the relics of times utterly gone by; of beings passed from recollection; of customs and manners with which ours have no affinity. They are like objects from some strange and distant land, of which we have no certain knowledge, and about which all our conceptions are vague and visionary. There is something extremely solemn and awful in those effigies on Gothic tombs, extended as if in the sleep of death, or in the supplication of the dying hour. They have an effect infinitely more impressive on my feelings than the fanciful attitudes, the over-wrought conceits, and allegorical groups, which abound on modern monuments. I have been struck, also, with the superiority of many of the old sepulchral inscriptions. There was a noble way, in former times, of saying things simply, and yet saying them proudly; and I do not know an epitaph that breathes a loftier consciousness of family worth and honourable lineage, than one which affirms of a noble house, that \"all the brothers were brave, and all the sisters virtuous.\"\n\nIn the opposite transept to Poets' Corner stands a monument which is among the most renowned achievements of modern art; but which to me appears horrible rather than sublime. It is the tomb of Mrs. Nightingale, by Roubiliac. The bottom of the monument is represented as throwing open its marble doors, and\na sheeted skeleton is starting forth. The shroud is falling from his fleshless frame as he launches his dart at his victim. She is sinking into her affrighted husband's arms, who strives, with vain and frantic effort, to avert the blow. The whole is executed with terrible truth and spirit; we almost fancy we hear the gibbering yell of triumph bursting from the distended jaws of the spectre.\n\nBut why should we thus seek to clothe death with unnecessary terrors, and to spread horrors round the tomb of those we love? The grave should be surrounded by everything that might inspire tenderness and veneration for the dead; or that might win the living to virtue. It is the place, not of disgust and dismay, but of sorrow and meditation.\n\nWhile wandering about these gloomy vaults and silent aisles, studying the records of the dead, the sound of busy existence from without occasionally reaches the ear;\u2014the rumbling of the passing equipage; the murmur of the multitude; or perhaps the light laugh of pleasure. The contrast is striking with the deathlike repose around; and it has a strange effect upon the feelings, thus to hear the surges of active life hurrying along, and beating against the very walls of the sepulchre.\n\nI continued in this way to move from tomb to tomb, and from chapel to chapel. The day was gradually wearing away; the distant tread of loiterers about the abbey grew less and less frequent; the sweet-tongued bell was summoning to evening prayers; and I saw at a distance the choristers, in their white surplices, crossing the aisle and entering the choir. I stood before the entrance to Henry the Seventh's chapel. A flight of steps lead up to it, through a deep and gloomy, but magnificent arch. Great gates of brass, richly and delicately wrought, turn heavily upon their hinges, as if proudly reluctant to admit the feet of common mortals into this most gorgeous of sepulchres.\n\nOn entering, the eye is astonished by the pomp of architecture, and the elaborate beauty of sculptured detail. The very walls are wrought into universal ornament, incrusted with tracery, and scooped into niches, crowded with the statues of saints and martyrs. Stone seems, by the cunning labour of the chisel, to have been robbed of its weight and density, suspended aloft, as if by magic, and the fretted roof achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb.\n\nAlong the sides of the chapel are the lofty stalls of the Knights of the Bath, richly carved of oak, though with the grotesque decorations of Gothic architecture. On the pinnacles of the stalls are affixed the helmets and crests of the knights, with their\nscarfs and swords; and above them are suspended their banners, emblazoned with armorial bearings, and contrasting the splendour of gold and purple and crimson, with the cold gray fretwork of the roof. In the midst of this grand mausoleum stands the sepulchre of its founder,\u2014his effigy, with that of his queen, extended on a sumptuous tomb, and the whole surrounded by a superbly-wrought brazen railing.\n\nThere is a sad dreariness in this magnificence; this strange mixture of tombs and trophies; these emblems of living and aspiring ambition, close beside mementos which show the dust and oblivion in which all must, sooner or later, terminate. Nothing impresses the mind with a deeper feeling of loneliness, than to tread the silent and deserted scene of former throng and pageant. On looking round on the vacant stalls of the knights and their esquires, and on the rows of dusty but gorgeous banners that were once borne before them, my imagination conjured up the scene when this hall was bright with the valour and beauty of the land; glittering with the splendour of jewelled rank and military array; alive with the tread of many feet and the hum of an admiring multitude. All had passed away; the silence of death had settled again upon the place, interrupted only by the casual chirping of birds, which had found their way into the chapel, and built their nests among its friezes and pendants\u2014sure signs of solitariness and desertion.\n\nWhen I read the names inscribed on the banners, they were those of men scattered far and wide about the world; some tossing upon distant seas; some under arms in distant lands; some mingling in the busy intrigues of courts and cabinets; all seeking to deserve one more distinction in this mansion of shadowy honours: the melancholy reward of a monument.\n\nTwo small aisles on each side of this chapel present a touching instance of the equality of the grave, which brings down the oppressor to a level with the oppressed, and mingles the dust of the bitterest enemies together. In one is the sepulchre of the haughty Elizabeth; in the other is that of her victim, the lovely and unfortunate Mary. Not an hour in the day but some ejaculation of pity is uttered over the fate of the latter, mingled with indignation at her oppressor. The walls of Elizabeth's sepulchre continually echo with the sighs of sympathy heaved at the grave of her rival.\n\nA peculiar melancholy reigns over the aisle where Mary lies buried. The light struggles dimly through windows darkened by dust. The greater part of the place is in deep shadow, and\n\nthe walls are hung with the figure of Mary's brazen railing, much faded. I was wearied by the monument, and the story of poverty.\n\nThe sound of voices could only be heard repeating the words of the choir; these, with the stillness, the deep silence around, gave me pause.\n\nSuddenly there came to ear, falling with a sound as it were, huge tones of grandeur accordant; and do they swell and fall in harmony through the sepulchre voice? They heaving higher and higher on sound. And then they break out into a loud warble along the air, like the pure tones of its thrilling tones, pouring forth upon the ear, the sweeping concord so powerful\u2014it fills the ear is sturned, winding up in the very soul, the swelling tide of sound.\n\nI sat for some time of music is almost lost, were gradually cast deeper and deeper token of the silence.\n\nI rose and walked\nthe walls are stained and tinted by time and weather. A marble figure of Mary is stretched upon the tomb, round which is an iron railing, much corroded, bearing her national emblem\u2014the thistle. I was weary with wandering, and sat down to rest myself by the monument, revolving in my mind the chequered and disastrous story of poor Mary.\n\nThe sound of casual footsteps had ceased from the abbey. I could only hear, now and then, the distant voice of the priest repeating the evening service, and the faint responses of the choir; these paused for a time, and all was hushed. The stillness, the desertion, and obscurity that were gradually prevailing around, gave a deeper and more solemn interest to the place:\n\nFor in the silent grave no conversation,\nNo joyful tread of friends, no voice of lovers;\nNo careful father's counsel\u2014nothing's heard,\nFor nothing is, but all oblivion,\nDust, and an endless darkness.\n\nSuddenly the notes of the deep-labouring organ burst upon the ear, falling with doubled and redoubled intensity, and rolling, as it were, huge billows of sound. How well do their volume and grandeur accord with this mighty building! With what pomp do they swell through its vast vaults, and breathe their awful harmony through these caves of death, and make the silent sepulchre vocal! And now they rise in triumphant acclamation, heaving higher and higher their accordant notes, and piling sound on sound. And now they pause, and the soft voices of the choir break out into sweet gushes of melody; they soar aloft, and warble along the roof, and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the pure airs of heaven. Again the pealing organ heaves its thrilling thunders, compressing air into music, and rolling it forth upon the soul. What long-drawn cadences! What solemn sweeping concords! It grows more and more dense and powerful\u2014it fills the vast pile, and seems to jar the very walls\u2014the ear is sturned\u2014the senses are overwhelmed. And now it is winding up in full jubilee\u2014it is rising from the earth to heaven\u2014the very soul seems rapt away and floated upwards on this swelling tide of harmony!\n\nI sat for some time lost in that kind of reverie which a strain of music is apt sometimes to inspire: the shadows of evening were gradually thickening round me; the monuments began to cast deeper and deeper gloom; and the distant clock again gave token of the slowly waning day.\n\nI rose and prepared to leave the abbey. As I descended the\nflight of steps which lead into the body of the building, my eye was caught by the shrine of Edward the Confessor, and I ascended the small staircase that conducts to it, to take from thence a general survey of this wilderness of tombs. The shrine is elevated upon a kind of platform, and close around it are the sepulchres of various kings and queens. From this eminence the eye looks down between pillars and funereal trophies to the chapels and chambers below, crowded with tombs; where warriors, prelates, courtiers, and statesmen, lie mouldering in their \"beds of darkness.\" Close by me stood the great chair of coronation, rudely carved of oak, in the barbarous taste of a remote and gothic age. The scene seemed almost as if contrived, with theatrical artifice, to produce an effect upon the beholder. Here was a type of the beginning and the end of human pomp and power; here it was literally but a step from the throne to the sepulchre. Would not one think that these incongruous mementos had been gathered together as a lesson to living greatness?\u2014to show it, even in the moment of its proudest exaltation, the neglect and dishonour to which it must soon arrive; how soon that crown which encircles its brow must pass away, and it must lie down in the dust and disgraces of the tomb, and be trampled upon by the feet of the meanest of the multitude. For, strange to tell, even the grave is here no longer a sanctuary. There is a shocking levity in some natures, which leads them to sport with awful and hallowed things; and there are base minds, which delight to revenge on the illustrious dead the abject homage and grovelling servility which they pay to the living. The coffin of Edward the Confessor has been broken open, and his remains despoiled of their funereal ornaments; the sceptre has been stolen from the hand of the imperious Elizabeth, and the effigy of Henry the Fifth lies headless. Not a royal monument but bears some proof how false and fugitive is the homage of mankind. Some are plundered, some mutilated; some covered with ribaldry and insult\u2014all more or less outraged and dishonoured!\n\nThe last beams of day were now faintly streaming through the painted windows in the high vaults above me; the lower parts of the abbey were already wrapped in the obscurity of twilight. The chapel and aisles grew darker and darker. The effigies of the kings faded into shadows; the marble figures of the monuments assumed strange shapes in the uncertain light; the evening breeze crept through the aisles like the cold breath of the grave; and even the distant footfall of a varger, traversing the Poets' Corner, had something strange and dreary in its sound. I slowly retraced my steps, and, quitting the cloister, returned to the place that filled the whole of my thoughts.\n\nI endeavoured to contemplate objects I had seen before, but they had fallen into a new aspect. The trophies, hitherto so imposing, now had scarcely any appearance. I thought I, in my present state of humiliation and insignificance, of renown, of empire, of greatness, of state, mocking at my former glory and forgetfulness of my former boast, after having heard me silently turn my back upon me, the story of my life, which once gave importance to me, now lay aside to be forgotten. The hero of yesteryear, who once was supplanting by his prowess Sir Thomas Malory, now lies silent and sadly telling how his story fades into the shadows of controversy; the fame of the past falls from the lips of men, and they but hear the tales that are written in the annals of the perpetuity of the English race. Great have been the changes that is now the memory of the enemies, which once did him dishonour; Misery is the only balsama.\"\n\nWhat, then, can prevent me from sharing in the same fate? Come when it may, let me lie in rubbish and decay, in melody and peace, under the arches, and the garish sunbeams shall not disturb me.\nretraced my morning's walk, and as I passed out at the portal of the cloisters, the door, closing with a jarring noise behind me, filled the whole building with echoes.\n\nI endeavoured to form some arrangement in my mind of the objects I had been contemplating, but found they were already fallen into indistinctness and confusion. Names, inscriptions, trophies, had all become confounded in my recollection, though I had scarcely taken my foot from off the threshold. What, thought I, is this vast assemblage of sepulchres but a treasury of humiliation; a huge pile of reiterated homilies on the emptiness of renown, and the certainty of oblivion! It is, indeed, the empire of Death; his great shadowy palace, where he sits in state, mocking at the relics of human glory, and spreading dust and forgetfulness on the monuments of princes. How idle a boast, after all, is the immortality of a name! Time is ever silently turning over his pages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present, to think of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten. The idol of to-day pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection; and will, in turn, be supplanted by his successor of to-morrow. \"Our fathers,\" says Sir Thomas Brown, \"find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how we may be buried in our survivors.\" History fades into fable; fact becomes clouded with doubt and controversy; the inscription moulders from the tablet; the statue falls from the pedestal. Columns, arches, pyramids, what are they but heaps of sand; and their epitaphs, but characters written in the dust? What is the security of a tomb, or the perpetuity of an embalment? The remains of Alexander the Great have been scattered to the wind, and his empty sarcophagus is now the mere curiosity of a museum. \"The Egyptian mummies, which Cambyses or time hath spared, avarice now consumeth; Mixraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold for balsam.\"\n\nWhat, then, is to insure this pile which now towers above me from sharing the fate of mightier mausoleums? The time must come when its gilded vaults, which now spring so loftily, shall lie in rubbish beneath the feet; when, instead of the sound of melody and praise, the wind shall whistle through the broken arches, and the owl hoot from the shattered tower\u2014when the garish sunbeam shall break into these gloomy mansions of death,\n\n* Sir T. Brown.\nand the ivy twine round the fallen column; and the foxglove hang its blossoms about the nameless urn, as if in mockery of the dead. Thus man passes away; his name perishes from record and recollection; his history is as a tale that is told, and his very monument becomes a ruin.\n\nNOTES CONCERNING WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\n\nToward the end of the sixth century, when Britain, under the dominion of the Saxons, was in a state of barbarism and idolatry, Pope Gregory the Great, struck with the beauty of some Anglo-Saxon youths exposed for sale in the market-place at Rome, conceived a fancy for the race, and determined to send missionaries to preach the gospel among these comely but benighted islanders. He was encouraged to this by learning that Ethelbert, king of Kent, and the most potent of the Anglo-Saxon princes, had married Bertha, a Christian princess, only daughter of the king of Paris, and that she was allowed by stipulation the full exercise of her religion.\n\nThe shrewd pontiff knew the influence of the sex in matters of religious faith. He forthwith despatched Augustine, a Roman monk, with forty associates, to the court of Ethelbert at Canterbury, to effect the conversion of the king, and to obtain through him a foothold in the island.\n\nEthelbert received them warily, and held a conference in the open air; being distrustful of foreign priestcraft, and fearful of spells and magic. They ultimately succeeded in making him as good a Christian as his wife; the conversion of the king of course produced the conversion of his loyal subjects. The zeal and success of Augustine were rewarded by his being made archbishop of Canterbury, and being endowed with authority over all the British churches.\n\nOne of the most prominent converts was Segebert or Sebert, king of the East Saxons, a nephew of Ethelbert. He reigned at London, of which Mellitus, one of the Roman monks who had come over with Augustine, was made bishop.\n\nSebert, in 605, in his religious zeal, founded a monastery by the river side to the west of the city, on the ruins of a temple of Apollo, being in fact the origin of the present pile of Westminster Abbey. Great preparations were made for the consecration of the church, which was to be dedicated to St. Peter. On the morning of the appointed day, Mellitus, the bishop, proceeded with great pomp and solemnity to perform the ceremony. On approaching the edifice, he was met by a fisherman, who informed him that it was needless to proceed, as the ceremony was over. The bishop stared with surprise, when the fisherman went on to relate, that the night before, as he was in his boat on the Thames, St. Peter appeared to him, and told him that he intended to consecrate the church himself, that very night. The apostle accordingly went into the church, which suddenly became illuminated. The ceremony was performed in sumptuous style, accompanied by strains of heavenly music and clouds of fragrant incense. After this, the apostle came into the boat and ordered the fisherman to cast his net. He did so, and had a miraculous draught of fishes; one of which he was commanded to present to the bishop, and to signify to him that the apostle had relieved him from the necessity of consecrating the church.\n\nMellitus was a wary man, slow of belief, and required confirmation of the fisherman's tale. He opened the church doors, and beheld wax candles, crosses, holy water; oil sprinkled in various places, and various other traces of a grand ceremonial. If he had still any lingering doubt, they were completely removed on the fisherman's producing the identical fish which he had been ordered by the apostle to present to him. To resist this would have been to resist ocular demonstration. The good bishop accordingly was convinced that the church had actually been consecrated by St. Peter in person; so he reverently abstained from proceeding further in the business.\n\nThe foregoing tradition is said to be the reason why King Edward the Confessor chose this place as the site of a religious house which he meant to endow. He pulled down the old church and built another in its place in 1045. In this his remains were deposited in a magnificent shrine.\n\nThe sacred edifice again underwent modifications, if not a reconstruction, by Henry III. in 1228, and began to assume its present appearance.\n\nUnder Henry VIII. it lost its conventual character, that monarch turning the monks away, and seizing upon the revenues.\n\nRELICS OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.\n\nA curious narrative was printed in 1698, by one of the choristers of the cathedral, who appears to have been the Paul Pry of the sacred edifice, giving an account of his ransacking among the bones of Edward the Confessor, after they had quietly reposed in their sepulchre up to the chain of the dead. It had been a two-headed servant chest or coffin, memory. Now until the worthies ladder, and few bands of iron.\n\nSubsequently the coffin was accidentally by the story of royal discovery of the friends, of course, he again mounted six inches long, hand, and groined, richly adorned, and showed to his lord.\n\n\"At the time, head to the holden whole and full of surrounding the flowered silk, the well nigh perish'd and found.\"\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Edward the Confessor and brought to grief.\n\nHaving satisfied the coffin, and sought suitable at the time, hands, he got a hand afterwards, and knelt on his knees to King Edward, one of great strength, large iron wedges, abuse might be offered.\n\nAs the history often says, \"The skeleton of what is now a mortar catch the sight of the spiral pillars of dust. The mosaic foot square and five feet.\"\n\nINSCRIPTION.\n\nHere lies the Lord Edward had no issue.

The When the service of the pile, by the beacon passes through the arches and grim sepulchres.\nsepulchre upwards of six hundred years, and of his drawing forth the crucifix and golden chain of the deceased monarch. During eighteen years that he had officiated in the choir, it had been a common tradition, he says, among his brother choristers and the gray-headed servants of the abbey, that the body of King Edward was deposited in a kind of chest or coffin, which was indistinctly seen in the upper part of the shrine erected to his memory. None of the abbey goseips, however, had ventured upon a nearer inspection, until the worthy narrator, to gratify his curiosity, mounted to the coffin by the aid of a ladder, and found it to be made of wood, apparently very strong and firm, being secured by bands of iron.\n\nSubsequently, in 1665, on taking down the scaffolding used in the coronation of James II., the coffin was found to be broken, a hole appearing in the lid, probably made through accident by the workmen. No one ventured, however, to meddle with the sacred depositary of royal dust\u2014until, several weeks afterwards, the circumstance came to the knowledge of the aforesaid chorister. He forthwith repaired to the abbey in company with two friends of congenial tastes, who were desirous of inspecting the tombs. Procuring a ladder, he again mounted to the coffin, and found, as had been represented, a hole in the lid about six inches long and four inches broad, just in front of the left breast. Thrusting in his hand, and grasping at the bone, he drew from underneath the shoulder a crucifix, richly adorned and enamelled, affixed to a gold chain twenty-four inches long. These he showed to his inquisitive friends, who were equally surprised with himself.\n\n\"At the time,\" says he, \"when I took the cross and chain out of the coffin, I drew the head to the hole and viewed it, being very sound and firm, with the upper and nether jaws whole and full of teeth; and a list of gold above an inch broad, in the nature of a coronet, surrounding the temple. There was also in the coffin white linen and gold-coloured flowered silk, that looked indifferent fresh; but the least stress put thereto showed it was well nigh perished. There were all his bones, and much dust likewise, which I left as I found.\"\n\nIt is difficult to conceive a more grotesque lesson to human pride than the skull of Edward the Confessor thus irreverently pulled about in its coffin by a prying chorister and brought to grin face to face with him through a hole in the lid!\n\nHaving satisfied his curiosity, the chorister put the crucifix and chain back again into the coffin, and sought the dean, to apprise him of his discovery. The dean not being accessible at the time, and fearing that the \"holy treasure\" might be taken away by other hands, he got a brother chorister to accompany him to the shrine about two or three hours afterwards, and in his presence again drew forth the relics. These he afterwards delivered on his knees to King James. The king subsequently had the old coffin enclosed in a new one of great strength, \"each plank being two inches thick, and clamped together with large iron wedges, where it now remains (1688) as a testimony of his pious care, that no abuse might be offered to the sacred relics therein reposed.\"\n\nAs the history of this shrine is full of moral, I subjoin a description of it in modern times. \"The solitary and forlorn shrine,\" says a British writer, \"now stands a mere skeleton of what it was. A few faint traces of its sparkling decorations inlaid on solid mortar catch the rays of the sun, for ever set on its splendour.\" Only two of the spiral pillars remain. The wooden font's top is much broken, and covered with dust. The mosaic is picked away in every part within reach; only the lozenges of about a foot square and five circular pieces of the rich marble remain.\"\u2014Malcolm, Lond. Radiv.\n\nINSCRIPTION ON A MONUMENT ALLUDED TO IN THE SKETCH.\n\nHere lyse the Loyal Duke of Newcastle, and his Dutchess his second wife, by whom he had no issue. Her name was Margaret Lucas, youngest sister to the Lord Lucas of Colchester, a noble family; for all the brothers were valiant and all the sisters virtuous. This Dutchess was a wise, witty, and learned lady, which her many Books do well testify: she was a most virtuous, and loving and careful wife, and was with her lord all the time of his banishment and miseries, and when he came home never parted from him in his solitary retirements.\n\nIn the winter time, when the days are short, the service in the afternoon is performed by the light of tapers. The effect is fine of the choir partially lighted up, while the main body of the cathedral and the transepts are in profound and cavernous darkness. The white dresses of the choristers gleam amidst the deep brown of the oaken slats and canopies; the partial illumination makes enormous shadows from columns and screens, and darting into the surrounding gloom, catches here and there upon a sepulchral decoration, or monumental effigy. The swelling notes of the organ accord well with the scene.\n\nWhen the service is over, the dean is lighted to his dwelling, in the old conventual part of the pile, by the boys of the choir, in their white dresses, bearing tapers, and the procession passes through the abbey and along the shadowy cloisters, lighting up angles and arches and grim sepulchral monuments, and leaving all behind in darkness.\nCHRISTMAS.\n\nBut is old, old, good old Christmas gone?

They recall the pictures my fancy used to draw in the May morning of life, when as yet I only knew the world through books, and believed it, to be all that poets had painted it; and they bring with them the flavour of those honest days of yore, in which, perhaps, with equal fallacy, I am apt to think the world was more homebred, social, and joyous than at present. I regret to say that they are daily growing more and more faint, being gradually worn away by time, but still more obliterated by modern fashion. They resemble those picturesque morsels of Gothic architecture, which we see crumbling in various parts of the country, partly dilapidated by the waste of ages, and partly lost in the additions and alterations of latter days. Poetry, however, clings with cherishing fondness about the rural game and holiday revel, from which it has derived so many of its themes\u2014as the ivy winds its rich foliage about the Gothic arch and mouldering tower, gratefully repaying their support, by clasping together their tottering remains, and, as it were, embalming them in verdure.\n\nOf all the old festivals, however, that of Christmas awakens the strongest and most heartfelt associations. There is a tone of solemn and sacred feeling that blends with our conviviality, and lifts the spirit to a state of hallowed and elevated enjoyment. The services of the church about this season are extremely tender and inspiring. They dwell on the beautiful story of the origin of our faith, and the pastoral scenes that accompanied its announcement. They gradually increase in fervour and pathos during the season of Advent, until they break forth in full jubilee on the morning that brought peace and good-will to men. I do not know a more touching scene than to hear the full-throated voices of the choir anthem in such a manner as to make triumphant the soul.\n\nIt is a belief of mine, that this festivity is the oldest religion of primitive man. It brings together of all classes, and all bands of kindred, to forget the sorrows of the past, and to call back the memories of the good in life, and to look forward to about the past, and to look forward to there to grow up in the future, mementos of the past.\n\nThere is a charm to the landscape, a great portion of which is ours. Our feelings are affected by the landscape, and we feel the life of the bird, the freshness of the spring, the coolness of the autumn; each season is associated with its deep and varied feelings, with mate to the mind, and mere sensations. When the snow is despoiled of its beauty, and the snow, we turn our thoughts to dreariness and gloom, and darkness, and death, shut in our four walls, and keenly disposed to feel that we are more confined than ever. We feel more than ever that we are brought more than ever into the enjoyment. But we turn our thoughts from the dead and gloomy recesses of our rooms, and forth the pure and fresh air.\n\nThe pitchy darkness of the room filled with the sound of the ruddy blaze, which glowed in the room, and made the whole\nnot know a grander effect of music on the moral feelings, than to hear the full choir and the pealing organ performing a Christmas anthem in a cathedral, and filling every part of the vast pile with triumphant harmony.\n\nIt is a beautiful arrangement, also, derived from days of yore, that this festival, which commemorates the announcement of the religion of peace and love, has been made the season for gathering together of family connections, and drawing closer again those bands of kindred hearts, which the cares and pleasures and sorrows of the world are continually operating to cast loose: of calling back the children of a family, who have launched forth in life, and wandered widely asunder, once more to assemble about the paternal hearth, that rallying-place of the affections, there to grow young and loving again among the endearing mementos of childhood.\n\nThere is something in the very season of the year that gives a charm to the festivity of Christmas. At other times we derive a great portion of our pleasures from the mere beauties of nature. Our feelings sally forth and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape, and we \"live abroad and everywhere.\" The song of the bird, the murmur of the stream, the breathing fragrance of spring, the soft voluptuousness of summer, the golden pomp of autumn; earth with its mantle of refreshing green, and heaven with its deep delicious blue and its cloudy magnificence, all fill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we revel in the luxury of mere sensation. But in the depth of winter, when nature lies despoiled of every charm, and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow, we turn for our gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of the landscape, the short gloomy days and darksome nights, while they circumscribe our wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling abroad, and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasure of the social circle. Our thoughts are more concentrated: our friendly sympathies more aroused. We feel more sensibly the charm of each other's society, and are brought more closely together by dependence on each other for enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart; and we draw our pleasures from the deep wells of loving-kindness, which lie in the quiet recesses of our bosoms; and which, when resorted to, furnish forth the pure element of domestic felicity.\n\nThe pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room filled with the glow and warmth of the evening fire. The ruddy blaze diffuses an artificial summer and sunshine through the room, and lights up each countenance in a kindlier welcome.\nWhere does the honest face of hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smile\u2014where is the shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent\u2014than by the winter fireside? and as the hollow blast of wintry wind rushes through the hall, claps the distant door, whistles about the casement, and rumbles down the chimney, what can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and sheltered security, with which we look round upon the comfortable chamber and the scene of domestic hilarity?\n\nThe English, from the great prevalence of rural habit throughout every class of society, have always been fond of those festivals and holidays which agreeably interrupt the stillness of country life; and they were, in former days, particularly observant of the religious and social rites of Christmas. It is inspiring to read even the dry details which some antiquaries have given of the quaint humours, the burlesque pageants, the complete abandonment to mirth and good-fellowship, with which this festival was celebrated. It seemed to throw open every door, and unlock every heart. It brought the peasant and the peer together, and blended all ranks in one warm generous flow of joy and kindness. The old halls of castles and manor-houses resounded with the harp and the Christmas carol, and their ample boards groaned under the weight of hospitality. Even the poorest cottage welcomed the festive season with green decorations of bay and holly\u2014the cheerful fire glanced its rays through the lattice, inviting the passengers to raise the latch, and join the gossip knot huddled round the hearth, beguiling the long evening with legendary jokes and oft-told Christmas tales.\n\nOne of the least pleasing effects of modern refinement is the havoc it has made among the hearty old holiday customs. It has completely taken off the sharp touchings and spirited reliefs of these embellishments of life, and has worn down society into a more smooth and polished, but certainly a less characteristic surface. Many of the games and ceremonials of Christmas have entirely disappeared, and, like the sherris sack of old Falstaff, are become matters of speculation and dispute among commentators. They flourished in times full of spirit and lustihood, when men enjoyed life roughly, but heartily and vigorously; times wild and picturesque, which have furnished poetry with its richest materials, and the drama with its most attractive variety of characters and manners. The world has become more worldly. There is more of dissipation, and less of enjoyment. Pleasure has expanded into a broader, but a shallower stream; and has forsaken many of those deep and quiet channels where it flowed sweetly through. We have acquired a taste for many of its minor forms, but the honest fireside, the kindly-hearted antithesis of the cold have passed away. The big houses in which Christmas is the shadowy reminiscence of a parlour, but the little rooms of the drawing-room are empty.\n\nShorn, however, of its ancient Christmas is still a festival. It is gratifying to see how it holds so powerful an influence over the relations making and unmaking, uniting friends, and separating enemies, and repassing the barriers of feelings; the same old familiar emblems of peace and plenty, still effect in proportionate degree the sympathies. The minstrelsy, by its charm, produces the effect of a charm, and makes them in that way \"more kind upon man,\" by connecting them with the feelings fancied them to be connected with the good-will to man.\n\nHow delightful it is to see these moral influences at work! The very crowding of the mind into repose of the soul, \"the quiet of the dames,\" was never so strongly approached of late years.\n\nAmidst the hurly-burly and stir of the world, the quiet bosom can renew its strength, and generated feelings can be rekindled.\nsweetly through the calm bosom of domestic life. Society has acquired a more enlightened and elegant tone; but it has lost many of its strong local peculiarities, its home-bred feelings, its honest fireside delights. The traditionary customs of golden-hearted antiquity, its feudal hospitalities, and lordly wassilings, have passed away with the baronial castles and stately manor-houses in which they were celebrated. They comported with the shadowy hall, the great oaken gallery, and the tapestried parlour, but are unfitted to the light showy saloons and gay drawing-rooms of the modern villa.\n\nShorn, however, as it is, of its ancient and festive honours, Christmas is still a period of delightful excitement in England. It is gratifying to see that home feeling completely aroused which holds so powerful a place in every English bosom. The preparations making on every side for the social board that is again to unite friends and kindred; the presents of good cheer passing and repassing, those tokens of regard, and quickeners of kind feelings; the evergreens distributed about houses and churches, emblems of peace and gladness; all these have the most pleasing effect in producing fond associations, and kindling benevolent sympathies. Even the sound of the Waits, rude as may be their minstrelsy, breaks upon the mid-watches of a winter night with the effect of perfect harmony. As I have been awakened by them in that still and solemn hour, \"when deep sleep falleth upon man,\" I have listened with a hushed delight, and, connecting them with the sacred and joyous occasion, have almost fancied them into another celestial choir, announcing peace and good-will to mankind.\n\nHow delightfully the imagination, when wrought upon by these moral influences, turns everything to melody and beauty! The very crowing of the cock, heard sometimes in the profound repose of the country, \"telling the night watches to his feathery dames,\" was thought by the common people to announce the approach of this sacred festival:\n\n\"Sometime say that ever 'gainst the season comes\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\nThis bird of dawning singeth all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;\nThe nights are wholesome\u2014then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm,\nSo hallowed and so gracious is the time.\"\n\nAmidst the general call to happiness, the bustle of the spirits, and stir of the affections, which prevail at this period, what bosom can remain insensible? It is, indeed, the season of regenerated feeling\u2014the season for kindling, not merely the fire of\nhospitality in the hall, but the genial flame of charity in the heart.\n\nThe scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile waste of years; and the idea of home, fraught with the fragrance of home-dwelling joys, reanimates the drooping spirit; as the Arabian breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the weary pilgrim of the desert.\n\nStranger and sojourner as I am in the land\u2014though for me no social hearth may blaze, no hospitable roof throw open its doors, nor the warm grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold\u2014yet I feel the influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of those around me. Surely happiness is reflective, like the light of heaven; and every countenance, bright with smiles, and glowing with innocent enjoyment, is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a supreme and ever-shining benevolence. He who can turn churlishly away from contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings, and can sit down darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful, may have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification, but he wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a merry Christmas.\n\nTHE STAGE COACH.\n\nOmne bene\nSine paena\nTempus est ludendi,\nVenit hora\nAbeque mora\nLibros deponendi.\n\nOLD HOLIDAY SCHOOL SONG.\n\nIn the preceding paper I have made some general observations on the Christmas festivities of England, and am tempted to illustrate them by some anecdotes of a Christmas passed in the country; in perusing which I would most courteously invite my reader to lay aside the austerity of wisdom, and to put on that genuine holiday spirit which is tolerant of folly, and anxious only for amusement.\n\nIn the course of a December tour in Yorkshire, I rode for a long distance in one of the public coaches, on the day preceding Christmas. The coach was crowded, both inside and out, with passengers, who, by their talk, seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or friends, to eat the Christmas dinner. It was loaded also with hampers of game, and baskets and boxes of delicacies; and hares hung dangling their long ears about the coachman's box, presents from distant friends for the impending feast. I had passengers with which I had been returning, themselves in gigantic plumes, as they were of the abhorred kind, were full of the household, and were to give us our pockets were to look forward to which I found myself seated in the place of the leader as he was in the country there.\n\nThey were to whom, we had a host of questions for the world. The ordinary air of the hat a little more greens stuck to the personage for the so during the consequence, perhaps, it was to have a sight of this very night to have a dress and prevalent English stage, one of any sort.\n\nHe has a red, as if the vessel of the frequent potato increased by the cauliflower, broad-brimmed kerchief about\nfeast. I had three fine rosy-cheeked school-boys for my fellow-passengers inside, full of the buxom health and manly spirit which I have observed in the children of this country. They were returning home for the holidays in high glee, and promising themselves a world of enjoyment. It was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of the little rogues, and the impracticable feats they were to perform during their six weeks' emancipation from the abhorred thraldom of book, birch, and pedagogue. They were full of anticipations of the meeting with the family and household, down to the very cat and dog; and of the joy they were to give their little sisters by the presents with which their pockets were crammed; but the meeting to which they seemed to look forward with the greatest impatience was with Bantam, which I found to be a pony, and according to their talk, possessed of more virtues than any steed since the days of Bucephalus. How he could trot! how he could run! and then such leaps as he would take\u2014there was not a hedge in the whole country that he could not clear.\n\nThey were under the particular guardianship of the coachman, to whom, whenever an opportunity presented, they addressed a host of questions, and pronounced him one of the best fellows in the world. Indeed, I could not but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and importance of the coachman, who wore his hat a little on one side, and had a large bunch of Christmas greens stuck in the buttonhole of his coat. He is always a personage full of mighty care and business, but he is particularly so during this season, having so many commissions to execute in consequence of the great interchange of presents. And here, perhaps, it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers, to have a sketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous and important class of functionaries, who have a dress, a manner, a language, an air, peculiar to themselves, and prevalent throughout the fraternity; so that, wherever an English stage-coachman may be seen, he cannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery.\n\nHe has commonly a broad, full face, curiously mottled with red, as if the blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the skin; he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt liquors, and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of coats, in which he is buried like a cauliflower, the upper one reaching to his heels. He wears a broad-brimmed, low-crowned hat; a huge roll of coloured handkerchief about his neck, knowingly knotted and tucked in at the\nbosom; and has in summertime a large bouquet of flowers in his buttonhole; the present, most probably, of some enamoured country lass. His waistcoat is commonly of some bright colour, striped, and his smallclothes extend far below the knees, to meet a pair of jockey-boots which reach about half-way up his legs.\n\nAll this costume is maintained with much precision; he has a pride in having his clothes of excellent materials; and, notwithstanding the seeming grossness of his appearance, there is still discernible that neatness and propriety of person which is almost inherent in an Englishman. He enjoys great consequence and consideration along the road; has frequent conferences with the village housewives, who look upon him as a man of great trust and dependence; and he seems to have a good understanding with every bright-eyed country lass. The moment he arrives where the horses are to be changed, he throws down the reins with something of an air, and abandons the cattle to the care of the ostler; his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another. When off the box, his hands are thrust into the pockets of his great coat, and he rolls about the inn yard with an air of the most absolute lordliness. Here he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of ostlers, stable-boys, shoeblacks, and those nameless hangers-on that infest inns and taverns, and run errands, and do all kinds of odd jobs, for the privilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the leakage of the taproom. These all look up to him as to an oracle; treasure up his cant phrases; echo his opinions about horses and other topics of jockey lore; and above all, endeavour to imitate his air and carriage. Every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands in the pockets, rolls in his gait, talks slang, and is an embryo Coachey.\n\nPerhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in my own mind, that I fancied I saw cheerfulness in every countenance throughout the journey. A stage coach, however, carries animation always with it, and puts the world in motion as it whirls along. The horn, sounded at the entrance of a village, produces a general bustle. Some hasten forth to meet friends; some with bundles and bandboxes to secure places, and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the group that accompanies them. In the meantime the coachman has a world of small commissions to execute. Sometimes he delivers a hare or pheasant; sometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a public-house; and sometimes, with knowing leer and words of sly import, hands to some half-blushing, half-laughing half-admirer.\n\nruns to the country fair assembled stations the but the eng passing of The smith, whirls by; hammers, in brown for a moment drawn sigh sulphureous.\n\nPerhaps unusual anim body was i other luxur lages; the with custom putting the holly, within windows.\n\nof Christmas turkeys, get for in twelve little.

As the coach rattles through the village, every one runs to the window, and you have glances on every side of fresh country faces and blooming giggling girls. At the corners are assembled juntos of village idlers and wise men, who take their stations there for the important purpose of seeing company pass; but the sagest knot is generally at the blacksmith's, to whom the passing of the coach is an event fruitful of much speculation. The smith, with the horse's heel in his lap, pauses as the vehicle whirls by; the cyclops round the anvil suspend their ringing hammers, and suffer the iron to grow cool; and the sooty spectre in brown paper cap, labouring at the bellows, leans on the handle for a moment, and permits the asthmatic engine to heave a long-drawn sigh, while he glares through the murky smoke and sulphureous gleams of the smithy.\n\nPerhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual animation to the country, for it seemed to me as if everybody was in good looks and good spirits. Game, poultry, and other luxuries of the table, were in brisk circulation in the villages; the grocers', butchers', and fruiterers' shops were thronged with customers. The housewives were stirring briskly about, putting their dwellings in order; and the glossy branches of holly, with their bright red berries, began to appear at the windows. The scene brought to mind an old writer's account of Christmas preparations:\u2014\"Now capons and hens, besides turkeys, geese, and ducks, with beef and mutton\u2014must all die\u2014for in twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little. Now plums and spice, sugar and honey, square it among pies and broth. Now or never must music be in tune, for the youth must dance and sing to get them a heat, while the aged sit by the fire. The country maid leaves half her market, and must be sent again, if she forgets a pack of cards on Christmas eve. Great is the contention of holly and ivy, whether master or dame wears the breeches. Dice and cards benefit the butler; and if the cook do not lack wit, he will sweetly lick his fingers.\"\n\nI was roused from this fit of luxurious meditation, by a shout from my little travelling companions. They had been looking out of the coach windows for the last few miles, recognizing every tree and cottage as they approached home, and now there was a general burst of joy\u2014\"There's John! and there's old Carlo! and there's Bantam!\" cried the happy little rogues, clapping their hands.\n\nAt the end of the lane there was an old sober-looking servant\nin livery, waiting for them; he was accompanied by a superannuated pointer, and by the redoubtable Bantam, a little old set of a pony, with a shaggy mane and long rusty tail, who stood dozing quietly by the road-side, little dreaming of the bustling times that awaited him.\n\nI was pleased to see the fondness with which the little fellows leaped about the steady old footman, and hugged the pointer; who wriggled his whole body for joy. But Bantam was the great object of interest; all wanted to mount at once, and it was with some difficulty that John arranged that they should ride by turns, and the eldest should ride first.\n\nOff they set at last; one on the pony, with the dog bounding and barking before him, and the others holding John's hands; both talking at once, and overpowering him with questions about home, and with school anecdotes. I looked after them with a feeling in which I do not know whether pleasure or melancholy predominated; for I was reminded of these days when, like them, I had neither known care nor sorrow, and a holiday was the summit of earthly felicity. We stopped a few moments afterwards to water the horses, and on resuming our route, a turn of the road brought us in sight of a neat country seat. I could just distinguish the forms of a lady and two young girls in the portico, and I saw my little comrades, with Bantam, Carlo, and old John, trooping along the carriage road. I leaned out of the coach window, in hopes of witnessing the happy meeting, but a grove of trees shut it from my sight.\n\nIn the evening we reached a village where I had determined to pass the night. As we drove into the great gateway of the inn, I saw on one side the light of a rousing kitchen fire beaming through a window. I entered, and admired, for the hundredth time, that picture of convenience, neatness, and broad, honest enjoyment, the kitchen of an English inn. It was of spacious dimensions, hung round with copper and tin vessels highly polished, and decorated here and there with a Christmas green. Hams, tongues, and flitches of bacon, were suspended from the ceiling; a smoke-jack made its ceaseless clanking beside the fireplace, and a clock ticked in one corner. A well-scoured deal table extended along one side of the kitchen, with a cold round of beef and other hearty viands upon it, over which two foaming tankards of ale seemed mounting guard. Travellers of inferior order were preparing to attack this stout repast, while others sat smoking and gossiping over their ale on two high-backed oaken settles beside the fire. Trim housemaids were hurrying backwards and forwards, and the landlady; a flippant woman, who had been by the fire. I had no idea of the\n\nIt was a chaise whirr.\nbackwards and forwards under the directions of a fresh bustling landlady; but still seizing an occasional moment to exchange a flippant word, and have a rallying laugh with the group round the fire. The scene completely realized Poor Robin's humble idea of the comforts of mid-winter:\n\nNow trees their leafy bays do bear\nTo reverence Winter's silver hair;\nA handsome hostess, merry host,\nA pot o' ale now and a toast,\nTobacco and a good coal fire,\nAre things this season doth require.*\n\nI had not been long at the inn when a post-chaise drove up to the door. A young gentleman stepped out, and by the light of the lamps I caught a glimpse of a countenance which I thought I knew. I moved forward to get a nearer view, when his eye caught mine. I was not mistaken: it was Frank Bracebridge, a sprightly good-humoured young fellow, with whom I had once travelled on the continent. Our meeting was extremely cordial, for the countenance of an old fellow-traveller always brings up the recollection of a thousand pleasant scenes, odd adventures, and excellent jokes. To discuss all these in a transient interview at an inn was impossible; and finding that I was not pressed for time, and was merely making a tour of observation, he insisted that I should give him a day or two at his father's country seat, to which he was going to pass the holidays, and which lay at a few miles' distance. \"It is better than eating a solitary Christmas dinner at an inn,\" said he, \"and I can assure you of a hearty welcome in something of the old-fashioned style.\" His reasoning was cogent, and I must confess the preparation I had seen for universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little impatient of my loneliness. I closed, therefore, at once, with his invitation; the chaise drove up to the door, and in a few moments I was on my way to the family mansion of the Bracebridges.\n\nCHRISTMAS EVE.\n\nSaint Francis and Saint Benedight\nBless this house from wicked wight;\nFrom the night-mare and the goblin,\nThat is night good fellow Robin:\nKeep it from all evil spirits,\nFairs, weasels, rats, and ferrets:\nFrom curfew time\nTo the next prime.\u2014CARTWRIGHT.\n\nIt was a brilliant moonlight night, but extremely cold; our chaise whirled rapidly over the frozen ground; the postboy\n\n* Poor Robin's Almanac, 1864.\nsmacked his whip incessantly, and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop. \"He knows where he is going,\" said my companion, laughing, \"and is eager to arrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants' hall. My father, you must know, is a bigoted devotee of the old school, and prides himself upon keeping up something of old English hospitality. He is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet with now-a-days in its purity, the old English country gentleman; for our men of fortune spend so much of their time in town, and fashion is carried so much into the country, that the strong rich peculiarities of ancient rural life are almost polished away. My father, however, from early years, took honest Peacham* for his text-book, instead of Chesterfield; he determined, in his own mind, that there was no condition more truly honourable and enviable than that of a country gentleman on his paternal lands, and therefore passes the whole of his time on his estate. He is a strenuous advocate for the revival of the old rural games and holiday observances, and is deeply read in the writers, ancient and modern, who have treated on the subject. Indeed, his favourite range of reading is among the authors who flourished at least two centuries since; who, he insists, wrote and thought more like true Englishmen than any of their successors. He even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few centuries earlier, when England was itself, and had its peculiar manners and customs. As he lives at some distance from the main road, in rather a lonely part of the country, without any rival gentry near him, he has that most enviable of all blessings to an Englishman, an opportunity of indulging the bent of his own humour without molestation. Being representative of the oldest family in the neighbourhood, and a great part of the peasantry being his tenants, he is much looked up to, and, in general, is known simply by the appellation of 'The Squire;' a title which has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial. I think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father, to prepare you for any eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd.\"\n\nWe had passed for some time along the wall of a park, and at length the chaise stopped at the gate. It was in a heavy magnificent old style, of iron bars, fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers. The huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the family crest. Close adjoining\n\n* Peacham's Complete Gentleman, 1622.\nwas the porter's lodge, sheltered under dark fir-trees, and almost buried in shrubbery.\n\nThe postboy rang a large porter's bell, which resounded through the still frosty air, and was answered by the distant barking of dogs, with which the mansion-house seemed garrisoned. An old woman immediately appeared at the gate. As the moonlight fell strongly upon her, I had a full view of a little primitive dame, dressed very much in the antique taste, with a neat kerchief and stomacher, and her silver hair peeping from under a cap of snowy whiteness. She came curtseying forth, with many expressions of simple joy at seeing her young master. Her husband, it seemed, was up at the house keeping Christmas eve in the servants' hall; they could not do without him, as he was the best hand at a song and story in the household.\n\nMy friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to the hall, which was at no great distance, while the chaise should follow on. Our road wound through a noble avenue of trees, among the naked branches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep vault of a cloudless sky. The lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight covering of snow, which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught a frosty crystal; and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent vapour, stealing up from the low grounds and threatening gradually to shroud the landscape.\n\nMy companion looked around him with transport:\u2014\"How often,\" said he, \"have I scampered up this avenue, on returning home on school vacations! How often have I played under these trees when a boy! I feel a degree of filial reverence for them, as we look up to those who have cherished us in childhood. My father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays, and having us around him on family festivals. He used to direct and superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the studies of their children. He was very particular that we should play the old English games according to their original form; and consulted old books for precedent and authority for every 'merrie disport;' yet I assure you there never was pedantry so delightful. It was the policy of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the happiest place in the world; and I value this delicious home-feeling as one of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow.\"\n\nWe were interrupted by the clamour of a troop of dogs of all sorts and sizes, \"mongrel, puppy, whelp and hound, and curs...\"\nof low degree,\" that, disturbed by the ring of the porter's bell, and the rattling of the chaise, came bounding, open-mouthed, across the lawn.\n\n\"The little dogs and all,\nTray, Blanch, and Sweetheart\u2014see, they bark at me!\"\n\ncried Bracebridge, laughing. At the sound of his voice, the bark was changed into a yelp of delight, and in a moment he was surrounded and almost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals.\n\nWe had now come in full view of the old family mansion, partly thrown in deep shadow, and partly lit up by the cold moonshine. It was an irregular building, of some magnitude, and seemed to be of the architecture of different periods. One wing was evidently very ancient, with heavy stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy, from among the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered with the moonbeams. The rest of the house was in the French taste of Charles the Second's time, having been repaired and altered, as my friend told me, by one of his ancestors, who returned with that monarch at the Restoration. The grounds about the house were laid out in the old formal manner of artificial flower-beds, clipped shrubberies, raised terraces, and heavy stone balustrades, ornamented with urns, a leaden statue or two, and a jet of water. The old gentleman, I was told, was extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its original state. He admired this fashion in gardening; it had an air of magnificence, was courtly and noble, and befitted good old family style. The boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening, had sprung up with modern republican notions, but did not suit a monarchical government; it smacked of the levelling system.\u2014I could not help smiling at this introduction of politics into gardening, though I expressed some apprehension that I should find the old gentleman rather intolerant in his creed.\u2014Frank assured me, however, that it was almost the only instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics; and he believed that he had got this notion from a member of parliament who once passed a few weeks with him. The squire was glad of any argument to defend his clipped yew-trees and formal terraces, which had been occasionally attacked by modern landscape-gardeners.\n\nAs we approached the house, we heard the sound of music, and now and then a burst of laughter, from one end of the building. This, Bracebridge said, must proceed from the servants' hall, where even enemies of Christmas would be usage. Here was the wild rice, the snap dragon, the burnt, and the imminent.\n\nSo interminable a ring repeated itself on arrival before the accompaniment of an army, homeward bound, the Universe, the gentleman, the countenance, the like myself, a mixture of all.\n\nThe family party was far advanced in travelling distance, and was assembled in four different branches, who were the uncles, the married daughters, and half-fledged sons-in-law. They were joined by others convinced, there was a group of children, a more tender-hearted, and a profusion of dolls, about whom the beings, who were carried off to the grave.\n\nWhile the ladies and Bracebridge were talking, I have called the attention of the squires to something of its peculiarities, which was suspended.\nvants' hall, where a great deal of revelry was permitted, and even encouraged, by the squire, throughout the twelve days of Christmas, provided everything was done conformably to ancient usage. Here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind, shoe the wild mare, hot cockles, steal the white loaf, bob apple, and snap dragon; the Yule log and Christmas candle were regularly burnt, and the mistletoe, with its white berries, hung up, to the imminent peril of all the pretty housemaids.*\n\nSo intent were the servants upon their sports, that we had to ring repeatedly before we could make ourselves heard. On our arrival being announced, the squire came out to receive us, accompanied by his two other sons; one a young officer in the army, home on leave of absence; the other an Oxonian, just from the University. The squire was a fine healthy-looking old gentleman, with silver hair curling lightly round an open florid countenance; in which the physiognomist, with the advantage, like myself, of a previous hint or two, might discover a singular mixture of whim and benevolence.\n\nThe family meeting was warm and affectionate: as the evening was far advanced, the squire would not permit us to change our travelling dresses, but ushered us at once to the company, which was assembled in a large old-fashioned hall. It was composed of different branches of a numerous family connection, where there were the usual proportion of old uncles and aunts, comfortable married dames, superannuated spinsters, blooming country cousins, half-fledged striplings, and bright-eyed boarding-school hoydens. They were variously occupied; some at a round game of cards; others conversing around the fireplace; at one end of the hall was a group of the young folks, some nearly grown up, others of a more tender and budding age, fully engrossed by a merry game; and a profusion of wooden horses, penny trumpets, and tattered dolls, about the floor, showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings, who, having frolicked through a happy day, had been carried off to slumber through a peaceful night.\n\nWhile the mutual greetings were going on between young Bracebridge and his relatives, I had time to scan the apartment. I have called it a hall, for so it had certainly been in old times, and the squire had evidently endeavoured to restore it to something of its primitive state. Over the heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior in armour, standing by a\n\n* The mistletoe is still hung up in farmhouses and kitchens at Christmas, and the young men have the privilege of kissing the girls under it, plucking each time a berry from the bush. When the berries are all plucked, the privilege ceases.\n\nL 2\nwhite horse, and on the opposite wall hung a helmet, buckler, and lance. At one end an enormous pair of antlers were inserted in the wall, the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend hats, whips, and spurs; and in the corners of the apartment were fowling-pieces, fishing-rods, and other sporting implements. The furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days, though some articles of modern convenience had been added, and the oaken floor had been carpeted; so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlour and hall.\n\nThe grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace, to make way for a fire of wood, in the midst of which was an enormous log glowing and blazing, and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat; this I understood was the Yule clog, which the squire was particular in having brought in and illumined on a Christmas eve, according to ancient custom.*\n\nIt was really delightful to see the old squire seated in his hereditary elbow chair, by the hospitable fireplace of his ancestors, and looking around him like the sun of a system, beaming warmth and gladness to every heart. Even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet, as he lazily shifted his position and yawned, would look fondly up in his master's face, wag his tail against the floor, and stretch himself again to sleep, confident of kindness and protection. There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described, but is immediately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his ease. I had not been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy old cavalier, before I found myself as much at home as if I had been one of the family.\n\nSupper was announced shortly after our arrival. It was served up in a spacious oaken chamber, the panels of which shone with wax, and around which were several family portraits decorated\n\n* The Yule clog is a great log of wood, sometimes the root of a tree, brought into the house with great ceremony, on Christmas eve, laid in the fireplace, and lighted with the brand of last year's clog. While it lasted, there was great drinking, singing, and telling of tales. Sometimes it was accompanied by Christmas candles; but in the cottages the only light was from the ruddy blaze of the great wood fire. The Yule clog was to burn all night; if it went out, it was considered a sign of ill luck.\n\nHerrick mentions it in one of his songs\u2014\n\nCome, bring with a noise,\nMy merrie, merrie boyes,\nThe Christmas log to the firing;\nWhile my good dame, she\nBids ye all be free,\nAnd drink to your hearts' desiring.\n\nThe Yule clog is still burnt in many farmhouses and kitchens in England, particularly in the north, and there are several superstitions connected with it among the peasantry. If a squinting person came to the house while it is burning, or a person barefooted, it is considered an ill omen. The brand remaining from the Yule clog is carefully put away to light the next year's Christmas fire.\nwith holly and ivy. Besides the accustomed lights, two great wax tapers, called Christmas candles, wreathed with greens, were placed on a highly-polished beaufet among the family plate. The table was abundantly spread with substantial fare; but the squire made his supper of frumenty, a dish made of wheat cakes boiled in milk, with rich spices, being a standing dish in old times for Christmas eve. I was happy to find my old friend, mince pie, in the retinue of the feast; and finding him to be perfectly orthodox, and that I need not be ashamed of my predilection, I greeted him with all the warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel acquaintance.\n\nThe mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humours of an eccentric personage whom Mr. Bracebridge always addressed with the quaint appellation of Master Simon. He was a tight brisk little man, with the air of an arrant old bachelor. His nose was shaped like the bill of a parrot; his face slightly pitted with the small-pox, with a dry perpetual bloom on it, like a frostbitten leaf in autumn. He had an eye of great quickness and vivacity, with a drollery and lurking wagging of expression that was irresistible. He was evidently the wit of the family, dealing very much in sly jokes and innuendoes with the ladies, and making infinite merriment by harpings upon old themes; which, unfortunately, my ignorance of the family chronicles did not permit me to enjoy. It seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep a young girl next him in a continual agony of stifled laughter, in spite of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother, who sat opposite. Indeed, he was the idol of the younger part of the company, who laughed at everything he said or did, and at every turn of his countenance. I could not wonder at it; for he must have been a miracle of accomplishments in their eyes. He could imitate Punch and Judy; make an old woman of his hand, with the assistance of a burnt cork and pocket-handkerchief; and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature, that the young folks were ready to die with laughing.\n\nI was let briefly into his history by Frank Bracebridge. He was an old bachelor, of a small independent income, which, by careful management, was sufficient for all his wants. He revolved through the family system like a vagrant comet in its orbit; sometimes visiting one branch, and sometimes another quite remote; as is often the case with gentlemen of extensive connections and small fortunes in England. He had a chirping buoyant disposition, always enjoying the present moment; and his frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring\nthose rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so uncharitably charged. He was a complete family chronicle, being versed in the genealogy, history, and intermarriages of the whole house of Bracebridge, which made him a great favourite with the old folks; he was the beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters, among whom he was habitually considered rather a young fellow, and he was master of the revels among the children; so that there was not a more popular being in the sphere in which he moved than Mr. Simon Bracebridge.\n\nOf late years he had resided almost entirely with the squire, to whom he had become a factotum, and whom he particularly delighted by jumping with his humour in respect to old times, and by having a scrap of an old song to suit every occasion. We had presently a specimen of his last-mentioned talent, for no sooner was supper removed, and spiced wines and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced, than Master Simon was called on for a good old Christmas song. He bethought himself for a moment, and then, with a sparkle of the eye, and a voice that was by no means bad, excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto, like the notes of a split reed, he quavered forth a quaint old ditty.\n\nNew Christmas is come,\nLet us beat up the drum,\nAnd call all our neighbours together,\nAnd when they appear,\nLet us make them such cheer,\nAs will keep out the wind and the weather, &c.\n\nThe supper had disposed every one to gaiety, and an old harper was summoned from the servants' hall, where he had been strumming all the evening, and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the squire's home-brewed. He was a kind of hanger-on, I was told, of the establishment, and, though ostensibly a resident of the village, was oftener to be found in the squire's kitchen than his own home, the old gentleman being fond of the sound of \"harp in hall.\"\n\nThe dance, like most dances after supper, was a merry one; some of the older folks joined in it, and the squire himself figured down several couple with a partner, with whom he affirmed he had danced at every Christmas for nearly half a century. Master Simon, who seemed to be a kind of connecting link between the old times and the new, and to be withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments, evidently piqued himself on his dancing, and was endeavouring to gain credit by the heel and toe, rigadoon, and other graces of the ancient school; but he had unluckily asserted himself with a little romping girl from boarding-school,\nwho, by her wild vivacity, kept him continually on the stretch, and defeated all his sober attempts at elegance:\u2014such are the ill-assorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately prone!\n\nThe young Oxonian, on the contrary, had led out one of his maiden aunts, on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity; he was full of practical jokes, and his delight was to tease his aunts and cousins; yet, like all madcap youngsters, he was a universal favourite among the women. The most interesting couple in the dance was the young officer and a ward of the squire's, a beautiful blushing girl of seventeen. From several shy glances which I had noticed in the course of the evening, I suspected there was a little kindness growing up between them; and, indeed, the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a romantic girl. He was tall, slender, and handsome, and like most young British officers of late years, had picked up various small accomplishments on the continent\u2014he could talk French and Italian\u2014draw landscapes, sing very tolerably\u2014dance divinely; but, above all, he had been wounded at Waterloo:\u2014what girl of seventeen, well read in poetry and romance, could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection!\n\nThe moment the dance was over, he caught up a guitar, and lolling against the old marble fireplace, in an attitude which I am half inclined to suspect was studied, began the little French air of the Troubadour. The squire, however, exclaimed against having anything on Christmas eve but good old English; upon which the young minstrel, casting up his eye for a moment, as if in an effort of memory, struck into another strain, and, with a charming air of gallantry, gave Herrick's \"Night-Piece to Julia.\"\n\nHer eyes the glow-worm lend thee,\nThe shooting star attend thee,\nAnd the elves also,\nWhose little eyes glow\nLike the sparks of fire befriend thee.\n\nNo Will-o'-the-Wisp mislight thee;\nNor snake nor slow-worm bite thee;\nBut on, on thy way,\nNot making a stay,\nSince ghost there is none to affright thee.\n\nThen let not the dark thee cumber\nWhat tho' the moon does slumber,\nThe stars of the night\nWill lend thee their light,\nLike tapers clear without number.\n\nThen, Julia, let me woo thee,\nThus, thus to come unto me,\nAnd when I shall meet\nThy silvery feet,\nMy soul I'll pour into thee.\nThe song might or might not have been intended in compliment to the fair Julia, for so I found his partner was called; she, however, was certainly unconscious of any such application, for she never looked at the singer, but kept her eyes cast upon the floor. Her face was suffused, it is true, with a beautiful blush, and there was a gentle heaving of the bosom, but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise of the dance; indeed, so great was her indifference, that she amused herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers, and by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the floor.\n\nThe party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of shaking hands. As I passed through the hall, on my way to my chamber, the dying embers of the Yule clog still sent forth a dusky glow, and had it not been the season when \"no spirit dares stir abroad,\" I should have been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight, and peep whether the fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth.\n\nMy chamber was in the old part of the mansion, the ponderous furniture of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants. The room was panelled, with cornices of heavy carved work, in which flowers and grotesque faces were strangely intermingled; and a row of black-looking portraits stared mournfully at me from the walls. The bed was of rich though faded damask, with a lofty tester, and stood in a niche opposite a bow window. I had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed to break forth in the air just below the window. I listened, and found it proceeded from a band, which I concluded to be the waits from some neighbouring village. They went round the house, playing under the windows. I drew aside the curtains to hear them more distinctly. The moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement, partially lighting up the antiquated apartment. The sounds, as they receded, became more soft and aerial, and seemed to accord with the quiet and moonlight. I listened and listened\u2014they became more and more tender and remote, and, as they gradually died away, my head sunk upon the pillow, and I fell asleep.\nCHRISTMAS DAY.\n\nDark and dull night, fie hence away,\nAnd give the honour to this day\nThat sees December turn\u2019d to May.\n\nWhy does the chilling winter\u2019s morn\nSmile like a field beset with corn?\nOr smell like to a mead new-shorne,\nThus on the sudden?\u2014Come and see\nThe cause why things thus fragrant be.\u2014Homer.\n\nWhen I woke the next morning, it seemed as if all the events of the preceding evening had been a dream, and nothing but the identity of the ancient chamber convinced me of their reality. While I lay musing on my pillow, I heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door, and a whispering consultation. Presently a choir of small voices chanted forth an old Christmas carol, the burden of which was\u2014\n\nRejoice, our Saviour he was born\nOn Christmas day in the morning.\n\nI rose softly, slipped on my clothes, opened the door suddenly, and beheld one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could imagine. It consisted of a boy and two girls, the eldest not more than six, and lovely as seraphs. They were going the rounds of the house, and singing at every chamber door; but my sudden appearance frightened them into mute bashfulness. They remained for a moment playing on their lips with their fingers, and now and then stealing a shy glance, from under their eyebrows, until, as if by one impulse, they scampered away, and as they turned an angle of the gallery, I heard them laughing in triumph at their escape.\n\nEverything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this stronghold of old-fashioned hospitality. The window of my chamber looked out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape. There was a sloping lawn, a fine stream winding at the foot of it, and a tract of park beyond, with noble clumps of trees, and herds of deer. At a distance was a neat hamlet, with the smoke from the cottage chimneys hanging over it; and a church with its dark spire in strong relief against the clear cold sky. The house was surrounded with evergreens, according to the English custom, which would have given almost an appearance of summer; but the morning was extremely frosty; the light vapour of the preceding evening had been precipitated by the cold, and covered all the trees and every blade of grass with its fine crystallizations. The rays of a bright morning sun had a dazzling effect among the glittering foliage.\nA robin, perched upon the top of a mountain ash that hung its clusters of red berries just before my window, was basking himself in the sunshine, and piping a few querulous notes; and a peacock was displaying all the glories of his train, and strutting with the pride and gravity of a Spanish grandee, on the terrace walk below.\n\nI had scarcely dressed myself, when a servant appeared to invite me to family prayers. He showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing of the house, where I found the principal part of the family already assembled in a kind of gallery, furnished with cushions, hassocks, and large prayer-books; the servants were seated on benches below. The old gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery, and Master Simon acted as clerk, and made the responses; and I must do him the justice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum.\n\nThe service was followed by a Christmas carol, which Mr. Bracebridge himself had constructed from a poem of his favourite author, Herrick; and it had been adapted to an old church melody by Master Simon. As there were several good voices among the household, the effect was extremely pleasing; but I was particularly gratified by the exaltation of heart, and sudden sally of grateful feeling, with which the worthy squire delivered one stanza: his eye glistening, and his voice rambling out of all the bounds of time and tune:\n\n\"'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth\nWith guiltless mirth,\nAnd givest me Wassail bowls to drink\nSpiced to the brink:\nLord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand\nThat calls my mind:\nAnd giv'st me for my bushall owne,\n'Twice ten for one.\"\n\nI afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every Sunday and saint's day throughout the year, either by Mr. Bracebridge or by some member of the family. It was once almost universally the case at the seats of the nobility and gentry of England, and it is much to be regretted that the custom is falling into neglect; for the dullest observer must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those households, where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship in the morning gives, as it were, the key-note to every temper for the day, and attunes every spirit to harmony.\n\nOur breakfast consisted of what the squire denominated true old English fare. He indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts of tea and toast, which he censured as among\nthe causes of modern effeminacy and weak nerves, and the decline of old English heartiness; and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his guests, yet there was a brave display of cold meats, wine, and ale on the sideboard.\n\nAfter breakfast I walked about the grounds with Frank Bracebridge and Master Simon, or Mr. Simon, as he was called by everybody but the squire. We were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs, that seemed loungers about the establishment; from the frisking spaniel to the steady old stag-hound; the last of which was of a race that had been in the family time out of mind; they were all obedient to a dog-whistle which hung to Master Simon's buttonhole, and in the midst of their gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried in his hand.\n\nThe old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine than by pale moonlight; and I could not but feel the force of the squire's idea, that the formal terraces, heavily-moulded balustrades, and clipped yew-trees, carried with them an air of proud aristocracy. There appeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place, and I was making some remarks upon what I termed a flock of them, that were basking under a sunny wall, when I was gently corrected in my phraseology by Master Simon, who told me that, according to the most ancient and approved treatise on hunting, I must say a muster of peacocks. \"In the same way,\" added he, with a slight air of pedantry, \"we say a flight of doves or swallows, a bevy of quails, a herd of deer, of wrens or cranes, a skulk of foxes, or a building of rooks.\" He went on to inform me that, according to Sir Anthony Fitzherbert, we ought to ascribe to this bird \"both understanding and glory; for, being praised, he will presently set up his tail, chiefly against the sun, to the intent you may the better behold the beauty thereof. But at the fall of the leaf, when his tail falleth, he will mourn and hide himself in corners, till his tail come again as it was.\"\n\nI could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so whimsical a subject; but I found that the peacocks were birds of some consequence at the hall; for Frank Bracebridge informed me that they were great favourites with his father, who was extremely careful to keep up the breed; partly because they belonged to chivalry, and were in great request at the stately banquets of the olden time; and partly because they had a pomp and magnificence about them, highly becoming an old family mansion. Nothing, he was accustomed to say, had an air of\ngreater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone balustrade.\n\nMaster Simon had now to hurry off, having an appointment at the parish church with the village choristers, who were to perform some music of his selection. There was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful flow of animal spirits of the little man; and I confess I had been somewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly were not in the range of everyday reading. I mentioned this last circumstance to Frank Bracebridge, who told me with a smile that Master Simon's whole stock of erudition was confined to some half a dozen old authors, which the squire had put into his hands, and which he read over and over whenever he had a studious fit, as he sometimes had on a rainy day, or a long winter evening. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's \"Book of Husbandry;\" Markham's \"Country Contentments;\" the \"Tretyse of Hunting,\" by Sir Thomas Cockayne, Knight; Isaac Walton's \"Angler,\" and two or three more such ancient worthies of the pen, were his standard authorities; and, like all men who know but a few books, he looked up to them with a kind of idolatry, and quoted them on all occasions. As to his songs, they were chiefly picked out of old books in the squire's library, and adapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last century. His practical application of scraps of literature, however, had caused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of book knowledge by all the grooms, huntsmen, and small sportsmen of the neighbourhood.\n\nWhile we were talking, we heard the distant toll of the village bell, and I was told that the squire was a little particular in having his household at church on a Christmas morning; considering it a day of pouring out of thanks and rejoicing; for, as old Tusser observed,\n\n\"At Christmas be merry, and thankful within,\nAnd feast thy poor neighbours, the great with the small.\"\n\n\"If you are disposed to go to church,\" said Frank Bracebridge, \"I can promise you a specimen of my cousin Simon's musical achievements. As the church is destitute of an organ, he has formed a band from the village amateurs, and established a musical club for their improvement; he has also sorted a choir, as he sorted my father's pack of hounds, according to the directions of Jervaise Markham, in his 'Country Contentments;' for the bass he has sought out all the 'deep, solemn mouths,' and for the tenor the 'loud-ringing mouths,' among the country bumpkins, and for 'sweet mouths,' he has culled with curious\ntaste among the prettiest lasses in the neighbourhood; though these last, he affirms, are the most difficult to keep in tune; your pretty female singer being exceedingly wayward and capricious, and very liable to accident.\"\n\nAs the morning, though frosty, was remarkably fine and clear, the most of the family walked to the church, which was a very old building of gray stone, and stood near a village, about half a mile from the park gate. Adjoining it was a low snug parsonage, which seemed coeval with the church. The front of it was perfectly matted with a yew-tree that had been trained against its walls, through the dense foliage of which, apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique lattices. As we passed this sheltered nest, the parson issued forth and preceded us.\n\nI had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor, such as is often found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron's table, but I was disappointed. The parson was a little, meagre, black-looking man, with a grizzled wig that was too wide, and stood off from each ear, so that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it, like a dried filbert in its shell. He wore a rusty coat, with great skirts, and pockets that would have held the church bible and prayer-book; and his small legs seemed still smaller, from being planted in large shoes, decorated with enormous buckles.\n\nI was informed by Frank Bracebridge, that the parson had been a chum of his father's at Oxford, and had received this living shortly after the latter had come to his estate. He was a complete black-letter hunter, and would scarcely read a work printed in the Roman character. The editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his delight; and he was indefatigable in his researches after such old English writers as have fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness. In deference, perhaps, to the notions of Mr. Bracebridge, he had made diligent investigations into the festive rites and holiday customs of former times, and had been as zealous in the inquiry as if he had been a boon companion, but it was merely with that plodding spirit with which men of astute temperament follow up any track of study merely because it is denominated learning, indifferent to its intrinsic nature, whether it be the illustration of the wisdom or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity. He had pored over these old volumes so intensely, that they seemed to have been reflected into his countenance, which, if the face be indeed an index of the mind, might be compared to a title-page of black letter.\nOn reaching the church porch, we found the parson rebuking the gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which the church was decorated. It was, he observed, an unholy plant, profaned by having been used by the Druids in their mystic ceremonies; and though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and kitchens, yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church as unhallowed, and totally unfit for sacred purposes. So tenacious was he on this point, that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great part of the humble trophies of his taste, before the parson would consent to enter upon the service of the day.\n\nThe interior of the church was venerable but simple; on the walls were several mural monuments of the Bracebridges, and just beside the altar was a tomb of ancient workmanship, on which lay the effigy of a warrior in armour, with his legs crossed, a sign of his having been a crusader. I was told it was one of the family who had signalized himself in the Holy Land, and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall.\n\nDuring service, Master Simon stood up in the pew, and repeated the responses very audibly; evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school, and a man of old family connections. I observed, too, that he turned over the leaves of a folio prayer-book with something of a flourish; possibly to show off an enormous seal-ring which enriched one of his fingers, and which had the look of a family relic. But he was evidently most solicitous about the musical part of the service, keeping his eye fixed intently on the choir, and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis.\n\nThe orchestra was in a small gallery, and presented a most whimsical grouping of heads, piled one above the other, among which I particularly noticed that of the village tailor, a pale fellow with a retreating forehead and chin, who played on the clarionet, and seemed to have blown his face to a point; and there was another, a short puffy man, stooping and laboring at a bass-viol, so as to show nothing but the top of a round bald head, like the egg of an ostrich. There were two or three pretty faces among the female singers, to which the keen air of a frosty morning had given a bright rosy tint; but the gentlemen choirsisters had evidently been chosen, like old Cremona fiddles, more for tone than looks; and as several had to sing from the same book, there were clusterings of odd physiognomies, not unlike those groups of cherubs we sometimes see on country tombstones.\n\nThe usual music was heard, the vocal parts being sung by some boys, and some by travelling musicians, rendering more by far than usual. But the greatest noise was arranged by the organist, who, expecting to hear the music, everything else, the whole chorus began to play, and seemed to be playing loud and confusingly, not very well, or rather not very well in a pair of loud, sonorous notes, which were wrapped up in a sort of wriggling buzz, like the nasal sole of a fish.\n\nThe parson's religious ceremonies were conducted merely as a matter of form, the correctors of the parish church, and the bishop of Cesarea, St. Peter, and the cloud more than once quoted quotations. The parson was a mighty and powerful man, seemed inclined to believe he had a legion of angels in the course of his life, completely embroiled in litigation, when he thought the ceremonies were going out of the hands of the parson lived in the present.\n\n* From the \"House of Commons\" House spent much money on the Lord's day, grounded on the Lord's day, Lev. xxii. 24; Lev. xxiii. 7; Matt. xxvi. 29; Christ's masses, and the custom of which Parliament has passed orders to be called Christmas.\nThe usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well, the vocal parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental, and some loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling over a passage with prodigious celerity, and clearing more bars than the keenest fox-hunter to be in at the death. But the great trial was an anthem that had been prepared and arranged by Master Simon, and on which he had founded great expectation. Unluckily there was a blunder at the very onset; the musicians became flurried; Master Simon was in a fever; everything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus beginning \"Now let us sing with one accord,\" which seemed to be a signal for parting company: all became discord and confusion; each shifted for himself, and got to the end as well, or rather, as soon as he could, excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles, bestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose, who happened to stand a little apart, and, being wrapped up in his own melody, kept on a quavering course, wriggling his head, ogling his book, and winding all up by a nasal solo of at least three bars' duration.\n\nThe parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies of Christmas, and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day of thanksgiving, but of rejoicing; supporting the correctness of his opinions by the earliest usages of the church, and enforcing them by the authorities of Theophilus of Cesarea, St. Cyprian, St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and a cloud more of saints and fathers, from whom he made copious quotations. I was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity of such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one present seemed inclined to dispute; but I soon found that the good man had a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with; having, in the course of his researches on the subject of Christmas, got completely embroiled in the sectarian controversies of the Revolution, when the Puritans made such a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the church, and poor old Christmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of Parliament.* The worthy parson lived but with times past, and knew but little of the present.\n\n* From the \"Flying Eagle,\" a small Gazette, published December 24th, 1652\u2014\"The House spent much time this day about the business of the Navy, for settling the affairs at sea, and before they rose, were presented with a terrible remonstrance against Christmas day, grounded upon divine Scriptures, 2 Cor. v. 16; 1 Cor. xv. 14, 17; and in honour of the Lord's day, grounded upon these Scriptures: John xx. 1; Rev. i. 10; Psalms cxviii. 24; Lev. xxiii. 7, 11; Mark xv. 8; Psalms lxxiv. 10; in which Christmas is called Anti-Christ's mass, and those Mass-mongers and Papists who observe it, &c. In consequence of which Parliament spent some time in consultation about the abolition of Christmas day, passed orders to that effect, and resolved to sit on the following day, which was commonly called Christmas day.\"\nShut up among worm-eaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated little study, the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the day; while the era of the Revolution was mere modern history. He forgot that nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of poor mince-pie throughout the land; when plum porridge was denounced as \"mere popery,\" and roast-beef as anti-christian; and that Christmas had been brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of King Charles at the Restoration. He kindled into warmth with the ardour of his contest, and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat; he had a stubborn conflict with old Prynne and two or three other forgotten champions of the Roundheads, on the subject of Christmas festivity; and concluded by urging his hearers, in the most solemn and affecting manner, to stand to the traditional customs of their fathers, and feast and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the church.\n\nI have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate effects; for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and all possessed with the gaiety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their pastor. The elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard, greeting and shaking hands; and the children ran about crying \"Ule! Ule!\" and repeating some uncoth rhymes,* which the parson, who had joined us, informed me had been handed down from days of yore. The villagers doffed their hats to the squire as he passed, giving him the good wishes of the season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity, and were invited by him to the hall, to take something to keep out the cold of the weather; and I heard blessings uttered by several of the poor, which convinced me that, in the midst of his enjoyments, the worthy old cavalier had not forgotten the true Christmas virtue of charity.\n\nOn our way homeward his heart seemed overflowed with generous and happy feelings. As we passed over a rising ground which commanded something of a prospect, the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our ears: the squire paused for a few moments, and looked around with an air of inexpressible benignity. The beauty of the day was of itself sufficient to inspire philanthropy. Notwithstanding the frostiness of the morning, the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient power to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern declivity, and to bring out the living green which\n\n* \"Ule! Ule!\nThree puddings in a pule;\nCrack nuts and cry Ule!\"\n\nadorns an hillside of smiling slopes, shaded slopes, broad rays and glittering translations to cover the surface of the triumph of winter; it was hospitality, kindness, and the pleasure to the eyes of the \"I love,\" said it is a great thing are sure of as it were, they disposed to churlish enmity.\n\nThe squires games and among the lordly the old hall daylight; whispering and humming day long, and make me \"had a great the promotion They made truly say with\n\n\"The nation\n\n* \"An English the morning), had beer was broached, mug, and good Ch break, or else two her round the man COAL FIRE.\nadorns an English landscape even in mid-winter. Large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted with the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows. Every sheltered bank, on which the broad rays rested, yielded its silver rill of cold and limpid water, glittering through the dripping grass; and sent up slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just above the surface of the earth. There was something truly cheering in this triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter; it was, as the squire observed, an emblem of Christmas hospitality, breaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness, and thawing every heart into a flow. He pointed with pleasure to the indications of good cheer roeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farm-houses, and low thatched cottages.\n\n\"I love,\" said he, \"to see this day well kept by rich and poor; it is a great thing to have one day in the year, at least, when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go, and of having, as it were, the world all thrown open to you; and I am almost disposed to join with Poor Robin, in his malediction on every churlish enemy to this honest festival:\n\n\"Those who at Christmas do repine,\nAnd would fain hence despatch him,\nMay they with old Duke Humphry dine,\nOr else may Squire Ketch catch 'em.\"\n\nThe squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower orders, and countenanced by the higher; when the old halls of castles and manor-houses were thrown open at daylight; when the tables were covered with brawn, and beef, and humming ale; when the harp and the carol resounded all day long, and when rich and poor were alike welcome to enter and make merry.* \"Our old games and local customs,\" said he, \"had a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home, and the promotion of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord. They made the times merrier, and kinder, and better; and I can truly say with one of our old poets:\n\n\"I like them well\u2014the curious preciseness\nAnd all-pretended gravity of those\nThat seek to banish hence these harmless sports,\nHave thrust away much ancient honesty.\"\n\n\"The nation,\" continued he, \"is altered; we have almost lost\n\n* An English gentleman, at the opening of the great day (i.e. on Christmas day in the morning), had all his tenants and neighbours enter his hall by daybreak. The strong beer was broached, and the black-jacks went plentifully about with toast, sugar, and nutmeg, and good Cheshire cheese. The Hackin (the great sausage) must be boiled by day-break, or else two young men must take the maiden (i.e. the cook) by the arms, and run her round the market-place till she is shamed of her laziness.\"\u2014ROUND ABOUT OUR SEA COAL FIRE.\nour simple true-hearted peasantry. They have broken asunder from the higher classes, and seem to think their interests are separate. They have become too knowing, and begin to read newspapers, listen to ale-house politicians, and talk of reform. I think one mode to keep them in good humour in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to pass more time on their estates, mingle more among the country people, and set the merry old English games going again.\"\n\nSuch was the good squire's project for mitigating public discontent; and, indeed, he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice, and a few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old style. The country people, however, did not understand how to play their parts in the scene of hospitality; many uncoth circumstances occurred; the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country, and more beggars drawn into the neighbourhood in one week than the parish officers could get rid of in a year. Since then he had contented himself with inviting the decent part of the neighbouring peasantry to call at the hall on Christmas day, and with distributing beef, and bread, and ale, among the poor, that they might make merry in their own dwellings.\n\nWe had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a distance. A band of country lads, without coats, their shirt sleeves fancifully tied with ribands, their hats decorated with greens, and clubs in their hands, were seen advancing up the avenue, followed by a large number of villagers and peasantry. They stopped before the hall door, where the music struck up a peculiar air, and the lads performed a curious and intricate dance, advancing, retreating, and striking their clubs together, keeping exact time to the music; while one, whimsically crowned with a fox's skin, the tail of which flaunted down his back, kept capering round the skirts of the dance, and rattling a Christmas box, with many antic gesticulations.\n\nThe squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and delight, and gave me a full account of its origin, which he traced to the times when the Romans held possession of the island, plainly proving that this was a lineal descendant of the sword dance of the ancients. \"It was now,\" he said, \"nearly extinct, but he had accidentally met with traces of it in the neighbourhood, and had encouraged its revival; though, to tell the truth, it was too apt to be followed up by the rough cudgel-play and broken heads in the evening.\"\n\nAfter the dance was concluded, the whole party was enter-\ntained with brawn and beef, and stout home-brewed. The squire himself mingled among the rustics, and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and regard. It is true, I perceived two or three of the younger peasants, as they were raising their tankards to their mouths, when the squire's back was turned, making something of a grimace, and giving each other the wink; but the moment they caught my eye, they pulled grave faces, and were exceedingly demure. With Master Simon, however, they all seemed more at their ease. His varied occupations and amusements had made him well known throughout the neighbourhood. He was a visitor at every farm-house and cottage, gossiped with the farmers and their wives, romped with their daughters, and, like that type of a vagrant bachelor, the humble-bee, tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country round.\n\nThe bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and affability. There is something genuine and affectionate in the gaiety of the lower orders, when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of those above them; the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth, and a kind word or a small pleasantry frankly uttered by a patron, gladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine. When the squire had retired, the merriment increased, and there was much joking and laughter, particularly between Master Simon and a hale, ruddy-faced, white-headed farmer, who appeared to be the wit of the village; for I observed all his companions to wait with open mouths for his retorts, and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand them.\n\nThe whole house, indeed, seemed abandoned to merriment; as I passed to my room to dress for dinner, I heard the sound of music in a small court, and looking through a window that commanded it, I perceived a band of wandering musicians, with pandean pipes and tambourine; a pretty, coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad, while several of the other servants were looking on. In the midst of her sport, the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window, and, colouring up, ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion.\nTHE CHRISTMAS DINNER.\n\nLo! now is come our joyful'st feast!\nLet every man be jolly;\nEach room with yule leaves is drest,\nAnd every post with holly.\nNow all our neighbours' chimneys smoke,\nAnd Christmas blocks are burning;\nTheir ovens they with half't meats choke,\nAnd all their spits are turning.\nWithout the door let sorrow lie,\nAnd if, for cold, it hap to die,\nWe'll bury 't in a Christmas pye,\nAnd evermore be merry.\u2014WITHERS' JUVENILLA.\n\nI had finished my toilet, and was loitering with Frank Bracebridge in the library, when we heard a distinct thwacking sound, which he informed me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner. The squire kept up old customs in kitchen as well as hall; and the rolling-pin, struck upon the dresser by the cook, summoned the servants to carry in the meats.\n\nJust in this nick the cook knock'd thrice,\nAnd all the waiters in a trice\nHis summons did obey;\nEach serving man, with dish in hand,\nMarch'd boldly up, like our train band,\nPresented and away.*\n\nThe dinner was served up in the great hall, where the squire always held his Christmas banquet. A blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped on to warm the spacious apartment, and the flame went sparkling and wreathing up the wide-mouthed chimney. The great picture of the crusader and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the occasion; and holly and ivy had likewise been wreathed round the helmet and weapons on the opposite wall, which I understood were the arms of the same warrior. I must own, by the by, I had strong doubts about the authenticity of the painting and armour as having belonged to the crusader, they certainly having the stamp of more recent days; but I was told that the painting had been so considered time out of mind; and that, as to the armour, it had been found in a lumber-room, and elevated to its present situation by the squire, who at once determined it to be the armour of the family hero; and as he was absolute authority on all such subjects in his own household, the matter had passed into current acceptation. A sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy, on which was a display of plate that might have vied (at least in variety) with Belshazzar's parade of the vessels of the temple: \"flagons, cans, cups, beakers, goblets, basins, and ewers;\" the gorgeous utensils of good companionship that had\n\n* Sir John Suchling\ngradually accumulated through many generations of jovial housekeepers. Before these stood the two Yule candles, beaming like two stars of the first magnitude; other lights were distributed in branches, and the whole array glittered like a firmament of silver.\n\nWe were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy, the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace, and twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody. Never did Christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of countenances; those who were not handsome were, at least, happy; and happiness is a rare improver of your hard-favoured visage. I always consider an old English family as well worth studying as a collection of Holbein's portraits or Albert Durer's prints. There is much antiquarian lore to be acquired; much knowledge of the physiognomies of former times. Perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those rows of old family portraits with which the mansions of this country are stocked; certain it is, that the quaint features of antiquity are often most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines; and I have traced an old family nose through a whole picture-gallery, legitimately handed down from generation to generation, almost from the time of the Conquest. Something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company around me. Many of their faces had evidently originated in a gothic age, and been merely copied by succeeding generations; and there was one little girl in particular, of staid demeanour, with a high Roman nose, and an antique vinegar aspect, who was a great favourite of the squire's, being, as he said, a Bracebridge all over, and the very counterpart of one of his ancestors who figured in the court of Henry VIII.\n\nThe parson said grace, which was not a short familiar one, such as is commonly addressed to the Deity in these uncereemonious days; but a long, courtly, well-worded one of the ancient school. There was now a pause, as if something was expected; when suddenly the butler entered the hall with some degree of bustle: he was attended by a servant on each side with a large wax-light, and bore a silver dish, on which was an enormous pig's head, decorated with rosemary, with a lemon in its mouth, which was placed with great formality at the head of the table. The moment this pageant made its appearance, the harper struck up a flourish; at the conclusion of which the young Oxonian, on receiving a hint from the squire, gave, with an air of the most comic gravity, an old carol, the first verse of which was as follows:\nTHE SKETCH BOOK.\n\nCaput apri defero,\nReddems laudes Domino.\nThe boar's head in hand bring I,\nWith garlands gay and rosemary.\nI pray you all synges merily\nQui satis in convivio.\n\nThough prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities, from being apprized of the peculiar hobby of mine host; yet I confess, the parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me, until I gathered from the conversation of the squire and the parson, that it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boar's head; a dish formerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and song, at great tables, on Christmas day. \"I like the old custom,\" said the squire, \"not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself, but because it was observed at the college at Oxford at which I was educated. When I hear the old song chanted, it brings to mind the time when I was young and gamesome\u2014and the noble old college hall\u2014and my fellow-students loitering about in their black gowns; many of whom, poor lads, are now in their graves!\"\n\nThe parson, however, whose mind was not haunted by such associations, and who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment, objected to the Oxonian's version of the carol, which, he affirmed, was different from that sung at college. He went on, with the dry perseverance of a commentator, to give the college reading, accompanied by sundry annotations; addressing himself at first to the company at large; but finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk and other objects, he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished, until he concluded his remarks in an under voice to a fat-headed old gentleman next him, who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge plateful of turkey.*\n\n* The old ceremony of serving up the boar's head on Christmas day is still observed in the hall of Queen's College, Oxford. I was favoured by the parson with a copy of the carol as now sung; and as it may be acceptable to such of my readers as are curious in these grave and learned matters, I give it entire:\n\nThe boar's head in hand bear I,\nBedeck'd with bays and rosemary;\nAnd I pray you, my masters, be merry,\nQuot estis in convivio.\nCaput apri defero,\nReddems laudes Domino.\n\nThe boar's head, as I understand,\nIs the rarest dish in all this land,\nWhich thus bedeck'd with a gay garland\nLet us savour cantico.\nCaput apri defero, &c.\n\nOur steward hath provided this\nIn honour of the King of Bliss,\nWhich on this day to be served is\nIn Reginald Atrio.\nCaput apri defero, &c. &c. &c.\n\nThe table was an epitome of all larders.

A distinguished post was allotted to \"ancient sirloin,\" as mine host termed it; being, as he added, \"the standard of old English hospitality, and a joint of goodly presence, and full of expectation.\" There were several dishes quaintly decorated, and which had evidently something traditional in their embellishments; but about which, as I did not like to appear over-curious, I asked no questions.\n\nI could not, however, but notice a pie, magnificently decorated with peacock's feathers, in imitation of the tail of that bird, which overshadowed a considerable tract of the table. This, the squire confessed, with some little hesitation, was a pheasant pie, though a peacock pie was certainly the most authentical; but there had been such a mortality among the peacocks this season, that he could not prevail upon himself to have one killed.*\n\nIt would be tedious, perhaps, to my wiser readers, who may not have that foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things, to which I am a little given, were I to mention the other make-shifts of this worthy old humorist, by which he was endeavouring to follow up, though at humble distance, the quaint customs of antiquity. I was pleased, however, to see the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives; who, indeed, entered readily into the full spirit of them, and seemed all well versed in their parts; having doubtless been present at many a rehearsal. I was amused, too, at the air of profound gravity with which the butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them, however eccentric. They had an old-fashioned look; having, for the most part, been brought up in the household, and grown into keeping with the antiquated mansion, and the humours of its lord; and most probably looked upon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of honourable housekeeping.\n\nWhen the cloth was removed, the butler brought in a huge silver vessel of rare and curious workmanship, which he placed\n\n* The peacock was anciently in great demand for stately entertainments. Sometimes it was made into a pie, at one end of which the head appeared above the crust, in all its plumage, with the neck richly gilt; at the other end the tail was displayed. Such pies were served up at the solemn banquets of chivalry, when knights-errant pledged themselves to undertake any perilous enterprise; whence came the ancient oath, used by Justice Shallow, \"by cock and pie.\"\n\nThe peacock was also an important dish for the Christmas feast; and Massinger, in his \"City Madam,\" gives some idea of the extravagance with which this, as well as other dishes, was prepared for the gorgeous revels of the olden times:\n\n\"Men may talk of country Christmases:\nTheir thirty pound butter'd eggs\u2014their pie of carps' tongues:\nTheir pheasants drench'd with ambergris; the carcasses of three fat wethers bruised\nfor gravy to make sauce for a single peacock!\"\nbefore the squire. Its appearance was hailed with acclamation; being the Wassail Bowl, so renowned in Christmas festivity. The contents had been prepared by the squire himself; for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which he particularly prided himself; alleging that it was too abstruse and complex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant. It was a potion, indeed, that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him; being composed of the richest and raciest wines, highly spiced and sweetened, with roasted apples bobbing about the surface.*\n\nThe old gentleman's whole countenance beamed with a serene look of indwelling delight, as he stirred this mighty bowl. Having raised it to his lips, with a hearty wish of a merry Christmas to all present, he sent it brimming round the board, for every one to follow his example, according to the primitive style; pronouncing it \"the ancient fountain of good-feeling, where all hearts met together.\"\u2020\n\nThere was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of Christmas joviality circulated, and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies. When it reached Master Simon, he raised it in both hands, and with the air of a boon companion struck up an old Wassail chanson:\n\nThe brown bowle,\nThe merry brown bowle,\nAs it goes round-about-a,\nFill\nStill,\nLet the world say what it will,\nAnd drink your fill all out-a.\n\nThe deep canne,\nThe merry deep canne,\nAs thou dost freely quaff-a,\nSing\nFling,\nBe as merry as a king,\nAnd sound a lusty laugh-a.\u2021\n\nMuch of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics, to which I was a stranger. There was, however, a great\n\n* The Wassail Bowl was sometimes composed of ale instead of wine; with nutmeg, sugar, toast, ginger, and roasted crabs; in this way the nut-brown beverage is still prepared in some old families, and round the hearths of substantial farmers at Christmas. It is also called Lamb's Wool, and is celebrated by Herrick in his \"Twelfth Night.\"\n\n\"Next crown the bowle full\nWith gentle Lamb's Wool;\nAdd sugar, nutmeg, and ginger;\nWith store of ale too;\nAnd thus ye must doe\nTo make the Wassail a swinger.\"\n\n\u2020 The custom of drinking out of the same cup gave place to each having his cup. When the steward came to the door with the Wassail, he was to cry three times, Wassail, Wassail, Wassail, and then the chaplain (chaplain) was to answer with a song.\u2014ARCHAEOLOGIA.\n\n\u2021 From Poor Robin's Almanack.\ndeal of rallying of Master Simon about some gay widow, with whom he was accused of having a flirtation. This attack was commenced by the ladies; but it was continued throughout the dinner by the fat-headed old gentleman next the parson, with the persevering assiduity of a slow hound; being one of those long-winded jokers, who, though rather dull at starting game, are unrivalled for their talent in hunting it down. At every pause in the general conversation, he renewed his bantering in pretty much the same terms; winking hard at me with both eyes, whenever he gave Master Simon what he considered a home thrust. The latter, indeed, seemed fond of being teased on the subject, as old bachelors are apt to be; and he took occasion to inform me, in an undertone, that the lady in question was a prodigiously fine woman, and drove her own curricles.\n\nThe dinner-time passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity; and, though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene of broader rout and revel, yet I doubt whether it ever witnessed more honest and genuine enjoyment. How easy it is for one benevolent being to diffuse pleasure around him; and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of gladness, making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles! the joyous disposition of the worthy squire was perfectly contagious; he was happy himself, and disposed to make all the world happy; and the little eccentricities of his humour did but season, in a manner, the sweetness of his philanthropy.\n\nWhen the ladies had retired, the conversation, as usual, became still more animated; many good things were broached which had been thought of during dinner, but which would not exactly do for a lady's ear; and though I cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered, yet I have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less laughter. Wit, after all, is a mighty, tart, pungent, ingredient, and much too acid for some stomachs; but honest good humour is the oil and wine of a merry meeting, and there is no jovial companionship equal to that where the jokes are rather small, and the laughter abundant.\n\nThe squire told several long stories of early college pranks and adventures, in some of which the parson had been a sharer; though in looking at the latter, it required some effort of imagination to figure such a little dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap gambol. Indeed, the two college chums presented pictures of what men may be made by their different lots in life. The squire had left the university to live lustily on his\npaternal domains, in the vigorous enjoyment of prosperity and sunshine, and had flourished on to a hearty and florid old age; whilst the poor parson, on the contrary, had dried and withered away, among dusty tomes, in the silence and shadows of his study. Still there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire, feebly glimmering in the bottom of his soul; and as the squire hinted at a sly story of the parson and a pretty milk-maid, whom they once met on the banks of the Isis, the old gentleman made an \"alphabet of faces,\" which, as far as I could decipher his physiognomy, I verily believe was indicative of laughter; indeed, I have rarely met with an old gentleman that took absolute offence at the imputed gallantries of his youth.\n\nI found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of sober judgment. The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew duller. Master Simon was in as chirping a humour as a grasshopper filled with dew; his old songs grew of a warmer complexion, and he began to talk maudlin about the widow. He even gave a long song about the wooing of a widow, which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent black-letter work, entitled \"Cupid's Solicitor for Love,\" containing store of good advice for bachelors, and which he promised to lend me; the first verse was to this effect:\n\nHe that will woo a widow must not dally,\nHe must make hay while the sun doth shine;\nHe must not stand with her\u2014shall I, shall I?\nBut boldly say, Widow, thou must be mine.\n\nThis song inspired the fat-headed old gentleman, who made several attempts to tell a rather broad story out of Joe Miller, that was pat to the purpose; but he always stuck in the middle, everybody recollecting the latter part excepting himself. The parson, too, began to show the effects of good cheer, having gradually settled down into a doze, and his wig sitting most suspiciously on one side. Just at this juncture we were summoned to the drawing-room, and I suspect, at the private instigation of mine host, whose joviality seemed always tempered with a proper love of decorum.\n\nAfter the dinner-table was removed, the hall was given up to the younger members of the family, who, prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the Oxonian and Master Simon, made its old walls ring with their merriment, as they played at romping games. I delight in witnessing the gambols of children, and particularly at this happy holiday season, and could not help stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of laughter. I found them at the game of blind-man's-buff.* Master Simon, who was\n\n* At Christmas, when the churchyards are full of misrule, or merriment, the young man of honor, or bachelor, is often seen playing at blind-man's-buff.\nthe leader of their revels, and seemed on all occasions to fulfil the office of that ancient potentate, the Lord of Misrule,* was blinded in the midst of the hall. The little beings were as busy about him as the mock fairies about Falstaff; pinching him, plucking at the skirts of his coat, and tickling him with straws. One fine blue-eyed girl of about thirteen, with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion, her frolic face in a glow, her frock half torn off her shoulders, a complete picture of a romp, was the chief tormentor; and, from the slyness with which Master Simon avoided the smaller game, and hemmed this wild little nymph in corners, and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs, I suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was convenient.\n\nWhen I returned to the drawing-room, I found the company seated round the fire listening to the parson, who was deeply ensconced in a high-backed oaken chair, the work of some cunning artificer of yore, which had been brought from the library for his particular accommodation. From this venerable piece of furniture, with which his shadowy figure and dark weazen face so admirably accorded, he was dealing out strange accounts of the popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country, with which he had become acquainted in the course of his antiquarian researches. I am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was himself somewhat tinctured with superstition, as men are very apt to be who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the country, and pore over black-letter tracts, so often filled with the marvellous and supernatural. He gave us several anecdotes of the fancies of the neighbouring peasantry, concerning the effigy of the crusader, which lay on the tomb by the church altar. As it was the only monument of the kind in that part of the country, it had always been regarded with feelings of superstition by the good wives of the village. It was said to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy nights, particularly when it thundered; and one old woman, whose cottage bordered on the churchyard, had seen it through the windows of the church, when the moon shone, slowly pacing up and down the aisles. It was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the deceased, or some treasure hidden, which kept the spirit in a state of trouble and restlessness. Some talked of gold and jewels buried in the tomb, over which the spectre kept watch; and there was a story\n\n* At Christmasmas there was in the King's house, wheresover hee was lodged, a lord of misrule, or master of merry deportes, and the like had ye in the house of every nobleman of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall or temporall.\u2014Stow.\ncurrent of a sexton in old times who endeavoured to break his way to the coffin at night, but, just as he reached it, received a violent blow from the marble hand of the effigy, which stretched him senseless on the pavement. These tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier among the rustics, yet when night came on, there were many of the stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath that led across the churchyard.\n\nFrom these and other anecdotes that followed, the crusader appeared to be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the vicinity. His picture which hung up in the hall, was thought by the servants to have something supernatural about it; for they remarked that, in whatever part of the hall you went, the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you. The old porter's wife too, at the lodge, who had been born and brought up in the family, and was a great gossip among the maid-servants, affirmed, that in her young days she had often heard say, that on Midsummer eve, when it was well known all kinds of ghosts, goblins, and fairies become visible and walk abroad, the crusader used to mount his horse, come down from his picture, ride about the house, down the avenue, and so to the church to visit the tomb; on which occasion the church door most civilly swung open of itself; not that he needed it; for he rode through closed gates and even stone walls, and had been seen by one of the dairymaids to pass between two bars of the great park gate, making himself as thin as a sheet of paper.\n\nAll these superstitions I found had been very much countenanced by the squire, who, though not superstitious himself, was very fond of seeing others so. He listened to every goblin tale of the neighbouring gossips with infinite gravity, and held the porter's wife in high favour on account of her talent for the marvellous. He was himself a great reader of old legends and romances, and often lamented that he could not believe in them; for a superstitious person, he thought, must live in a kind of fairly land.\n\nWhilst we were all attention to the parson's stories, our ears were suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall, in which were mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy, with the uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter. The door suddenly flew open, and a train came trooping into the room, that might almost have been mistaken for the breaking-up of the court of Fairy. That indefatigable spirit, Master Simon, in the faithful discharge of his duties as Lord of Misrule, had been engaged in masking; and now, as the young ones of the occasion romped about in effect. There were clothes-presses, and the relics of the rations; they had convened from bedizened out.\n\nMaster Simon was appalled in the aspect of one who might have figured in his nose curving that seemed accompanied by \"Pie,\" in the stomacher, but the officer appeared in green, and a\n\nThe costume was in search, and the to a young Julia hung on. The rest of the girls trundled Bracebridge and gravely bottomed wiper, Pudding, and The whole was an appropriate character, rather a miscellany of ages of the past.\n\nThe irruption was to ancient custom. Master Simon was with whom\n\n* Masques or masquerades at hall-taverns and fantastic disguises from Ben Jonson's time.\nMisrule, had conceived the idea of a Christmas mummery or masking; and having called in to his assistance the Oxonian and the young officer, who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion romping and merriment, they had carried it into instant effect. The old housekeeper had been consulted; the antique clothes-presses and wardrobes rummaged, and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the light for several generations; the younger part of the company had been privately convened from the parlour and hall, and the whole had been bedizened out, into a burlesque imitation of an antique mask.*\n\nMaster Simon led the van, as \"Ancient Christmas,\" quaintly apparelled in a ruff, a short cloak, which had very much the aspect of one of the old housekeeper's petticoats, and a hat that might have served for a village steeple, and must indubitably have figured in the days of the Covenanters. From under this his nose curved boldly forth, flushed with a frost-bitten bloom, that seemed the very trophy of a December blast. He was accompanied by the blue-eyed romp, dished up as \"Dame Mince Pie,\" in the venerable magnificence of a faded brocade, long stomacher, peaked hat, and high-heeled shoes. The young officer appeared as Robin Hood, in a sporting dress of Kendal green, and a foraging cap with a gold tassel.\n\nThe costume, to be sure, did not bear testimony to deep research, and there was an evident eye to the picturesque, natural to a young gallant in the presence of his mistress. The fair Julia hung on his arm in a pretty rustic dress, as \"Maid Marian.\" The rest of the train had been metamorphosed in various ways; the girls trussed up in the finery of the ancient belles of the Bracebridge line, and the striplings bewhiskered with burnt cork, and gravely clad in broad skirts, hanging sleeves, and full-bottomed wigs, to represent the character of Roast Beef, Plum Pudding, and other worthies celebrated in ancient maskings. The whole was under the control of the Oxonian, in the appropriate character of Misrule; and I observed that he exercised rather a mischievous sway with his wand over the smaller personages of the pageant.\n\nThe irruption of this motley crew, with beat of drum, according to ancient custom, was the consummation of uproar and merriment. Master Simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which, as Ancient Christmas, he walked a minuet with\n\n* Maskings or mummeries were favourite sports at Christmas in old times; and the wardrobes at halls and manor-houses were often laid under contribution to furnish dresses and fantastic disguisings. I strongly suspect Master Simon to have taken the idea of his from Ben Jonson's \"Masque of Christmas.\"\nthe peerless, though giggling, Dame Mince Pie. It was followed by a dance of all the characters, which, from its medley of costumes, seemed as though the old family portraits had skipped down from their frames to join in the sport. Different centuries were figuring at cross hands and right and left; the dark ages were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons; and the days of Queen Bess jiggling merrily down the middle, through a line of succeeding generations.\n\nThe worthy squire contemplated these fantastic sports, and this resurrection of his old wardrobe, with the simple relish of childish delight. He stood chuckling and rubbing his hands, and scarcely hearing a word the parson said, notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing most authentically on the ancient and stately dance at the Paon, or peacock, from which he conceived the minuet to be derived.* For my part I was in a continual excitement, from the varied scenes of whim and innocent gaiety passing before me. It was inspiring to me to see wild-eyed frolic and warm-hearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills and glooms of winter, and old age throwing off his apathy, and catching once more the freshness of youthful enjoyment. I felt also an interest in the scene, from the consideration that these fleeting customs were posting fast into oblivion, and that this was, perhaps, the only family in England in which the whole of them were still punctiliously observed. There was a quaintness, too, mingled with all this revelry, that gave it a peculiar zest: it was suited to the time and place; and as the old manor-house almost reeled with mirth and wassail, it seemed echoing back the joviality of long-departed years.\u2020\n\nBut enough of Christmas and its gambols; it is time for me to pause in this garrulity. Methinks I hear the questions asked by my graver readers, \"To what purpose is all this\u2014how is the world to be made wiser by this talk?\" Alas! is there not wisdom enough extant for the instruction of the world? And if not, are there not thousands of abler pens labouring for its improvement!\u2014It is so much pleasanter to please than to instruct\u2014to play the companion rather than the preceptor.\n\n* Sir John Hawkins, speaking of the dance called the Pavon, from pavo, a peacock, says, \"It is a grave and majestic dance; the method of dancing it anciently was by gentlemen dressed with cape and swords, by those of the long robe in their gowns, by the peers in their mantles, and by the ladies in gowns with long trains, the motion whereof, in dancing, resembled that of a peacock.\"\u2014History of Music.\n\n\u2020 At the time of the first publication of this paper, the picture of an old-fashioned Christmas in the country was pronounced by some as out of date. The author had afterwards an opportunity of witnessing almost all the customs above described, existing in unexcepted vigour in the shires of Derbyshire and Yorkshire, where he passed the Christmas holidays. The reader will find some notice of them in the author's account of his sojourn at Newstead Abbey.\nWhat, after all, is the mite of wisdom that I could throw into the mass of knowledge; or how am I sure that my sagest deductions may be safe guides for the opinion of others? But in writing to amuse, if I fail, the only evil is in my own disappointment. If, however, I can by any lucky chance, in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle from the brow of care, or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can now and then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy, prompt a benevolent view of human nature, and make my reader more in good humour with his fellow-beings and himself, surely, surely, I shall not then have written entirely in vain.\n\nLONDON ANTIQUES.\n\nI do walk,\nMethinks, like Guido Vaux, with my dark lantern,\nStealing to set the town o' fire; i' th' country\nI should be taken for William o' the Wisp,\nOr Robin Goodfellow.\u2014FLETCHER.\n\nI AM somewhat of an antiquity hunter, and am fond of exploring London in quest of the relics of old times. These are principally to be found in the depths of the city, swallowed up and almost lost in a wilderness of brick and mortar; but deriving poetical and romantic interest from the commonplace prosaic world around them. I was struck with an instance of the kind in the course of a recent summer ramble into the city; for the city is only to be explored to advantage in summer-time, when free from the smoke and fog, and rain and mud of winter. I had been buffeting for some time against the current of population setting through Fleet-street. The warm weather had unstrung my nerves, and made me sensitive to every jar and jostle and discordant sound. The flesh was weary, the spirit faint, and I was getting out of humour with the bustling busy throng through which I had to struggle, when in a fit of desperation I tore my way through the crowd, plunged into a by-lane, and after passing through several obscure nooks and angles, emerged into a quaint and quiet court with a grass-plot in the centre, overhung by elms, and kept perpetually fresh and green by a fountain with its sparkling jet of water. A student with book in hand was seated on a stone bench, partly reading, partly meditating on the movements of two or three trim nursery-maids with their infant charges.\n\nI was like an Arab who had suddenly come upon an oasis amid the panting sterility of the desert. By degrees the quiet and coolness of the place soothed my nerves and refreshed my spirit.\nI pursued my walk, and came, hard by, to a very ancient chapel, with a low-browed Saxon portal of massive and rich architecture. The interior was circular and lofty, and lighted from above. Around were monumental tombs of ancient date, on which were extended the marble effigies of warriors in armour. Some had the hands devoutly crossed upon the breast; others grasped the pommel of the sword, menacing hostility even in the tomb!\u2014while the crossed legs of several indicated soldiers of the Faith who had been on crusades to the Holy Land.\n\nI was, in fact, in the chapel of the Knights Templars, strangely situated in the very centre of sordid traffic; and I do not know a more impressive lesson for the man of the world than thus suddenly to turn aside from the highway of busy money-seeking life, and sit down among these shadowy sepulchres, where all is twilight, dust, and forgetfulness.\n\nIn a subsequent tour of observation, I encountered another of these relics of a \"foregone world\" locked up in the heart of the city. I had been wandering for some time through dull monotonous streets, destitute of anything to strike the eye or excite the imagination, when I beheld before me a Gothic gateway of mouldering antiquity. It opened into a spacious quadrangle forming the court-yard of a stately Gothic pile, the portal of which stood invitingly open.\n\nIt was apparently a public edifice, and, as I was antiquity hunting, I ventured in, though with dubious steps. Meeting no one either to oppose or rebuke my intrusion, I continued on until I found myself in a great hall, with a lofty arched roof and oaken gallery, all of Gothic architecture. At one end of the hall was an enormous fireplace, with wooden settles on each side; at the other end was a raised platform, or dais, the seat of state, above which was the portrait of a man in antique garb, with a long robe, a ruff, and a venerable gray beard.\n\nThe whole establishment had an air of monastic quiet and seclusion, and what gave it a mysterious charm was, that I had not met with a human being since I had passed the threshold.\n\nEncouraged by this loneliness, I seated myself in a recess of a large bow window, which admitted a broad flood of yellow sunshine, chequered here and there by tints from panes of coloured glass; while an open casement let in the soft summer air. Here, leaning my head on my hand, and my arm on an old oaken table, I indulged in a sort of reverie about what might have been the ancient uses of this edifice. It had evidently been of monastic origin; perhaps one of those collegiate establishments built of\nyears for the promotion of learning, where the patient monk, in the ample solitude of the cloister, added page to page, and volume to volume, emulating in the productions of his brain the magnitudes of the pile he inhabited.\n\nAs I was seated in this musing mood, a small panelled door in an arch at the upper end of the hall was opened, and a number of gray-headed old men, clad in long black cloaks, came forth one by one; proceeding in that manner through the hall, without uttering a word, each turning a pale face on me as he passed, and disappearing through a door at the lower end.\n\nI was singularly struck with their appearance; their black cloaks and antiquated air comported with the style of this most venerable and mysterious pile. It was as if the ghosts of the departed years about which I had been musing were passing in review before me. Pleasing myself with such fancies, I set out, in the spirit of romance, to explore what I pictured to myself a realm of shadows, existing in the very centre of substantial realities.\n\nMy ramble led me through a labyrinth of interior courts and corridors and dilapidated cloisters, for the main edifice had many additions and dependencies, built at various times and in various styles; in one open space a number of boys, who evidently belonged to the establishment, were at their sports; but everywhere I observed those mysterious old gray men in black mantles, sometimes sauntering alone, sometimes conversing in groups: they appeared to be the pervading genii of the place. I now called to mind what I had read of certain colleges in old times, where judicial astrology, geomancy, necromancy, and other forbidden and magical sciences were taught. Was this an establishment of the kind, and were these black-cloaked old men really professors of the black art?\n\nThese surmises were passing through my mind as my eye glanced into a chamber hung round with all kinds of strange and unsightly objects, implements of savage warfare; strange idols and stuffed alligators; bottled serpents and monsters decorated the mantelpiece; while on the high tester of an old-fashioned bedstead grinned a human skull, flanked on each side by a dried cat.\n\nI approached to regard more narrowly this mystic chamber, which seemed a fitting laboratory for a necromancer, when I was startled at beholding a human countenance staring at me from a dusky corner. It was that of a small, shrivelled old man, with thin cheeks, bright eyes, and gray wiry projecting eyebrows. I\nat first doubted whether it were not a mummy curiously preserved, but it moved, and I saw that it was alive. It was another of those black-cloaked old men; and, as I regarded his quaint physiognomy, his obsolete garb, and the hideous and sinister objects by which he was surrounded, I began to persuade myself that I had come upon the arch mago, who ruled over this magical fraternity.\n\nSeeing me pausing before the door, he rose and invited me to enter. I obeyed with singular hardihood, for how did I know whether a wave of his wand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster, or conjure me into one of the bottles on his mantelpieces? He proved, however, to be anything but a conjurer, and his simple garrulity soon dispelled all the magic and mystery with which I had enveloped this antiquated pile and its no less antiquated inhabitants.\n\nIt appeared that I had made my way into the centre of an ancient asylum for superannuated tradesmen and decayed householders, with which was connected a school for a limited number of boys. It was founded upwards of two centuries since on an old monastic establishment, and retained somewhat of the conventual air and character. The shadowy line of old men in black mantles who had passed before me in the hall, and whom I had elevated into magi, turned out to be the pensioners returning from morning service in the chapel.\n\nJohn Hallum, the little collector of curiosities whom I had made the arch magician, had been for six years a resident of the place, and had decorated this final nestling-place of his old age with relics and rarities picked up in the course of his life. According to his own account, he had been somewhat of a traveller, having been once in France, and very near making a visit to Holland. He regretted not having visited the latter country, \"as then he might have said he had been there.\" He was evidently a traveller of the simple kind.\n\nHe was aristocratical, too, in his notions; keeping aloof, as I found, from the ordinary run of pensioners. His chief associates were a blind man who spoke Latin and Greek, of both which languages Hallum was profoundly ignorant; and a broken-down gentleman, who had run through a fortune of forty thousand pounds left him by his father, and ten thousand pounds, the marriage portion of his wife. Little Hallum seemed to consider it an indubitable sign of gentle blood as well as of lofty spirit to be able to squander such enormous sums.\n\nP.S.\u2014The picturesque remnant of old times into which I have thus begun to wander originally consisted of the remains of a monastery. Some of these buildings have been kept up with care, while others, broken-down and deserted, are their old selves again, used for private purposes by the old, in the place of the old convent. And so much for the boys.\n\nStowe, who has thought of the obligations of the hospital, but not to interfere with the hospital, but to see that it is fully what it ought to be, or grudgingly doing its duty, or sparing, or coldly indifferent, or unseemly generous.\n\n\"And in truth, the children from the care of the hospital take place as they ought to do, for the good of their souls.\"\n\nFor the sake of the preceding sketch, which may wish to be expanded, I subjoin a note on an odd-looking building of coloured coating, which I paid a visit to the other day. In the first, whether we shall be able to make off upon inquiry, I shall give our general opinion. On making personal inquiries, satisfactory answers have been told the same amount of the same which the following\nthus beguiled the reader is what is called the Charter House, originally the Chartreuse. It was founded in 1611, on the remains of an ancient convent, by Sir Thomas Sutton, being one of those noble charities set on foot by individual munificence, and kept up with the quaintness and sanctity of ancient times amidst the modern changes and innovations of London. Here eighty broken-down men, who have seen better days, are provided, in their old age, with food, clothing, fuel, and a yearly allowance for private expenses. They dine together, as did the monks of old, in the hall, which had been the refectory of the original convent. Attached to the establishment is a school for forty-four boys.\n\nStowe, whose work I have consulted on the subject, speaking of the obligations of the gray-headed pensioners, says, \"They are not to intermeddle with any business touching the affairs of the hospital, but to attend only to the service of God, and take thankfully what is provided for them, without muttering, murmuring, or grudging. None to wear weapon, long hair, coloured boots, spurs, or coloured shoes, feathers in their hats, or any ruffian-like or unseemly apparel, but such as becomes hospital men to wear.\" \"And in truth,\" adds Stowe, \"happy are they that are so taken from the cares and sorrows of the world, and fixed in so good a place as these old men are; having nothing to care for but the good of their souls, to serve God, and to live in brotherly love.\"\n\nFor the amusement of such as have been interested by the preceding sketch, taken down from my own observation, and who may wish to know a little more about the mysteries of London, I subjoin a medicum of local history, put into my hands by an odd-looking old gentleman in a small brown wig and a stuff-coloured coat, with whom I became acquainted shortly after my visit to the Charter House. I confess I was a little dubious at first, whether it was not one of those apocryphal tales often passed off upon inquiring travellers like myself, and which have brought our general character for veracity into such undeserved reproach. On making proper inquiries, however, I have received the most satisfactory assurances of the author's probity; and, indeed, have been told that he is actually engaged in a full and particular account of the very interesting region in which he resides; of which the following may be considered merely as a foretaste:\nLITTLE BRITAIN.\n\nWhat I write is most true * * * * * I have a whole book of cases lying by me, which if I should set forth, some grave senators (within the hearing of New bell) would be out of charity with me.\u2014NASH.\n\nIn the centre of the great city of London lies a small neighbourhood, consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts, of very venerable and debilitated houses, which goes by the name of LITTLE BRITAIN. Christ Church School and St. Bartholomew's Hospital bound it on the west; Smithfield and Long-lane on the north; Aldersgate-street, like an arm of the sea, divides it from the eastern part of the city; whilst the yawning gulf of Bull-and-Mouth-street separates it from Butcher-lane, and the regions of Newgate. Over this little territory, thus bounded and designated, the great dome of St. Paul's, swelling above the intervening houses of Paternoster-row, Amen-corner, and Ave Maria-lane, looks down with an air of motherly protection.\n\nThis quarter derives its appellation from having been, in ancient times, the residence of the Dukes of Brittany. As London increased, however, rank and fashion rolled off to the west, and trade, creeping on at their heels, took possession of their deserted abodes. For some time Little Britain became the great mart of learning, and was peopled by the busy and prolific race of booksellers: these also gradually deserted it, and, emigrating beyond the great strait of Newgate-street, settled down in Paternoster-row and St. Paul's-churchyard, where they continue to increase and multiply even at the present day.\n\nBut though thus fallen into decline, Little Britain still bears traces of its former splendour. There are several houses ready to tumble down, the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings of hideous faces, unknown birds, beasts, and fishes; and fruits and flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify. There are also, in Aldersgate-street, certain remains of what were once spacious and lordly family mansions, but which have in latter days been subdivided into several tenements. Here may often be found the family of a petty tradesman, with its trumpery furniture, burrowing among the relics of antiquated finery, in great rambling time-stained apartments, with fretted ceilings, gilded cornices, and enormous marble fireplaces. The lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but, like your small ancient gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to equal antiquity. These have their gable-ends to the street; great bow\n\nwindows, with low arched\n\nIn this quarter there are several quaint rooms on the second floor, with large sitting-rooms, and set off by particular moulded chairs, covered with having scenes from the old palaces painted together, and leather-bottomed stools carry a high price, when they were reduced. The room is taken up with records recorded the scenes mingled with verses written in chaste rhyme, extol the charms of the long, long circle of idle personages who meet regularly every evening, the gentleman of the house internal state of the place. I have managed to get a view of the place.\n\nLittle Britain is a city; the streets are wide, London as it was in the fashions. Here are the games and outdoor sports, pancakes or roast goose, Valentine's Day, but the girls under the pudding are all merry, maintaining all others being\n\nLittle Britain is its inhabitants.\n\nIt is evident that the second side of Little Britain is daily to Cloth Fair.\nwindows, with diamond panes set in lead, grotesque carvings, and low arched door-ways.*\n\nIn this most venerable and sheltered little nest have I passed several quiet years of existence, comfortably lodged in the second floor of one of the smallest but oldest edifices. My sitting-room is an old wainscoted chamber, with small panels, and set off with a miscellaneous array of furniture. I have a particular respect for three or four high-backed claw-footed chairs, covered with tarnished brocade, which bear the marks of having seen better days, and have doubtless figured in some of the old palaces of Little Britain. They seem to me to keep together, and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their leather-bottomed neighbours; as I have seen decayed gentry carry a high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to associate. The whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a bow window; on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous occupants for many generations, mingled with scraps of very indifferent gentleman-like poetry, written in characters which I can scarcely decipher, and which extol the charms of many a beauty of Little Britain, who has long, long since bloomed, faded, and passed away. As I am an idle personage, with no apparent occupation, and pay my bill regularly every week, I am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of the neighbourhood; and, being curious to learn the internal state of a community so apparently shut up within itself, I have managed to work my way into all the concerns and secrets of the place.\n\nLittle Britain may truly be called the heart's core of the city; the strong-hold of true John Bullism. It is a fragment of London as it was in its better days, with its antiquated folks and fashions. Here flourish in great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore. The inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, hot-cross buns on Good Friday, and roast goose at Michaelmas; they send love-letters on Valentine's Day, burn the Pope on the fifth of November, and kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at Christmas. Roast beef and plum pudding are also held in superstitious veneration, and port and sherry maintain their grounds as the only true English wines; all others being considered vile outlandish beverages.\n\nLittle Britain has its long catalogue of city wonders, which its inhabitants consider the wonders of the world; such as the\n\n* It is evident that the author of this interesting communication has included, in his general title of Little Britain, many of these little lanes and courts that belong immediately to Cloth Fair.\ngreat bell of St. Paul's, which scours all the bear when it tolls; the figures that strike the hours at St. Dunstan's clock; the Monument; the lions in the Tower; and the wooden giants in Guildhall. They still believe in dreams and fortune-telling, and an old woman that lives in Bull-and-Mouth-street makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods, and promising the girls good husbands. They are apt to be rendered uncomfortable by comets and eclipses; and if a dog howls dolefully at night, it is looked upon as a sure sign of a death in the place. There are even many ghost-stories current, particularly concerning the old mansion-houses; in several of which it is said strange sights are sometimes seen. Lords and ladies, the former in full-bottomed wigs, hanging sleeves and swords, the latter in lappets, stays, hoops, and brocade, have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers, on moonlight nights; and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient proprietors in their court-dresses.\n\nLittle Britain has likewise its sages and great men. One of the most important of the former is a tall, dry old gentleman, of the name of Skryme, who keeps a small apothecary's shop. He has a cadaverous countenance, full of cavities and projections; with a brown circle round each eye, like a pair of horn spectacles. He is much thought of by the old women, who consider him as a kind of conjurer, because he has two or three stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop, and several snakes in bottles. He is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers, and is much given to pore over alarming accounts of plots, conspiracies, fires, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; which last phenomena he considers as signs of the times. He has always some dismal tale of the kind to deal out to his customers, with their doses; and thus at the same time puts both soul and body into an uproar. He is a great believer in omens and predictions; and has the prophecies of Robert Nixon and Mother Shipton by heart. No man can make so much out of an eclipse, or even an unusually dark day; and he shook the tail of the last comet over the heads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly fright out of their wits. He has lately got hold of a popular or prophecy, on which he has been unusually eloquent. There has been a saying current among the ancient syphils, who turn up these things, that when the grasshopper on the top of the Exchange shook hands with the dragon on the top of Bow church steeple, fearful events would take place. This conjunction, it seems, has strangely come to pass. The architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the capitol.\nthe Exchange, and the steeple of Bow church; and, fearful to relate, the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie, cheek by jowl, in the yard of his workshop.\n\n\"Others,\" as Mr. Skryme is accustomed to say, \"may go star-gazing, and look for conjunctions in the heavens, but here is a conjunction on the earth, near at home, and under our own eyes, which surpasses all the signs and calculations of astrologers.\" Since these portentous weathercocks have thus laid their heads together, wonderful events had already occurred. The good old king, notwithstanding that he had lived eighty-two years, had all at once given up the ghost; another king had mounted the throne; a royal duke had died suddenly\u2014another, in France, had been murdered; there had been Radical meetings in all parts of the kingdom; the bloody scenes at Manchester; the great plot in Cato-street;\u2014and, above all, the Queen had returned to England! All these sinister events are recounted by Mr. Skryme with a mysterious look, and a dismal shake of the head; and being taken with his drugs, and associated in the minds of his auditors with stuffed sea-monsters, bottled serpents, and his own visage, which is a title-page of tribulation, they have spread great gloom through the minds of the people of Little Britain. They shake their heads whenever they go by Bow church, and observe, that they never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple, which in old times told nothing but glad tidings, as the history of Whittington and his Cat bears witness.\n\nThe rival oracle of Little Britain is a substantial cheese-monger, who lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions, and is as magnificently lodged as a round-bellied mite in the midst of one of his own Cheshire. Indeed, he is a man of no little standing and importance; and his renown extends through Huggin-lane, and Lad-lane, and even unto Aldermanbury. His opinion is very much taken in affairs of state, having read the Sunday papers for the last half-century, together with the Gentleman's Magazine, Rapin's History of England, and the Naval Chronicle. His head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne the test of time and use for centuries. It is his firm opinion that \"it is a moral impossible,\" so long as England is true to herself, that anything can shake her; and he has much to say on the subject of the national debt; which, somehow or other, he proves to be a great national bulwark and blessing. He passed the greater part of his life in the purloins of Little Britain, until of late years, when, having become rich, and grown into the dignity of a Sunday cane, he begins to take\nhis pleasure and see the world. He has therefore made several excursions to Hampstead, Highgate, and other neighbouring towns, where he has passed whole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a telescope, and endeavouring to descry the steeple of St. Bartholomew's. Not a stage-coachman of Bull-and-Mouth-street but touches his hat as he passes; and he is considered quite a patron at the coach-office of the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's Churchyard. His family have been very urgent for him to make an expedition to Margate, but he has great doubts of those new gin-cracks, the steamboats, and, indeed, thinks himself too advanced in life to undertake sea voyages.\n\nLittle Britain has occasionally its factions and divisions, and party spirit ran very high at one time in consequence of two rival \"Burial Societies\" being set up in the place. One held its meeting at the Swan and Horse Shoe, and was patronized by the cheesemonger; the other at the Cock and Crown, under the auspices of the apothecary; it is needless to say that the latter was the most flourishing. I have passed an evening or two at each, and have acquired much valuable information, as to the best mode of being buried, the comparative merits of churchyards, together with divers hints on the subject of patent-iron coffins. I have heard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality of prohibiting the latter on account of their durability. The feuds occasioned by these societies have happily died of late; but they were for a long time prevailing themes of controversy, the people of Little Britain being extremely solicitous of funereal honours and of lying comfortably in their graves.\n\nBesides these two funeral societies, there is a third of quite a different cast, which tends to throw the sunshine of good-humour over the whole neighbourhood. It meets once a week at a little old-fashioned house, kept by a jolly publican of the name of Wagstaff, and bearing for insignia a resplendent half-moon, with a most seductive bunch of grapes. The whole edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the thirsty wayfarer; such as \"Truman, Hanbury, and Co.'s Entire,\" \"Wine, Rum, and Brandy Vaults,\" \"Old Tom, Rum, and Compounds,\" etc. This, indeed, has been a temple of Bacchus and Momus from time immemorial. It has always been in the family of the Wagstaffs, so that its history is tolerably preserved by the present landlord. It was much frequented by the gallants and cavaliers of the reign of Elizabeth, and was looked into now and then by the wits of Charles the Second's day. But what Wagstaff principally prides himself upon is, that Henry the Eighth, in one of his nocturnal ramblings, visited the famous wine-shop, and left a dubious and uncertain inscription.\n\nThe elms, which bear the name of the ancient Britons, in old catch-words, are still in place, and are still there. There is a legend connected with the song; but the story of Little Britain, is told by the ale-wife before him, who keeps the songs and jests of her ancestors as heir-looms. She is a stout old pot belly, and has a profusion of gray hair, which she has called in to assist her in the old drinking-song. She says it, to be sure, with a smile on her father's lips, but the old Moon and I, who have heard it before the ale-wife, affirm that it is true. Little Britain...\nLITTLE BRITAIN.\n\ntarnal rambles, broke the head of one of his ancestors with his famous walking-staff. This, however, is considered as rather a dubious and vain-glorious boast of the landlord.\n\nThe club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of \"the Roaring Lads of Little Britain.\" They abound in old catches, glees, and choice stories, that are traditional in the place, and not to be met with in any other part of the metropolis. There is a mad-cap undertaker who is inimitable at a merry song; but the life of the club, and indeed the prime wit of Little Britain, is bully Wagstaff himself. His ancestors were all wags before him, and he has inherited with the inn a large stock of songs and jokes, which go with it from generation to generation as heir-looms. He is a dapper little fellow, with bandy legs and pot belly, a red face, with a moist merry eye, and a little shock of gray hair behind. At the opening of every club-night he is called in to sing his \"Confession of Faith,\" which is the famous old drinking trowl from Gammer Gurton's Needle. He sings it, to be sure, with many variations, as he received it from his father's lips; for it has been a standing favourite at the Half-Moon and Bunch of Grapes ever since it was written; nay, he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honour of singing it before the nobility and gentry at Christmas mummeries, when Little Britain was in all its glory.*\n\n* As mine host of the Half-Moon's Confession of Faith may not be familiar to the majority of readers, and as it is a specimen of the current songs of Little Britain, I subjoin it in its original orthography. I would observe, that the whole club always join in the chorus with a fearful thumping on the table and clattering of pewter pots\u2014\n\nI cannot eat but lytie meate,\nMy stomache is not good,\nBut sure I thinke that I can drinke\nWith him that weare a hood.\nThough I go bare, take ye no care,\nI nothing am a colde,\nI star my skyn so full within,\nOf joly good ale and olde.\n\nChorus. Beoth and syde go bare, go bare,\nBeoth feet and hand go colde,\nBut belly, God send thee good ale ymough,\nWhether it be new or olde.\n\nI have no roost, but a net browne toste,\nAnd a crab laid in the fyre;\nA lytle breede shall do me stonde,\nMuch breede I not desyre.\nNo frost nor snow, nor wind, I trowe,\nCan hurte mee, if I walde,\nI am so wrapt and throwly lupt\nOf joly good ale and olde.\n\nChorus. Beoth and syde go bare, go bare, &c.\n\nAnd Tyb my wife, that, as her lyfe,\nLotheth well good ale to seeke,\nFull oft drynke she, till ye may see\nThe tears run downe her cheeks.\nIt would do one's heart good to hear, on a club night, the shouts of merriment, the matches of song, and now and then the choral bursts of half a dozen discordant voices, which issue from this jovial mansion. At such times the street is lined with listeners, who enjoy a delight equal to that of gazing into a confectioner's window, or sniffing up the steams of a cook-shop.\n\nThere are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in Little Britain; these are St. Bartholomew's fair, and the Lord Mayor's day. During the time of the fair, which is held in the adjoining regions of Smithfield, there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding about. The late quiet streets of Little Britain are overrun with an irruption of strange figures and faces; every tavern is a scene of rout and revel. The fiddle and the song are heard from the tap-room, morning, noon, and night; and at each window may be seen some group of bose companions, with half-shut eyes, hats on one side, pipe in mouth, and tankard in hand, fondling, and prosing, and singing mandolin songs over their liquor. Even the sober decorum of private families, which I must say is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbours, is no proof against this Saturnalia. There is no such thing as keeping maid-servants within doors. Their brains are absolutely set maddening with Punch and the Puppet Show; the Flying Horses; Signior Polito; the Fire-Eaters; the celebrated Mr. Paap; and the Irish Giant. The children, too, lavish all their holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread, and fill the house with the Lilliputian din of drums, trumpets, and penny whistles.\n\nBut the Lord Mayor's day is the greatest anniversary. The Lord Mayor is looked up to by the inhabitants of Little Britain as the greatest potentate upon earth; his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of human splendour; and his procession, with all the Sheriffs and Aldermen in his train, as the grandest of earthly pageants. How they exult in the idea, that the King himself dare not enter the city, without first knocking at the gate of\n\nThen doth shee trivie to me the bowle,\nEven as a manit-worme sholdes,\nAnd sayth, sweete hartie, I took my parte\nOf this jolly good ale and a ble.\nChorus. Backs and sydes go bare, go bare, &c.\nNow let them dryake, till they nod and wink,\nEven as goodes fellowes sholdes doe,\nThey shall not mysee to have the blisses\nGood ale doth bring men to;\nAnd all poore souls that here sownd bowles,\nOr here them lastely trode,\nGod save the lyves of them and their wives,\nWhether they be younge or olde.\nChorus. Backs and sydes go bare, go bare, &c.\nTemple Bar, and asking permission of the Lord Mayor; for if he did, heaven and earth! there is no knowing what might be the consequence. The man in armour who rides before the Lord Mayor, and is the city champion, has orders to cut down everybody that offends against the dignity of the city; and then there is the little man with a velvet porringer on his head, who sits at the window of the state coach, and holds the city sword, as long as a pike-staff\u2014Odd's blood! If he once draws that sword, Majesty itself is not safe!\n\nUnder the protection of this mighty potentate, therefore, the good people of Little Britain sleep in peace. Temple Bar is an effectual barrier against all interior foes; and as to foreign invasion, the Lord Mayor has but to throw himself into the Tower, call in the train bands, and put the standing army of beef-eaters under arms, and he may bid defiance to the world!\n\nThus wrapped up in its own concerns, its own habits, and its own opinions, Little Britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this great fungus metropolis. I have pleased myself with considering it as a chosen spot, where the principles of sturdy John Bullism were garnered up, like seed corn, to renew the national character, when it had run to waste and degeneracy. I have rejoiced also in the general spirit of harmony that prevailed throughout it; for though there might now and then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the cheesemonger and the apothecary, and an occasional feud between the burial societies, yet these were but transient clouds, and soon passed away. The neighbours met with good-will, parted with a shake of the hand, and never abused each other except behind their backs.\n\nI could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which I have been present; where we played at All-Fours, Pope-Joan, Tom-come-tickle-me, and other choice old games; and where we sometimes had a good old English country dance to the tune of Sir Roger de Coverley. Once a year also the neighbours would gather together and go on a gipsy-party to Epping Forest. It would have done any man's heart good to see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on the grass under the trees. How we made the woods ring with bursts of laughter at the songs of little Wagstaff and the merry undertaker! After dinner, too, the young folks would play at blind-man's-buff and hide-and-seek; and it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers, and to hear a fine romping girl now and then squeak from among the bushes. The elder folks would gather round the cheesemonger and the apothecary, to hear them\ntalk politics; for they generally brought out a newspaper in their pockets, to pass away time in the country. They would now and then, to be sure, get a little warm in argument; but their disputes were always adjusted by reference to a worthy old umbrella-maker, in a double chin, who, never exactly comprehending the subject, managed somehow or other to decide in favour of both parties.\n\nAll empires, however, says some philosopher or historian, are doomed to changes and revolutions. Luxury and innovation creep in; factions arise; and families now and then spring up, whose ambition and intrigues throw the whole system into confusion. Thus, in latter days, has the tranquillity of Little Britain been grievously disturbed, and its golden simplicity of manners threatened with total subversion, by the aspiring family of a retired butcher.\n\nThe family of the Lambs had long been among the most thriving and popular in the neighbourhood: the Miss Lambs were the belles of Little Britain, and everybody was pleased when Old Lamb had made money enough to shut up shop, and put his name on a brass plate on his door. In an evil hour, however, one of the Miss Lambs had the honour of being a lady in attendance on the Lady Mayoress, at her grand annual ball, on which occasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head. The family never got over it; they were immediately smitten with a passion for high life; set up a one-horse carriage, put a bit of gold lace round the errand-boy's hat, and have been the talk and detestation of the whole neighbourhood ever since. They could no longer be induced to play at Pope-Joan or blindman's-buff; they could endure no dances but quadrilles, which nobody had ever heard of in Little Britain; and they took to reading novels, talking bad French, and playing upon the piano. Their brother, too, who had been articled to an attorney, set up for a dandy and a critic, characters hitherto unknown in these parts; and he confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about Kean, the opera, and the Edinburgh Review.\n\nWhat was still worse, the Lambs gave a grand ball, to which they neglected to invite any of their old neighbours; but they had a great deal of genteel company from Theobald's-road, Red Lion-square, and other parts towards the west. There were several beaux of their brother's acquaintance from Gray's-inn-lane and Hatton-garden; and not less than three aldermen's ladies, with their daughters. This was not to be forgotten or forgiven. All Little Britain was in an uproar with the smacking of whips, jingling of carriages, which might be watching the virulent opposition opposite the house where one that knew all.\n\nThis dear little neighbourhood of the Lambs' apartments with its tea junketing, may say, \"in a few generations were a contrary.\"\n\nthe music of Irish melodies with wonder. Plunket's family, the rich herd, their consciousness rates, by candlelight that had past pieces.\n\nThe only admirable was the meekness of the voice of the broad face men, daughters always coax him as \"papa\" to coax him into manly habits.\n\nthe butcher, gloating. He was pressible. He and he persisted dining at two tea.\"\n\nHe was done by family. He felt civil to him; throwing out a\nof whips, the lashing of miserable horses, and the rattling and jingling of hackney coaches. The gossips of the neighbourhood might be seen popping their night-caps out at every window, watching the crazy vehicles rumble by; and there was a knot of virulent old cronies, that kept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher's, and scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door.\n\nThis dance was a cause of almost open war, and the whole neighbourhood declared they would have nothing more to say to the Lambs. It is true that Mrs. Lamb, when she had no engagements with her quality acquaintance, would give little humdrum tea junkettings to some of her old cronies, \"quite,\" as she would say, \"in a friendly way;\" and it is equally true that her invitations were always accepted, in spite of all previous vows to the contrary. Nay, the good ladies would sit and be delighted with the music of the Miss Lambs, who would condescend to strum an Irish melody for them on the piano; and they would listen with wonderful interest to Mrs. Lamb's anecdotes of Alderman Plunket's family, of Portskon Ward, and the Miss Timberlakes, the rich heiresses of Crutched Friars; but then they relieved their consciences, and averted the reproaches of their confederates, by canvassing at the next gossiping convocation everything that had passed, and pulling the Lambs and their rout all to pieces.\n\nThe only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the retired butcher himself. Honest Lamb, in spite of the meekness of his name, was a rough, hearty old fellow, with the voice of a lion, a head of black hair like a shoe-brush, and a broad face mottled like his own beef. It was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as \"the old gentleman,\" addressed him as \"papa,\" in tones of infinite softness, and endeavoured to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers, and other gentlemanly habits. Do what they might, there was no keeping down the butcher. His sturdy nature would break through all their gloating. He had a hearty vulgar good humour that was irrepressible. His very jokes made his sensitive daughters shudder; and he persisted in wearing his blue cotton coat of a morning, dining at two o'clock, and having a \"bit of sausage with his tea.\"\n\nHe was doomed, however, to share the unpopularity of his family. He found his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him; no longer laughing at his jokes; and now and then throwing out a fling at \"some people,\" and a hint about \"quality.\"\nbinding.\" This both nettled and perplexed the honest butcher; and his wife and daughters, with the consummate policy of the shrewder sex, taking advantage of the circumstance, at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoon's pipe and tankard at Wagstaff's; to sit after dinner by himself, and take his pint of port\u2014a liquor he detested\u2014and to nod in his chair in solitary and dismal gentility.\n\nThe Miss Lambs might now be seen flitting along the streets in French bonnets, with unknown beaux; and talking and laughing so loud that it distressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing. They even went so far as to attempt patronage, and actually induced a French dancing-master to set up in the neighbourhood; but the worthy folks of Little Britain took fire at it, and did so persecute the poor Gaul, that he was fain to pack up fiddle and dancing-pumps, and decamp with such precipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings.\n\nI had flattered myself, at first, with the idea that all this fiery indignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of their zeal for good old English manners, and their horror of innovation; and I applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in expressing, for upstart pride, French fashions, and the Miss Lambs. But I grieve to say that I soon perceived the infection had taken hold; and that my neighbours, after condemning, were beginning to follow their example. I overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their daughters have one quarter at French and music, and that they might take a few lessons in quadrille. I even saw, in the course of a few Sundays, no less than five French bonnets, precisely like those of the Miss Lambs, parading about Little Britain.\n\nI still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away; that the Lambs might move out of the neighbourhood, might die, or might run away with attorneys' apprentices; and that quiet and simplicity might be again restored to the community. But unluckily a rival power arose. An opulent oilman died, and left a widow with a large jointure and a family of buxom daughters. The young ladies had long been repining in secret at the parsimony of a prudent father, which kept down all their aspirations. Their ambition, being now no longer restrained, broke out into a blaze, and they openly took the field against the family of the butcher. It is true that the Lambs, having had the first start, had naturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career. They could speak a little bad French, play the piano, dance quadrilles, and had formed high acquaintances; but the Lambs appeared mounted for a dance, though they double the time.\n\nThe whole able factions of games of cards discarded; the dance; and mistletoe leaves. Lambs have also broken Britain; the square, and so on.\n\nThus is the seasons, likely will be the quis talent and it will terminate.\n\nThe immediate a single man, nothing personal by profession, both parties mutual backs ladies on all with both parties to reconcile dating one, Trotters ever ruined!\n\nI have actually looked old English eaten, drunk fashionable for a veteran rate tax; bid a and leave the divide the dis\nances; but the Trotters were not to be distanced. When the Lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats, the Miss Trotters mounted four, and of twice as fine colours. If the Lambs gave a dance, the Trotters were sure not to be behindhand; and though they might not boast of as good company, yet they had double the number, and were twice as merry.\n\nThe whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable factions under the banners of these two families. The old games of Pope-Joan and Tom-come-tickle-me are entirely discarded; there is no such thing as getting up an honest country dance; and on my attempting to kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last Christmas, I was indignantly repulsed; the Miss Lambs having pronounced it \"shocking vulgar.\" Bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable part of Little Britain; the Lambs standing up for the dignity of Cross-Keys square, and the Trotters for the vicinity of St. Bartholomew's.\n\nThus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions, like the great empire whose name it bears; and what will be the result would puzzle the apothecary himself, with all his talent at prognostics, to determine; though I apprehend that it will terminate in the total downfall of genuine John Bullism.\n\nThe immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me. Being a single man, and, as I observed before, rather an idle good-for-nothing personage, I have been considered the only gentleman by profession in the place. I stand therefore in high favour with both parties, and have to hear all their cabinet counsels and mutual backbitings. As I am too civil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions, I have committed myself most horribly with both parties, by abusing their opponents. I might manage to reconcile this to my conscience, which is a truly accommodating one, but I cannot to my apprehension\u2014if the Lambs and Trotters ever come to a reconciliation, and compare notes, I am ruined!\n\nI have determined, therefore, to beat a retreat in time, and am actually looking out for some other nest in this great city, where old English manners are still kept up; where French is neither eaten, drunk, danced, nor spoken; and where there are no fashionable families or retired tradesmen. This found, I will, like a veteran rat, hasten away before I have an old house about my ears; bid a long, though a sorrowful adieu to my present abode, and leave the rival factions of the Lambs and the Trotters to divide the distracted empire of Little Britain.\nSTRATFORD-ON-AVON.\n\nThere soft-flowing Avon, by thy silver streams\nOf things more than mortal sweet Shakspeare would dream.\nThe fairies by moonlight dance round his green bed,\nFor hallow'd the turf is which pillow'd his head.\u2014Garrick.\n\nTo a homeless man, who has no spot on this wide world which he can truly call his own, there is a momentary feeling of something like independence and territorial consequence, when, after a weary day's travel, he kicks off his boots, thrusts his feet into slippers, and stretches himself before an inn fire. Let the world without go as it may; let kingdoms rise or fall, so long as he has the wherewithal to pay his bill, he is, for the time being, the very monarch of all he surveys. The arm-chair is his throne, the poker his sceptre, and the little parlour, some twelve feet square, his undisputed empire. It is a morsel of certainty, snatched from the midst of the uncertainties of life; it is a sunny moment gleaming out kindly on a cloudy day: and he who has advanced some way on the pilgrimage of existence knows the importance of husbanding even morsels and moments of enjoyment. \"Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?\" thought I, as I gave the fire a stir, lolled back in my elbow-chair, and cast a complacent look about the little parlour of the Red Horse, at Stratford-on-Avon.\n\nThe words of sweet Shakspeare were just passing through my mind as the clock struck midnight from the tower of the church in which he lies buried. There was a gentle tap at the door, and a pretty chambermaid, putting in her smiling face, inquired, with a hesitating air, whether I had rung. I understood it as a modest hint that it was time to retire. My dream of absolute dominion was at an end; so abdicating my throne, like a prudent potentate, to avoid being deposed; and putting the Stratford Guide-Book under my arm, as a pillow companion, I went to bed, and dreamt all night of Shakspeare, the jubilee, and David Garrick.\n\nThe next morning was one of those quickening mornings which we sometimes have in early spring; for it was about the middle of March. The chills of a long winter had suddenly given way; the north wind had spent its last gasp; and a mild air came stealing from the west, breathing the breath of life into nature, and wooing every bud and flower to burst forth into fragrance and beauty.\n\nI had come to Stratford on a poetical pilgrimage. My first visit was to the house where Shakspeare was born, and where, according to tradition, he was brought up to his father's craft of wool-combing. It is a small mean-looking edifice of wood and plaster, a hatching chambers guage, by prince to the of the poet of nation. The house, lighter artificial looking dirty cap. with which was the shakspeare shot his tobacco-pipe.

In this chair, the house to sit: the seat of the inspiration. I mention the chair, though built of wood, that the chair is very years. It is an ordinary chair, the chair of the Santa Claus, the enchanter; for the princess, yet, in the old chimney.\n\nI am always longing to be deceived.\nplaster, a true nestling-place of genius, which seems to delight in hatching its offspring in by-corners. The walls of its squalid chambers are covered with names and inscriptions in every language, by pilgrims of all nations, ranks, and conditions, from the prince to the peasant; and present a simple, but striking instance of the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to the great poet of nature.\n\nThe house is shown by a garrulous old lady, in a frosty red face, lighted up by a cold blue anxious eye, and garnished with artificial locks of flaxen hair, curling from under an exceedingly dirty cap. She was peculiarly assiduous in exhibiting the relics with which this, like all other celebrated shrines, abounds. There was the shattered stock of the very matchlock with which Shakspeare shot the deer, on his poaching exploits. There, too, was his tobacco-box; which proves that he was a rival smoker of Sir Walter Raleigh; the sword also with which he played Hamlet; and the identical lantern with which Friar Laurence discovered Romeo and Juliet at the tomb! there was an ample supply also of Shakspeare's mulberry-tree, which seems to have as extraordinary powers of self-multiplication as the wood of the true cross; of which there is enough extant to build a ship of the line.\n\nThe most favourite object of curiosity, however, is Shakspeare's chair. It stands in the chimney nook of a small gloomy chamber, just behind what was his father's shop. Here he may many a time have sat when a boy, watching the slowly revolving spit with all the longing of an urchin; or of an evening, listening to the cronies and gossips of Stratford, dealing forth churchyard tales and legendary anecdotes of the troublesome times of England. In this chair it is the custom of every one that visits the house to sit: whether this be done with the hope of imbibing any of the inspiration of the bard I am at a loss to say, I merely mention the fact; and mine hostess privately assured me, that, though built of solid oak, such was the fervent zeal of devotees, that the chair had to be new-bottomed at least once in three years. It is worthy of notice, also, in the history of this extraordinary chair, that it partakes something of the volatile nature of the Santa Casa of Loretto, or the flying chair of the Arabian enchanter; for though sold some few years since to a northern princess, yet, strange to tell, it has found its way back again to the old chimney corner.\n\nI am always of easy faith in such matters, and am ever willing to be deceived, where the deceit is pleasant and costs nothing.\nI am, therefore, a ready believer in relics, legends, and local anecdotes of goblins and great men; and would advise all travellers who travel for their gratification to be the same. What is it to us, whether these stories be true or false, so long as we can persuade ourselves into the belief of them, and enjoy all the charm of the reality? There is nothing like resolute good-humoured credulity in these matters; and on this occasion I went even so far as willingly to believe the claims of mine hostess to a lineal descent from the poet, when, unluckily for my faith, she put into my hands a play of her own composition, which set all belief in her consanguinity at defiance.\n\nFrom the birth-place of Shakespeare a few paces brought me to his grave. He lies buried in the chancel of the parish church, a large and venerable pile, mouldering with age, but richly ornamented. It stands on the banks of the Avon, on an embowered point, and separated by adjoining gardens from the suburbs of the town. Its situation is quiet and retired: the river runs murmuring at the foot of the churchyard, and the elms which grow upon its banks droop their branches into its clear bosom. An avenue of limes, the boughs of which are curiously interlaced, so as to form in summer an arched way of foliage, leads up from the gate of the yard to the church porch. The graves are overgrown with grass; the gray tombstones, some of them nearly sunk into the earth, are half-covered with moss, which has likewise tinted the reverend old building. Small birds have built their nests among the cornices and fissures of the walls, and keep up a continual flutter and chirping; and rooks are sailing and cawing about its lofty gray spire.\n\nIn the course of my rambles I met with the gray-headed sexton, Edmonds, and accompanied him home to get the key of the church. He had lived in Stratford, man and boy, for eighty years, and seemed still to consider himself a vigorous man, with the trivial exception that he had nearly lost the use of his legs for a few years past. His dwelling was a cottage, looking out upon the Avon and its bordering meadows; and was a picture of that neatness, order, and comfort which pervade the humblest dwellings in this country. A low white-washed room, with a stone floor carefully scrubbed, served for parlour, kitchen, and hall. Rows of pewter and earthen dishes glittered along the dresser. On an old oaken table, well rubbed and polished, lay the family Bible and Prayer-book, and the drawer contained the family library, composed of about half a score of well-thumbed volumes. An ancient clock, that important article of cottage furniture, stood by the warming-pan, and a horn-handled knife was wide open in the jambs.\n\nThere was a pretty little annotated volume, and who, I thought, had played his manhood out in the evening of life, buried together with that we are now tranquilly enjoying of life that is left.\n\nI had heard much from these lips, but part. They are not in comparison with, and it is here that his biography fails.\n\nThe sexton spoke on the prejudices I remembered that he tended the churchyard \"a short period,\" and assisted also in the time he had a more than quickener of the soul.\n\nI was greatly surprised to hear John Angerstein, the inexhaustible owner of the mulberry-tree under which Shakspeare used to sit, that he looked upon the poet's tomb as his own. Thus it is that the pebbles make a sound even at the feet of kings.\n\nWe approached the house entered by a narrow passage\nfurniture, ticked on the opposite side of the room; with a bright warming-pan hanging on one side of it, and the old man's horn-handled Sunday cane on the other. The fireplace, as usual, was wide and deep enough to admit a gossip knot within its jambs. In one corner sat the old man's grand-daughter sewing, a pretty blue-eyed girl,\u2014and in the opposite corner was a superannuated crony, whom he addressed by the name of John Ange, and who, I found, had been his companion from childhood. They had played together in infancy; they had worked together in manhood; they were now tottering about and gossiping away the evening of life; and in a short time they will probably be buried together in the neighbouring churchyard. It is not often that we see two streams of existence running thus evenly and tranquilly side by side; it is only in such quiet \"bosom scenes\" of life that they are to be met with.\n\nI had hoped to gather some traditionary anecdotes of the bard from these ancient chroniclers; but they had nothing new to impart. The long interval during which Shakspeare's writings lay in comparative neglect has spread its shadow over his history; and it is his good or evil lot that scarcely anything remains to his biographers but a scanty handful of conjectures.\n\nThe sexton and his companion had been employed as carpenters on the preparations for the celebrated Stratford jubilee, and they remembered Garrick, the prime mover of the f\u00eate, who superintended the arrangements, and who, according to the sexton, was \"a short punch man, very lively and bustling.\" John Ange had assisted also in cutting down Shakspeare's mulberry-tree, of which he had a morsel in his pocket for sale; no doubt a sovereign quickener of literary conception.\n\nI was grieved to hear these two worthy wights speak very dubiously of the eloquent dame who shows the Shakspeare house. John Ange shook his head when I mentioned her valuable and inexhaustible collection of relics, particularly her remains of the mulberry-tree; and the old sexton even expressed a doubt as to Shakspeare having been born in her house. I soon discovered that he looked upon her mansion with an evil eye, as a rival to the poet's tomb; the latter having comparatively but few visitors. Thus it is that historians differ at the very outset, and mere pebbles make the stream of truth diverge into different channels even at the fountain head.\n\nWe approached the church through the avenue of limes, and entered by a Gothic porch, highly ornamented, with carved doors\nof massive oak. The interior is spacious, and the architecture and embellishments superior to those of most country churches. There are several ancient monuments of nobility and gentry, over some of which hang funeral escutcheons, and banners dropping piecemeal from the walls. The tomb of Shakspeare is in the chancel. The place is solemn and sepulchral. Tall elms wave before the pointed windows, and the Avon, which runs at a short distance from the walls, keeps up a low perpetual murmur. A flat stone marks the spot where the bard is buried. There are four lines inscribed on it, said to have been written by himself, and which have in them something extremely awful. If they are indeed his own, they show that solicitude about the quiet of the grave, which seems natural to fine sensibilities and thoughtful minds.\n\nGood friend, for Jesus' sake, forbear\nTo dig the dust enclosed here.\nBlessed be he that spares these stones,\nAnd curse be he that moves my bones.\n\nJust over the grave, in a niche of the wall, is a bust of Shakspeare, put up shortly after his death, and considered as a resemblance. The aspect is pleasant and serene, with a finely-arched forehead; and I thought I could read in it clear indications of that cheerful, social disposition, by which he was as much characterized among his contemporaries as by the vastness of his genius. The inscription mentions his age at the time of his decease\u2014fifty-three years; an untimely death for the world: for what fruit might not have been expected from the golden autumn of such a mind, sheltered as it was from the stormy vicissitudes of life, and flourishing in the sunshine of popular and royal favour.\n\nThe inscription on the tombstone has not been without its effect. It has prevented the removal of his remains from the bosom of his native place to Westminster Abbey, which was at one time contemplated. A few years since, also, as some labourers were digging to make an adjoining vault, the earth caved in, so as to leave a vacant space almost like an arch, through which one might have reached into his grave. No one, however, presumed to meddle with his remains so awfully guarded by a malediction; and lest any of the idle or the curious, or any collector of relics, should be tempted to commit depredations, the old sexton kept watch over the place for two days, until the vault was finished and the aperture closed again. He told me that he had made bold to look in at the hole, but could see nothing, I thing, I\n\nNext Mrs. Hall is a full-length memory; There and dwell on the idea porvive leum.

On a tomb close by, also, is a full-length effigy of his old friend John Combe, of curious memory; on whom he is said to have written a ludicrous epitaph. There are other monuments around, but the mind refuses to dwell on anything that is not connected with Shakspeare. His idea pervades the place; the whole pile seems but as his mausoleum. The feelings, no longer checked and thwarted by doubt, here indulge in perfect confidence: other traces of him may be false or dubious, but here is palpable evidence and absolute certainty. As I trod the sounding pavement, there was something intense and thrilling in the idea that, in very truth, the remains of Shakspeare were mouldering beneath my feet. It was a long time before I could prevail upon myself to leave the place; and as I passed through the churchyard, I plucked a branch from one of the yew-trees, the only relic that I have brought from Stratford. I had now visited the usual objects of a pilgrim's devotion, but I had a desire to see the old family seat of the Lucys, at Charlecot, and to ramble through the park where Shakspeare, in company with some of the rioters of Stratford, committed his youthful offence of deer-stealing. In this harebrained exploit we are told that he was taken prisoner, and carried to the keeper's lodge, where he remained all night in doleful captivity. When brought into the presence of Sir Thomas Lucy, his treatment must have been galling and humiliating; for it so wrought upon his spirit as to produce a rough pasquinade, which was affixed to the park gate at Charlecot.*\n\nThis flagitious attack upon the dignity of the knight so incensed him, that he applied to a lawyer at Warwick to put the severity of the laws in force against the rhyming deer-stalker. Shakspeare did not wait to brave the united puissance of a knight of the shire and a country attorney. He forthwith abandoned the pleasant banks of the Avon and his paternal trade; wandered\n\n*The following is the only stanza extant of this lampoon:\n\nA parliament member, a justice of peace,\nAt home a poor scarecrow, at London an ass,\nIf Lucy is Lucy, as some volves miscall it,\nThen Lucy is lowly, whatever befall it.\nHe thinks himself great;\nYet an ass in his estate,\nWe allow by his ears but with noses to mate,\nIf Lucy is Lucy, as some volves miscall it,\nThen sing lowly Lucy whatever befall it.\naway to London; became a hanger-on to the theatres; then an actor; and, finally, wrote for the stage; and thus, through the persecution of Sir Thomas Lucy, Stratford lost an indifferent wool-comber, and the world gained an immortal poet. He retained, however, for a long time, a sense of the harsh treatment of the Lord of Charlecot, and revenged himself in his writings; but in the sportive way of a good-natured mind. Sir Thomas is said to be the original of Justice Shallow, and the satire is slyly fixed upon him by the justice's armorial bearings, which, like those of the knight, had white lutes* in the quarterings.\n\nVarious attempts have been made by his biographers to soften and explain away this early transgression of the poet; but I look upon it as one of those thoughtless exploits natural to his situation and turn of mind. Shakespeare, when young, had doubtless all the wildness and irregularity of an ardent, undisciplined, and undirected genius. The poetic temperament has naturally something in it of the vagabond. When left to itself, it runs loosely and wildly, and delights in everything eccentric and licentious. It is often a turn-up of a die, in the gambling freaks of fate, whether a natural genius shall turn out a great rogue or a great poet; and had not Shakespeare's mind fortunately taken a literary bias, he might have as daringly transcended all civil as he has all dramatic laws.\n\nI have little doubt that in early life, when running like an unbroken colt about the neighbourhood of Stratford, he was to be found in the company of all kinds of odd anomalous characters; that he associated with all the madcaps of the place, and was one of those unlucky urchins at mention of whom old men shake their heads, and predict that they will one day come to the gallows. To him the poaching in Sir Thomas Lucy's park was doubtless like a foray to a Scottish knight, and struck his eager and as yet untamed imagination as something delightfully adventurous.\n\n* The lute is a pipe or jack, and abounds in the Avon about Charlecot.\n\n\u2020 A proof of Shakespeare's random habits and associates in his youthful days may be found in a traditionary anecdote, picked up at Stratford by the elder Ireland, and mentioned in his \"Picturesque Views on the Avon.\"\n\nAbout seven miles from Stratford lies the thirsty little market town of Bedford, famous for its ale. Two societies of the village yeomanry used to meet, under the appellation of the Bedford Toipers, and to challenge the lovers of good ale of the neighbouring villages to a contest of drinking. Among others, the people of Stratford were called out to prove the strength of their heads; and in the number of the champions was Shakespeare, who, in spite of the proverb, that \"they who drink beer will think beer,\" was as true to his ale as Falstaff to his sack. The chimney of Stratford was steeped in the first onset, and sounded a retreat while they had yet legs to carry them off the field. They had scarcely marched a mile, when, their legs failing them, they were forced to lie down under a crab-tree, where they passed the night. It is still standing, and goes by the name of Shakespeare's tree.\n\nThe old house remains in a most interesting and peaceful circumstance. The house stood near Stratford, I remember leisurely the trees must have been.\n\nThe country is always very fine in the weather, and the landscape. The awakening of the senses; to see the green sprouts of their reviving, returning from the borderer on the white blossoms bleating of the fields.

As the house stood at little more than three miles' distance from Stratford, I resolved to pay it a pedestrian visit, that I might stroll leisurely through some of those scenes from which Shakspeare must have derived his earliest ideas of rural imagery.\n\nThe country was yet naked and leafless; but English scenery is always verdant, and the sudden change in the temperature of the weather was surprising in its quickening effects upon the landscape. It was inspiring and animating to witness this first awakening of spring; to feel its warm breath stealing over the senses; to see the moist mellow earth beginning to put forth the green sprout and the tender blade; and the trees and shrubs, in their reviving tints and bursting buds, giving the promise of returning foliage and flower. The cold snowdrop, that little borderer on the skirts of winter, was to be seen with its chaste white blossoms in the small gardens before the cottages. The bleating of the new-dropped lambs was faintly heard from the fields. The sparrow twittered about the thatched eaves and budding hedges; the robin threw a livelier note into his late querulous wintry strain; and the lark, springing up from the reeking bosom of the meadow, towered away into the bright fleecy cloud, pouring forth torrents of melody. As I watched the little songster, mounting up higher and higher, until his body was a mere speck on the white bosom of the cloud, while the ear was still filled with his music, it called to mind Shakspeare's exquisite little song in \"Cymbeline\":\n\nMark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,\nAnd Phoebus 'gins arise,\nHis steeds to water at these springs,\nOn chaliced flowers that lie.\nAnd waking merry-buds begin\nTo ope their golden eyes;\nWith every thing that pretty bin,\nMy lady sweet arise!\n\nIndeed the whole country about here is poetical ground; everything is associated with the idea of Shakspeare. Every old\n\nIn the morning his companions awaked the bard, and proposed returning to Bedford, but he declined, saying he had had enough, having drunk with\u2014\n\nPiping Pewworth, Dancing Marston,\nHaunted Hilborough, Hungry Grafton,\nDodging Erthall, Pupil Winkford,\nBeggarly Broom, and Drunken Bedford.\n\n\"The villages here alluded to,\" says Ireland, \"still bear the epithets thus given them; the people of Pewworth are still famed for their skill on the pipe and tabor; Hilborough is now called Haunted Hilborough; and Grafton is famous for the poverty of its soil.\"\ncottage that I saw I fancied into some resort of his boyhood, where he had acquired his intimate knowledge of rustic life and manners, and heard those legendary tales and wild superstitions which he has woven like witchcraft into his dramas; for in his time, we are told, it was a popular amusement in winter evenings \"to sit round the fire, and tell merry tales of errant knights, queens, lovers, lords, ladies, giants, dwarfs, thieves, cheaters, witches, fairies, goblins, and friars.\"*\n\nMy route for a part of the way lay in sight of the Avon, which made a variety of the most fanciful doublings and windings through a wide and fertile valley; sometimes glittering from among willows, which fringed its borders; sometimes disappearing among groves, or beneath green banks; and sometimes rambling out into full view, and making an azure sweep round a slope of meadow-land. This beautiful bosom of country is called the Vale of the Red Horse. A distant line of undulating blue hills seems to be its boundary, whilst all the soft intervening landscape lies in a manner enchained in the silver links of the Avon.\n\nAfter pursuing the road for about three miles, I turned off into a footpath, which led along the borders of fields, and under hedgerows, to a private gate of the park; there was a stile, however, for the benefit of the pedestrian; there being a public right of way through the grounds. I delight in these hospitable estates, in which every one has a kind of property\u2014at least as far as the footpath is concerned. It in some measure reconciles a poor man to his lot, and, what is more, to the better lot of his neighbour, thus to have parks and pleasure-grounds thrown open for his recreation. He breathes the pure air as freely, and lolls as luxuriously under the shade, as the lord of the soil; and if he has not the privilege of calling all that he sees his own, he has not, at the same time, the trouble of paying for it, and keeping it in order.\n\nI now found myself among noble avenues of oaks and elms, whose vast size bespoke the growth of centuries. The wind sounded solemnly among their branches, and the rooks cawed from their hereditary nests in the tree-tops. The eye ranged through a long lessening vista, with nothing to interrupt the view but a distant statue, and a vagrant deer stalking like a shadow across the opening.\n\n* Scot, in his \"Discoverie of Witchcraft,\" enumerates a host of these fireside fascinants. \"And they have so afraid us with ball-beggars, spirits, witches, urchins, elves, hags, fairies, satyrs, pans, fauns, syrens, kit with the can stickle, tritons, centaurs, warites, giants, imps, calare, conjurers, nymphs, changelings, incubus, Robin-goodfellow, the speere, the merrie, the man in the ore, the Bell-waine, the flar drake, the puckle, Tom Titcomb, hobgoblin, Tom Tumbler, boncluse, and such other huge, that we were afraid of our owne shadows.\"\n\nThere is the effect of similarity in duration, and which we also the longevity of aristocratic palaces of marble and mortar, suddenly build.\n\nIt was fine and about the time broke, which Shakespear's forest meditations in \"As such scenes inspire, the majesty of rapture; vagary upon it; and the luxury of the under one of shades over the that the poet which breathed\n\nI had now of brick, with Elizabeth's da. The exterior be considered a gentleman of into a kind of grassplot, sh of the a flanked by tow\nThere is something about these stately old avenues that has the effect of Gothic architecture, not merely from the pretended similarity of form, but from their bearing the evidence of long duration, and of having had their origin in a period of time with which we associate ideas of romantic grandeur. They betoken also the long-settled dignity and proudly-concentrated independence of an ancient family; and I have heard a worthy but aristocratic old friend observe, when speaking of the sumptuous palaces of modern gentry, that \"money could do much with stone and mortar, but, thank Heaven, there was no such thing as suddenly building up an avenue of oaks.\"\n\nIt was from wandering in early life among this rich scenery, and about the romantic solitudes of the adjoining park of Fullbroke, which then formed a part of the Lucy estate, that some of Shakspeare's commentators have supposed he derived his noble forest meditations of Jacques, and the enchanting woodland pictures in \"As you Like it.\" It is in lonely wanderings through such scenes that the mind drinks deep but quiet draughts of inspiration, and becomes intensely sensible of the beauty and majesty of nature. The imagination kindles into reverie and rapture; vague but exquisite images and ideas keep breaking upon it; and we revel in a mute and almost incommunicable luxury of thought. It was in some such mood, and perhaps under one of those very trees before me, which threw their broad shades over the grassy banks and quivering waters of the Avon, that the poet's fancy may have sallied forth into that little song which breathes the very soul of a rural voluptuary:\n\nUnder the green wood tree,\nWho loves to lie with me,\nAnd tune his merry throat\nUnto the sweet bird's note,\nCome hither, come hither, come hither.\nHere shall he see\nNo enemy,\nBut winter and rough weather.\n\nI had now come in sight of the house. It is a large building of brick, with stone quoins, and is in the Gothic style of Queen Elizabeth's day, having been built in the first year of her reign. The exterior remains very nearly in its original state, and may be considered a fair specimen of the residence of a wealthy country gentleman of those days. A great gateway opens from the park into a kind of court-yard in front of the house, ornamented with a grassplot, shrubs, and flower-beds. The gateway is in imitation of the ancient barbican; being a kind of out-post, and flanked by towers; though evidently for mere ornament instead\nof defence. The front of the house is completely in the old style: with stone-shafted casements, a great bow window of heavy stonework, and a portal with armorial bearings over it, carved in stone. At each corner of the building is an octagon tower, surmounted by a gilt ball and weathercock.\n\nThe Avon, which winds through the park, makes a bend just at the foot of a gently-sloping bank, which sweeps down from the rear of the house. Large herds of deer were feeding or reposing upon its borders; and swans were sailing majestically upon its bosom. As I contemplated the venerable old mansion, I called to mind Falstaff's encomium on Justice Shallow's abode, and the affected indifference and real vanity of the latter.\n\nFalstaff. You have a goodly dwelling and a rich.\nShallow. Barren, barren, barren; beggars all, Sir John\u2014marry, good sir.\n\nWhatever may have been the joviality of the old mansion in the days of Shakspeare, it had now an air of stillness and solitude. The great iron gateway that opened into the court-yard was locked; there was no show of servants bustling about the place; the deer gazed quietly at me as I passed, being no longer harried by the moss-troopers of Stratford. The only sign of domestic life that I met with was a white cat, stealing with wary look and stealthy pace towards the stables, as if on some nefarious expedition. I must not omit to mention the carcass of a scoundrel crow which I saw suspended against the barn wall, as it shows that the Lucys still inherit that lordly abhorrence of poachers, and maintain that rigorous exercise of territorial power which was so strenuously manifested in the case of the bard.\n\nAfter prowling about for some time, I at length found my way to a lateral portal, which was the every-day entrance to the mansion. I was courteously received by a worthy old housekeeper, who, with the civility and communicativeness of her order, showed me the interior of the house. The greater part has undergone alterations, and been adapted to modern tastes and modes of living: there is a fine old oaken staircase; and the great hall, that noble feature in an ancient manor-house, still retains much of the appearance it must have had in the days of Shakspeare. The ceiling is arched and lofty; and at one end is a gallery, in which stands an organ. The weapons and trophies of the chase, which formerly adorned the hall of a country gentleman, have made way for family portraits. There is a wide hospitable fireplace, calculated for an ample old-fashioned wood fire, formerly the rallying-place of winter festivity. On the opposite side of the hall is the huge Gothic bow-window, with stone shafts, which looks out on the glass the same directions, some of them the quarters of Sir Thomas Lucy.

Here are emblazoned in stained glass the armorial bearings of the Lucy family for many generations, some being dated in 1558. I was delighted to observe in the quarterings the three white laces, by which the character of Sir Thomas was first identified with that of Justice Shallow. They are mentioned in the first scene of the \"Merry Wives of Windsor,\" where the Justice is in a rage with Falstaff for having \"beaten his men, killed his deer, and broken into his lodge.\" The poet had no doubt the offences of himself and his comrades in mind at the time, and we may suppose the family pride and vindictive threats of the puissant Shallow to be a caricature of the pompous indignation of Sir Thomas.\n\nShallow.

Ha; o' my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it!\n\nNear the window thus emblazoned hung a portrait by Sir Peter Lely, of one of the Lucy family, a great beauty of the time of Charles the Second: the old housekeeper shook her head as she pointed to the picture, and informed me that this lady had been sadly addicted to cards, and had gambled away a great portion of the family estate, among which was that part of the park where Shakespeare and his comrades had killed the deer. The lands thus lost had not been entirely regained by the family even at the present day. It is but justice to this recreant dame to confess that she had a surpassingly fine hand and arm.\n\nThe picture which most attracted my attention was a great painting over the fireplace, containing likenesses of Sir Thomas Lucy and his family, who inhabited the hall in the latter part of Shakespeare's lifetime. I at first thought that it was the vindictive knight himself, but the housekeeper assured me that it was his son; the only likeness extant of the former being an effigy upon his tomb in the church of the neighbouring hamlet of Charlecot.*\n\n* This effigy is in white marble, and represents the Knight in complete armour. Near him lies the effigy of his wife, and on her tomb is the following inscription, which, if truly composed by her husband, places him quite above the intellectual level of Master Shallow:\u2014\n\n\"Here lyeth the Lady Joyce Lucy wife of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecot in ye county of Warwick, Knight, Daughter and heir of Thomas Aston of Botton in ye county of Worcestershire who departed out of this wretched world to her heavenly kingdom ye 16 day of...\"\nThe picture gives a lively idea of the costume and manners of the time. Sir Thomas is dressed in ruff and doublet, white shoes with roses in them, and has a peaked yellow, or, as Master Slender would say, \"a cane-coloured beard.\" His lady is seated on the opposite side of the picture, in wide ruff and long stomacher, and the children have a most venerable stiffness and formality of dress. Hounds and spaniels are mingled in the family group, a hawk is seated on his perch in the foreground, and one of the children holds a bow\u2014all intimating the knight's skill in hunting, hawking, and archery, so indispensable to an accomplished gentleman in those days.*\n\nI regretted to find that the ancient furniture of the hall had disappeared, for I had hoped to meet with the stately elbow-chair of carved oak, in which the country squire of former days was wont to sway the sceptre of empire over his rural domains; and in which it might be presumed the redoubted Sir Thomas sat enthroned in awful state when the recreant Shakspeare was brought before him. As I like to deck out pictures for my own entertainment, I pleased myself with the idea that this very hall had been the scene of the unlucky bard's examination on the morning after his captivity in the lodge. I fancied to myself the rural potentate, surrounded by his body-guard of butler pages, and blue-coated serving-men with their badges; while the luckless culprit was brought in, forlorn and chopfallen, in the custody of gamekeepers, huntsmen, and whippers-in, and followed by a rabble rout of country clowns. I fancied bright faces of curious housemaids peeping from the half-opened doors, while from the gallery the fair daughters of the knight leaned gracefully forward, eyeing the youthful prisoner with that pity \"that dwells in womanhood.\" Who would have thought that this poor\n\nFebruary in ye years of our Lord God 1598 and of her age 60 and three.

Set downe by him yt best knewe what hath byn written to be true.\n\n\"Thomas Lucy.\"\n\n* Bishop Erle, speaking of the country gentleman of his time, observes, \"His keeping is seen much in the different families of dogs, and serving-men attendant on the kennels; and the deepness of their throats is the depth of his discourse. A hawk esteems the true burden of nobility, and is exceedingly ambitious to seem delighted at the sport, and have his fist gloved with his jesses.\" And Gilpin, in his description of Mr. Hastings, remarks, \"He kept all sorts of hounds that run\u2014beast, fox, hare, otter, badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both long and short-winged. His great hall was commonly strewed with marrow-bones, and full of hawk perches, hounds, spaniels, terriers. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some of the choicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels.\"\n\nOn returning to the seat of the poet, the spirit of the poet seemed to hover over the very trees and shrubs, and charm and charm the \"play world\" into a fairy land. The imagination of Shakspeare, I thought, had surveyed every object, enlarged every object, surrounded with a halo, and up by po\nvarlet, thus trembling before the brief authority of a country squire, and the sport of rustic boors, was soon to become the delight of princes, the theme of all tongues and ages, the dictator to the human mind, and was to confer immortality on his oppressor by a caricature and a lampoon!\n\nI was now invited by the butler to walk into the garden, and I felt inclined to visit the orchard and arbour where the justice treated Sir John Falstaff and Cousin Silence \"to a last year's pippin of his own grafting, with a dish of carraways;\" but I had already spent so much of the day in my ramblings, that I was obliged to give up any further investigations. When about to take my leave, I was gratified by the civil entreaties of the housekeeper and butler that I would take some refreshment, an instance of good old hospitality which, I grieve to say, we castle-hunters seldom meet with in modern days. I make no doubt it is a virtue which the present representative of the Lucys inherits from his ancestors; for Shakspeare, even in his caricature, makes Justice Shallow importunate in this respect, as witness his pressing instances to Falstaff.\n\nBy cock and pre, sir, you shall not away to-night \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused; excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse shall serve; you shall not be excused. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Some pigeons, Davy; a couple of short-legged hens; a joint of mutton; and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William Cook.\n\nI now bade a reluctant farewell to the old hall. My mind had become so completely possessed by the imaginary scenes and characters connected with it, that I seemed to be actually living among them. Everything brought them as it were before my eyes; and as the door of the dining-room opened, I almost expected to hear the feeble voice of Master Silence quavering forth his favourite ditty:\n\n'Tis merry in hall, when beards was all,\nAnd welcome merry shrove-tide.\n\nOn returning to my inn, I could not but reflect on the singular gift of the poet; to be able thus to spread the magic of his mind over the very face of nature; to give to things and places a charm and character not their own, and to turn this \"working-day world\" into a perfect fairy land. He is, indeed, the true enchantor, whose spell operates, not upon the senses, but upon the imagination of the heart. Under the wizard influence of Shakspeare, I had been walking all day in a complete delusion. I had surveyed the landscape through the prism of poetry, which had changed every object with the hues of the rainbow. I had been surrounded with fancied beings; with mere airy nothing, constructed up by poetic power, yet which to me had all the charm of\nI had heard Jacques soliloquize beneath his oak; had beheld the fair Rosalind and her companion adventuring through the woodlands; and, above all, had been once more present in spirit with fat Jack Falstaff and his contemporaries, from the august Justice Shallow, down to the gentle Master Slender and the sweet Ann Page. Ten thousand honours and blessings on the bard who has thus gilded the dull realities of life with innocent illusions; who has spread exquisite and unbought pleasures in my chequered path, and beguiled my spirit in many a lonely hour with all the cordial and cheerful sympathies of social life!\n\nAs I crossed the bridge over the Avon on my return, I paused to contemplate the distant church in which the poet lies buried, and could not but exult in the malediction, which has kept his ashes undisturbed in its quiet and hallowed vaults. What honour could his name have derived from being mingled in dusty companionships with the epitaphs and escutcheons and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude? What would a crowded corner in Westminster Abbey have been, compared with this reverend pile, which seems to stand in beautiful loneliness as his sole mausoleum! The solicitude about the grave may be but the offspring of an overwrought sensibility; but human nature is made up of foibles and prejudices; and its best and tenderest affections are mingled with these factitious feelings. He who has sought renown about the world, and has reaped a full harvest of worldly favour, will find, after all, that there is no love, no admiration, no applause, so sweet to the soul as that which springs up in his native place. It is there that he seeks to be gathered in peace and honour among his kindred and his early friends. And when the weary heart and failing head begin to warn him that the evening of life is drawing on, he turns as fondly as does the infant to the mother's arms, to sink to sleep in the bosom of the scene of his childhood.\n\nHow would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard, when, wandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful world, he cast back a heavy look upon his paternal home, could he have foreseen that, before many years, he should return to it covered with renown; that his name should become the boast and glory of his native place; that his ashes should be religiously guarded as its most precious treasure; and that lessening spire, on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation, should one day become the beacon, towering amidst the gentle landscape, to guide the literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb!\nTRAITS OF INDIAN CHARACTER.\n\nI appeal to any white man, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not to eat\u2014if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not.\u2014SPEECH OF AN INDIAN CHIEF.\n\nThere is something in the character and habits of the North American savage, taken in connection with the scenery over which he is accustomed to range, its vast lakes, boundless forests, majestic rivers, and trackless plains, that is to my mind wonderfully striking and sublime. He is formed for the wilderness, as the Arab is for the desert. His nature is stern, simple, and enduring; fitted to grapple with difficulties, and to support privations. There seems but little soil in his heart for the support of the kindly virtues; and yet, if we would but take the trouble to penetrate through that proud stoicism and habitual taciturnity, which lock up his character from casual observation, we should find him linked to his fellow-man of civilized life by more of those sympathies and affections than are usually ascribed to him.\n\nIt has been the lot of the unfortunate aborigines of America, in the early periods of colonization, to be doubly wronged by the white men. They have been dispossessed of their hereditary possessions by mercenary and frequently wanton warfare; and their characters have been traduced by bigoted and interested writers. The colonist often treated them like beasts of the forest; and the author has endeavoured to justify him in his outrages. The former found it easier to exterminate than to civilize; the latter to vilify than to discriminate. The appellations of savage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities of both; and thus the poor wanderers of the forest were persecuted and defamed, not because they were guilty, but because they were ignorant.\n\nThe rights of the savage have seldom been properly appreciated or respected by the white man. In peace he has too often been the dupe of artful traffic; in war he has been regarded as a ferocious animal, whose life or death was a question of mere precaution and convenience. Man is cruelly wasteful of life when his own safety is endangered, and he is sheltered by impunity; and little mercy is to be expected from him, when he feels the sting of the reptile and is conscious of the power to destroy.\n\nThe same prejudices, which were indulged thus early, exist in common circulation at the present day. Certain learned societies have, it is true, with laudable diligence, endeavoured to investigate and record the real characters and manners of the\nIndian tribes; the American government, too, has wisely and humanely exerted itself to inculcate a friendly and forbearing spirit towards them, and to protect them from fraud and injustice.* The current opinion of the Indian character, however, is too apt to be formed from the miserable hordes which infest the frontiers, and hang on the skirts of the settlements. These are too commonly composed of degenerate beings, corrupted and enfeebled by the vices of society, without being benefited by its civilization. That proud independence, which formed the main pillar of savage virtue, has been shaken down, and the whole moral fabric lies in ruins. Their spirits are humiliated and debased by a sense of inferiority, and their native courage cowed and daunted by the superior knowledge and power of their enlightened neighbours. Society has advanced upon them like one of those withering airs, that will sometimes breed desolation over a whole region of fertility. It has enervated their strength, multiplied their diseases, and superinduced upon their original barbarity the low vices of artificial life. It has given them a thousand superfluous wants, whilst it has diminished their means of mere existence. It has driven before it the animals of the chase, who fly from the sound of the axe and the smoke of the settlement, and seek refuge in the depths of the remotest forests and yet untrodden wilds. Thus do we too often find the Indians on our frontiers to be the mere wrecks and remnants of once powerful tribes, who have lingered in the vicinity of the settlements, and sunk into precarious and vagabond existence. Poverty, repining and hopeless poverty, a canker of the mind unknown in savage life, corrodes their spirits and blights every free and noble quality of their natures. They become drunken, indolent, feeble, thievish, and pusillanimous. They loiter like vagrants about the settlements, among spacious dwellings replete with elaborate comforts, which only render them sensible of the comparative wretchedness of their own condition. Luxury spreads its ample board before their eyes; but they are excluded from the banquet. Plenty revels over the fields; but they are starving in the midst of its abundance: the whole wilderness has blossomed into a garden; but they feel as reptiles that infest it.\n\nHow different was their state while yet the undisputed lords\n\n* The American government has been indefatigable in its exertions to ameliorate the situation of the Indians, and to introduce among them the arts of civilization, and civil and religious knowledge. To protect them from the frauds of the white traders, no purchase of land from them by individuals is permitted; nor is any person allowed to receive lands from them as a present, without the express sanction of government. These provisions are strictly enforced.\nof the soil! Their wants were few, and the means of gratification within their reach. They saw every one around them sharing the same lot, enduring the same hardships, feeding on the same aliments, arrayed in the same rude garments. No roof then rose, but was open to the homeless stranger; no smoke curled among the trees, but he was welcome to sit down by its fire and join the hunter in his repast. \"For,\" says an old historian of New England, \"their life is so void of care, and they are so loving also, that they make use of those things they enjoy as common goods, and are therein so compassionate, that rather than one should starve through want, they would starve all; thus they pass their time merrily, not regarding our pomp, but are better content with their own, which some men esteem so meanly of.\" Such were the Indians whilst in the pride and energy of their primitive natures: they resembled those wild plants, which thrive best in the shades of the forest, but shrink from the hand of cultivation, and perish beneath the influence of the sun.\n\nIn discussing the savage character, writers have been too prone to indulge in vulgar prejudice and passionate exaggeration, instead of the candid temper of true philosophy. They have not sufficiently considered the peculiar circumstances in which the Indians have been placed, and the peculiar principles under which they have been educated. No being acts more rigidly from rule than the Indian. His whole conduct is regulated according to some general maxims early implanted in his mind. The moral laws that govern him are, to be sure, but few; but then he conforms to them all;\u2014the white man abounds in laws of religion, morals, and manners, but how many does he violate!\n\nA frequent ground of accusation against the Indians is their disregard of treaties, and the treachery and wantonness with which, in time of apparent peace, they will suddenly fly to hostilities. The intercourse of the white men with the Indians, however, is too apt to be cold, distrustful, oppressive, and insulting. They seldom treat them with that confidence and frankness which are indispensable to real friendship; nor is sufficient caution observed not to offend against those feelings of pride or superstition, which often prompt the Indian to hostility quicker than mere considerations of interest. The solitary savage feels silently, but acutely. His sensibilities are not diffused over so wide a surface as those of the white man; but they run in steadier and deeper channels. His pride, his affections, his superstitions, are all directed towards fewer objects; but the\nwounds inflicted on them are proportionably severe, and furnish motives of hostility which we cannot sufficiently appreciate. Where a community is also limited in number, and forms one great patriarchal family, as in an Indian tribe, the injury of an individual is the injury of the whole; and the sentiment of vengeance is almost instantaneously diffused. One council-fire is sufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a plan of hostilities. Here all the fighting men and sages assemble. Eloquence and superstition combine to inflame the minds of the warriors. The orator awakens their martial ardour, and they are wrought up to a kind of religious desperation, by the visions of the prophet and the dreamer.\n\nAn instance of one of those sudden exasperations, arising from a motive peculiar to the Indian character, is extant in an old record of the early settlement of Massachusetts. The planters of Plymouth had defaced the monuments of the dead at Passonagessit, and had plundered the grave of the Sachem's mother of some skins with which it had been decorated. The Indians are remarkable for the reverence which they entertain for the sepulchres of their kindred. Tribes that have passed generations exiled from the abodes of their ancestors, when by chance they have been travelling in the vicinity, have been known to turn aside from the highway, and, guided by wonderfully accurate tradition, have crossed the country for miles, to some tumulus, buried perhaps in woods, where the bones of their tribe were anciently deposited; and there have passed hours in silent meditation. Influenced by this sublime and holy feeling, the Sachem whose mother's tomb had been violated, gathered his men together, and addressed them in the following beautifully simple and pathetic harangue; a curious specimen of Indian eloquence, and an affecting instance of filial piety in a savage:\n\n\"When last the glorious light of all the sky was underneath this globe, and birds grew silent, I began to settle, as my custom is, to take repose. Before mine eyes were fast closed, methought I saw a vision, at which my spirit was much troubled; and trembling at that doleful sight, a spirit cried aloud, 'Behold, my son, whom I have cherished, see the breasts that gave thee suck, the hands that lapped thee warm, and fed thee oft. Canst thou forget to take revenge of those wild people who have defaced my monument in a despiteful manner, disdaining our antiquities and honourable customs? See, now, the Sachem's grave lies like the common people, defaced by an ignoble race. Thy mother...\"\ndoth complain, and implores thy aid against this thievish people, who have newly intruded on our land. If this be suffered, I shall not rest quiet in my everlasting habitation.' This said, the spirit vanished, and I, all in a sweat, not able scarce to speak, began to get some strength, and recollect my spirits that were fled, and determined to demand your counsel and assistance.\"\n\nI have adduced this anecdote at some length, as it tends to show how these sudden acts of hostility, which have been attributed to caprice and perfidy, may often arise from deep and generous motives, which our inattention to Indian character and customs prevents our properly appreciating.\n\nAnother ground of violent outcry against the Indians is their barbarity to the vanquished. This had its origin partly in policy and partly in superstition. The tribes, though sometimes called nations, were never so formidable in their numbers, but that the loss of several warriors was sensibly felt; this was particularly the case when they had been frequently engaged in warfare; and many an instance occurs in Indian history, where a tribe, that had long been formidable to its neighbours, has been broken up and driven away, by the capture and massacre of its principal fighting men. There was a strong temptation, therefore, to the victor to be merciless; not so much to gratify any cruel revenge, as to provide for future security. The Indians had also the superstitious belief, frequent among barbarous nations, and prevalent also among the ancients, that the manes of their friends who had fallen in battle were soothed by the blood of the captives. The prisoners, however, who are not thus sacrificed, are adopted into their families in the place of the slain, and are treated with the confidence and affection of relatives and friends; nay, so hospitable and tender is their entertainment, that when the alternative is offered them, they will often prefer to remain with their adopted brethren, rather than return to the home and the friends of their youth.\n\nThe cruelty of the Indians towards their prisoners has been heightened since the colonization of the whites. What was formerly a compliance with policy and superstition, has been exaggerated into a gratification of vengeance. They cannot but be sensible that the white men are the usurpers of their ancient dominion, the cause of their degradation, and the gradual destroyers of their race. They go forth to battle, smarting with injuries and indignities which they have individually suffered, and they are driven to madness and despair by the wide-spreading desola-\ntion, and the overwhelming ruin of European warfare. The whites have too frequently set them an example of violence, by burning their villages, and laying waste their slender means of subsistence; and yet they wonder that savages do not show moderation and magnanimity towards those who have left them nothing but mere existence and wretchedness.\n\nWe stigmatize the Indians, also, as cowardly and treacherous, because they use stratagem in warfare, in preference to open force; but in this they are fully justified by their rude code of honour. They are early taught that stratagem is praiseworthy; the bravest warrior thinks it no disgrace to lurk in silence, and take every advantage of his foe: he triumphs in the superior craft and sagacity by which he has been enabled to surprise and destroy an enemy. Indeed, man is naturally more prone to subtlety than open valour, owing to his physical weakness in comparison with other animals. They are endowed with natural weapons of defence; with horns, with tusks, with hoofs, and talons; but man has to depend on his superior sagacity. In all his encounters with these, his proper enemies, he resorts to stratagem; and when he perversely turns his hostility against his fellow-man, he at first continues the same subtle mode of warfare.\n\nThe natural principle of war is to do the most harm to our enemy with the least harm to ourselves: and this of course is to be effected by stratagem. That chivalrous courage which induces us to despise the suggestions of prudence, and to rush in the face of certain danger, is the offspring of society, and produced by education. It is honourable, because it is, in fact, the triumph of lofty sentiment over an instinctive repugnance to pain, and over those yearnings after personal ease and security, which society has condemned as ignoble. It is kept alive by pride and the fear of shame; and thus the dread of real evil is overcome by the superior dread of an evil which exists but in the imagination. It has been cherished and stimulated also by various means. It has been the theme of spirit-stirring song and chivalrous story. The poet and minstrel have delighted to shed round it the splendours of fiction; and even the historian has forgotten the sober gravity of narration, and broken forth into enthusiasm and rhapsody in its praise. Triumphs and gorgeous pageants have been its reward: monuments, on which art has exhausted its skill, and opulence its treasures, have been erected to perpetuate a nation's gratitude and admiration. Thus artificially excited, courage has risen to an extraordinary and factitious degree of heroism, and, arrayed in all the glorious \"pomp and circumstance of war,\" this turbulent quality has been made invaluable, and swollen.\n\nBut if chivalry is pain, He lives in adventure to arouse himself. Surrounded by and surprising weapons in through the fields of air, undaunted, expeditions of the devoted vast forests, enemies, and seas\u2014are now bark he spurns the swiftness His very subdues. He gains his wraps himself buffalo, and a\n\nNo hero of his lofty contents its cruelty superior to the situation. The latter, the former can endures it; among the protracted his persecutors, the devouring from the sinewy defiance of an fathers to witness. Notwithstanding have overshadowed some bright gleam degree of melancholy.\nquality has even been able to eclipse many of those quiet, but invaluable virtues, which silently ennoble the human character, and swell the tide of human happiness.\n\nBut if courage intrinsically consists in the defiance of danger and pain, the life of the Indian is a continual exhibition of it. He lives in a state of perpetual hostility and risk. Peril and adventure are congenial to his nature; or rather seem necessary to arouse his faculties and to give an interest to his existence. Surrounded by hostile tribes, whose mode of warfare is by ambush and surprisal, he is always prepared for fight, and lives with his weapons in his hands. As the ship careers in fearful singleness through the solitudes of ocean; as the bird mingles among clouds and storms, and wings its way, a mere speck, across the pathless fields of air;\u2014so the Indian holds his course, silent, solitary, but undaunted, through the boundless bosom of the wilderness. His expeditions may vie in distance and danger with the pilgrimage of the devotee, or the crusade of the knight-errant. He traverses vast forests, exposed to the hazards of lonely sickness, of lurking enemies, and pining famine. Stormy lakes\u2014those great inland seas\u2014are no obstacles to his wanderings: in his light canoe of bark he sports, like a feather, on their waves; and darts, with the swiftness of an arrow, down the roaring rapids of the rivers. His very subsistence is snatched from the midst of toil and peril. He gains his food by the hardships and dangers of the chase: he wraps himself in the spoils of the bear, the panther, and the buffalo, and sleeps among the thunders of the cataract.\n\nNo hero of ancient or modern days can surpass the Indian in his lofty contempt of death, and the fortitude with which he sustains its cruellest affliction. Indeed, we here behold him rising superior to the white man, in consequence of his peculiar education. The latter rushes to glorious death at the cannon's mouth; the former calmly contemplates its approach, and triumphantly endures it; amidst the varied torments of surrounding foes and the protracted agonies of fire. He even takes a pride in taunting his persecutors, and provoking their ingenuity of torture; and as the devouring flames prey on his very vitals, and the flesh shrinks from the sinews, he raises his last song of triumph, breathing the defiance of an unconquered heart, and invoking the spirits of his fathers to witness that he dies without a groan.\n\nNotwithstanding the obloquy with which the early historians have overshadowed the characters of the unfortunate natives, some bright gleams occasionally break through, which throw a degree of melancholy lustre on their memories. Facts are occa-\nsionally to be met with in the rude annals of the eastern provinces, which, though recorded with the colouring of prejudice and bigotry, yet speak for themselves; and will be dwelt on with applause and sympathy, when prejudice shall have passed away.\n\nIn one of the homely narratives of the Indian wars in New England, there is a touching account of the desolation carried into the tribe of the Pequod Indians. Humanity shrinks from the cold-blooded detail of indiscriminate butchery. In one place we read of the surprisal of an Indian fort in the night, when the wigwams were wrapt in flames, and the miserable inhabitants shot down and slain in attempting to escape, \"all being despatched and ended in the course of an hour.\" After a series of similar transactions, \"our soldiers,\" as the historian piously observes, \"being resolved by God's assistance to make a final destruction of them,\" the unhappy savages being hunted from their homes and fortresses, and pursued with fire and sword, a scanty, but gallant band, the sad remnant of the Pequod warriors, with their wives and children, took refuge in a swamp.\n\nBurning with indignation, and rendered sullen by despair; with hearts bursting with grief at the destruction of their tribe, and spirits galled and sore at the fancied ignominy of their defeat, they refused to ask their lives at the hands of an insulting foe, and preferred death to submission.\n\nAs the night drew on they were surrounded in their dismal retreat, so as to render escape impracticable. Thus situated, their enemy \"plied them with shot all the time, by which means many were killed and buried in the mire.\" In the darkness and fog that preceded the dawn of day, some few broke through the besiegers and escaped into the woods; \"the rest were left to the conquerors, of which many were killed in the swamp, like sullen dogs who would rather, in their self-willedness and madness, sit still and be shot through, or cut to pieces,\" than implore for mercy. When the day broke upon this handful of forlorn but dauntless spirits, the soldiers, we are told, entering the swamp, \"saw several heaps of them sitting close together, upon whom they discharged their pieces laden with ten or twelve pistol bullets at a time, putting the muzzles of the pieces under the boughs, within a few yards of them; so as, besides those that were found dead, many more were killed and sunk into the mire, and never were minded more by friend or foe.\"\n\nCan any one read this plain unvarnished tale without admiring the stern resolution, the unbending pride, the loftiness of spirit,\nTRAITS OF INDIAN CHARACTER.\n\nthat seemed to nerve the hearts of these self-taught heroes, and to raise them above the instinctive feelings of human nature? When the Gauls laid waste the city of Rome, they found the senators clothed in their robes, and seated with stern tranquillity in their curule chairs; in this manner they suffered death without resistance or even supplication. Such conduct was, in them, applauded as noble and magnanimous; in the hapless Indian it was reviled as obstinate and sullen. How truly are we the dupes of show and circumstance! How different is virtue, clothed in purple and enthroned in state, from virtue, naked and destitute, and perishing obscurely in a wilderness!\n\nBut I forbear to dwell on these gloomy pictures. The eastern tribes have long since disappeared; the forests that sheltered them have been laid low; and scarce any traces remain of them in the thickly-settled states of New England, excepting here and there the Indian name of a village or a stream. And such must, sooner or later, be the fate of those other tribes which skirt the frontiers, and have occasionally been inveigled from their forests to mingle in the wars of white men. In a little while, and they will go the way that their brethren have gone before. The few hordes which still linger about the shores of Huron and Superior, and the tributary streams of the Mississippi, will share the fate of those tribes that once spread over Massachusetts and Connecticut, and lorded it along the proud banks of the Hudson; of that gigantic race said to have existed on the borders of the Susquehanna; and of those various nations that flourished about the Potomac and the Rappahannock, and that peopled the forests of the vast valley of Shenandoah. They will vanish like a vapour from the face of the earth; their very history will be lost in forgetfulness; and \"the places that now know them will know them no more forever.\" Or if, perchance, some dubious memorial of them should survive, it may be in the romantic dreams of the poet, to people imagination his glades and groves, like the fauns and satyrs and sylvan deities of antiquity. But should he venture upon the dark story of their wrongs and wretchedness; should he tell how they were invaded, corrupted, despoiled, driven from their native abodes and the sepulchres of their fathers, hunted like wild beasts about the earth, and sent down with violence and butchery to the grave, posterity will either turn with horror and incredulity from the tale, or blush with indignation at the inhumanity of their forefathers.\u2014\"We are driven back,\" said an old warrior, \"until we can retreat no farther\u2014our hatchets are broken, our bows are snapped, our fires are nearly extinguished\u2014a little longer and...\"\nthe white man will cease to persecute us\u2014for we shall cease to exist.\"\n\nPHILIP OF POKANOKET.\n\nAN INDIAN MEMOIR.\n\nAs monumental bronze unchanged his look:\nA soul that pity touch'd, but never shook:\nTrain'd from his tree-rock'd cradle to his bier:\nThe fierce extremes of good and ill to brook\nImpressive\u2014fearing but the shame of fear\u2014\nA stoe of the woods\u2014a man without a tear.\u2014CAMPBELL.\n\nIt is to be regretted that those early writers, who treated of the discovery and settlement of America, have not given us more particular and candid accounts of the remarkable characters that flourished in savage life. The scanty anecdotes which have reached us are full of peculiarity and interest; they furnish us with nearer glimpses of human nature, and show what man is in a comparatively primitive state, and what he owes to civilization. There is something of the charm of discovery in lighting upon these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature; in witnessing, as it were, the native growth of moral sentiment, and perceiving those generous and romantic qualities which have been artificially cultivated by society, vegetating in spontaneous hardihood and rude magnificence.\n\nIn civilized life, where the happiness, and, indeed, almost the existence, of man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow-men, he is constantly acting a studied part. The bold and peculiar traits of native character are refined away, or softened down by the levelling influence of what is termed good-breeding; and he practises so many petty deceptions, and affects so many generous sentiments, for the purposes of popularity, that it is difficult to distinguish his real from his artificial character. The Indian, on the contrary, free from the restraints and refinements of polished life, and, in a great degree, a solitary and independent being, obeys the impulses of his inclination or the dictates of his judgment; and thus the attributes of his nature, being freely indulged, grow singly great and striking. Society is like a lawn, where every roughness is smoothed, every bramble eradicated, and where the eye is delighted by the smiling verdure of a velvet surface; he, however, who would study nature in its wildness and variety, must plunge into the forest, must explore the glen, must stem the torrent, and dare the precipice.\n\nThese reflections arose on casually looking through a volume of early colonial history, wherein are recorded, with great bitterness, the outrages of the Indians, and their wars with the settlers of New England. It is painful to perceive, even from these partial narratives, how soon the white man moved to exterminate the idea, how soon the earth, how soon the coinage, was known.\n\nSuch was Philip, whose name is connected with Connecticut, whose temporary abode was at Wagansets, the place of the time of the first untought heart of human nature, the seat of their councils unknown. With his story and record traces on the dim twilight.\n\nWhen the Indians, their descendents of the World, from whom he was to the last, and that number of hardships; and the tribes; exposed to the vicissitude filled with doom, sinking into enthusiasm.\n\nassot, chief who reigned advantage of them from his seemed at once extended toward came early in attended by a league of peace promised to see\n\n* While correcting quoted English poet\npartial narratives, how the footsteps of civilization may be traced in the blood of the aborigines; how easily the colonists were moved to hostility by the lust of conquest; how merciless and exterminating was their warfare. The imagination shrinks at the idea, how many intellectual beings were hunted from the earth, how many brave and noble hearts, of nature's sterling coinage, were broken down and trampled in the dust!\n\nSuch was the fate of Philip of Pokanoket, an Indian warrior, whose name was once a terror throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut. He was the most distinguished of a number of contemporary Sachems who reigned over the Pequods, the Narragansets, the Wampanoags, and the other eastern tribes, at the time of the first settlement of New England; a band of native untaught heroes, who made the most generous struggle of which human nature is capable; fighting to the last gasp in the cause of their country, without a hope of victory or a thought of renown. Worthy of an age of poetry, and fit subjects for local story and romantic fiction, they have left scarcely any authentic traces on the page of history, but stalk, like gigantic shadows, in the dim twilight of tradition.*\n\nWhen the pilgrims, as the Plymouth settlers are called by their descendants, first took refuge on the shores of the New World, from the religious persecutions of the Old, their situation was to the last degree gloomy and disheartening. Few in number, and that number rapidly perishing away through sickness and hardships; surrounded by a howling wilderness and savage tribes; exposed to the rigours of an almost arctic winter, and the vicissitudes of an ever-shifting climate: their minds were filled with doleful forebodings, and nothing preserved them from sinking into despondency but the strong excitement of religious enthusiasm. In this forlorn situation they were visited by Massasoit, chief Sagamore of the Wampanoags, a powerful chief, who reigned over a great extent of country. Instead of taking advantage of the scanty number of the strangers, and expelling them from his territories, into which they had intruded, he seemed at once to conceive for them a generous friendship, and extended towards them the rites of primitive hospitality. He came early in the spring to their settlement of New Plymouth, attended by a mere handful of followers; entered into a solemn league of peace and amity; sold them a portion of the soil, and promised to secure for them the good-will of his savage allies.\n\n* While correcting the proof-sheets of this article, the author is informed that a celebrated English poet has nearly finished an heroic poem on the story of Philip of Pokanoket.\nWhatever may be said of Indian perfidy, it is certain that the integrity and good faith of Massasoit have never been impeached. He continued a firm and magnanimous friend of the white men; suffering them to extend their possessions, and to strengthen themselves in the land; and betraying no jealousy of their increasing power and prosperity. Shortly before his death, he came once more to New Plymouth, with his son Alexander, for the purpose of renewing the covenant of peace, and of securing it to his posterity.\n\nAt this conference he endeavoured to protect the religion of his forefathers from the encroaching zeal of the missionaries; and stipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his people from their ancient faith; but, finding the English obstinately opposed to any such condition, he mildly relinquished the demand. Almost the last act of his life was to bring his two sons, Alexander and Philip (as they had been named by the English), to the residence of a principal settler, recommending mutual kindness and confidence; and entreating that the same love and amity which had existed between the white men and himself might be continued afterwards with his children. The good old Sachem died in peace, and was happily gathered to his fathers before sorrow came upon his tribe; his children remained behind to experience the ingratitude of white men.\n\nHis eldest son, Alexander, succeeded him. He was of a quick and impetuous temper, and proudly tenacious of his hereditary rights and dignity. The intrusive policy and dictatorial conduct of the strangers excited his indignation; and he beheld with uneasiness their exterminating wars with the neighbouring tribes. He was doomed soon to incur their hostility, being accused of plotting with the Narragansets, to rise against the English and drive them from the land. It is impossible to say whether this accusation was warranted by facts, or was grounded on mere suspicions. It is evident, however, by the violent and overbearing measures of the settlers, that they had by this time begun to feel conscious of the rapid increase of their power, and to grow harsh and inconsiderate in their treatment of the natives. They despatched an armed force to seize upon Alexander, and to bring him before their courts. He was traced to his woodland haunts, and surprised at a hunting-house, where he was reposing with a band of his followers, unarmed, after the toils of the chase. The suddenness of his arrest, and the outrage offered to his sovereign dignity, so preyed upon the irascible feelings of this proud savage, as to throw him into a raging fever. He was permitted to return home, on condition of appearance, and there he reached his native spirit.\n\nThe success of the enterprise as he was carried away by ambition to seek new lands and enterprises, was not without apprehension. His plans were secret and inauspicious, and very probably he was considered the most dangerous who had previously been able to influence bands of his own countrymen to make incursions into territories still unoccupied by feeble, scattered tribes. What was originally intended for the nature of the enterprise? The settlers, relying on their superior numbers and positions of territory, supposed that the savage is never so weak as when which an injury has been done; facts are all too plain to show that to know that the Indians and white men were lorded over by these vagabonds in the wilderness.\n\nBut whatever may have been and his particular designs, they suppressed the Indians and the settlers, and re-established the power as it was called the right of dominion of the white man. The savage and indomitable spirit of Massasoit was at length broken by the eastern tribes, who, after a distant period of resistance, threw off the yoke of the oppressors again, and an era of peace and whites, that gave\nhome, on condition of sending his son as a pledge for his re-appearance; but the blow he had received was fatal, and before he reached his home he fell a victim to the agonies of a wounded spirit.\n\nThe successor of Alexander was Metamocet, or King Philip, as he was called by the settlers, on account of his lofty spirit and ambitious temper. These, together with his well-known energy and enterprise, had rendered him an object of great jealousy and apprehension, and he was accused of having always cherished a secret and implacable hostility towards the whites. Such may very probably, and very naturally, have been the case. He considered them as originally but mere intruders into the country, who had presumed upon indulgence, and were extending an influence baneful to savage life. He saw the whole race of his countrymen melting before them from the face of the earth; their territories slipping from their hands, and their tribes becoming feeble, scattered, and dependent. It may be said that the soil was originally purchased by the settlers; but who does not know the nature of Indian purchases, in the early period of colonization? The Europeans always made thrifty bargains through their superior adroitness in traffic; and they gained vast accessions of territory by easily-provoked hostilities. An uncultivated savage is never a nice inquirer into the refinements of law, by which an injury may be gradually and legally inflicted. Leading facts are all by which he judges; and it was enough for Philip to know that before the intrusion of the Europeans his countrymen were lords of the soil, and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their fathers.\n\nBut whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility, and his particular indignation at the treatment of his brother, he suppressed them for the present, renewed the contract with the settlers, and resided peaceably for many years at Pokanoket, or, as it was called by the English, Mount Hope,* the ancient seat of dominion of his tribe. Suspicion, however, which were at first vague and indefinite, began to acquire form and substance; and he was at length charged with attempting to instigate the various eastern tribes to rise at once, and, by a simultaneous effort, to throw off the yoke of their oppressors. It is difficult at this distant period to assign the proper credit due to these early accusations against the Indians. There was a proneness to suspicion, and an aptness to acts of violence, on the part of the whites, that gave weight and importance to every idle tale.\n\n* New Bristol, Rhode Island.\nInformers abounded where tale-bearing met with countenance and reward; and the sword was readily unsheathed when its success was certain, and it carved out empire.\n\nThe only positive evidence on record against Phillip is the accusation of one Sausaman, a renegado Indian, whose natural cunning had been quickened by a partial education which he had received among the settlers. He changed his faith and his allegiance two or three times, with a facility that evinced the looseness of his principles. He had acted for some time as Philip's confidential secretary and counsellor, and had enjoyed his bounty and protection. Finding, however, that the clouds of adversity were gathering round his patron, he abandoned his service and went over to the whites; and, in order to gain their favour, charged his former benefactor with plotting against their safety. A rigorous investigation took place. Phillip and several of his subjects submitted to be examined, but nothing was proved against them.\n\nThe settlers, however, had now gone too far to retract; they had previously determined that Phillip was a dangerous neighbour; they had publicly evinced their distrust; and had done enough to insure his hostility; according, therefore, to the usual mode of reasoning in these cases, his destruction had become necessary to their security. Sausaman, the treacherous informer, was shortly afterwards found dead in a pond, having fallen a victim to the vengeance of his tribe. Three Indians, one of whom was a friend and counsellor of Phillip, were apprehended and tried, and, on the testimony of one very questionable witness, were condemned and executed as murderers.\n\nThis treatment of his subjects, and ignominious punishment of his friend, outraged the pride and exasperated the passions of Phillip. The bolt which had fallen thus at his very feet awakened him to the gathering storm, and he determined to trust himself no longer in the power of the white men. The fate of his insulted and broken-hearted brother still rankled in his mind, and he had a further warning in the tragic story of Miantonomo, a great Sachem of the Narragansets, who, after manfully facing his accusers before a tribunal of the colonists, excusing himself from a charge of conspiracy, and receiving assurances of amity, had been perfidiously despatched at their instigation. Phillip, therefore, gathered his fighting men about him, persuaded all strangers that he could to join his cause, sent the women and children to the Narragansets for safety, and wherever he appeared was continually surrounded by armed warriors.\nWhen the two parties were thus in a state of distrust and irritation, the least spark was sufficient to set them in a flame. The Indians, having weapons in their hands, grew mischievous, and committed various petty depredations. In one of their maraudings a warrior was fired on and killed by a settler. This was the signal for open hostilities; the Indians pressed to revenge the death of their comrade, and the alarm of war resounded through the Plymouth colony.\n\nIn the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we meet with many indications of the diseased state of the public mind. The gloom of religious abstraction, and the wildness of their situation, among trackless forests and savage tribes, had disposed the colonists to superstitious fancies, and had filled their imaginations with the frightful chimeras of witchcraft and spectrology. They were much given also to a belief in omens. The troubles with Philip and his Indians were preceded, we are told, by a variety of those awful warnings which forerun great and public calamities. The perfect form of an Indian bow appeared in the air at New Plymouth, which was looked upon by the inhabitants as a \"prodigious apparition.\" At Hadley, Northampton, and other towns in their neighbourhood, was heard the report of a great piece of ordnance, with a shaking of the earth, and a considerable echo.* Others were alarmed on a still sunny morning by the discharge of guns and muskets; bullets seemed to whistle past them, and the noise of drums resounded in the air, seeming to pass away to the westward; others fancied that they heard the galloping of horses over their heads; and certain monstrous births which took place about the time, filled the superstitious in some towns with doleful forebodings. Many of these portentous sights and sounds may be ascribed to natural phenomena; to the northern lights which occur vividly in those latitudes; the meteors which explode in the air; the casual rushing of a blast through the top branches of the forest; the crash of fallen trees or disrupted rocks; and to those other unearthly sounds and echoes which will sometimes strike the ear so strangely amidst the profound stillness of woodland solitudes. These may have startled some melancholy imaginations, may have been exaggerated by the love for the marvellous, and listened to with that avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and mysterious. The universal currency of these superstitious fancies, and the grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day, are strongly characteristic of the times.\n\n* The Rev. Increase Mather's History.\nThe nature of the contest that ensued was such as too often distinguishes the warfare between civilized men and savages. On the part of the whites it was conducted with superior skill and success, but with a wastefulness of the blood, and a disregard of the natural rights of their antagonists; on the part of the Indians it was waged with the desperation of men fearless of death, and who had nothing to expect from peace but humiliation, dependence, and decay.\n\nThe events of the war are transmitted to us by a worthy clergyman of the time; who dwells with horror and indignation on every hostile act of the Indians, however justifiable, whilst he mentions with applause the most sanguinary atrocities of the whites. Philip is reviled as a murderer and a traitor, without considering that he was a true-born prince, gallantly fighting at the head of his subjects to avenge the wrongs of his family, to retrieve the tottering power of his line, and to deliver his native land from the oppression of usurping strangers.\n\nThe project of a wide and simultaneous revolt, if such had really been formed, was worthy of a spacious mind, and, had it not been prematurely discovered, might have been overwhelming in its consequences. The war that actually broke out was but a war of detail, a mere succession of casual exploits and unconnected enterprises. Still it sets forth the military genius and daring prowess of Philip; and wherever, in the prejudiced and passionate narrations that have been given of it, we can arrive at simple facts, we find him displaying a vigorous mind, a fertility of expedients, a contempt of suffering and hardship, and an unconquerable resolution, that command our sympathy and applause.\n\nDriven from his paternal domains at Mount Hope, he threw himself into the depths of those vast and trackless forests that skirted the settlements, and were almost impervious to anything but a wild beast or an Indian. Here he gathered together his forces, like the storm accumulating its stores of mischief in the bosom of the thunder-cloud, and would suddenly emerge at a time and place least expected, carrying havoc and dismay into the villages. There were now and then indications of these impending ravages, that filled the minds of the colonists with awe and apprehension. The report of a distant gun would perhaps be heard from the solitary woodland, where there was known to be no white man; the cattle which had been wandering in the woods would sometimes return home wounded; or an Indian or two would be seen lurking about the skirts of the forest, and suddenly disappearing; as the lightning will sometimes be seen playing silent games in the tempest.\n\nThough Philip was a wanderer, yet Pocasset was his toil, and, though he search or inquire quarter, lay hidden there were the greatest of New England perplexed with fear and mouldering in dubious hemlocks. But of these shaggy trees the white man was armed with the agility of Pocasset and his followers. They venture into the wilderness, perish in fens and marshes. They therefore build a fort, where Philip and his warriors may see, in the distance, behind; and escape of war among the country, and the way Philip beheld the mystery in which He was an event could foresee, and always be alert. The whole Philip seemed part of the wide scene took place, Philip's actions also were a deal in necromancy or prophetess, with charms and incantations also used upon that of the dreamer and the dreamer two would be seen lurking about the skirts of the forest, and suddenly disappearing; as the lightning will sometimes be seen playing silent games in the tempest.\nplaying silently about the edge of the cloud that is brewing up the tempest.\n\nThough sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the settlers, yet Philip as often escaped almost miraculously from their toils, and, plunging into the wilderness, would be lost to all search or inquiry, until he again emerged at some far distant quarter, laying the country desolate. Among his strongholds, were the great swamps or morasses, which extend in some parts of New England; composed of loose bogs of deep black mud; perplexed with thickets, brambles, rank weeds, the shattered and mouldering trunks of fallen trees, overshadowed by lugubrious hemlocks. The uncertain footing and the tangled mazes of these shaggy wilds, rendered them almost impracticable to the white man, though the Indian could thread their labyrinths with the agility of a deer. Into one of these, the great swamp of Pocasset Neck, was Philip once driven with a band of his followers. The English did not dare to pursue him, fearing to venture into these dark and frightful recesses, where they might perish in fens and miry pits, or be shot down by lurking foes. They therefore invested the entrance to the Neck, and began to build a fort, with the thought of starving out the foe; but Philip and his warriors wafted themselves on a raft over an arm of the sea, in the dead of night, leaving the women and children behind; and escaped away to the westward, kindling the flames of war among the tribes of Massachusetts and the Nipmuck country, and threatening the colony of Connecticut.\u2014In this way Philip became a theme of universal apprehension. The mystery in which he was enveloped exaggerated his real terrors. He was an evil that walked in darkness; whose coming none could foresee, and against which none knew when to be on the alert. The whole country abounded with rumours and alarms. Philip seemed almost possessed of ubiquity; for, in whatever part of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the forest took place, Philip was said to be its leader. Many superstitious notions also were circulated concerning him. He was said to deal in necromancy, and to be attended by an old Indian witch or prophetess, whom he consulted, and who assisted him by her charms and incantations. This indeed was frequently the case with Indian chiefs; either through their own credulity, or to act upon that of their followers; and the influence of the prophet and the dreamer over Indian superstition has been fully evidenced in recent cases of savage warfare.\n\nAt the time that Philip effected his escape from Pocasset, his\nfortunes were in a desperate condition. His forces had been thinned by repeated fights, and he had lost almost the whole of his resources. In this time of adversity he found a faithful friend in Canonchet, chief Sachem of all the Narragansets. He was the son and heir of Miantonomo, the great Sachem, who, as already mentioned, after an honourable acquittal of the charge of conspiracy, had been privately put to death at the perfidious instigations of the settlers. \"He was the heir,\" says the old chronicler, \"of all his father's pride and insolence, as well as of his malice towards the English;\"\u2014he certainly was the heir of his insults and injuries, and the legitimate avenger of his murder. Though he had forborne to take an active part in this hopeless war, yet he received Philip and his broken forces with open arms; and gave them the most generous countenance and support. This at once drew upon him the hostility of the English; and it was determined to strike a signal blow that should involve both the Sachems in one common ruin. A great force was, therefore, gathered together from Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut, and was sent into the Narraganset country in the depth of winter, when the swamps, being frozen and leafless, could be traversed with comparative facility, and would no longer afford dark and impenetrable fastnesses to the Indians.\n\nApprehensive of attack, Canonchet had conveyed the greater part of his stores, together with the old, the infirm, the women and children of his tribe, to a strong fortress; where he and Philip had likewise drawn up the flower of their forces. This fortress, deemed by the Indians impregnable, was situated upon a rising mound or kind of island, of five or six acres, in the midst of a swamp: it was constructed with a degree of judgment and skill vastly superior to what is usually displayed in Indian fortification, and indicative of the martial genius of these two chieftains.\n\nGuided by a renegade Indian, the English penetrated, through December snows, to this stronghold, and came upon the garrison by surprise. The fight was fierce and tumultuous. The assailants were repulsed in their first attack, and several of their bravest officers were shot down in the act of storming the fortress sword in hand. The assault was renewed with greater success. A lodgment was effected. The Indians were driven from one post to another. They disputed their ground inch by inch, fighting with the fury of despair. Most of their veterans were cut to pieces; and after a long and bloody battle, Philip and Canon-\nPHILIP OF POKANOKET.\n\nchet, with a handful of surviving warriors, retreated from the fort and took refuge in the thickets of the surrounding forest.\n\nThe victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort; the whole was soon in a blaze: many of the old men, the women, and the children, perished in the flames. This last outrage overcame even the stoicism of the savage. The neighboring woods resounded with the yells of rage and despair, uttered by the fugitive warriors, as they beheld the destruction of their dwellings, and heard the agonizing cries of their wives and offspring. \"The burning of the wigwams,\" says a contemporary writer, \"the shrieks and cries of the women and children, and the yelling of the warriors, exhibited a most horrible and affecting scene, so that it greatly moved some of the soldiers.\" The same writer cautiously adds, \"they were in much doubt then, and afterwards seriously inquired, whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with humanity, and the benevolent principles of the Gospel.\"\n\nThe fate of the brave and generous Canonchet is worthy of particular mention: the last scene of his life is one of the noblest instances on record of Indian magnanimity.\n\nBroken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat, yet faithful to his ally, and to the hapless cause which he had espoused, he rejected all overtures of peace, offered on condition of betraying Philip and his followers, and declared that \"he would fight it out to the last man, rather than become a servant to the English.\" His home being destroyed; his country harassed and laid waste by the incursions of the conquerors; he was obliged to wander away to the banks of the Connecticut; where he formed a rallying-point to the whole body of Western Indians, and laid waste several of the English settlements.\n\nEarly in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition, with only thirty chosen men, to penetrate to Seaconk, in the vicinity of Mount Hope, and to procure seed-corn to plant for the sustenance of his troops. This little band of adventurers had passed safely through the Pequod country, and were in the centre of the Narraganset, resting at some wigwams near Pautucket. However, when an alarm was given of an approaching enemy, leaving but seven men by him at the time, Canonchet despatched two of them to the top of a neighbouring hill, to bring intelligence of the foe.\n\nPanicking-struck by the appearance of a troop of English and Indians rapidly advancing, they fled in breathless terror past\n\n* MS. of the Rev. W. Baggot.\ntheir chieftain, without stopping to inform him of the danger. Canonchet sent another scout, who did the same. He then sent two more, one of whom, hurrying back in confusion and affright, told him that the whole British army was at hand. Canonchet saw there was no choice but immediate flight. He attempted to escape round the hill, but was perceived, and hotly pursued by the hostile Indians, and a few of the fleetest of the English. Finding the swiftest pursuer close upon his heels, he threw off, first his blanket, then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag, by which his enemies knew him to be Canonchet, and redoubled the eagerness of pursuit.\n\nAt length, in dashing through the river, his foot slipped upon a stone, and he fell so deep as to wet his gun. This accident so struck him with despair, that, as he afterwards confessed, \"his heart and his bowels turned within him, and he became like a rotten stick, void of strength.\"\n\nTo such a degree was he unnerved, that, being seized by a Pequot Indian within a short distance of the river, he made no resistance, though a man of great vigour of body and boldness of heart. But on being made prisoner, the whole pride of his spirit arose within him; and from that moment, we find, in the anecdotes given by his enemies, nothing but repeated flashes of elevated and prince-like heroism. Being questioned by one of the English who first came up with him, and who had not attained his twenty-second year, the proud-hearted warrior, looking with lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance, replied, \"You are a child\u2014you cannot understand matters of war\u2014let your brother or your chief come\u2014he will I answer.\"\n\nThough repeated offers were made to him of his life, on condition of submitting with his nation to the English, yet he rejected them with disdain, and refused to send any proposals of the kind to the great body of his subjects; saying, that he knew none of them would comply. Being reproached with his breach of faith towards the whites; his boast that he would not deliver up a Wampanoag nor the paring of a Wampanoag's nail; and his threat that he would burn the English alive in their houses, Philip, were betrayed; he disdained to justify himself, haughtily answering that others among them were as forward for the war as himself, and \"he desired to hear crossing a neighbor starved with cold and his friend, might have touched the feelings of the generous death, the brave; but Canonchet was an Indian; a being toward only cease from\nwhom war had no courtesy, humanity no law, religion no compassion\u2014he was condemned to die. The last words of his that are recorded, are worthy the greatness of his soul. When sentence of death was passed upon him, he observed \"that he liked it well, for he should die before his heart was soft, or he had spoken anything unworthy of himself.\" His enemies gave him the death of a soldier, for he was shot at Stoningham, by three young Sachems of his own rank.\n\nThe defeat at the Narragansett fortress, and the death of Canonchet, were fatal blows to the fortunes of King Philip. He made an ineffectual attempt to raise a head of war, by stirring up the Mohawks to take arms; but though possessed of the native talents of a statesman, his arts were counteracted by the superior arts of his enlightened enemies, and the terror of their warlike skill began to subdue the resolution of the neighbouring tribes. The unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped of power, and his ranks rapidly thinning around him. Some were abandoned by the whites; others fell victims to hunger and fatigue, and to the frequent attacks by which they were harassed. His stores were all captured; his chosen friends were swept away from before his eyes; his uncle was shot down by his side; his sister was carried into captivity; and in one of his narrow escapes he was compelled to leave his beloved wife and only son to the mercy of the enemy. \"His ruin,\" says the historian, \"being thus gradually carried on, his misery was not prevented, but augmented thereby; being himself made acquainted with the sense and experimental feeling of the captivity of his children, loss of friends, slaughter of his subjects, dismemberment of all family relations, and being stripped of all outward comforts, before his own life should be taken away.\"\n\nTo fill up the measure of his misfortunes, his own followers began to plot against his life, that by sacrificing him they might purchase dishonourable safety. Through treachery a number of faithful adherents, the subjects of Wetamoe, an Indian's mail; and niece of Pocasset, a near kinswoman and confederate of Philip, were betrayed into the hands of the enemy. Wetamoe, that other was among them at the time, and attempted to make her escape by crossing a neighbouring river; either exhausted by swimming, starved with cold and hunger, she was found dead and naked near the water side. But persecution ceased not at the grave. In the generation death, the refuge of the wretched, where the wicked coming toward only cease from troubling, was no protection to this outcast.\nfemale, whose great crime was affectionate fidelity to her kinsman and her friend. Her corpse was the object of unmanly and dastardly vengeance; the head was severed from the body and set upon a pole, and was thus exposed at Taunton, to the view of her captive subjects. They immediately recognized the features of their unfortunate queen, and were so affected at this barbarous spectacle, that we are told they broke forth into the \"most horrid and diabolical lamentations.\"\n\nHowever Philip had borne up against the complicated miseries and misfortunes that surrounded him, the treachery of his followers seemed to wring his heart and reduce him to despondency. It is said that \"he never rejoiced afterwards, nor had success in any of his designs.\" The spring of hope was broken\u2014the ardour of enterprise was extinguished\u2014he looked around, and all was danger and darkness; there was no eye to pity, nor any arm that could bring deliverance. With a scanty band of followers, who still remained true to his desperate fortunes, the unhappy Philip wandered back to the vicinity of Mount Hope, the ancient dwelling of his fathers. Here he lurked about, like a spectre, among the scenes of former power and prosperity, now bereft of home, of family, and friend. There needs no better picture of his destitute and piteous situation, than that furnished by the homely pen of the chronicler, who is unwarily enlisting the feelings of the reader in favour of the hapless warrior whom he reviles. \"Philip,\" he says, \"like a savage wild beast, having been hunted by the English forces through the woods, above a hundred miles backward and forward, at last was driven to his own den, upon Mount Hope, where he retired, with a few of his best friends, into a swamp, which proved but a prison to keep him fast till the messengers of death came by divine permission to execute vengeance upon him.\"\n\nEven in this last refuge of desperation and despair, a sullen grandeur gathers round his memory. We picture him to ourselves seated among his careworn followers, brooding in silence over his blasted fortunes, and acquiring a savage sublimity from the wildness and dreariness of his lurking-place. Defeated, but not dismayed\u2014crushed to the earth, but not humiliated\u2014he seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster, and to experience a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of bitterness. Little minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds rise above it. The very idea of submission awakened the fury of Philip, and he smote to death one of his followers, who\nproposed an expedient of peace. The brother of the victim made his escape, and in revenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain. A body of white men and Indians were immediately despatched to the swamp where Philip lay crouched, glaring with fury and despair. Before he was aware of their approach, they had begun to surround him. In a little while he saw five of his truest followers laid dead at his feet; all resistance was vain; he rushed forth from his covert, and made a headlong attempt to escape, but was shot through the heart by a renegade Indian of his own nation.\n\nSuch is the scanty story of the brave, but unfortunate King Philip: persecuted while living, slandered and dishonoured when dead. If, however, we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes furnished us by his enemies, we may perceive in them traces of amiable and lofty character, sufficient to awaken sympathy for his fate and respect for his memory. We find that, amidst all the harassing cares and ferocious passions of constant warfare, he was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love and paternal tenderness, and to the generous sentiment of friendship. The captivity of his \"beloved wife and only son\" are mentioned with exultation as causing him poignant misery; the death of any dear friend is triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities; but the treachery and desertion of many of his followers, in whose affections he had confided, is said to have desolated his heart, and to have bereaved him of all further comfort. He was a patriot attached to his native soil\u2014a prince true to his subjects, and indignant of their wrongs\u2014a soldier, daring in battle, firm in adversity, patient of fatigue, of hunger, of every variety of bodily suffering, and ready to perish in the cause he had espoused. Proud of heart, and with an untameable love of natural liberty, he preferred to enjoy it among the beasts of the forests or in the dismal and famished recesses of swamps and morasses, rather than bow his haughty spirit to submission, and be dependent and despised in the ease and luxury of the settlements. With heroic qualities and bold achievements, that would have graced a civilized warrior, and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian, he lived a wanderer and a fugitive in his native land, and went down, like a lonely bark wandering amid darkness and tempest\u2014without a pitying eye to weep his fall, or a friendly hand to record his struggle.\nJOHN BULL.\n\nAn old song, made by an aged old pate,\nOf an old worshipful gentleman, who had a great estate,\nThat kept a brave old house at a beautiful rate,\nAnd an old porter to relieve the poor at his gate.\nWith an old study fill'd full of learned old books,\nWith an old reverend chaplain, you might know him by his looks,\nWith an old buttery-hatch worn quite off the hooks,\nAnd an old kitchen that maintained half-a-dozen old cooks.\nLike an old curate, &c.\u2014Old Song.\n\nThere is no species of humour in which the English more excel, than that which consists in caricaturing and giving ludicrous appellations, or nicknames. In this way they have whimsically designated, not merely individuals, but nations; and, in their fondness for pushing a joke, they have not spared even themselves. One would think that, in personifying itself, a nation would be apt to picture something grand, heroic, and imposing; but it is characteristic of the peculiar humour of the English, and of their love for what is blunt, comic, and familiar, that they have embodied their national oddities in the figure of a sturdy, corpulent old fellow, with a three-cornered hat, red waistcoat, leather breeches, and stout oaken cudgel. Thus they have taken a singular delight in exhibiting their most private foibles in a laughable point of view; and have been so successful in their delineations, that there is scarcely a being in actual existence more absolutely present to the public mind than that eccentric personage, John Bull.\n\nPerhaps the continual contemplation of the character thus drawn of them has contributed to fix it upon the nation, and thus to give reality to what at first may have been painted in a great measure from the imagination. Men are apt to acquire peculiarities that are continually ascribed to them. The common orders of English seem wonderfully captivated with the idea which they have formed of John Bull, and endeavour to act up to the broad caricature that is perpetually before their eyes. Unluckily, they sometimes make their boasted Bullian an apology for their prejudice or grossness; and this I have especially noticed among those truly homebred and genuine sons of the soil who have never migrated beyond the sound of bells. If one of these should be a little uncouth in speech, and apt to utter impertinent truths, he confesses that he is a real John Bull, and always speaks his mind. If he now and then flies into an unreasonable burst of passion about trifles, he observes, that John Bull is a choleric old blade, but then his passion is over in a moment, and he bears no malice. If he\nbetray a coarseness of taste, and an insensibility to foreign refinements, he thanks Heaven for his ignorance\u2014he is a plain John Bull, and has no relish for frippery and niceties. His very proneness to be gulled by strangers, and to pay extravagantly for absurdities, is excused under the plea of munificence\u2014for John is always more generous than wise.\n\nThus, under the name of John Bull, he will contrive to argue every fault into a merit, and will frankly convict himself of being the honestest fellow in existence.\n\nHowever little, therefore, the character may have suited in the first instance, it has gradually adapted itself to the nation; or rather they have adapted themselves to each other; and a stranger who wishes to study English peculiarities, may gather much valuable information from the innumerable portraits of John Bull, as exhibited in the windows of the caricature-shops. Still, however, he is one of those fertile humorists, that are continually throwing out new portraits, and presenting different aspects from different points of view; and, often as he has been described, I cannot resist the temptation to give a slight sketch of him, such as he has met my eye.\n\nJohn Bull, to all appearance, is a plain, downright, matter-of-fact fellow, with much less of poetry about him than rich prose. There is little of romance in his nature, but a vast deal of strong natural feeling. He excels in humour more than in wit; is jolly rather than gay; melancholy rather than morose; can easily be moved to a sudden tear, or surprised into a broad laugh; but he loathes sentiment, and has no turn for light pleasantry. He is a boon companion, if you allow him to have his humour, and to talk about himself; and he will stand by a friend in a quarrel, with life and purse, however soundly he may be cudgelled.\n\nIn this last respect, to tell the truth, he has a propensity to be somewhat too ready. He is a busy-minded personage, who thinks not merely for himself and family, but for all the country round, and is most generously disposed to be everybody's champion. He is continually volunteering his services to settle his neighbour's affairs, and takes it in great dudgeon if they engage in any matter of consequence without asking his advice; though he seldom engages in any friendly office of the kind without finishing by getting into a squabble with all parties, and then railing bitterly at their ingratitude. He unluckily took lessons in his youth in the noble science of defence, and having accomplished himself in the use of his limbs and his weapons, and become a perfect master at boxing and cudgel-play, he has had a trouble-\nsome life of it ever since. He cannot hear of a quarrel between the most distant of his neighbours, but he begins incontinently to fumble with the head of his cudgel, and consider whether his interest or honour does not require that he should meddle in the broil. Indeed, he has extended his relations of pride and policy so completely over the whole country, that no event can take place without infringing some of his finely-spun rights and dignities. Couched in his little domain, with these filaments stretching forth in every direction, he is like some choleric, bottle-bellied old spider, who has woven his web over a whole chamber, so that a fly cannot buzz, nor a breeze blow, without startling his repose, and causing him to sally forth wrathfully from his den.\n\nThough really a good-hearted, good-tempered old fellow at bottom, yet he is singularly fond of being in the midst of contention. It is one of his peculiarities, however, that he only relishes the beginning of an affray; he always goes into a fight with alacrity, but comes out of it grumbling even when victorious; and though no one fights with more obstinacy to carry a contested point, yet, when the battle is over, and he comes to the reconciliation, he is so much taken up with the mere shaking of hands, that he is apt to let his antagonist pocket all that they have been quarrelling about. It is not, therefore, fighting that he ought so much to be on his guard against, as making friends. It is difficult to cudgel him out of a farthing; but put him in a good humour, and you may bargain him out of all the money in his pocket. He is like a stout ship, which will weather the roughest storm uninjured, but roll its masts overboard in the succeeding calm.\n\nHe is a little fond of playing the magnifico abroad; of pulling out a long purse; flinging his money bravely about at boxing-matches, horse-races, cock-fights, and carrying a high head among \"gentlemen of the fancy:\" but immediately after one of these fits of extravagance, he will be taken with violent qualms of economy; stop short at the most trivial expenditure; talk desperately of being ruined and brought upon the parish; and in such moods will not pay the smallest tradesman's bill without violent altercation. He is, in fact, the most punctual and discontented paymaster in the world; drawing his coin out of his breeches pocket with infinite reluctance; paying to the uttermost farthing, but accompanying every guinea with a growl.\n\nWith all his talk of economy, however, he is a bountiful provider, and a hospitable housekeeper. His economy is of a whimsical kind, its chief object being to devise how he may affordance that man\nto be extravagant; for he will begrudge himself a beefsteak and pint of port one day, that he may roast an ox whole, broach a hogshead of ale, and treat all his neighbours on the next.\n\nHis domestic establishment is enormously expensive: not so much from any great outward parade, as from the great consumption of solid beef and pudding; the vast number of followers he feeds and clothes; and his singular disposition to pay hugely for small services. He is a most kind and indulgent master, and, provided his servants humour his peculiarities, flatter his vanity a little now and then, and do not peculate grossly on him before his face, they may manage him to perfection. Everything that lives on him seems to thrive and grow fat. His house-servants are well paid and pampered, and have little to do. His horses are sleek and lazy, and prance slowly before his state carriage; and his house-dogs sleep quietly about the door, and will hardly at a house-breaker.\n\nThe family mansion is an old castellated manor-house, gray with age, and of a most venerable, though weather-beaten appearance. It has been built upon no regular plan, but is a vast accumulation of parts, erected in various tastes and ages. The centre bears evident traces of Saxon architecture, and is as solid as ponderous stone and old English oak can make it. Like all the relics of that style, it is full of obscure passages, intricate naves, and dusky chambers; and though these have been partially lighted up in modern days, yet there are many places where you must still grope in the dark. Additions have been made to the original edifice from time to time, and great alterations have taken place; towers and battlements have been erected during wars and tumults; wings built in time of peace; and outhouses, lodges, and offices, run up according to the whim or convenience of different generations, until it has become one of the most spacious, rambling tenements imaginable. An entire wing is taken up with the family chapel, a reverend pile, that must have cost a fortune; tall, been exceedingly sumptuous, and, indeed, in spite of having been parish; and altered and simplified at various periods, has still a look of solemn religious pomp. Its walls within are storied with the usual and distinguished monuments of John's ancestors; and it is snugly fitted up with fine out of his best cushions and well-lined chairs, where such of his family as are inclined to church services, may doze comfortably in the discharge of their duties.\n\nTo keep up this chapel has cost John much money; but he is a bountiful economy is of attach in his religion, and piqued in his zeal, from the circumstance that many dissenting chapels have been erected in his\nvicinity, and several of his neighbours, with whom he has had quarrels, are strong papists.\n\nTo do the duties of the chapel, he maintains, at a large expense, a pious and portly family chaplain. He is a most learned and decorous personage, and a truly well-bred Christian, who always backs the old gentleman in his opinions, winks discreetly at his little peccadilloes, rebukes the children when refractory, and is of great use in exhorting the tenants to read their bibles, say their prayers, and, above all, to pay their rents punctually, and without grumbling.\n\nThe family apartments are in a very antiquated taste, somewhat heavy, and often inconvenient, but full of the solemn magnificence of former times; fitted up with rich, though faded tapestry, unwieldy furniture, and loads of massy gorgeous plate. The vast fireplaces, ample kitchens, extensive cellars, and sumptuous banqueting-halls, all speak of the roaring hospitality of days of yore, of which the modern festivity at the manor-house is but a shadow. There are, however, complete suites of rooms apparently deserted and time-worn; and towers and turrets that are tottering to decay; so that in high wind there is danger of their tumbling about the ears of the household.\n\nJohn has frequently been advised to have the old edifice thoroughly overhauled; and to have some of the useless parts pulled down, and the others strengthened with their materials; but the old gentleman always grows testy on this subject. He swears the house is an excellent house\u2014that it is tight and weather-proof, and not to be shaken by tempests\u2014that it has stood for several hundred years, and therefore is not likely to tumble down now\u2014that as to its being inconvenient, his family is accustomed to the inconveniences, and would not be comfortable without them\u2014that as to its unwieldy size and irregular construction, these result from its being the growth of centuries and being improved by the wisdom of every generation\u2014that an old family, like his, requires a large house to dwell in; new upstart families may live in modern cottages and snug boxes, but an old English family should inhabit an old English manor-house. If you point out any part of the building as superfluous, he insists that it is material to the strength or decoration of the rest, and the harmony of the whole; and swears that the parts are so built into each other, that if you pull down one, you run the risk of having the whole about your ears.\n\nThe secret of the matter is, that John has a great disposition of the family.\nto protect and patronize. He thinks it indispensable to the dignity of an ancient and honourable family, to be bounteous in its appointments, and to be eaten up by dependants; and so, partly from pride and partly from kind-heartedness, he makes it a rule always to give shelter and maintenance to his superannuated servants.\n\nThe consequence is, that, like many other venerable family establishments, his manor is encumbered by old retainers whom he cannot turn off, and an old style which he cannot lay down. His mansion is like a great hospital of invalids, and, with all its magnitude, is not a whit too large for its inhabitants. Not a nook or corner but is of use in housing some useless personage. Groups of veteran beef-eaters, gouty pensioners, and retired heroes of the buttery and the larder, are seen lolling about its walls, crawling over its lawns, dozing under its trees, or sunning themselves upon the benches at its doors. Every office and out-house is garrisoned by these supernumeraries and their families; for they are amazingly prolific, and when they die off, are sure to leave John a legacy of hungry mouths to be provided for. A mattock cannot be struck against the most mouldering tumble-down tower, but out pops, from some cranny or loop-hole, the gray pate of some superannuated hanger-on, who has lived at John's expense all his life, and makes the most grievous outcry at their pulling down the roof from over the head of a worn-out servant of the family. This is an appeal that John's honest heart never can withstand; so that a man, who has faithfully eaten his beef and pudding all his life, is sure to be rewarded with a pipe and tankard in his old days.\n\nA great part of his park, also, is turned into paddocks, where his broken-down chargers are turned loose to graze undisturbed for the remainder of their existence\u2014a worthy example of grateful recollection, which, if some of his neighbours were to imitate, would not be to their discredit. Indeed, it is one of his greatest pleasures to point out these old steeds to his visitors, to dwell on their good qualities, extol their past services, and boast, with some little vainglory, of the perilous adventures and hardy exploits through which they have carried him.\n\nHe is given, however, to indulge his veneration for family superstitions, and family incumbencies, to a whimsical extent. His manor is infested by gangs of gipsies; yet he will not suffer them to be driven off, because they have infested the place time out of mind, and been regular poachers upon every generation of the family. He will scarcely permit a dry branch to be lopped\nfrom the great trees that surround the house, lest it should molest the rooks, that have bred there for centuries. Owls have taken possession of the dovecote; but they are hereditary owls, and must not be disturbed. Swallows have nearly choked up every chimney with their nests; martins build in every frieze and cornice; crows flutter about the towers, and perch on every weathercock; and old gray-headed rats may be seen in every quarter of the house, running in and out of their holes undauntedly in broad daylight. In short, John has such a reverence for everything that has been long in the family, that he will not hear even of abuses being reformed, because they are good old family abuses.\n\nAll these whims and habits have concurred woefully to drain the old gentleman's purse; and as he prides himself on punctuality on money matters, and wishes to maintain his credit in the neighbourhood, they have caused him great perplexity in meeting his engagements. This, too, has been increased by the altercations and heart-burnings which are continually taking place in his family. His children have been brought up to different callings, and are of different ways of thinking; and as they have always been allowed to speak their minds freely, they do not fail to exercise the privilege most clamorously in the present posture of his affairs. Some stand up for the honour of the race, and are clear that the old establishment should be kept up in all its state, whatever may be the cost; others, who are more prudent and considerate, entreat the old gentleman to retrench his expenses, and to put his whole system of housekeeping on a more moderate footing. He has, indeed, at times, seemed inclined to listen to their opinions, but their wholesome advice has been completely defeated by the obstreperous conduct of one of his sons. This is a noisy, rattle-pated fellow, of rather low habits, who neglects his business to frequent ale-houses\u2014is the orator of village clubs, and a complete oracle among the poorest of his father's tenants. No sooner does he hear any of his brothers mention reform or retrenchment, than up he jumps, takes the words out of their mouths, and roars out for an overturn. When his tongue is once going, nothing can stop it. He rants about the room; hectors the old man about his spendthriftismself. Instead practices; ridicules his tastes and pursuits; insists that he shall turn the old servants out of doors; give the broken-down horse and shrunk as a to the hounds; send the fat chaplain packing, and take a field preacher in his place\u2014nay, that the whole family mansion shall be levelled with the ground, and a plain one of brick and mortar built in its place. Family festivities whenever an occasion complaining of his father's extravagance runs up to spend all his estate. It may be remembered with the old gentleman, irritable, from the effects of trenchment or the tavern oracle, paternal discipline, they have frequently run so high, that John, the officer who has been sent on half-pay. The right or wrong of life; and is ready to overturn the orator's external authority. These family squabbles are food for some to look wise, and others to be provoked. They are represented; his extravagance, and he is more dabbling with money. Old gentleman, never knew anything of swelling, and perhaps very fine one, and yet all that, they have never been known. What is worse, harassments and practices; ridicule his taste and pursuits; insist that he shall turn the old servants out of doors; give the broken-down horse and shrunk as a to the hounds; send the fat chaplain packing, and take a field preacher in his place\u2014nay, that the whole family mansion shall be levelled with the ground, and a plain one of brick and mortar built in its place.\nbuilt in its place. He rails at every social entertainment and family festivity, and skulks away growling to the ale-house whenever an equipage drives up to the door. Though constantly complaining of the emptiness of his purse, yet he scruples not to spend all his pocket-money in these tavern convocations, and even runs up scores for the liquor, over which he preaches about his father's extravagance.\n\nIt may be readily imagined how little such thwarting agrees with the old cavalier's fiery temperament. He has become so irritable, from repeated crossings, that the mere mention of retrenchment or reform is a signal for a brawl between him and the tavern oracle. As the latter is too sturdy and refractory for paternal discipline, having grown out of all fear of the cudgel, they have frequent scenes of wordy warfare, which at times run so high, that John is fain to call in the aid of his son Tom, an officer who has served abroad, but is at present living at home, on half-pay. This last is sure to stand by the old gentleman, right or wrong; likes nothing so much as a racketing, roistering life; and is ready at a wink or nod, to out sabre, and flourish it over the orator's head, if he dares to array himself against paternal authority.\n\nThese family dissensions, as usual, have got abroad, and are rare food for scandal in John's neighbourhood. People begin to look wise, and shake their heads, whenever his affairs are mentioned. They all \"hope that matters are not so bad with him as represented;\" but when a man's own children begin to rail at his extravagance, things must be badly managed. They understand he is mortgaged over head and ears, and is continually dabbling with money-lenders. He is certainly an open-handed old gentleman, but they fear he has lived too fast; indeed, they never knew any good come of this fondness for hunting, racing, travelling, and prize-fighting. In short, Mr. Bull's estate is a very fine one, and has been in the family a long while; but, for all that, they have known many finer estates come to the hammer.\"\n\nWhat is worst of all, is the effect which these pecuniary embarrassments and domestic feuds have had on the poor man himself. Instead of that jolly round corporation, and snug rosy face, which he used to present, he has of late become as shrivelled down horses and shrunk as a frost-bitten apple. His scarlet gold-laced waistcoat, which bellied out so bravely in those prosperous days when the mansion shall be sailed before the wind, now hangs loosely about him like a and mortar remainsail in a calm. His leather breeches are all in folds and\nwrinkles, and apparently have much ado to hold up the boots\nthat yawn on both sides of his once sturdy legs.\n\nInstead of strutting about as formerly, with his three-cornered\nhat on one side; flourishing his cudgel, and bringing it down\nevery moment with a hearty thump upon the ground; looking\nevery one sturdily in the face, and trolling out a stave of a catch\nor a drinking song; he now goes about whistling thoughtfully to\nhimself, with his head drooping down, his cudgel tucked under\nhis arm, and his hands thrust to the bottom of his breeches\npockets, which are evidently empty.\n\nSuch is the plight of honest John Bull at present; yet for all\nthis the old fellow's spirit is as tall and as gallant as ever. If\nyou drop the least expression of sympathy or concern, he takes\nfire in an instant; swears that he is the richest and stoutest\nfellow in the country; talks of laying out large sums to adorn\nhis house or buy another estate; and with a valiant swagger and\ngrasping of his cudgel, longs exceedingly to have another bout at\nquarter-staff.\n\nThough there may be something rather whimsical in all this,\nyet I confess I cannot look upon John's situation without strong\nfeelings of interest. With all his odd humours and obstinate\nprejudices, he is a sterling-hearted old blade. He may not be\nso wonderfully fine a fellow as he thinks himself, but he is at\nleast twice as good as his neighbours represent him. His virtues\nare all his own; all plain, homebred, and unaffected. His very\nfaults smack of the raciness of his good qualities. His extravagance savours of his generosity; his quarrelsomeness, of his\ncourage; his credulity, of his open faith; his vanity, of his pride;\nand his bluntness, of his sincerity. They are all the redundancies\nof a rich and liberal character. He is like his old oak, rough\nwithout, but sound and solid within; whose bark abounds with\nexcrencences in proportion to the growth and grandeur of the\ntimber; and whose branches make a fearful groaning and mur-\nmuring in the least storm, from their very magnitude and\nluxuriance. There is something, too, in the appearance of his\nold family mansion that is extremely poetical and picturesque;\nand, as long as it can be rendered comfortably habitable, I should\nalmost tremble to see it meddled with, during the present conflict\nof tastes and opinions. Some of his advisers are no doubt good\narchitects, that might be of service; but many, I fear, are more\nlovers, who, when they had once got to work with their mat-\ntocks on this venerable edifice, would never stop until they had\nbrought it to the ground, and perhaps buried themselves among\nthe ruins. All that\nhim more prude\nmind about other\nattempt to p\nhappiness or\nremain quietly\ncultivate his r\ncome\u2014if he th\n\u2014 if he can; re\nenjoy, on h\nerry old age.\n\nIn the course of\nEngland, I had\nthrough the more\nafternoon at a vil\nand retired. The\ninhabitants, not t\neach-roads. I d\nan early d\nmy ramble, as\nchurch, where\nit was al\ncompletely overru\ntrees, an angle\npeered thro\nmorning.

There was an air of primitive simplicity about its inhabitants, not to be found in the villages which lie on the great roads. His virtues. I determined to pass the night there, and, having taken an early dinner, strolled out to enjoy the neighbouring scenery.\n\nMy ramble, as is usually the case with travellers, soon led me to the church, which stood at a little distance from the village. Indeed, it was an object of some curiosity, its old tower being completely overrun with ivy, so that only here and there a jutting bounds with buttress, an angle of gray wall, or a fantastically carved ornament of the spire, peered through the verdant covering. It was a lovely sight and marvellous. The early part of the day had been dark and showery, but in the afternoon it had cleared up; and though sullen clouds still hung overhead, yet there was a broad tract of golden sky picturesque in the west, from which the setting sun gleamed through the leaves, and lit up all nature into a melancholy smile. Present confusion seemed like the parting hour of a good Christian, smiling on his doubt gone, sins and sorrows of the world, and giving, in the serenity of his heart, an assurance that he will rise again in glory.\n\nI had seated myself on a half-sunken tombstone, and was until they began, as one is apt to do at this sober-thoughted hour, on past\nscenes and early friends\u2014on those who were distant and those who were dead\u2014and indulging in that kind of melancholy fancying which has in it something sweeter even than pleasure. Every now and then the stroke of a bell from the neighbouring tower fell on my ear; its tones were in unison with the scene, and, instead of jarring, chimed in with my feelings; and it was some time before I recollected that it must be tolling the knell of some new tenant of the tomb.\n\nPresently I saw a funeral train moving across the village green: it wound slowly along a lane; was lost, and re-appeared through the breaks of the hedges, until it passed the place where I was sitting. The pall was supported by young girls, dressed in white; and another, about the age of seventeen, walked before, bearing a chaplet of white flowers; a token that the deceased was a young and unmarried female. The corpse was followed by the parents. They were a venerable couple, of the better order of peasantry. The father seemed to repress his feelings; but his fixed eye, contracted brow, and deeply-furrowed face, showed the struggle that was passing within. His wife hung on his arm, and wept aloud with the convulsive bursts of a mother's sorrow.\n\nI followed the funeral into the church. The bier was placed in the centre aisle, and the chaplet of white flowers, with a pair of white gloves, were hung over the seat which the deceased had occupied.\n\nEvery one knows the soul-subduing pathos of the funeral service; for who is so fortunate as never to have followed some one he has loved to the tomb? but when performed over the remains of innocence and beauty, thus laid low in the bloom of existence\u2014what can be more affecting? At that simple, but most solemn consignment of the body to the grave\u2014\"Earth to earth\u2014ashes to ashes\u2014dust to dust!\"\u2014the tears of the youthful companions of the deceased flowed unrestrained. The father still seemed to struggle with his feelings, and to comfort himself with the assurance that the dead are blessed which die in the Lord; but the mother only thought of her child as a flower of the field cut down and withered in the midst of its sweetness; she was like Rachel, \"mourning over her children, and would not be comforted.\"\n\nOn returning to the inn, I learned the whole story of the deceased. It was a simple one, and such as has often been told. She had been the beauty and pride of the village. Her father had once been an opulent farmer, but was reduced in circumstances. This was an only child, and brought up entirely at home, in the quiet of the village. The good man was limited, and he only sought not to raise his parents, and fostered a native plant with the frankness of tender plants among natives of the soil.\n\nThe superintendents and her companions were an unassuming lot, whom might be trusted.\n\nThe village, however, retain some of its old festivals and observances of the past, which have been promoted by the customs, and the mission fulfilled for mankind. Up to last year, in the month of May, decorated with garlands, the May wand, games, sports, and dances, the situation of the village would often appear as on one May-day, when recently quartered there, the native took part, all, with the ladies of the village fair, dancing and smiling, and delighting to make her acquaintance; and which young people\nhome, in the simplicity of rural life. She had been the pupil of the village pastor, the favourite lamb of his little flock. The good man watched over her education with paternal care; it was limited, and suitable to the sphere in which she was to move; for he only sought to make her an ornament to her station in life, not to raise her above it. The tenderness and indulgence of her parents, and the exemption from all ordinary occupations, had fostered a natural grace and delicacy of character that accorded with the fragile loveliness of her form. She appeared like some tender plant of the garden, blooming accidentally amid the hardier natives of the fields.\n\nThe superiority of her charms was felt and acknowledged by her companions, but without envy; for it was surpassed by the unassuming gentleness and winning kindness of her manners. It might be truly said of her:\n\n\"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\nRan on the greenward; nothing she does or seems\nBut smacks of something greater than herself;\nToo noble for this place.\"\n\nThe village was one of those sequestered spots, which still retain some vestiges of old English customs. It had its rural festivals and holiday pastimes, and still kept up some faint observance of the once popular rites of May. These, indeed, had been promoted by its present pastor, who was a lover of old customs, and one of those simple Christians that think their mission fulfilled by promoting joy on earth and good-will among mankind. Under his auspices the May-pole stood from year to year, in the centre of the village green; on May-day it was decorated with garlands and streamers; and a queen or lady of the May was appointed, as in former times, to preside at the sports, and distribute the prizes and rewards. The picturesque situation of the village, and the fancifulness of its rustic f\u00eates, would often attract the notice of casual visitors. Among these, on one May-day, was a young officer, whose regiment had been recently quartered in the neighbourhood. He was charmed with the native taste that pervaded this village pageant; but, above all, with the dawning loveliness of the queen of May. It was the village favourite, who was crowned with flowers, and blushing and smiling in all the beautiful confusion of girlish diffidence and delight. The artlessness of rural habits enabled him readily to make her acquaintance; he gradually won his way into her intimacy; and paid his court to her in that unthinking way in which young officers are too apt to trifle with rustic simplicity.\nThere was nothing in his advances to startle or alarm. He never even talked of love; but there are modes of making it more eloquent than language, and which convey it subtilely and irresistibly to the heart. The beam of the eye, the tone of voice, the thousand tenderesses which emanate from every word, and look, and action\u2014these form the true eloquence of love, and can always be felt and understood, but never described. Can we wonder that they should readily win a heart, young, guileless, and susceptible? As to her, she loved almost unconsciously; she scarcely inquired what was the growing passion that was absorbing every thought and feeling, or what were to be its consequences. She, indeed, looked not to the future. When present, his looks and words occupied her whole attention; when absent, she thought but of what had passed at their recent interview. She would wander with him through the green lanes and rural scenes of the vicinity. He taught her to see new beauties in nature; he talked in the language of polite and cultivated life, and breathed into her ear the witcheries of romance and poetry.\n\nPerhaps there could not have been a passion, between the sexes, more pure than this innocent girl's. The gallant figure of her youthful admirer, and the splendour of his military attire, might at first have charmed her eye; but it was not these that had captivated her heart. Her attachment had something in it of idolatry. She looked up to him as to a being of a superior order. She felt in his society the enthusiasm of a mind naturally delicate and poetical, and now first awakened to a keen perception of the beautiful and grand. Of the sordid distinctions of rank and fortune she thought nothing; it was the difference of intellect, of demeanour, of manners, from those of the rustic society to which she had been accustomed, that elevated him in her opinion. She would listen to him with charmed ear and downcast look of mute delight, and her cheek would mantle with enthusiasm; or if ever she ventured a shy glance of timid admiration, it was as quickly withdrawn, and she would sigh and blush at the idea of her comparative unworthiness.\n\nHer lover was equally impassioned; but his passion was mingled with feelings of a coarser nature. He had begun the connection in levity; for he had often heard his brother officers boast of their village conquests, and thought some triumph of the kind necessary to his reputation as a man of spirit. But he was too full of youthful fervour. His heart had not yet been rendered sufficiently cold and selfish by a wandering and a dissipated life; it caught fire from the very flame it sought to kindle; and before he was really in love.\n\nWhat was it that incessantly opposed him\u2014the prejudice, the pride, the proud and unyielding vanity\u2014but that which was tender and compassionate, kindness in heart, which swayed down even his soul himself by a power to chill the gay levity with which whenever he thought that mysterious hallowed sphere.\n\nThe sudden continent came on, and a short time interval assisted to commit him at hand; where evening rambles.\n\nThe idea of death broke in at once as a sudden and the simplicity of a tear from her eyes there are moments to hallow the calmness and the sight of confidence of however, all cannot to propose that of his fortunes.\n\nHe was quite at his own back, victim, that she was and why she was of her parents' upon her pure\u2014she did not but she shrank\nbefore he was aware of the nature of his situation he became really in love.\n\nWhat was he to do? There were the old obstacles which so incessantly occur in these heedless attachments. His rank in life\u2014the prejudices of titled connections\u2014his dependence upon a proud and unyielding father\u2014all forbade him to think of matrimony\u2014but when he looked down upon this innocent being, so tender and confiding, there was a purity in her manners, a blamelessness in her life, and a beseeching modesty in her looks, that swayed every licentious feeling. In vain did he try to fortify himself by a thousand heartless examples of race of fashion; and to chill the glow of generous sentiment, with that cold derisive levity with which he had heard them talk of female virtue: whenever he came into her presence, she was still surrounded by that mysterious but impassive charm of virgin purity in whose hallowed sphere no guilty thought can live.\n\nThe sudden arrival of orders for the regiment to repair to the continent completed the confusion of his mind. He remained for a short time in a state of the most painful irresolution; he hesitated to communicate the tidings, until the day for marching was at hand; when he gave her the intelligence in the course of an evening ramble.\n\nThe idea of parting had never before occurred to her. It broke in at once upon her dreams of felicity; she looked upon it as a sudden and insurmountable evil, and wept with the guileless simplicity of a child. He drew her to his bosom, and kissed the tears from her soft cheek; nor did he meet with a repulse, for there are moments of mingled sorrow and tenderness which hallow the caresses of affection. He was naturally impetuous; and the sight of beauty, apparently yielding in his arms, the confidence of his power over her, and the dread of losing her forever, all conspired to overwhelm his better feelings\u2014he ventured to propose that she should leave her home, and be the companion of his fortunes.\n\nHe was quite a novice in seduction, and blushed and faltered at his own baseness; but so innocent of mind was his intended victim, that she was at first at a loss to comprehend his meaning; and why she should leave her native village, and the humble roof of her parents. When at last the nature of his proposal flashed upon her pure mind, the effect was withering. She did not weep\u2014she did not break forth into reproach\u2014she said not a word\u2014but she shrank back aghast as from a viper; gave him a look of\nanguish that pierced to his very soul; and, clasping her hands in agony, fled, as if for refuge, to her father's cottage.\n\nThe officer retired, confounded, humiliated, and repentant. It is uncertain what might have been the result of the conflict of his feelings, had not his thoughts been diverted by the bustle of departure. New scenes, new pleasures, and new companions, soon dissipated his self-reproach, and stifled his tenderness; yet, amidst the stir of camps, the revelries of garrisons, the array of armies, and even the din of battles, his thoughts would sometimes steal back to the scenes of rural quiet and village simplicity\u2014the white cottage\u2014the footpath along the silver brook and up the hawthorn hedge, and the little village maid loitering along it, leaning on his arm, and listening to him with eyes beaming with unconscious affection.\n\nThe shock which the poor girl had received, in the destruction of all her ideal world, had indeed been cruel. Faintings and hysterics had at first shaken her tender frame, and were succeeded by a settled and pining melancholy. She had beheld from her window the march of the departing troops. She had seen her faithless lover borne off, as if in triumph, amidst the sound of drum and trumpet and the pomp of arms. She strained a last aching gaze after him, as the morning sun glittered about his figure, and his plume waved in the breeze; he passed away like a bright vision from her sight, and left her all in darkness.\n\nIt would be trite to dwell on the particulars of her after-story. It was, like other tales of love, melancholy. She avoided society, and wandered out alone in the walks she had most frequented with her lover. She sought, like the stricken deer, to weep in silence and loneliness, and brood over the barbed sorrow that rankled in her soul. Sometimes she would be seen late of an evening sitting in the porch of the village church; and the milk-maids, returning from the fields, would now and then overhear her singing some plaintive ditty in the hawthorn walk. She became fervent in her devotions at church; and as the old people saw her approach, so wasted away, yet with a hectic gloom, and that hallowed air which melancholy diffuses round the form, they would make way for her, as for something spiritual, and, looking after her, would shake their heads in gloomy foreboding.\n\nShe felt a conviction that she was hastening to the tomb, but looked forward to it as a place of rest. The silver cord that had bound her to existence was loosed, and there seemed to be no more pleasure under the sun. If ever her gentle bosom had entertained\n\nShe was inclosed in a denuded tenderness, couched in the simplicity. Her ideal from her mind depicted the scene with saying, \"I give him her forgiveness.\"\n\nBy degrees she would leave the cottage, propped up by the look out upon the world imparted to her by it. She never ever raised her head on her pillow, her parents hung on her hopes, still fresh and flushed her cheeks.\n\nIn this way she died soon; her heart closed open, and the leaves of the clusters fell down round the window.\n\nHer father, when he spoke of the time when it seemed to be her bosom. Her mother's bell had tolled, and she lagging into death, her hallowed stillness, her gazing on her face, her pass so rough, the image of a seraph's face, while thinking of her, she looked to that distant spot where gathered?\n\nSuddenly the sound came to the cottage, and the girl gave a faint exclamation. The repentant lover came to her to his bosom.\nentertained resentment against her lover, it was extinguished. She was incapable of angry passions; and, in a moment of sudden tenderness, she penned him a farewell letter. It was couched in the simplest language, but touching from its very simplicity. She told him that she was dying, and did not conceal from him that his conduct was the cause. She even depicted the sufferings which she had experienced; but concluded with saying, that she could not die in peace until she had sent him her forgiveness and her blessing.\n\nBy degrees her strength so declined, that she could no longer leave the cottage. She could only totter to the window, where, propped up in her chair, it was her enjoyment to sit all day and look out upon the landscape. Still she uttered no complaint, nor imparted to any one the malady that was preying on her heart. She never even mentioned her lover's name: but would lay her head on her mother's bosom and weep in silence. Her poor parents hung, in mute anxiety, over this fading blossom of their hopes, still flattering themselves that it might again revive to freshness, and that the bright unearthly bloom which sometimes flushed her cheek might be the promise of returning health.\n\nIn this way she was seated between them one Sunday afternoon; her hands were clasped in theirs, the lattice was thrown open, and the soft air that stole in brought with it the fragrance of the clustering honeysuckle which her own hands had trained round the window.\n\nHer father had just been reading a chapter in the Bible: it spoke of the vanity of worldly things, and of the joys of heaven: it seemed to have diffused comfort and serenity through her bosom. Her eye was fixed on the distant village church; the bell had tolled for the evening service; the last villager was lagging into the porch; and everything had sunk into that hallowed stillness peculiar to the day of rest. Her parents were gazing on her with yearning hearts. Sickness and sorrow, which pass so roughly over some faces, had given to hers the expression of a seraph's. A tear trembled in her soft blue eye.\u2014Was she thinking of her faithless lover?\u2014or were her thoughts wandering to that distant churchyard, into whose bosom she might soon be gathered?\n\nSuddenly the clang of hoofs was heard\u2014a horseman galloped to the cottage\u2014he dismounted before the window\u2014the poor girl gave a faint exclamation, and sank back in her chair: it was her repentant lover! He rushed into the house, and flew to clasp her to his bosom; but her wasted form\u2014her deathlike com-\ntenance\u2014so wan, yet so lovely in its desolation, smote him to\nthe soul, and he threw himself in agony at her feet. She was\ntoo faint to rise\u2014she attempted to extend her trembling hand\u2014\nher lips moved as if she spoke, but no word was articulated\u2014she\nlooked down upon him with a smile of unutterable tenderness,\u2014\nand closed her eyes for ever!\n\nSuch are the particulars which I gathered of this village story.\nThey are but scanty, and I am conscious have little novelty to\nrecommend them. In the present rage also for strange incident\nand high-seasoned narrative, they may appear trite and insigni-\nficant; but they interested me strongly at the time; and, taken\nin connection with the affecting ceremony which I had just wit-\nnessed, left a deeper impression on my mind than many circum-\nstances of a more striking nature. I have passed through the\nplace since, and visited the church again, from a better motive\nthan mere curiosity. It was a wintry evening; the trees were\nstripped of their foliage; the churchyard looked naked and\nmournful, and the wind rustled coldly through the dry grass.\nEvergreens, however, had been planted about the grave of the\nvillage favourite, and osiers were bent over it to keep the turf\nuninjured.\n\nThe church door was open, and I stepped in. There hung\nthe chaplet of flowers and the gloves, as on the day of the\nfuneral: the flowers were withered, it is true, but care seemed\nto have been taken that no dust should soil their whiteness. I\nhave seen many monuments, where art has exhausted its powers\nto awaken the sympathy of the spectator, but I have met with\nnone that spoke more touchingly to my heart than this simple\nbut delicate memento of departed innocence.\n\n---\n\nTHE ANGLER.\n\nThis day dense Nature seem'd in love,\nThe lusky sun began to move,\nFresh juice did stir th' embossing vines,\nAnd birds had drawn their valentines.\nThe jealous trout that low did lie,\nRest at a well-dismembered site.\nThere stood my friend, with patient skill,\nAttending of his trembling quill.\u2014Sir H. Wotton.\n\nIt is said that many an unlucky urchin is induced to run\naway from his family, and betake himself to a seafaring life,\nfrom reading the history of Robinson Crusoe; and I suspect that,\nin like manner, many of those worthy gentlemen who are given\nto haunt the sides of pastoral streams with angle rods in hand,\nmay trace the origin of their passion to the seductive pages of\nhonest Izaak Walton. I recollect studying his \"Complete Angler\" several years since, in company with a knot of friends in America, and, moreover, that we were all completely bitten with the angling mania. It was early in the year; but as soon as the weather was auspicious, and that the spring began to melt into the verge of summer, we took rod in hand and sallied into the country, as stark mad as was ever Don Quixote from reading books of chivalry.\n\nOne of our party had equalled the Don in the fulness of his equipments, being attired cap-a-pie for the enterprise. He wore a broad-skirted fustian coat, perplexed with half a hundred pockets; a pair of stout shoes, and leather gaiters; a basket hung on one side for fish; a patent rod, a landing-net, and a score of other inconveniences, only to be found in the true angler's armory. Thus harnessed for the field, he was as great a matter of stare and wonderment among the country folk, who had never seen a regular angler, as was the steel-clad hero of La Mancha among the goat-herds of the Sierra Morena.\n\nOur first essay was along a mountain brook, among the highlands of the Hudson; a most unfortunate place for the execution of those piscatory tactics which had been invented along the velvet margins of quiet English rivulets. It was one of those wild streams that lavish, among our romantic solitudes, unheeded bounties, enough to fill the sketch-book of a hunter of the pictur-esque. Sometimes it would leap down rocky shelves, making small cascades, over which the trees threw their broad balancing sprays, and long nameless weeds hung in fringes from the impending banks, dripping with diamond drops. Sometimes it would brawl and fret along a ravine in the matted shade of a forest, filling it with murmurs; and, after this tempestuous career, would steal forth into open day with the most placid demure face imaginable; as I have seen some pestilent shrew of a housewife, after filling her home with uproar and ill-humour, come dimpling out of doors, swimming and courtseying, and smiling upon all the world.\n\nHow smoothly would this vagrant brook glide, at such times, through some bosom of green meadow-land among the mountains; where the quiet was only interrupted by the occasional tinkling of a bell from the lazy cattle among the clover, or the sound of a woodcutter's axe from the neighbouring forest.\n\nFor my part, I was always a bungler at all kinds of sport that required either patience or adroitness, and had not angled above half an hour before I had completely \"satisfied the sentiment,\"\nand convinced myself of the truth of Izaak Walton's opinion, that angling is something like poetry\u2014a man must be born to it. I hooked myself instead of the fish; tangled my line in every tree; lost my bait; broke my rod; until I gave up the attempt in despair, and passed the day under the trees, reading old Izaak; satisfied that it was his fascinating vein of honest simplicity and rural feeling that had bewitched me, and not the passion for angling. My companions, however, were more persevering in their delusion. I have them at this moment before my eyes, stealing along the border of the brook, where it lay open to the day, or was merely fringed by shrubs and bushes. I see the bittern rising with hollow scream as they break in upon his rarely-invaded haunt; the kingfisher watching them suspiciously from his dry tree that overhangs the deep black mill-pond, in the gorge of the hills; the tortoise letting himself slip sideways from off the stone or log on which he is sunning himself; and the panic-struck frog plumping in headlong as they approach, and spreading an alarm throughout the watery world around.\n\nI recollect, also, that, after toiling and watching and creeping about for the greater part of a day, with scarcely any success, in spite of all our admirable apparatus, a lubberly country urchin came down from the hills with a rod made from a branch of a tree, a few yards of twine, and, as Heaven shall help me! I believe a crooked pin for a hook, baited with a vile earthworm\u2014and in half an hour caught more fish than we had nibbles throughout the day!\n\nBut, above all, I recollect the \"good, honest, wholesome, hungry\" repast, which we made under a beech-tree, just by a spring of pure sweet water that stole out of the side of a hill; and how, when it was over, one of the party read old Izaak Walton's scene with the milkmaid, while I lay on the grass and built castles in a bright pile of clouds, until I fell asleep. All this may appear like mere egotism; yet I cannot refrain from uttering these recollections, which are passing like a strain of music over my mind, and have been called up by an agreeable scene which I witnessed not long since.\n\nIn a morning stroll along the banks of the Alun, a beautiful little stream which flows down from the Welsh hills, and throws itself into the Dee, my attention was attracted to a group seated on the margin. On approaching, I found it to consist of a veteran angler and two rustic disciples. The former was an old fellow with a wooden leg, with clothes very much but very carefully patched, betokening poverty, honestly come by, and decently maintained. He present fairly a smile; his ingather the who was discompanied was a poacher, and fish-pond in was a tall, apparently anxious in examining to discover he and was lecturing to listen towards all \"Izaak Walton. The peaceable spirits since I met which are so fraternity.\n\n\"that in going that ye shew emists disputing of your money, the helth of you.\n\nI thought me an exem cheerful cont him. I could stumped from in the air, to catching among would throw it lightly of those dark in which the was giving in manner in which and play the\n\n* From this same employment than I partes in flabyng your of your game. And playes. And thus a principall cause t\nmaintained. His face bore the marks of former storms, but present fair weather; its furrows had been worn into an habitual smile; his iron-gray locks hung about his ears, and he had altogether the good-humoured air of a constitutional philosopher who was disposed to take the world as it went. One of his companions was a ragged wight, with the skulking look of an arrant poacher, and I warrant could find his way to any gentleman's fish-pond in the neighbourhood in the darkest night. The other was a tall, awkward, country lad, with a lounging gait, and apparently somewhat of a rustic beau. The old man was busy in examining the maw of a trout which he had just killed, to discover by its contents what insects were seasonable for bait; and was lecturing on the subject to his companions, who appeared to listen with infinite deference. I have a kind feeling towards all \"brothers of the angle,\" ever since I read Izaak Walton. They are men, he affirms, of a \"mild, sweet, and peaceable spirit;\" and my esteem for them has been increased since I met with an old \"Tretyse of fishing with the Angle,\" in which are set forth many of the maxims of their inoffensive fraternity. \"Take good heed,\" sayeth this honest little tretyse, \"that in going about your disportes ye open no man's gates, but that ye shut them again. Also ye shall not use this forsayd crafty disport for no covetousness to the encreasing and sparing of your money only, but principally for your solace, and to cause the helth of your body and specially of your soule.\"*\n\nI thought that I could perceive in the veteran angler before me an exemplification of what I had read; and there was a cheerful contentedness in his looks that quite drew me towards him. I could not but remark the gallant manner in which he stumped from one part of the brook to another; waving his rod in the air, to keep the line from dragging on the ground, or catching among the bushes; and the adroitness with which he would throw his fly to any particular place; sometimes skimming it lightly along a little rapid; sometimes casting it into one of those dark holes made by a twisted root or overhanging bank, in which the large trout are apt to lurk. In the meanwhile he was giving instructions to his two disciples; showing them the manner in which they should handle their rods, fix their flies, and play them along the surface of the stream. The scene\n\n* From this same treatise, it would appear that angling is a more industrious and devout employment than it is generally considered.\u2014\"For when ye purpose to go on your disportes in fishingye ye will not destroy greatlye many persons with you, which might let you of your game. And thus ye may serve God devoutly in sayings effectually your exhortations prayers. And thus doing, ye shall eschew and also breede many vises, as ye know, which is principall cause to induc men to many other vises, as it is right well known.\"\n\n---\n\nTHE ANGLER.\n\n240\nbrought to my mind the instructions of the sage Piscator to his scholar. The country around was of that pastoral kind which Walton is fond of describing. It was a part of the great plain of Cheshire, close by the beautiful vale of Grassford, and just where the inferior Welsh hills begin to swell up from among fresh-smelling meadows. The day, too, like that recorded in his work, was mild and sunshiny, with now and then a soft-dropping shower, that sowed the whole earth with diamonds.\n\nI soon fell into conversation with the old angler, and was so much entertained, that, under pretext of receiving instructions in his art, I kept company with him almost the whole day; wandering along the banks of the stream, and listening to his talk. He was very communicative, having all the easy garrulity of cheerful old age; and I fancy was a little flattered by having an opportunity of displaying his piscatory lore; for who does not like now and then to play the sage?\n\nHe had been much of a rambler in his day, and had passed some years of his youth in America, particularly in Savannah, where he had entered into trade and had been ruined by the indiscretion of a partner. He had afterwards experienced many ups and downs in life, until he got into the navy, where his leg was carried away by a cannon-ball, at the battle of Camperdown. This was the only stroke of real good fortune he had ever experienced, for it got him a pension, which, together with some small paternal property, brought him in a revenue of nearly forty pounds. On this he retired to his native village, where he lived quietly and independently; and devoted the remainder of his life to the \"noble art of angling.\"\n\nI found that he had read Izaak Walton attentively, and he seemed to have imbibed all his simple frankness and prevalent good humour. Though he had been sorely buffeted about the world, he was satisfied that the world, in itself, was good and beautiful. Though he had been so roughly used in different countries, as a poor sheep that is fleeced by every hedge and thicket, yet he spoke of every nation with candour and kindness, appearing to look only on the good side of things; and, above all, he was almost the only man I had ever met with who had been an unfortunate adventurer in America, and had honesty and magnanimity enough to take the fault to his own door, and not to curse the country. The lad that was receiving his instructions, I learnt, was the son and heir apparent of a fat old widow who kept the village inn, and, of course, a youth of some expectation, and much courted by the idle gentleman-like person-\nages of the place. In taking him under his care, therefore, the old man had probably an eye to a privileged corner in the taproom, and an occasional cup of cheerful ale free of expense.\n\nThere is certainly something in angling, if we could forget, which anglers are apt to do, the cruelties and tortures inflicted on worms and insects, that tends to produce a gentleness of spirit, and a pure serenity of mind. As the English are methodical, even in their recreations, and are the most scientific of sportsmen, it has been reduced among them to perfect rule and system. Indeed, it is an amusement peculiarly adapted to the mild and highly-cultivated scenery of England, where every roughness has been softened away from the landscape. It is delightful to saunter along those limpid streams which wander, like veins of silver, through the bosom of this beautiful country; leading one through a diversity of small home scenery; sometimes winding through ornamented grounds; sometimes brimming along through rich pasturage, where the fresh green is mingled with sweet-smelling flowers; sometimes venturing in sight of villages and hamlets, and then running capriciously away into shady retirements. The sweetness and serenity of nature, and the quiet watchfulness of the sport, gradually bring on pleasant fits of musing, which are now and then agreeably interrupted by the song of a bird, the distant whistle of the peasant, or perhaps the vagary of some fish, leaping out of the still water, and skimming transiently about its glassy surface. \"When I would beget content,\" says Izaak Walton, \"and increase confidence in the power and wisdom and providence of Almighty God, I will walk the meadows by some gliding stream, and there contemplate the lilies that take no care, and those very many other little living creatures that are not only created, but fed (man knows not how), by the goodness of the God of nature, and therefore trust in him.\"\n\nI cannot forbear to give another quotation from one of those ancient champions of angling, which breathes the same innocent and happy spirit:\n\nLet me live harmlessly, and near the brink Of Trent or Avon have a dwelling place, Where I may see my quill, or cork, down stalk, With eager bite of pike, or bleak, or dace; And on the world and my Creator think; Whilst some men strive ill-gotten goods to enhance; And others spend their time in base excess Of wine, or worse, in war, or wantonness. Let them that will, these pastimes still pursue, And on such pleasing fancies feed their fill;\nSo I the fields and meadows green may view,\nAnd daily by fresh rivers walk at will,\nAmong the daisies and the violets blue,\nRed hyacinth and yellow daffodil.*\n\nOn parting with the old angler, I inquired after his place of abode, and happening to be in the neighbourhood of the village a few evenings afterwards, I had the curiosity to seek him out. I found him living in a small cottage, containing only one room, but a perfect curiosity in its method and arrangement. It was on the skirts of the village, on a green bank, a little back from the road, with a small garden in front, stocked with kitchen herbs, and adorned with a few flowers. The whole front of the cottage was overrun with a honeysuckle. On the top was a ship for a weathercock. The interior was fitted up in a truly nautical style, his ideas of comfort and convenience having been acquired on the berth-deck of a man-of-war. A hammock was slung from the ceiling, which, in the daytime, was lashed up so as to take but little room. From the centre of the chamber hung a model of a ship, of his own workmanship. Two or three chairs, a table, and a large sea-chest, formed the principal moveables. About the wall were stuck up naval ballads, such as Admiral Hosier's Ghost, All in the Downs, and Tom Bowling, intermingled with pictures of sea-fights, among which the battle of Camperdown held a distinguished place. The mantel-piece was decorated with sea-shells, over which hung a quadrant, flanked by two wood-cuts of most bitter-looking naval commanders. His implements for angling were carefully disposed on nails and hooks about the room. On a shelf was arranged his library, containing a work on angling, much worn, a Bible covered with canvas, an old volume or two of voyages, a nautical almanack, and a book of songs.\n\nHis family consisted of a large black cat with one eye, and a parrot which he had caught and tamed, and educated himself, in the course of one of his voyages; and which uttered a variety of sea phrases with the hoarse brattling tone of a veteran boatswain. The establishment reminded me of that of the renowned Robinson Crusoe; it was kept in neat order, everything being \"stowed away\" with the regularity of a ship of war; and he informed me that he \"scoured the deck every morning, and swept it between meals.\"\n\nI found him seated on a bench before the door, smoking his pipe in the soft evening sunshine. His cat was purring soberly on the threshold, and his parrot describing some strange evolutions in an iron ring that swung in the centre of his cage. He had\n\n* J. Davies.\nbeen angling all day, and gave me a history of his sport with as much minuteness as a general would talk over a campaign; being particularly animated in relating the manner in which he had taken a large trout, which had completely tasked all his skill and wariness, and which he had sent as a trophy to mine hostess of the inn.\n\nHow comforting it is to see a cheerful and contented old age; and to behold a poor fellow, like this, after being tempest-tost through life, safely moored in a snug and quiet harbour in the evening of his days! His happiness, however, sprung from within himself, and was independent of external circumstances; for he had that inexhaustible good nature, which is the most precious gift of Heaven; spreading itself like oil over the troubled sea of thought, and keeping the mind smooth and equable in the roughest weather.\n\nOn inquiring further about him, I learnt that he was a universal favourite in the village, and the oracle of the tap-room; where he delighted the rustics with his songs, and, like Sinbad, astonished them with his stories of strange lands, and shipwrecks, and sea-fights. He was much noticed, too, by gentlemen sportsmen of the neighbourhood; had taught several of them the art of angling; and was a privileged visitor to their kitchens. The whole tenor of his life was quiet and inoffensive, being principally passed about the neighbouring streams, when the weather and season were favourable; and at other times he employed himself at home, preparing his fishing tackle for the next campaign, or manufacturing rods, nets, and flies, for his patrons and pupils among the gentry.\n\nHe was a regular attendant at church on Sundays, though he generally fell asleep during the sermon. He had made it his particular request that when he died he should be buried in a green spot, which he could see from his seat in church, and which he had marked out ever since he was a boy, and had thought of when far from home on the raging sea, in danger of being food for the fishes\u2014it was the spot where his father and mother had been buried.\n\nI have done, for I fear that my reader is growing weary; but I could not refrain from drawing the picture of this worthy \"brother of the angle;\" who has made me more than ever in love with the theory, though I fear I shall never be adroit in the practice, of his art; and I will conclude this rambling sketch in the words of honest Izaak Walton, by craving the blessing of St. Peter's master upon my reader, \"and upon all that are true...\"\nlovers of virtue; and dare trust in his providence; and be quiet; and go a angling.\"\n\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.\n\nFOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\n\nA pleasing land of drowsy head it was,\nOf dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\nAnd of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\nNor ever flashing round a summer sky.\n\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail, and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market-town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley, or rather lap of land, among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker, is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\n\nI recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noon time, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around, and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat, whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.\n\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of Sleepy Hollow, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighbouring country. A dreary,\ndreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade\nthe very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by\na high German doctor, during the early days of the settlement;\nothers, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his\ntribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered\nby Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still con-\ntinues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell\nover the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a\ncontinual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous\nbeliefs; are subject to trances and visions; and frequently see\nstrange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole\nneighbourhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and\ntwilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener\nacross the valley than in any other part of the country, and the\nnight-mare, with her whole nine fold, seems to make it the\nfavourite scene of her gambols.\n\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted\nregion, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of\nthe air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head.\nIt is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose\nhead had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless\nbattle during the revolutionary war; and who is ever and anon\nseen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night,\nas if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to\nthe valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and espe-\ncially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have\nbeen careful in collecting and collating the floating facts con-\ncerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper, having\nbeen buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene\nof battle in nightly quest of his head; and that the rushing speed\nwith which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a mid-\nnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get\nback to the churchyard before daybreak.\n\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition,\nwhich has furnished materials for many a wild story in that\nregion of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country\ninhabitants by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy\nHollow.\n\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have men-\ntioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is\nunconsciously imbued by every one who resides there for a time.\nHowever wide awake they may have been before they entered\nthat sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative\u2014to dream dreams, and see apparitions.\n\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible land; for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great state of New York, that population, manners, and customs, remain fixed; while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water which border a rapid stream; where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbour, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.\n\nIn this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane; who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, \"tarried,\" in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut; a state which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock, perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a corn-field.\n\nHis school-house was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copy-books. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window-shutters; so that, though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out; an idea most probably borrowed by\n\nthe architect from the bee-hive. The school-house stood just at the foot of the hill, and a formidable thicket of osiers, hence the lowly schoolmaster's lessons, might be heard in the echo of a bee-hive. The loud, shrill voice of the master, the thrilling peradventure, the thrilling suspense, some tardy loiterer might have thought to say, he was the only golden maxim in the world. Crane's school was a success.\n\nI would not dwell on those cruel punishments, those subjects; on the sternness of the nation rather than the kindness of the weak, and the severity of the puny stripling. The school was passed by without any satisfaction by its pupils. The wrong-headed, the dull, the stupid swelled and grew in his presence; he called \"cowards\" and inflicted a chastisement consolatory to the wrong-doer and thank him for it.\n\nWhen school was over, the playmate of the schoolboy would convey some message to the pretty sisters, and bring back the comforts of the evening. He was good terms with the schoolmaster; he was small, and weak, and weak with daily breakfasts; but the dilating power of the tenement, he was obliged to be instructed and look after the time; thus going to worldly effects. That all this\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.\n\nthe architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eel-pot. The school-house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a bee-hive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command; or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, \"Spare the rod and spoil the child.\" Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled.\n\nI would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school, who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burthen off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough, wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called \"doing his duty by their parents;\" and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that \"he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.\"\n\nWhen school-hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behoved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers, whose children he instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time; thus going the rounds of the neighbourhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.\n\nThat all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic\npatrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labours of their farms; helped to make hay; mended the fences; took the horses to water; drove the cows from pasture; and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favour in the eyes of the mothers, by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.\n\nIn addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the neighbourhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him, on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the mill-pond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little make-shifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated \"by hook and by crook,\" the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labour of head-work, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.\n\nThe schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighbourhood; being considered a kind of idle gentleman-like personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farm-house and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver tea-pot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard between services on Sundays! gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond; while he sheepishly bantered them.\n\nFrom his perusal of the gazette, carry his knowledge into the house; so that he was a great erudition. He was a perfect Witchcraft, it was believed.\n\nHe was, in fact, credulity. He digesting it, increased by degrees; and often his delight was to stretch him out on a brook that was old Mather's grave, made the principal part of his wended his steps to the farm-lane, the sound of nature's imagination: the boding cry of the dreary hooting of the thicket of birds, which sparkled in the air startled him, and closed his path; and the winging his horse ready to give him a witch's token, drawn though the tunes;\u2014and they opened their doors of their nasal melody from the distant.\n\nAnother of the winter evening\nmill-pond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.\n\nFrom his half itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house; so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's History of New England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.\n\nHe was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover, bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school-house, and there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of the evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farm-house where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination: the moan of the whip-poor-will* from the hill-side; the boding cry of the tree-toad, that harbinger of storm; the dreary hooting of the screech-owl, or the sudden rustling in the sycamore of birds frightened from their roost. The fire-flies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if by chance a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes;\u2014and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, \"in linked sweetness long drawn out,\" floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.\n\nAnother of his sources of fearful pleasure was, to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning.\n\n* The whip-poor-will is a bird which is only heard at night. It receives its name from its note, which is thought to resemble these words.\nby the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along\nthe hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and\ngoblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted\nbridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless\nhorseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes\ncalled him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of\nwitchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and\nsounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Conne-\ncticut; and would frighten them wofully with speculations upon\ncomets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the\nworld did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the\ntime topsy-turvy!\n\nBut if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling\nin the chimney-corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow\nfrom the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre\ndared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of\nhis subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and\nshadows beset his path amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a\nsnowy night!\u2014With what wistful look did he eye every trembling\nray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant\nwindow!\u2014How often was he appalled by some shrub covered\nwith snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path!\u2014\nHow often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his\nown steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look\nover his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being\ntramping close behind him!\u2014and how often was he thrown into\ncomplete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees,\nin the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his\nnightly scourings!\n\nAll these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms\nof the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many\nspectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in\ndiverse shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an\nend to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life\nof it, in despite of the devil and all his works, if his path had not\nbeen crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal\nman than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put\ntogether, and that was\u2014a woman.\n\nAmong the musical disciples who assembled one evening in\neach week to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina\nVan Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch\nfarmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as\npartridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her\nfather's peach-trees; but her beauty, but her coquette, as much\nmixture of and charm. So her great-grandfather, the tempting\nvokingly short, in the country.\n\nIchabod Crane found it not that\nfound favour in her paternal\npicture of a throne\nit is true, boundaries of\nmug, happy, and\nwealth, but not\nabundance, rather\nold was situated\ngreen, sheltered\nend of nestling\nover it, at the\nsweetest wreath\nwhole sparkling\nbubbled all\nfarm-house\nchurch, every\nwith the\nwithin it flitted\nchimmed twittering\none eye turned\ntheir heads under\nothers swelling; the\nenjoying the sunshiny\nmounting in the\nnow and then\na stately squadron\nand, convoying\nwere gobbling the\nlike ill-tempered cry.

She was, withal, a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time; and withal a provocingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.\n\nIchabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex, and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favour in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those, everything was snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks, in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm-tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel, and then sparkled away through the grass to a neighbouring brook that bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farm-house was a vast barn that might have served for a church, every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and crowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were granted in the repose and abundance of their pens, whence sallied forth now and then troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air.\n\nA stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farm-yard, and guinea-fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that one of her pattern of a husband, a warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping\nhis burnished wings, and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart\u2014sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.\n\nThe pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon his sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed-up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savoury sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back in a side-dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.\n\nAs the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow-lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burthened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes; and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a waggon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee, or the Lord knows where.\n\nWhen he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged, but lowly-sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighbouring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this\npiazzas the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the wall, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlour, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistered from their covert of asparagus tops; mock oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantel-piece; strings of various coloured birds' eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner-cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.\n\nFrom the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with; and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant, to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie, and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were for ever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.\n\nAmong these the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roistering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb, he had received the nickname of Brom Bones,\nby which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock-fights, and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone admitting of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic, but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and, with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humour at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with hoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks, and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment, till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, \"Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!\" The neighbours looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and when any mad-cap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.\n\nThis rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, \"sparking,\" within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.\n\nSuch was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack,\u2014yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet,\nthe moment it was away\u2014jerk! he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.\n\nTo have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently-insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy, indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the meantime, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favourable to the lover's eloquence.\n\nI profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for a man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed away over the heart of a coquette, is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined; his horse was no longer seen tied at the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.\n\nBrom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare, and have settled\ntheir pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore\u2014by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him: he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he \"would double the school-master up, and lay him on a shelf of his own school-house;\" and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic wagery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing-school, by stopping up the chimney; broke into the school-house at night, in spite of his formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy; so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's to instruct her in psalmody.\n\nIn this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situation of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil-doers; while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins; such as half-munched apples, pop-guns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper game-cocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the school-room. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro, in tow-cloth jacket and trousers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to\nIchabod to attend a merry-making, or \"quilting frolic,\" to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel's; and having delivered his message with that air of importance and effort at fine language which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.\n\nAll was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet school-room. The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed, or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves; inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.\n\nThe gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half-hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the school-house. That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plough-horse that had outlived almost everything but his viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck and a head like a hammer; his rusty main and tail were tangled and knotted with burrs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral; but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favourite steed of his master's, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.\n\nIchabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers; he\ncarried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and, as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called; and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horse's tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed, as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.\n\nIt was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighbouring stubble field.\n\nThe small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fulness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking, from bush to bush and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them. There was the honest cock-robin, the favourite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud, querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar-bird; with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail, and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light-blue coat and white under-clothes; screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.\n\nAs Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast stores of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press. Further on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of fragrant buckwheat, and as he beheld the dainty slaps of treacle, by Tassel.\n\nThus feeding on suppositions, which look like Hudson. To the west. The sea and glassy, extended and prolonged amber cloudbanks over them. The moon into a pure and mid-heaven. Precipices that depth to the sea was loitering tide, her sail reflection of if the vessel\n\nIt was to the Heer Van Ripper and flower. Leathern-faced hangings, huge and withered little gowns, homely gay calico petticoats as antiquated fine riband, innovation. Stupendous fashion of the for the purple potent nourish.\n\nBrom Bom to the gathering like himself could himself coul vicious anima\nprospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields, breathing the odour of the bee-hive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.\n\nThus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and \"sugared suppositions,\" he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disc down into the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, except that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple-green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.\n\nIt was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk withered little dames, in close crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine riband, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally quened in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.\n\nBrom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favourite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks, which kept the rider\nin constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.\n\nFain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlour of Van Tassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped-up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughy dough-nut, the tenderer oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet-cakes and short-cakes, ginger-cakes and honey-cakes, and the whole family of cakes. And then there were apple-pies and peach-pies and pumpkin-pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and, moreover, delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly tea-pot sending up its clouds of vapour from the midst\u2014Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.\n\nHe was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer; and whose spirits rose with eating as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendour. Then he thought, how soon he'd turn his back upon the old school-house, snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!\n\nOld Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humour, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to \"fall to, and help yourselves.\"\n\nAnd now the sound of the music from the common-room or hall summoned to the dance. The musician was an old grey-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neigh-\nhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.\n\nIchabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his loosely-hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought Saint Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighbourhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces, at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? the lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.\n\nWhen the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the eager folks, who, with old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war.\n\nThis neighbourhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly-favoured places which abound with chronicle and great men. The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding, and infested with refugees, cow-boys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each story-teller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.\n\nThere was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were\nseveral more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.\n\nBut all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded. The neighbourhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered long-settled retreats; but are trampled under-foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap, and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighbourhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.\n\nThe immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andr\u00e9 was taken, and which stood in the neighbourhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favourite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.\n\nThe sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favourite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity, beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the darkness extends a little among brooding black parts thrown a way itself, were gloom about darkness and headless horse encountered disbeliever in his foray into him; how swamp, unexpectedly turned and sprang.\n\nThis story adventure Hessian and one night been overtaken race with him for Daredevils came to the a flash of fire.\n\nAll these men talk in and then run deep in the large extra added manner state of Connecticut nightly walked.\n\nThe reverberation together the time rattling. Some of the swains, and of hoofs, or fainter untoward noise and figures gazed behind.\nleast the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favourite haunts of the headless horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.\n\nThis story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that, on returning one night from the neighbouring village of Sing-Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bow'l of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but, just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.\n\nAll these tales, told in that drowsy under-tone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind, with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native state of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.\n\nThe revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together their families in their waggons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favourite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter until they gradually died away\u2014and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have\na t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the heiress, fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chop-fallen. Oh these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?\u2014Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival?\u2014Heaven only knows, not I!\u2014Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been seeking a hen-roost, rather than a fair lady's heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks, roused his steed most unceremoniously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.\n\nIt was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crest-fallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight he could even hear the barking of the watch-dog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills\u2014but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull-frog, from a neighbouring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably, and turning suddenly in his bed.\n\nAll the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the place. Its limbs were partly ordinary trees, partly into the air, and unfortunately was universally common people's notion, partly by its shape and partly for the sensations told connected with it.\n\nAs Ichabod approached, he thought he heard a noise sharply thrown out. As he neared, he thought he saw the form of the tree\u2014its branches narrowly, partly scorched by lightning. He heard a groan, and felt the saddle; it was aye together, as they reached the tree in safety.\n\nAbout two hundred yards on the road, and a little to the side, served as a meeting-place for the road where the trees were cut down, matted over with a gloom over it. Ichabod looked at this identical spot, and under the circumstances, yeomen conceivably might consider a schoolboy who had been summoned up by the score of kicks, to be on the bridge; but the animal made no attempt to fence. Ichabod took the reins on the other hand, and it was all in vain to try to plunge to\ntrees of the neighbourhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragic story of the unfortunate Andr\u00e9, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major Andr\u00e9\u2019s tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights and doleful lamentations told concerning it.\n\nAs Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white hanging in the midst of the tree\u2014he paused and ceased whistling; but on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan\u2014his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle; it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were awayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.\n\nAbout two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley\u2019s Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andr\u00e9 was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.\n\nAs he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of\nbrambles and alder-bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen, black and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.\n\nThe hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents\u2014\"Who are you?\" He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervour into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound, stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.\n\nIchabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed, in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind\u2014the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavoured to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion, that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!\u2014that the head was carried before him, to desperate Gunpowder's companion\u2014the head! Away then and sparks fluttered in his horse's back.\n\nThey had reached Hollow; but instead of halting, headlong down the sandy hollow it crosses the green knoll.\n\nAs yet there was no apparent advance; but way through the trees he felt it slip by, and endeavoured to save himself by the saddle for by his pursuit wrath passed, but this was his haunches; and to maintain his back-bone, him asunder.\n\nAn opening in the church, silver star is mistaken. the trees be ghostly company bridge,\" the black steed fancied that the ribs, and ordered over\nheadless!\u2014but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of the saddle: his terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping, by a sudden movement, to give his companion the slip\u2014but the spectre started full jump with him. Away then they dashed, through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head, in the eagerness of his flight.\n\nThey had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong down the hill to the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow, shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story, and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.\n\nAs yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase; but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and endeavoured to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under-foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Vau Ripper's wrath passed across his mind\u2014for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on the other, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse's backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.\n\nAn opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones' ghostly competitor had disappeared. \"If I can but reach that bridge,\" thought Ichabod, \"I am safe.\" Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side;\nand now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavoured to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash\u2014he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider passed by like a whirlwind.\n\nThe next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master's gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast\u2014dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the school-house, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.\n\nThe brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his estate, examined the bundle, which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy smallclothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes, full of dog's ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the books and furniture of the school-house, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather's History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac, and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honour of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who from that time forward determined to send his children no more to school, observing, that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.\n\nThe mystery was now collected in the hat and put on Bones, and when they met them with heads, and off by the nobody's done the school was another pedagogue.\n\nIt is true on a visit a ghostly adventure that Ichabod's neighbourhood, Hans Ripper, and dismissed by distant party at the same time electioneered made a justificatory shortly after Katrina in strangely known always burst which led a than he chose.\n\nThe old case these matters away by such as told about The bridge and that many years, so as pond. The was reported pedagogue; summer evening a melo Sleepy Hell\nThe mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others, were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him: the school was removed to a different quarter of the Hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his stead.\n\nIt is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighbourhood, partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar, turned politician, electioneered, written for the newspapers, and finally had been made a justice of the Ten-pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who shortly after his rival's disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.\n\nThe old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favourite story often told about the neighbourhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe, and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the mill-pond. The school-house being deserted, soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue; and the plough-boy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.\nPOSTSCRIPT,\n\nFOUND IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. KNICKERBOCKER.\n\nThe preceding tale is given, almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a Corporation meeting of the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humorous face; and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor,\u2014he made such efforts to be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather a severe face throughout: now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh, but upon good grounds\u2014when they have reason and the law on their side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the other a-kimbo, demanded, with a slight but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove?\n\nThe story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove:\n\n\"That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures\u2014provided we will but take a joke as we find it:\n\n\"That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it.\n\n\"Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.\"\n\nThe cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism: while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well; but still he thought the story a little\non the extravagant\u2014there were one or two points on which he had his doubts.\n\n\"Faith, sir,\" replied the story-teller, \"as to that matter, I don't believe one half of it myself.\"\n\nD. K.\n\nL'ENVOY.*\n\nGo, little books, God send thee good passage:\nAnd specially let this be thy prayer,\nUnto them all that thee will read or hear,\nWhere thou art wrong, after their help to call\nThee to correct in any part or all.\n\nCHAUCER'S Belle Dame sans Merci.\n\nIn concluding a second volume of the Sketch Book, the Author cannot but express his deep sense of the indulgence with which his first has been received, and of the liberal disposition that has been evinced to treat him with kindness as a stranger. Even the critics, whatever may be said of them by others, he has found to be a singularly gentle and good-natured race; it is true that each has in turn objected to some one or two articles, and that these individual exceptions, taken in the aggregate, would amount almost to a total condemnation of his work; but then he has been consoled by observing, that what one has particularly censured, another has as particularly praised; and thus, the encomiums being set off against the objections, he finds his work, upon the whole, commended far beyond its deserts.\n\nHe is aware that he runs a risk of forfeiting much of this kind favour by not following the counsel that has been liberally bestowed upon him; for where abundance of valuable advice is given gratis, it may seem a man's own fault if he should go astray. He only can say, in his vindication, that he faithfully determined, for a time, to govern himself in his second volume by the opinions passed upon his first; but he was soon brought to a stand by the contrariety of excellent counsel. One kindly advised him to avoid the ludicrous; another to shun the pathetic; a third assured him that he was tolerable at description, but cautioned him to leave narrative alone; while a fourth declared that he had a very pretty knack at turning a story, and was really entertaining when in a pensive mood, but was grievously mistaken if he imagined himself to possess a spirit of humour.\n\nThus perplexed by the advice of his friends, who each in turn closed some particular path, but left him all the world beside to range in, he found that to follow all their counsels would, in fact,\n\n* Closing the second volume of the London edition.\nbe to stand still. He remained for a time sadly embarrassed; when, all at once the thought struck him to ramble on as he had begun; that his work being miscellaneous, and written for different humours, it could not be expected that any one would be pleased with the whole; but that if it should contain something to suit each reader, his end would be completely answered. Few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite for every dish. One has an elegant horror of a roasted pig; another holds a curry or a devil in utter abomination; a third cannot tolerate the ancient flavour of venison and wild fowl; and a fourth, of truly masculine stomach, looks with sovereign contempt on those knick-knacks, here and there dished up for the ladies. Thus each article is condemned in its turn; and yet, amidst this variety of appetites, seldom does a dish go away from the table without being tasted and relished by some one or other of the guests.\n\nWith these considerations he ventures to serve up this second volume in the same heterogeneous way with his first; simply requesting the reader, if he should find here and there something to please him, to rest assured that it was written expressly for intelligent readers like himself; but entreating him, should he find anything to dislike, to tolerate it, as one of those articles which the author has been obliged to write for readers of a less refined taste.\n\nTo be serious.\u2014The author is conscious of the numerous faults and imperfections of his work; and well aware how little he is disciplined and accomplished in the arts of authorship. His deficiencies are also increased by a diffidence arising from his peculiar situation. He finds himself writing in a strange land, and appearing before a public which he has been accustomed, from childhood, to regard with the highest feelings of awe and reverence. He is full of solicitude to deserve their approbation, yet finds that very solicitude continually embarrassing his powers, and depriving him of that ease and confidence which are necessary to successful exertion. Still the kindness with which he is treated encourages him to go on, hoping that in time he may acquire a steadier footing; and thus he proceeds, half venturing, half shrinking, surprised at his own good fortune, and wondering at his own temerity.\n\nTHE END.\nBOHN'S SERIES.\n\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH.\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH:\n\nA BIOGRAPHY.\n\nBY\n\nWASHINGTON IRVING.\n\nLONDON:\nHENRY G. BOHN, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN.\n1850.\nPREFACE.\n\nIn the course of a revised edition of my works, I have come to a biographical sketch of Goldsmith, published several years since. It was written hastily, as introductory to a selection from his writings; and, though the facts contained in it were collected from various sources, I was chiefly indebted for them to the voluminous work of Mr. James Prior, who had collected and collated the most minute particulars of the poet's history with unwearied research, and scrupulous fidelity; but had rendered them, as I thought, in a form too cumberous and overlaid with details and disquisitions, and matters uninteresting to the general reader.\n\nWhen I was about of late to revise my biographical sketch, preparatory to republication, a volume was put into my hands, recently given to the public by Mr. John Forster, of the Inner Temple, who, likewise availing himself of the labours of the indefatigable Prior, and of a few new lights since evolved, has produced a biography of the poet, executed with a spirit, a feeling, a grace, and an eloquence, that leave nothing to be desired. Indeed it would have been presumption in me to undertake the subject after it had been thus felicitously treated, did I not stand committed by my previous sketch. That sketch now appeared too meagre and insufficient to satisfy public demand; yet it had to take its place in the revised series of my works, unless something more satisfactory\ncould be substituted. Under these circumstances, I have again taken up the subject, and gone into it with more fulness than formerly, omitting none of the facts which I considered illustrative of the life and character of the poet, and giving them in as graphic a style as I could command. Still the hurried manner in which I have had to do this amidst the pressure of other claims on my attention, and with the press dogging at my heels, has prevented me from giving some parts of the subject the thorough handling I could have wished. Those who would like to see it treated still more at large, with the addition of critical disquisitions, and the advantage of collateral facts, would do well to refer themselves to Mr. Prior's circumstantial volumes, or to the elegant and discursive pages of Mr. Forster.\n\nFor my own part, I can only regret my shortcomings in what to me is a labour of love; for it is a tribute of gratitude to the memory of an Author whose writings were the delight of my childhood, and have been a source of enjoyment to me throughout life; and to whom, of all others, I may address the beautiful apostrophe of Dante to Virgil:\n\nTu se' lo mio maestro, e 'l mio autore:\nTu se' solo colui, da cu' lo tolsi\nLo bello stile, che m' ha fatto onore.\n\nW.

magic gift of identifying themselves with their writings. We read his character in every page, and grow into familiar intimacy with him as we read. The artless benevolence that beams throughout his works, the whimsical, yet amiable views of human life and human nature, the unforced humour, blending so happily with good feeling and good sense, and singularly dashed, at times, with a pleasing melancholy; even the very nature of his mellow, and flowing, and softly-tinted style, all seem to bespeak his moral as well as his intellectual qualities, and make us love the man, at the same time that we admire the author. While the productions of writers of loftier pretension, and more sounding names, are suffered to moulder on our shelves, those of Goldsmith are cherished and laid in our bosoms. We do not quote them with ostentation, but they mingle with our minds, sweeten our tempers, and harmonize our thoughts; they put us in good humour with ourselves and with the world, and in so doing they make us happier and better men.\n\nAn acquaintance with the private biography of Goldsmith lets us into the secret of his gifted pages. We there discover them to be little more than transcripts of his own heart, and picturings of his fortunes. There he shows himself the same kind, artless, good-humoured, excursive, sensible, whimsical, intelligent being that he appears in his writings. Scarcely an adventure or character is given in his works that may not be traced to his own parti-coloured story. Many of his most ludicrous scenes and ridiculous incidents have been drawn from his own blunders and mischances, and he seems really to have been buffeted into almost every maxim imparted by him for the instruction of his reader.\n\nOliver Goldsmith was born on the 10th of November, 1728, at the hamlet of Pallas, or Pallasmore, county of Long-\nford, in Ireland. He sprang from a respectable, but by no means a thrifty stock. Some families seem to inherit kindness and incompetency, and to hand down virtue and poverty from generation to generation. Such was the case with the Goldsmiths. \"They were always,\" according to their own accounts, \"a strange family; they rarely acted like other people; their hearts were in the right place, but their heads seemed to be doing anything but what they ought.\"\u2014\"They were remarkable,\" says another statement, \"for their worth, but of no cleverness in the ways of the world.\" Oliver Goldsmith will be found faithfully to inherit the virtues and weaknesses of his race.\n\nHis father, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith, with hereditary improvidence, married when very young and very poor, and starved along for several years on a small country curacy, and the assistance of his wife's friends. His whole income, eked out by the produce of some fields which he farmed, and of some occasional duties performed for his wife's uncle, the rector of an adjoining parish, did not exceed forty pounds.\n\n\"And passing rich with forty pounds a year.\"\n\nHe inhabited an old, half-rustic mansion, that stood on a rising ground in a rough, lonely part of the country, overlooking a low tract occasionally flooded by the river Inny. In this house, Goldsmith was born, and it was a birthplace worthy of a poet, for, by all accounts, it was haunted ground. A tradition handed down among the neighbouring peasantry states that, in after years, the house, remaining for some time untenanted, went to decay, the roof fell in, and it became so lonely and forlorn as to be a resort for the \"good people,\" or fairies, who, in Ireland, are supposed to delight in old, crazy, deserted mansions for their midnight revels. All attempts to repair it were in vain; the fairies battled stoutly to maintain possession. A huge mis-shapen hobgoblin used to bestride the house every evening with an immense pair of jack-boots, which, in his efforts at hard riding, he would thrust through the roof, kicking to pieces all the work of the preceding day. The house was, therefore, left to its fate, and went to ruin.\n\nSuch is the popular tradition about Goldsmith's birthplace. About two years after his birth, a change came over the circumstances of his father. By the death of his wife's uncle he succeeded to the rectory of Kilkenny West; and,\nabandoning the old goblin mansion, he removed to Lissoy, in the county of Westmeath, where he occupied a farm of seventy acres, situated on the skirts of that pretty little village.\n\nThis was the scene of Goldsmith's boyhood, the little world whence he drew many of those pictures, rural and domestic, whimsical and touching, which abound throughout his works, and which appeal so eloquently both to the fancy and the heart. Lissoy is confidently cited as the original of his \"Auburn\" in the \"Deserted Village;\" his father's establishment, a mixture of farm and parsonage, furnished hints, it is said, for the rural economy of the Vicar of Wakefield; and his father himself, with his learned simplicity, his guileless wisdom, his amiable piety, and utter ignorance of the world, has been exquisitely portrayed in the worthy Dr. Primrose. Let us pause for a moment, and draw from Goldsmith's writings one or two of those pictures which, under feigned names, represent his father and his family, and the happy fireside of his childish days.\n\n\"My father,\" says the \"Man in Black,\" who, in some respects, is the counterpart of Goldsmith himself, \"my father, the younger son of a good family, was possessed of a small living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his generosity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers poorer than himself: for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in praise; and this was all he wanted. The same ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of his army influenced my father at the head of his table: he told the story of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was sure to set the table in a roar. Thus his pleasure increased in proportion to the pleasure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.\n\n\"As his fortune was but small, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intention of leaving his children money, for that was dross; he resolved they should have learning, for learning, he used to observe, was better than silver or gold. For this purpose he undertook to instruct us himself, and took as much care to form our morals as to improve our understanding. We were told that universal...\"\nbenevolence was what first cemented society; we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the human face divine with affection and esteem; he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious distress. In a word, we were perfectly instructed in the art of giving away thousands before we were taught the necessary qualification of getting a farthing.\"\n\nIn the \"Deserted Village\" we have another picture of his father and his father's fireside:\n\n\"His house was known to all the vagrant train,\nHe chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;\nThe long-remembered beggar was his guest,\nWhose beard, descending, swept his aged breast;\nThe ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,\nClaim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;\nThe broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,\nSat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;\nWept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,\nShoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won;\nPleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow,\nAnd quite forgot their vices in their woe;\nCareless their merits or their faults to scan,\nHis pity gave ere charity began.\"\n\nThe family of the worthy pastor consisted of five sons and three daughters. Henry, the eldest, was the good man's pride and hope, and he tasked his slender means to the utmost in educating him for a learned and distinguished career. Oliver was the second son, and seven years younger than Henry, who was the guide and protector of his childhood, and to whom he was most tenderly attached throughout life.\n\nOliver's education began when he was about three years old; that is to say, he was gathered under the wings of one of those good old motherly dames, found in every village, who cluck together the whole callow brood of the neighbourhood, to teach them their letters, and keep them out of harm's way. Mistress Elizabeth Delap, for that was her name, flourished in this capacity for upward of fifty years, and it was the pride and boast of her declining days, when nearly ninety years of age, that she was the first that had put a book (doubtless a hornbook) into Goldsmith's hands. Apparently he did not much profit by it, for she confessed he was one of the dullest boys she had ever dealt with, insomuch that she had sometimes doubted whether it was possible to make anything of\nhim: a common case with imaginative children, who are apt to be beguiled from the dry abstractions of elementary study by the picturings of the fancy.\n\nAt six years of age, he passed into the hands of the village schoolmaster, one Thomas (or, as he was commonly and irreverently named, Paddy) Byrne, a capital tutor for a poet. He had been educated for a pedagogue, but had enlisted in the army, served abroad during the wars of Queen Anne's time, and risen to the rank of quartermaster of a regiment in Spain. At the return of peace, having no longer exercise for the sword, he resumed the ferule, and drilled the urchin populace of Lissoy. Goldsmith is supposed to have had him and his school in view in the following sketch in his \"Deserted Village:\"\n\n\"Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,\nWith blossom'd furze unprofitably gay,\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule,\nThe village master taught his little school;\nA man severe he was, and stern to view,\nI knew him well, and every truant knew;\nWell had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace\nThe day's disasters in his morning face;\nFull well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee\nAt all his jokes, for many a joke had he;\nFull well the busy whisper circling round,\nConvey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd:\nYet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,\nThe love he bore to learning was in fault;\nThe village all declared how much he knew\n'Twas certain he could write and cipher too:\nLands he could measure, terms and tides presage,\nAnd e'en the story ran that he could gauge:\nIn arguing, too, the parson own'd his skill,\nFor, e'en though vanquished, he could argue still;\nWhile words of learned length and thund'ring sound,\nAmazed the gazing rustics rang'd around\u2014\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,\nThat one small head could carry all he knew.\"\n\nThere are certain whimsical traits in the character of Byrne, not given in the foregoing sketch. He was fond of talking of his vagabond wanderings in foreign lands, and had brought with him from the wars a world of campaigning stories, of which he was generally the hero, and which he would deal forth to his wondering scholars when he ought to have been teaching them their lessons. These travellers'\ntales had a powerful effect upon the vivid imagination of Goldsmith, and awakened an unconquerable passion for wandering, and seeking adventure.\n\nByrne was, moreover, of a romantic vein, and exceedingly superstitious. He was deeply versed in the fairy superstitions which abound in Ireland, all which he professed implicitly to believe. Under his tuition, Goldsmith soon became almost as great a proficient in fairy lore. From this branch of good-for-nothing knowledge, his studies, by an easy transition, extended to the histories of robbers, pirates, smugglers, and the whole race of Irish rogues and rapparees. Everything, in short, that savoured of romance, fable, and adventure, was congenial to his poetic mind, and took instant root there; but the slow plants of useful knowledge were apt to be overrun, if not choked, by the weeds of his quick imagination.\n\nAnother trait of his motley preceptor, Byrne, was a disposition to dabble in poetry, and this likewise was caught by his pupil. Before he was eight years old, Goldsmith had contracted a habit of scribbling verses on small scraps of paper, which, in a little while, he would throw into the fire. A few of these sybilline leaves, however, were rescued from the flames, and conveyed to his mother. The good woman read them with a mother's delight, and saw at once that her son was a genius and a poet. From that time she beset her husband with solicitations to give the boy an education suitable to his talents. The worthy man was already straitened by the costs of instruction of his eldest son Henry, and had intended to bring his second son up to a trade; but the mother would listen to no such thing; as usual, her influence prevailed, and Oliver, instead of being instructed in some humble, but cheerful and gainful handicraft, was devoted to poverty and the Muse.\n\nA severe attack of the small-pox caused him to be taken from under the care of his story-telling preceptor, Byrne. His malady had nearly proved fatal, and his face remained pitted through life. On his recovery, he was placed under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Griffin, schoolmaster of Elphin, in Roscommon, and became an inmate in the house of his uncle, John Goldsmith, Esq., of Ballyoughter, in that vicinity. He now entered upon studies of a higher order, but without making any uncommon progress. Still a careless, easy\nfacility of disposition, an amusing eccentricity of manners, and a vein of quiet and peculiar humour, rendered him a general favourite, and a trifling incident soon induced his uncle's family to concur in his mother's opinion of his genius.\n\nA number of young folks had assembled at his uncle's to dance. One of the company, named Cummings, played on the violin. In the course of the evening, Oliver undertook a hornpipe. His short and clumsy figure, and his face pitted and discoloured with the small-pox, rendered him a ludicrous figure in the eyes of the musician, who made merry at his expense, dubbing him his little \u00c6sop. Goldsmith was nettled by the jest, and, stopping short, in the hornpipe, exclaimed:\n\n\"Our herald hath proclaimed this saying,\nSee \u00c6sop dancing, and his monkey playing.\"\n\nThe repartee was thought wonderful for a boy of nine years old, and Oliver became forthwith the wit and the bright genius of the family. It was thought a pity he should not receive the same advantages with his elder brother Henry, who had been sent to the university; and, as his father's circumstances would not afford it, several of his relatives, spurred on by the representations of his mother, agreed to contribute towards the expense. The greater part, however, was borne by his uncle, the Rev. Thomas Contarine. This worthy man had been the college companion of Bishop Berkeley, and was possessed of moderate means, holding the living of Carrick-on-Shannon. He had married the sister of Goldsmith's father, but was now a widower, with an only child, a daughter, named Jane. Contarine was a kind-hearted man, with a generosity beyond his means. He took Goldsmith into favour from his infancy: his house was open to him during the holidays; his daughter Jane, two years older than the poet, was his early playmate: and uncle Contarine continued to be the last one of his most active, unwavering, and generous friends.\n\nFitted out in a great measure by this considerate relative, Oliver was now transferred to schools of a higher order, to prepare him for the university; first to one at Athlone, kept by the Rev. Mr. Campbell, and, at the end of two years, to one at Edgeworthstown, under the superintendence of the Rev. Patrick Hughes.\n\nEven at these schools his proficiency does not appear to have been brilliant. He was indolent and careless, however,\nrather than dull, and, on the whole, appears to have been well thought of by his teachers. In his studies he inclined towards the Latin poets and historians; relished Ovid and Horace, and delighted in Livy. He exercised himself with pleasure in reading and translating Tacitus, and was brought to pay attention to style in his compositions by a reproof from his brother Henry, to whom he had written brief and confused letters, and who told him in reply, that if he had but little to say, to endeavour to say that little well.\n\nThe career of his brother Henry at the university was enough to stimulate him to exertion. He seemed to be realizing all his father's hopes, and was winning collegiate honours that the good man considered indicative of his future success in life.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Oliver, if not distinguished among his teachers, was popular among his schoolmates. He had a thoughtless generosity extremely captivating to young hearts: his temper was quick and sensitive, and easily offended; but his anger was momentary, and it was impossible for him to harbour resentment. He was the leader of all boyish sports and athletic amusements, especially ball-playing, and he was foremost in all mischievous pranks. Many years afterwards, an old man, Jack Fitzimmons, one of the directors of the sports and keeper of the ball-court at Ballymahon, used to boast of having been schoolmate of \"Noll Goldsmith,\" as he called him, and would dwell with vainglory on one of their exploits, in robbing the orchard of Tirlicken, an old family residence of Lord Annaly. The exploit, however, had nearly involved disastrous consequences; for the crew of juvenile depredators were captured, like Shakspeare and his deer-stealing colleagues; and nothing but the respectability of Goldsmith's connexions saved him from the punishment that would have awaited more plebeian delinquents.\n\nAn amusing incident is related as occurring in Goldsmith's last journey homeward from Edgeworthstown. His father's house was about twenty miles distant; the road lay through a rough country, impassable for carriages. Goldsmith procured a horse for the journey, and a friend furnished him with a guinea for travelling expenses. He was but a stripling of sixteen, and being thus suddenly mounted on horseback, with money in his pocket, it is no wonder that his head was turned. He determined to play the man, and to spend his money in\nindependent traveller's style. Accordingly, instead of pushing directly for home, he halted for the night at the little town of Ardagh, and, accosting the first person he met, inquired, with somewhat of a consequential air, for the best house in the place. Unluckily, the person he had accosted was one Kelley, a notorious wag, who was quartered in the family of one Mr. Featherstone, a gentleman of fortune. Amused with the self-consequence of the stripling, and willing to play off a practical joke at his expense, he directed him to what was literally \"the best house in the place,\" namely, the family mansion of Mr. Featherstone. Goldsmith accordingly rode up to what he supposed to be an inn, ordered his horse to be taken to the stable, walked into the parlour, seated himself by the fire, and demanded what he could have for supper. On ordinary occasions he was diffident and even awkward in his manners, but here he was \"at ease in his inn,\" and felt called upon to show his manhood, and enact the experienced traveller. His person was by no means calculated to play off his pretensions, for he was short and thick, with a pockmarked face, and an air of carriage by no means of a distinguished cast. The owner of the house, however, soon discovered his whimsical mistake, and, being a man of humour, determined to indulge it, especially as he accidentally learned that this intruding guest was the son of an old acquaintance.\n\nAccordingly, Goldsmith was \"fooled to the top of his bent,\" and permitted to have full sway throughout the evening. Never was schoolboy more elated. When supper was served, he most condescendingly insisted that the landlord, his wife, and daughter, should partake, and ordered a bottle of wine to crown the repast and benefit the house. His last flourish was on going to bed, when he gave especial orders to have a hot cake at breakfast. His confusion and dismay, on discovering the next morning that he had been swaggering in this free and easy way in the house of a private gentleman, may be readily conceived. True to his habit of turning the events of his life to literary account, we find this chapter of ludicrous blunders and cross purposes dramatized many years afterwards in his admirable comedy of \"She Stoops to Conquer, or the Mistakes of a Night.\"\nCHAPTER II.\n\nWhile Oliver was making his way somewhat negligently through the schools, his elder brother Henry was rejoicing his father's heart by his career at the University. He soon distinguished himself at the examinations, and obtained a scholarship in 1743. This is a collegiate distinction which serves as a stepping-stone in any of the learned professions, and which leads to advancement in the University, should the individual choose to remain there. His father now trusted that he would push forward for that comfortable provision, a fellowship, and thence to higher dignities and emoluments. Henry, however, had the improvidence or the \"unworldliness\" of his race: returning to the country during the succeeding vacation, he married for love, relinquished, of course, all his collegiate prospects and advantages, set up a school in his father's neighbourhood, and buried his talents and acquirements for the remainder of his life in a curacy of forty pounds a year.\n\nAnother matrimonial event occurred not long afterwards in the Goldsmith family, to disturb the equanimity of its worthy head. This was the clandestine marriage of his daughter Catherine with a young gentleman of the name of Hodson, who had been confided to the care of her brother Henry to complete his studies. As the youth was of wealthy parentage, it was thought a lucky match for the Goldsmith family; but the tidings of the event stung the bride's father to the soul. Proud of his integrity, and jealous of that good name which was his chief possession, he saw himself and his family subjected to the degrading suspicion of having abused a trust reposed in them to promote a mercenary match. In the first transports of his feelings, he is said to have uttered a wish that his daughter might never have a child to bring like shame and sorrow on her head. The hasty wish, so contrary to the usual benignity of the man, was recalled and repented of almost as soon as uttered; but it was considered baleful in its effects by the superstitious neighbourhood; for, though his daughter bore three children, they all died before her.\n\nA more effectual measure was taken by Mr. Goldsmith to ward off the apprehended imputation, but one which imposed a heavy burden on his family. This was to furnish a marriage portion of four hundred pounds, that his daughter might\nnot be said to have entered her husband's family empty-handed. To raise the sum in cash was impossible; but he assigned to Mr. Hodson his little farm and the income of his tithes until the marriage portion should be paid. In the meantime, as his living did not amount to \u00a3200 per annum, he had to practise the strictest economy to pay off gradually this heavy tax incurred by his nice sense of honour.\n\nThe first of his family to feel the effects of this economy was Oliver. The time had now arrived for him to be sent to the University; and, accordingly, on the 11th June, 1747, when sixteen years of age, he entered Trinity College, Dublin; but his father was no longer able to place him there as a pensioner, as he had done his eldest son Henry; he was obliged, therefore, to enter him as a sizer, or \"poor scholar.\" He was lodged in one of the top rooms adjoining the library of the building, numbered 35, where it is said his name may still be seen, scratched by himself upon a window-frame.\n\nA student of this class is taught and boarded gratuitously, and has to pay but a very small sum for his room. It is expected, in return for his advantages, that he will be a diligent student, and render himself useful in a variety of ways. In Trinity College, at the time of Goldsmith's admission, several derogatory, and, indeed, menial offices were exacted from the sizer, as if the college sought to indemnify itself for conferring benefits by inflicting indignities. He was obliged to sweep part of the courts in the morning; to carry up the dishes from the kitchen to the fellows' table, and to wait in the hall until that body had dined. His very dress marked the inferiority of the \"poor student\" to his happier classmates. It was a black gown of coarse stuff without sleeves, and a plain black cloth cap without a tassel. We can conceive nothing more odious and ill-judged than these distinctions, which attached the idea of degradation to poverty, and placed the indigent youth of merit below the worthless minion of fortune. They were calculated to wound and irritate the noble mind, and to render the base mind baser.\n\nIndeed, the galling effect of these servile tasks upon youths of proud spirits and quick sensibilities became at length too notorious to be disregarded. About fifty years since, on a Trinity Sunday, a number of persons were assembled to witness the college ceremonies; and as a sizer was carrying up a dish of meat to the fellows' table, a burly citizen in the crowd\nmade some sneering observation on the servility of his office. Stung to the quick, the high-spirited youth instantly flung the dish and its contents at the head of the sneerer. The sizer was sharply reprimanded for this outbreak of wounded pride, but the degrading task was from that day forward very properly consigned to menial hands.\n\nIt was with the utmost repugnance that Goldsmith entered college in this capacity. His shy and sensitive nature was affected by the inferior station he was doomed to hold among his gay and opulent fellow-students, and he became, at times, moody and despondent. A recollection of these early mortifications induced him in after years, most strongly to dissuade his brother Henry, the clergyman, from sending a son to college on a like footing. \"If he has ambition, strong passions, and an exquisite sensibility of contempt, do not send him there, unless you have no other trade for him except your own.\"\n\nTo add to his annoyances, the fellow of the college who had the peculiar control of his studies, the Rev. Theaker Wilder, was a man of violent and capricious temper, and of diametrically opposite tastes. The tutor was devoted to the exact sciences; Goldsmith was for the classics. Wilder endeavoured to force his favourite studies upon the student by harsh means, suggested by his own coarse and savage nature. He abused him in presence of the class as ignorant and stupid; ridiculed him as awkward and ugly, and at times in the transports of his temper indulged in personal violence. The effect was to aggravate a passive distaste into a positive aversion. Goldsmith was loud in expressing his contempt for mathematics and his dislike of ethics and logic; and the prejudices thus imbibed continued through life. Mathematics he always pronounced a science to which the meanest intellects were competent.\n\nA truer cause of this distaste for the severer studies may probably be found in his natural indolence and his love of convivial pleasures. \"I was a lover of mirth, good-humour, and even sometimes of fun,\" said he, \"from my childhood.\" He sang a good song, was a boon companion, and could not resist any temptation to social enjoyment. He endeavoured to persuade himself that learning and dulness went hand in hand, and that genius was not to be put in harness. Even in riper years, when the consciousness of his own deficiencies\nought to have convinced him of the importance of early study, he speaks slightingly of college honours.\n\n\"A lad,\" says he, \"whose passions are not strong enough in youth to mislead him from that path of science, which his tutors, and not his inclinations, have chalked out, by four or five years' perseverance will probably obtain every advantage and honour his college can bestow. I would compare the man whose youth has been thus passed in the tranquillity of dispassionate prudence, to liquors that never ferment, and, consequently, continue always muddy.\"\n\nThe death of his worthy father, which took place early in 1747, rendered Goldsmith's situation at college extremely irksome. His mother was left with little more than the means of providing for the wants of her household, and was unable to furnish him any remittances. He would have been compelled, therefore, to leave college, had it not been for the occasional contributions of friends, the foremost among whom was his generous and warm-hearted uncle Contrarine. Still these supplies were so scanty and precarious, that in the intervals between them he was put to great straits. He had two college associates from whom he would occasionally borrow small sums; one was an early schoolmate, by the name of Beatty; the other a cousin, and the chosen companion of his frolics, Robert (or rather Bob) Bryanton, of Ballymulvey House, near Ballymahon. When these casual supplies failed him he was more than once obliged to raise funds for his immediate wants by pawning his books. At times he sank into despondency, but he had what he termed \"a knack at hoping,\" which soon buoyed him up again. He began now to resort to his poetical vein as a source of profit, scribbling street-ballads, which he privately sold for five shillings each at a shop which dealt in such small wares of literature. He felt an author's affection for these unowned bantlings, and we are told would stroll privately through the streets at night to hear them sung, listening to the comments and criticisms of by-standers, and observing the degree of applause which each received.\n\nEdmund Burke was a fellow-student with Goldsmith at the college. Neither the statesman nor the poet gave promise of their future celebrity, though Burke certainly surpassed his contemporary in industry and application; and evinced more disposition for self-improvement, associating himself with a num-\nber of his fellow-students in a debating club, in which they discussed literary topics, and exercised themselves in composition.\n\nGoldsmith may likewise have belonged to this association, but his propensity was rather to mingle with the gay and thoughtless. On one occasion we find him implicated in an affair that came nigh producing his expulsion. A report was brought to college that a scholar was in the hands of the bailiffs. This was an insult in which every gownsman felt himself involved. A number of the scholars flew to arms, and sallied forth to battle, headed by a hair-brained fellow nicknamed Gallows Walsh, noted for his aptness at mischief and fondness for riot. The stronghold of the bailiff was carried by storm, the scholar set at liberty, and the delinquent catchpole borne off captive to the college, where, having no pump to put him under, they satisfied the demands of collegiate law by ducking him in an old cistern.\n\nFlushed with this signal victory, Gallows Walsh now harangued his followers, and proposed to break open Newgate, or the Black Dog, as the prison was called, and effect a general jail delivery. He was answered by shouts of concurrence, and away went the throng of madcap youngsters, fully bent upon putting an end to the tyranny of law. They were joined by the mob of the city, and made an attack upon the prison with true Irish precipitation and thoughtlessness, never having provided themselves with cannon to batter its stone walls. A few shots from the prison brought them to their senses, and they beat a hasty retreat, two of the townsmen being killed, and several wounded.\n\nA severe scrutiny of this affair took place at the University. Four students, who had been ringleaders, were expelled; four others, who had been prominent in the affray, were publicly admonished; among the latter was the unlucky Goldsmith.\n\nTo make up for this disgrace, he gained, within a month afterward, one of the minor prizes of the college. It is true it was one of the very smallest, amounting in pecuniary value to but thirty shillings, but it was the first distinction he had gained in his whole collegiate career. This turn of success and sudden influx of wealth proved too much for the head of our poor student. He forthwith gave a supper and dance at his chamber to a number of young persons of both sexes from the city, in direct violation of college rules. The unwonted sound of the fiddle reached the ears of the implacable Wilder.\nHe rushed to the scene of unhallowed festivity, inflicted corporeal punishment on \"the father of the feast,\" and turned his astonished guests neck and heels out of doors.\n\nThis filled the measure of poor Goldsmith's humiliations; he felt degraded both within college and without. He dreaded the ridicule of his fellow-students for the ludicrous termination of his orgie, and he was ashamed to meet his city acquaintances after the degrading chastisement received in their presence, and after their own ignominious expulsion. Above all, he felt it impossible to submit any longer to the insulting tyranny of Wilder; he determined, therefore, to leave, not merely the college, but also his native land, and to bury what he conceived to be his irretrievable disgrace in some distant country. He accordingly sold his books and clothes, and sallied forth from the college walls the very next day, intending to embark at Cork for\u2014he scarce knew where\u2014America, or any other part beyond sea. With his usual heedless imprudence, however, he loitered about Dublin until his finances were reduced to a shilling; with this amount of specie he set out on his journey.\n\nFor three whole days he subsisted on his shilling, when that was spent, he parted with some of the clothes from his back, until, reduced almost to nakedness, he was four-and-twenty hours without food, insomuch that he declared a handful of grey peas, given to him by a girl at a wake, was one of the most delicious repasts he had ever tasted. Hunger, fatigue, and destitution brought down his spirit and calmed his anger. Fain would he have retraced his steps, could he have done so with any salvo for the lingerings of his pride. In this extremity, he conveyed to his brother Henry information of his distress, and of the rash project on which he had set out. His affectionate brother hastened to his relief; furnished him with money and clothes; soothed his feelings with gentle counsel; prevailed upon him to return to college, and effected an indifferent reconciliation between him and Wilder.\n\nAfter this irregular sally upon life, he remained nearly two years longer at the university, giving proofs of talent in occasional translations from the classics for one of which he received a premium, awarded only to those who are the first in literary merit. Still he never made much figure at college, his natural disinclination to study being increased by the\nharsh treatment he continued to experience from his tutor.\n\nAmong the anecdotes told of him while at college, is one indicative of that prompt, but thoughtless and often whimsical benevolence which throughout life formed one of the most eccentric, yet endearing points of his character. He was engaged to breakfast one day with a college intimate, but failed to make his appearance. His friend repaired to his room, knocked at the door, and was bidden to enter. To his surprise, he found Goldsmith in his bed, immersed to his chin in feathers. A serio-comic story explained the circumstance. In the course of the preceding evening's stroll he had met with a woman with five children, who implored his charity. Her husband was in the hospital; she was just from the country, a stranger, and destitute, without food or shelter for her helpless offspring. This was too much for the kind heart of Goldsmith. He was almost as poor as herself, it is true, and had no money in his pocket; but he brought her to the college gate, gave her the blankets from his bed to cover her little brood, and part of his clothes for her to sell and purchase food; and, finding himself cold during the night, had cut open his bed, and buried himself among the feathers.\n\nAt length, on the 27th of February, 1749, O.S., he was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and took his final leave of the university. He was freed from college rule, that emancipation so ardently coveted by the thoughtless student, and which too generally launches him amid the cares, the hardships, and vicissitudes of life. He was freed, too, from the brutal tyranny of Wilder. If his kind and placable nature could retain any resentment for past injuries, it might have been gratified by learning subsequently that the passionate career of Wilder was terminated by a violent death in the course of a dissolute brawl; but Goldsmith took no delight in the misfortunes even of his enemies.\n\nHe now returned to his friends, no longer the student to sport away the happy interval of vacation, but the anxious man, who is henceforth to shift for himself, and make his way through the world. In fact, he had no legitimate home to return to. At the death of his father, the paternal house at Lissoy, in which Goldsmith had passed his childhood, had been taken by Mr. Hodson, who had married his sister Catherine. His mother had removed to Ballymahon, where\nshe occupied a small house, and had to practice the severest frugality. His elder brother Henry served the curacy, and taught the school of his late father's parish, and lived in narrow circumstances at Goldsmith's birth-place, the old goblin-house at Pallas.\n\nNone of his relatives were in circumstances to aid him with anything more than a temporary home, and the aspect of every one seemed somewhat changed. In fact, his career at college had disappointed his friends, and they began to doubt his being the great genius they had fancied him. He whimsically alludes to this circumstance in that piece of autobiography, \"The Man in Black,\" in the Citizen of the World.\n\n\"The first opportunity my father had of finding his expectations disappointed was in the middling figure I made at the University: he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation, but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown. His disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having overrated my talents, and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time when my imagination and memory, yet unsatisfied, were more eager after new objects than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew. This, however, did not please my tutors, who observed, indeed, that I was a little dull, but at the same time allowed that I seemed to be very goodnatured, and had no harm in me.\"\n\nThe only one of his relatives who did not appear to lose faith in him was his uncle Contarine. This kind and considerate man, it is said, saw in him a warmth of heart requiring some skill to direct, and a latent genius that wanted time to mature, and these impressions none of his subsequent follies and irregularities wholly obliterated. His purse and affection, therefore, as well as his house, were now open to him, and he became his chief counsellor and director after his father's death. He urged him to prepare for holy orders; and others of his relatives concurred in the advice. Goldsmith had a settled repugnance to a clerical life. This has been ascribed by some to conscientious scruples, not considering himself of a temper and frame of mind for such a sacred office: others attributed it to his roving propensities, and his desire to visit foreign countries; he himself gives a whimsical objection in his biography of the \"Man in Black:\"\u2014\"To be\n\n* Citizen of the World, Letter xxvii.\nobliged to wear a long wig when I liked a short one, or a black coat when I generally dressed in brown, I thought such a restraint upon my liberty that I absolutely rejected the proposal.\"\n\nIn effect, however, his scruples were overruled, and he agreed to qualify himself for the office. He was now only twenty-one, and must pass two years of probation. They were two years of rather loitering, unsettled life. Sometimes he was at Lissoy, participating with thoughtless enjoyment in the rural sports and occupations of his brother-in-law, Mr. Hodson; sometimes he was with his brother Henry, at the old goblin mansion at Pallas, assisting him occasionally in his school. The early marriage and unambitious retirement of Henry, though so subversive of the fond plans of his father, had proved happy in their results. He was already surrounded by a blooming family, he was contented with his lot, beloved by his parishioners, and lived in the daily practice of all the amiable virtues, and the immediate enjoyment of their reward. Of the tender affection inspired in the breast of Goldsmith, by the constant kindness of this excellent brother, and of the longing recollection with which, in the lonely wanderings of after years, he looked back upon this scene of domestic felicity, we have a touching instance in the well-known opening to his poem of \"The Traveller:\"\n\n\"Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow,\nOr by the lazy Scheld or wandering Po;\nWhere'er I roam, whatever realms to see,\nMy heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee;\nStill to my brother turns with ceaseless pain,\nAnd drags at each remove a lengthening chain.\n\nEternal blessings crown my earliest friend,\nAnd round his dwelling guardian saints attend:\nBless'd be that spot, where cheerful guests retire\nTo pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;\nBless'd that abode, where want and pain repair,\nAnd every stranger finds a ready chair:\nBless'd be those feasts with simple plenty crown'd,\nWhere all the ruddy family around\nLaugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,\nOr sigh with pity at some mournful tale;\nOr press the bashful stranger to his food,\nAnd learn the luxury of doing good.\"\n\nDuring this loitering life Goldsmith pursued no study, but\nrather amused himself with miscellaneous reading, such as biography, travels, poetry, novels, plays\u2014everything, in short, that administered to the imagination. Sometimes he strolled along the banks of the river Inny; where in after years, when he had become famous, his favourite seats and haunts used to be pointed out. Often he joined in the rustic sports of the villagers, and became adroit at throwing the sledge, a favourite feat of activity and strength in Ireland. Recollections of these \"healthful sports\" we find in his \"Deserted Village:\"\n\n\"How often have I bless'd the coming day,\nWhen toil remitting lent its turn to play,\nAnd all the village train, from labour free,\nLed up their sports beneath the spreading tree;\nAnd many a gambol frolicked o'er the ground,\nAnd sleights of art, and feats of strength went round.\"\n\nA boon companion in all his rural amusements was his cousin and college crony, Robert Bryanton, with whom he sojourned occasionally at Ballymulvey House, in the neighbourhood. They used to make excursions about the country on foot, sometimes fishing, sometimes hunting otter in the Inny. They got into a country club at the little inn of Ballymahon, of which Goldsmith soon became the oracle and prime wit; astonishing his unlettered associates by his learning, and being considered capital at a song and a story. From the rustic conviviality of the inn at Ballymahon, and the company which used to assemble there, it is surmised that he took some hints in after life for his picturing of Tony Lumpkin and his associates: \"Dick Muggins, the exciseman; Jack Slang, the horse doctor; little Aminadab, that grinds the music box; and Tom Twist, that spins the pewter platter.\" Nay, it is thought that Tony's drinking song at the \"Three Jolly Pigeons\" was but a revival of one of the convivial catches at Ballymahon:\n\n\"Then come put the jorum about,\nAnd let us be merry and clever,\nOur hearts and our liquors are stout,\nHere's the Three Jolly Pigeons for ever.\nLet some cry of woodcock or hare,\nYour bustards, your ducks, and your widgeons,\nBut of all the gay birds in the air,\nHere's health to the Three Jolly Pigeons.\nToroddle, toroddle, toroll.\"\n\nNotwithstanding all these accomplishments, and this rural\npopularity, his friends began to shake their heads and shrug their shoulders when they spoke of him; and his brother Henry noted, with anything but satisfaction, his frequent visits to the club at Ballymahon. He emerged, however, unscathed from this dangerous ordeal, more fortunate in this respect than his comrade Bryanton; but he retained throughout life a fondness for clubs: often, too, in the course of his chequered career he looked back to this period of rural sports and careless enjoyments as one of the few sunny spots of his clouded life; and though he ultimately rose to associate with birds of a finer feather, his heart would still yearn in secret after the \"Three Jolly Pigeons.\"\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nThe time was now arrived for Goldsmith to apply for orders, and he presented himself accordingly before the Bishop of Elfin for ordination. We have stated his great objection to clerical life, the obligation to wear a black coat; and whimsical as it may appear, dress seems, in fact, to have formed an obstacle to his entrance into the church. He had ever a passion for clothing his sturdy, but awkward little person in gay colours; and on this solemn occasion, when it was to be supposed his garb would be of suitable gravity, he appeared luminously arrayed in scarlet breeches! He was rejected by the bishop, some say for want of sufficient studious preparation; his rambles and frolics with Bob Bryanton, and his revels with the club at Ballymahon, having been much in the way of his theological studies; others attribute his rejection to reports of his college irregularities, which the Bishop had received from his old tyrant Wilder; but those who look into the matter with more knowing eyes pronounce the scarlet breeches to have been the fundamental objection. \"My friends,\" says Goldsmith, speaking through his humourous representative, the \"Man in Black\"\u2014\"my friends were now perfectly satisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one that had not the least harm in him, and was so very good-natured.\" His uncle Contarine, however, still remained unwavering in his kindness, though much less sanguine in his expectations. He now looked round for a humbler sphere of action, and through his influence and exertions Oliver was received as tutor in the family...\nof a Mr. Flinn, a gentleman of the neighbourhood. The situation was apparently respectable; he had his seat at the table, and joined the family in their domestic recreations and their evening game at cards. There was a servility, however, in his position, which was not to his taste: nor did his deference for the family increase upon familiar intercourse. He charged a member of it with unfair play at cards. A violent altercation ensued, which ended in his throwing up his situation as tutor. On being paid off, he found himself in possession of an unheard-of amount of money. His wandering propensity and his desire to see the world were instantly in the ascendency. Without communicating his plans or intentions to his friends, he procured a good horse, and, with thirty pounds in his pocket, made his second sally forth into the world.\n\nThe worthy niece and housekeeper of the hero of La Mancha could not have been more surprised and dismayed at one of the Don's clandestine expeditions, than were the mother and friends of Goldsmith when they heard of his mysterious departure. Weeks elapsed, and nothing was seen or heard of him. It was feared that he had left the country on one of his wandering freaks, and his poor mother was reduced almost to despair, when one day he arrived at her door almost as forlorn in plight as the prodigal son. Of his thirty pounds, not a shilling was left; and instead of the goodly steed on which he had issued forth on his errantry, he was mounted on a sorry little pony, which he had nicknamed Fiddle-back. As soon as his mother was well assured of his safety, she rated him soundly for his inconsiderate conduct. His brothers and sisters, who were tenderly attached to him, interfered, and succeeded in mollifying her ire; and whatever lurking anger the good dame might have, was, no doubt effectually vanquished by the following whimsical narrative which he drew up at his brother's house and despatched to her.\n\n\"My dear mother, if you will sit down and calmly listen to what I say, you shall be fully resolved in every one of those many questions you have asked me. I went to Cork, and converted my horse, which you prize so much higher than Fiddle-back, into cash, took my passage in a ship bound for America, and, at the same time, paid the captain for my freight, and all the other expenses of my voyage. But it so happened that the wind did not answer for three weeks; and you know, mother, that I could not command the elements. My misfortune was, that,\nwhen the wind served, I happened to be with a party in the country, and my friend the captain never inquired after me, but set sail with as much indifference as if I had been on board. The remainder of my time I employed in the city and its environs, viewing everything curious, and you know no one can starve while he has money in his pocket.\n\n\"Reduced, however, to my last two guineas, I began to think of my dear mother and friends whom I had left behind me, and so bought that generous beast Fiddle-back, and bade adieu to Cork with only five shillings in my pocket. This, to be sure, was but a scanty allowance for man and horse towards a journey of above a hundred miles; but I did not despair, for I knew I must find friends on the road.\n\n\"I recollected particularly an old and faithful acquaintance I made at college, who had often and earnestly pressed me to spend a summer with him, and he lived but eight miles from Cork. This circumstance of vicinity he would expatiate on to me with peculiar emphasis. 'We shall,' says he, 'enjoy the delights of both city and country, and you shall command my stable and my purse.'\n\n\"However, upon the way I met a poor woman all in tears, who told me her husband had been arrested for a debt he was not able to pay, and that his eight children must now starve, bereaved as they were of his industry, which had been their only support. I thought myself at home, being not far from my good friend's house, and, therefore, parted with a moiety of all my store; and, pray mother, ought I not have given her the other half-crown, for what she got would be of little use to her? However, I soon arrived at the mansion of my affectionate friend, guarded by the vigilance of a huge mastiff, who flew at me, and would have torn me to pieces but for the assistance of a woman, whose countenance was not less grim than that of the dog; yet she with great humanity relieved me from the jaws of this Cerberus, and was prevailed on to carry up my name to her master.\n\n\"Without suffering me to wait long, my old friend, who was then recovering from a severe fit of sickness, came down in his nightcap, nightgown, and slippers, and embraced me with the most cordial welcome, showed me in, and, after giving me a history of his indisposition, assured me that he considered himself peculiarly fortunate in having under his roof the man he most loved on earth, and whose stay with him must, above all things, contribute to perfect his recovery. I now repented sorely I had not given the poor woman the other half-crown, as I thought all my bills of humanity would be punctually answered by this worthy man. I revealed to him my whole soul; I opened to him all my distresses; and freely owned that I had but one half crown in my pocket; but that now, like a ship after weathering out the storm, I considered myself secure in a safe and hospitable harbour. He made no answer, but walked about the room, rubbing his hands as one in deep study. This I imputed to the sympathetic feelings of a tender heart, which increased my esteem for him, and, as that increased, I gave the most favourable interpretation to his silence. I construed it into delicacy of sentiment, as if he dreaded to wound my pride by expressing his commiseration in words, leaving his generous conduct to speak for itself.\n\"It now approached six o'clock in the evening; and as I had eaten no breakfast, and as my spirits were raised, my appetite for dinner grew uncommonly keen. At length the old woman came into the room with two plates, one spoon, and a dirty cloth, which she laid upon the table. This appearance, without increasing my spirits, did not diminish my appetite. My protectress soon returned with a small bowl of asgo, a small porringer of sour milk, a loaf of stale brown bread, and the heel of an old cheese all over crawling with mites. My friend apologised that his illness obliged him to live on slops, and that better fare was not in the house; observing, at the same time, that a milk diet was certainly the most healthful; and at eight o'clock he again recommended a regular life, declaring that for his part he would lie down with the lamb and rise with the lark. My hunger was at this time so exceedingly sharp, that I wished for another slice of the loaf, but was obliged to go to bed without even that refreshment.\n\n\"This lenient entertainment I had received made me resolve to depart as soon as possible; accordingly, next morning, when I spoke of going, he did not oppose my resolution; he rather commended my design, adding some very sage counsel upon the occasion. 'To be sure,' said he, 'the longer you stay away from your mother, the more you will grieve her and your other friends; and possibly they are already afflicted at hearing of this foolish expedition you have made.' Notwithstanding all this, and without any hope of softening such a sordid heart, I again renewed the tale of my distress, and asking how he thought I could travel above a hundred miles upon one half crown? I begged to borrow a single guinea, which, I assured him, should be repaid with thanks. 'And you know, sir,' said I, 'it is no more than I have done for you.' To which he firmly answered, 'Why look you, Mr. Goldsmith, that is neither here nor there. I have paid you all you ever lent me, and this sickness of mine has left me bare of cash. But I have thought myself of a conveyance for you; sell your horse, and I will furnish you a much better one to ride on.' I readily grasped at his proposal, and begged to see the nag; on which he led me to his bedchamber, and from under the bed he pulled out a stout oak stick. 'Here he is,' said he; 'take this in your hand, and it will carry you to your mother's with more safety than such a horse as you ride.' I was in doubt, when I got it into my hand, whether I should not, in the first place, apply it to his pate; but a rap at the street door made the wretch fly to it, and when I returned to the parlour, he introduced me, as if nothing of the kind had happened, to the gentleman who entered, as Mr. Goldsmith, his most ingenious and worthy friend, of whom he had so often heard him speak with rapture. I could scarcely compose myself; and must have betrayed indignation in my mien to the stranger, who was a counsellor-at-law in the neighbourhood, a man of engaging aspect and polite address.\n\nAfter spending an hour, he asked my friend and me to dine with him at his house. This I declined at first, as I wished to have no farther communication with my hospitable friend; but at the solicitation of both, I at last consented, determined as I was by two motives; one, that I was prejudiced in favour of the looks and manner of the counsellor;\nand the other, that I stood in need of a comfortable dinner. And there, indeed, I found everything that I could wish, abundance without profusion, and elegance without affectation. In the evening, when my old friend, who had eaten very plentifully at his neighbour's table, but talked again of lying down with the lamb, made a motion to me for retiring, our generous host requested I should take a bed with him, upon which I plainly told my old friend that he might go home and take care of the horse he had given me, but that I never should re-enter his doors. He went away with a laugh, leaving me to add this to the other little things the counsellor already knew of his plausible neighbour.\n\n\"And now, my dear mother, I found sufficient to reconcile me to all my follies; for here I spent three whole days. The counsellor had two sweet girls for his daughters, who played enchantingly on the harpsichord; and yet it was but a melancholy pleasure I felt the first time I heard them; for that being the first time also that either of them had touched the instrument since their mother's death, I saw the tears in silence trickle down their father's cheeks. I every day endeavoured to go away, but every day was pressed and obliged to stay. On my going, the counsellor offered me his purse, with a horse and servant to convey me home; but the latter I declined, and only took a guinea to bear my necessary expenses on the road.\n\n\"To Mrs. Anne Goldsmith, Ballymahon.\"\n\nSuch is the story given by the poet-errant of this his second sally in quest of adventures. We cannot but think it was here and there touched up a little with the fanciful pen of the future essayist, with a view to amuse his mother and soften her vexation; but even in these respects it is valuable, as showing the early play of his humour, and his happy knack of extracting sweets from that worldly experience which to others yields nothing but bitterness.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nA new consultation was held among Goldsmith's friends as to his future course, and it was determined he should try the law. His uncle Contarine agreed to advance the necessary funds, and actually furnished him with fifty pounds, with which he set off for London, to enter on his studies at the Temple. Unfortunately, he fell in company at Dublin with a Roscommon acquaintance, one whose wits had been sharpened about town, who beguiled him into a gambling-house, and soon left him as penniless as when he bestrode the redoubtable Fiddle-back.\nHe was so ashamed of this fresh instance of gross heedlessness and imprudence, that he remained some time in Dublin without communicating to his friends his destitute condition. They heard of it, however, and he was invited back to the country, and indulgently forgiven by his generous uncle, but less readily by his mother, who was mortified and disheartened at seeing all her early hopes of him so repeatedly blighted. His brother Henry, too, began to lose patience at these successive failures, resulting from thoughtless indiscretion; and a quarrel took place, which for some time interrupted their usually affectionate intercourse.\n\nThe only home where poor erring Goldsmith still received a welcome, was the parsonage of his affectionate and forgiving uncle. Here he used to talk of literature with the good simple-hearted man, and delight him and his daughter with his verses. Jane, his early playmate, was now the woman grown; their intercourse was of a more intellectual kind than formerly; they discoursed of poetry and music; she played on the harpsichord, and he accompanied her with his flute. The music may not have been very artistic, as he never performed but by ear; it had probably as much merit as the poetry, which, if we may judge by the following specimen, was as yet but juvenile:\n\nTO A YOUNG LADY ON VALENTINE'S DAY,\nWITH THE DRAWING OF A HEART.\n\nWith submission at your shrine,\nComes a heart your Valentine,\nFrom the side where once it grew,\nSee it panting flies to you.\nTake it, fair one, to your breast,\nSoothe the fluttering thing to rest;\nLet the gentle, spotless toy,\nBe your sweetest, greatest joy.\nEvery night when wrapp'd in sleep,\nNext your heart the conquest keep;\nOr if dreams your fancy move,\nHear it whisper me and love;\nThen in pity to the swain,\nWho must heartless else remain,\nSoft as gentle dewy show'rs,\nSlow descend on April flowers;\nSoft as gentle riv'lets glide,\nSteal unnoticed to my side;\nIf the gem you have to spare,\nTake your own and place it there.\nIf this valentine was intended for the fair Jane, and expressive of a tender sentiment indulged by the stripling poet, it was unavailing; as not long afterwards she was married to a Mr. Lawder. We trust, however, it was but a poetical passion of that transient kind which grows up in idleness and exhales itself in rhyme. While Oliver was thus piping and poetizing at the parsonage, his uncle Contarine received a visit from Dean Goldsmith of Cloyne; a kind of magnate in the wide, but improvident family connexion, throughout which his word was law and almost gospel. This august dignitary was pleased to discover signs of talent in Oliver, and suggested that as he had attempted divinity and law without success, he should now try physic. The advice came from too important a source to be disregarded, and it was determined to send him to Edinburgh to commence his studies. The Dean having given the advice added to it, we trust, his blessing, but no money; that was furnished from the scantier purses of Goldsmith's brother, his sister (Mrs. Hodson) and his ever-ready uncle Contarine.\n\nIt was in the autumn of 1752 that Goldsmith arrived in Edinburgh. His outset in that city came near adding to the list of his indiscretions and disasters. Having taken lodgings at hap-hazard, he left his trunk there, containing all his worldly effects, and sallied forth to see the town. After sauntering about the streets until a late hour, he thought of returning home, when to his confusion, he found he had not acquainted himself with the name either of his landlady, or of the street in which she lived. Fortunately, in the height of his whimsical perplexity, he met the cawdy or porter, who had carried his trunk, and who now served him as a guide.\n\nHe did not remain long in the lodgings in which he had put up. The hostess was too adroit at that hocus-pocus of the table which often is practised in cheap boarding-houses. No one could conjure a single joint through a greater variety of forms. A loin of mutton, according to Goldsmith's account, would serve him and two fellow-students a whole week. \"A branded chop was served up one day, a fried steak another, collops with onion-sauce a third, and so on, until the fleshy parts were quite consumed, when finally a dish of broth was manufactured from the bones on the seventh day, and the landlady rested from her labours.\" Goldsmith had a good-humoured mode of taking things, and for a short time amused\nhimself with the shifts and expedients of his landlady, which struck him in a ludicrous manner: he soon, however, fell in with fellow-students from his own country, whom he joined at more eligible quarters.\n\nHe now attended medical lectures, and attached himself to an association of students called the Medical Society. He set out, as usual, with the best intentions, but as usual, soon fell into idle, convivial, thoughtless habits. Edinburgh was indeed a place of sore trial for one of his temperament. Convivial meetings were all the vogue, and the tavern was the universal rallying-place of good-fellowship. And then Goldsmith's intimacies lay chiefly among the Irish students, who were always ready for a wild freak and frolic. Among them he was a prime favourite, and somewhat of a leader, from his exuberance of spirits, his vein of humour, and his talent at singing an Irish song, and telling an Irish story.\n\nHis usual carelessness in money matters attended him. Though his supplies from home were scanty and irregular, he never could bring himself into habits of prudence and economy; often he was stripped of all his present finances at play; often he lavished them away in fits of unguarded charity or generosity. Sometimes among his boon companions he assumed a ludicrous swagger in money matters, which no one afterwards was more ready than himself to laugh at. At a convivial meeting with a number of his fellow-students, he suddenly proposed to draw lots with any one present, which of the two should treat the whole party to the play. The moment the proposition had bolted from his lips, his heart was in his throat. \"To my great though secret joy,\" said he, \"they all declined the challenge. Had it been accepted, and had I proved the loser, a part of my wardrobe must have been pledged in order to raise the money.\"\n\nAt another of these meetings, there was an earnest dispute on the question of ghosts, some being firm believers in the possibility of departed spirits returning to visit their friends and familiar haunts. One of the disputants set sail the next day for London, but the vessel put back through stress of weather. His return was unknown, except to one of the believers in ghosts, who concerted with him a trick to be played off on the opposite party. In the evening, at a meeting of the students, the discussion was renewed; and one of the most strenuous opposers of ghosts was asked whether he\nconsidered himself proof against ocular demonstration? He persisted in his scoffing. Some solemn process of conjuration was performed, and the comrade supposed to be on his way to London, made his appearance. The effect was fatal. The unbeliever fainted at the sight, and ultimately went mad. We have no account of what share Goldsmith took in this transaction, at which he was present.\n\nThe following letter to his friend Bryanton, contains some of Goldsmith's impressions concerning Scotland and its inhabitants, and gives indications of that humour which characterized some of his later writings.\n\n\"Robert Bryanton, at Ballymahon, Ireland.\n\n\"Edinburgh, September 26th, 1753.\n\n\"My dear Bob,\n\n\"How many good excuses (and you know that I was ever good at an excuse) might I call up to vindicate my past shameful silence. I might tell how I wrote a long letter on my first coming hither, and seem vastly angry at my not receiving an answer; I might allege that business (with business you know I was always pestered) had never given me time to finger a pen. But I suppress these and twenty more as plausible, and as easily invented, since they might be attended with a slight inconvenience of being known to be lies. Let me, then, speak truth. An hereditary indolence (I have it from my mother's side) has hitherto prevented my writing to you, and still prevents my writing at least twenty-five letters more, due to my friends in Ireland. No turn-split dog gets up into his wheel with more reluctance than I sit down to write; yet no dog ever loves the roast meat he turns better than I do him I now address.\n\n\"Yet what shall I say now I am entered? Shall I tire you with a description of this unfruitful country; where I must lead you over their hills all brown with heath, or their valleys, scarcely able to feed a rabbit? Man alone seems to be the only creature who has arrived to the natural size in this poor soil. Every part of the country presents the same dismal landscape. No grove nor brook lend their music to cheer the stranger, or make the inhabitants forget their poverty. Yet with all these disadvantages to call him down to humility, a Scotchman is one of the proudest things alive. The poor have pride ever ready to relieve them. If mankind should happen to despise them, they are masters of their own admiration; and that they can plentifully bestow upon themselves.\n\n\"From their pride and poverty, as I take it, results one advantage this country enjoys, namely, the gentlemen here are much better bred than among us. No such character here as our fox-hunters; and they have expressed great surprise when I informed them that some men in Ireland, of one thousand pounds a year, spend their whole lives in running after a hare, and drinking to be drunk. Truly if such a being, equipped in his hunting dress, came among a circle of Scotch gentry,\nthey would behold him with the same astonishment that a countryman does King George on horseback.\n\n\"The men here have generally high cheek bones, and are lean and swarthy, fond of action, dancing in particular. Now that I have mentioned dancing, let me say something of their balls, which are very frequent here. When a stranger enters the dancing-hall, he sees one end of the room taken up by the ladies, who sit dismally in a group by themselves; in the other end stand their pensive partners that are to be;\u2014but no more intercourse between the sexes than there is between two countries at war. The ladies, indeed, may ogle, and the gentlemen sigh; but an embargo is laid on any closer commerce. At length, to interrupt hostilities, the lady directess, or intendant, or what you will, pitches upon a lady and gentleman to walk a minuet; which they perform with a formality that approaches to despondence. After five or six couple have thus walked the gauntlet, all stand up to country-dances; each gentleman furnished with a partner from the aforesaid lady directress; so they dance much, say nothing, and thus concludes our assembly. I told a Scotch gentleman that such profound silence resembled the ancient procession of the Roman matrons in honour of Ceres; and the Scotch gentleman told me (and, faith, I believe he was right,) that I was a very great pedant for my pains.\n\n\"Now I am come to the ladies; and to show that I love Scotland, and everything that belongs to so charming a country, I insist on it, and will give him leave to break my head that denies it, that the Scotch ladies are ten thousand times finer and handsomer than the Irish. To be sure, now I see your sisters, Betty and Peggy, vastly surprised at my partiality,\u2014but tell them flatly, I don't value them, or their fine skins, or eyes, or good sense, or\u2014a potatoe,\u2014for I say, and will maintain it; and as a convincing proof (I am in a great passion) of what I assert, the Scotch ladies say it themselves. But to be less serious; where will you find a language so prettily become a pretty mouth as the broad Scotch? And the women here speak it in its highest purity; for instance, teach one of your young ladies at home to pronounce the 'Whoar will I gong?' with a becoming widening of mouth, and I'll lay my life they'll wound every hearer.\n\n\"We have no such character here as a coquet, but alas! how many envious prudes? Some days ago, I walked into my Lord Kilconbry's (don't be surprised, my lord is but a glover),\" when the Duchess of Hamilton (that fair who sacrificed her beauty to her ambition, and her inward peace to a title and gilt equipage) passed by in her chariot; her hattered husband, or more properly the guardian of her charms, sat by her side. Straight envy began, in the shape of no less than three ladies who sat with me, to find faults in her faultless form.\u2014'For my part,' says the first, 'I think, what I always thought, that the Duchess has too much of the red in her complexion.' 'Madam, I am of your opinion,' says\n\n* William Maclellan, who claimed the title, and whose son succeeded in establishing the claim in 1773. The father is said to have voted at the election of the sixteen peers for Scotland; and to have sold gloves in the lobby at this and other public assemblages.\nthe second; 'I think her face has a palish cast, too much on the delicate order.' 'and let me tell you,' added the third lady, whose mouth was puckered up to the size of an issue, 'that the Duchess has fine lips, but she wants a mouth.' At this every lady drew up her mouth as if going to pronounce the letter P.\n\n\"But how ill, my Bob, does it become me to ridicule women with whom I have scarcely any correspondence! There are, 'tis certain, handsome women here; and 'tis certain they have handsome men to keep them company. An ugly and poor man is society only for himself; and such society the world lets me enjoy in great abundance. Fortune has given you circumstances, and nature a person to look charming in the eyes of the fair. Nor do I envy, my dear Bob, such blessings, while I may sit down and laugh at the world and at myself\u2014the most ridiculous object in it. But you see I am grown downright splenetic, and perhaps, the fit may continue till I receive an answer to this. I know you cannot send me much news from Ballymahon, but such as it is, send it all; everything you send will be agreeable to me.\n\n\"Has George Conway put up a sign yet; or John Binley left off drinking drams; or Tom Allen got a new wig? But I leave you to your own choice what to write. While I live, know you have a true friend in yours, &c. &c. &c.\n\n\"Oliver Goldsmith.\n\n\"P.S.\u2014Give my sincere respects (not compliments, do you mind,) to your agreeable family, and give my service to my mother, if you see her; for, as you express it in Ireland, I have a sneaking kindness for her still. Direct to me, \u2014\u2014, Student in Physic, in Edinburgh.\"\n\nNothing worthy of preservation appeared from his pen during his residence in Edinburgh; and indeed his poetical powers, highly as they had been estimated by his friends, had not as yet, produced anything of superior merit. He made on one occasion a month's excursion to the Highlands. \"I set out the first day on foot,\" says he, in a letter to his uncle Contarine, \"but an ill-natured corn I have on my toe, has for the future prevented that cheap mode of travelling; so the second day, I hired a horse about the size of a ram, and he walked away (trot he could not) as pensive as his master.\"\n\nDuring his residence in Scotland, his convivial talents gained him at one time attentions in a high quarter, which, however, he had the good sense to appreciate correctly. \"I have spent,\" says he, in one of his letters, \"more than a fortnight every second day at the Duke of Hamilton's; but it seems they like me more as a jester than as a companion, so I disdained so servile an employment, as unworthy my calling as a physician.\" Here we again find the origin of another passage in his autobiography, under the character of the \"Man in Black,\" wherein that worthy figures as a flatterer\nto a great man. \"At first,\" says he, \"I was surprised that the situation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought disagreeable; there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke, and laughing when he looked round for applause. This, even good manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too soon, his lordship was a greater dunce than myself, and from that moment flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at setting him right, than at receiving his absurdities with submission; to flatter those we do not know is an easy task; but to flatter our intimate acquaintances, all whose foibles are strongly in our eyes, is drudgery insupportable. Every time I now opened my lips in praise, my falsehood went to my conscience; his lordship soon perceived me to be very unfit for his service; I was therefore discharged; my patron, at the same time, being graciously pleased to observe that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the least harm in me.\"\n\nAfter spending two winters at Edinburgh, Goldsmith prepared to finish his medical studies on the Continent, for which his uncle Contarine agreed to furnish the funds. \"I intend,\" said he, in a letter to his uncle, \"to visit Paris, where the great Farheim, Petit, and Du Hammel de Monceau instruct their pupils in all the branches of medicine. They speak French, and consequently I shall have much the advantage of most of my countrymen, as I am perfectly acquainted with that language, and few who leave Ireland are so. I shall spend the spring and summer in Paris, and the beginning of next winter go to Leyden. The great Albinus is still alive there, and 'twill be proper to go, though only to have it said that we have studied in so famous a University.\n\n\"As I shall not have another opportunity of receiving money from your bounty till my return to Ireland, so I have drawn for the last sum that I hope I shall ever trouble you for; 'tis 20l. And now, dear sir, let me acknowledge the humility or the station in which you found me; let me tell how I was despised by most, and hateful to myself. Poverty, hopeless poverty, was my lot, and Melancholy was beginning to make me her own. When you \u2014\u2014 but I stop here, to inquire how your health goes on? How does my cousin Jenny, and has she recovered her late complaint? How does my poor Jack Goldsmith? I fear his disorder is of such a\nnature as he won't easily recover. I wish, my dear sir, you would make me happy by another letter before I go abroad, for there I shall hardly hear from you. * * Give my\u2014how shall I express it? Give my earnest love to Mr. and Mrs. Lawder.\"\n\nMrs. Lawder was Jane, his early playmate\u2014the object of his valentine\u2014his first poetical inspiration. She had been for sometime married.\n\nMedical instruction, it will be perceived, was the ostensible motive for this visit to the Continent, but the real one, in all probability, was his long-cherished desire to see foreign parts. This, however, he would not acknowledge even to himself, but sought to reconcile his roving propensities with some grand moral purpose. \"I esteem the traveller who instructs the heart,\" says he, in one of his subsequent writings, \"but despise him who only indulges the imagination. A man who leaves home to mend himself and others, is a philosopher; but he who goes from country to country, guided by the blind impulse of curiosity, is only a vagabond.\" He, of course, was to travel as a philosopher, and in truth his outfits for a continental tour were in character. \"I shall carry just \u00a33l. to France,\" said he, \"with good store of clothes, shirts, &c., and that with economy will suffice.\" He forgot to make mention of his flute, which it will be found had occasionally to come in play when economy could not replenish his purse, nor philosophy find him a supper. Thus slenderly provided with money, prudence or experience, and almost as slightly guarded against \"hard knocks\" as the hero of La Mancha, whose head-piece was half iron, half pasteboard, he made his final sally forth upon the world; hoping all things, believing all things; little anticipating the chequered ills in store for him; little thinking, when he penned his valedictory letter to his good uncle Contarine, that he was never to see him more; never to return after all his wandering to the friend of his infancy; never to revisit his early and fondly-remembered haunts at \"sweet Lissoy\" and Ballymahon.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHis usual indiscretion attended Goldsmith at the very outset of his foreign enterprise. He had intended to take shipping at Leith for Holland; but on arriving at that port, he\nfound a ship about to sail for Bordeaux, with six agreeable passengers, whose acquaintance he had probably made at the inn. He was not a man to resist a sudden impulse; so, instead of embarking for Holland, he found himself ploughing the seas on his way to the other side of the continent. Scarcely had the ship been two days at sea, when she was driven by stress of weather to Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Here, of course, Goldsmith and his agreeable fellow-passengers found it expedient to go on shore and \"refresh themselves after the fatigues of the voyage.\" Of course they frolicked and made merry until a late hour in the evening, when, in the midst of their hilarity, the door was burst open, and a sergeant and twelve grenadiers entered with fixed bayonets, and took the whole convivial party prisoners.\n\nIt seems that the agreeable companions with whom our hero had struck up such a sudden intimacy, were Scotchmen in the French service, who had been in Scotland enlisting recruits for the French army.\n\nIn vain Goldsmith protested his innocence; he was marched off with his fellow-revellers to prison, whence he with difficulty obtained his release at the end of a fortnight. With his customary facility, however, at palliating his misadventures, he found everything turn out for the best. His imprisonment saved his life, for during his detention, the ship proceeded on her voyage, but was wrecked at the mouth of the Garonne, and all on board perished.\n\nGoldsmith's second embarkation was for Holland direct, and in nine days he arrived at Rotterdam, whence he proceeded, without any more deviations, to Leyden. He gives a whimsical picture, in one of his letters, of the appearance of the Hollander. \"The modern Dutchman is quite a different creature from him of former times: he in everything imitates a Frenchmen but in his easy, disengaged air. He is vastly ceremonious, and is, perhaps, exactly what a Frenchman might have been in the reign of Louis XIV. Such are the better bred. But the downright Hollander is one of the oddest figures in nature. Upon a lank head of hair he wears a half-cocked narrow hat, laced with black riband; no coat, but seven waistcoats and nine pair of breeches, so that his hips reach up almost to his armpits. This well-clothed vegetable is now fit to see company or make love. But what a pleasing creature is the object of his appetite! why, sho\nwears a large fur cap, with a deal of Flanders lace; and for every pair of breeches he carries, she puts on two petticoats.\n\n\"A Dutch lady burns nothing about her phlegmatic admirer but his tobacco. You must know, sir, every woman carries in her hand a stove of coals, which, when she sits, she snugs under her petticoats, and at this chimney dozing Strephon lights his pipe.\"\n\nIn the same letter, he contrasts Scotland and Holland. \"There, hills and rocks intercept every prospect; here, it is all a continued plain. There you might see a well-dressed duchess issuing from a dirty close, and here a dirty Dutchman inhabiting a palace. The Scotch may be compared to a tulip planted in dung; but I can never see a Dutchman in his own house, but I think of a magnificent Egyptian temple dedicated to an ox.\"\n\nThe country itself awakened his admiration. \"Nothing,\" said he, \"can equal its beauty; wherever I turn my eyes, fine houses, elegant gardens, statues, grottoes, vistas, present themselves; but when you enter their towns, you are charmed beyond description. No misery is to be seen here; every one is usefully employed.\" And again, in his noble description in \"The Traveller\":\n\n\"To men of other minds my fancy flies,\nImbosom'd in the deep where Holland lies.\nMethinks her patient sons before me stand,\nWhere the broad ocean leans against the land,\nAnd, sedulous to stop the coming tide,\nLift the tall rampire's artificial pride.\nOnward, methinks, and diligently slow,\nThe firm connected bulwark seems to grow;\nSpreads its long arms amid the watery roar,\nScoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.\nWhile the pent ocean, rising o'er the pile,\nSees an amphibious world before him smile;\nThe slow canal, the yellow-blossom'd vale,\nThe willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,\nThe crowded mart, the cultivated plain,\nA new creation rescued from his reign.\"\n\nHe remained about a year at Leyden, attending the lectures of Gaubius on chemistry, and Albinus on anatomy; though his studies are said to have been miscellaneous, and directed to literature rather than science. The thirty-three pounds with which he had set out on his travels, were soon consumed, and he was put to many a shift to meet his expenses.\nuntil his precarious remittances should arrive. He had a good friend on these occasions in a fellow-student and countryman, named Ellis, who afterwards rose to eminence as a physician. He used frequently to loan small sums to Goldsmith, which were always scrupulously paid. Ellis discovered the innate merits of the poor, awkward student, and used to declare, in after life, that it was a common remark in Leyden, that in all the peculiarities of Goldsmith, an elevation of mind was to be noted: a philosophical tone and manner: the feelings of a gentleman, and the language and information of a scholar.\"\n\nSometimes, in his emergencies, Goldsmith undertook to teach the English language. It is true he was ignorant of the Dutch, but he had a smattering of the French, picked up among the Irish priests at Ballymahon. He depicts his whimsical embarrassment in this respect in his account in the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" of the philosophical vagabond who went to Holland to teach the natives English, without knowing a word of their own language. Sometimes, when sorely pinched, and sometimes, perhaps, when flush, he resorted to the gambling tables, which in those days abounded in Holland. His good friend Ellis repeatedly warned him against this unfortunate propensity, but in vain. It brought its own cure, or rather its own punishment, by stripping him of every shilling.\n\nEllis once more stepped in to his relief with a true Irishman's generosity, but with more considerateness than generally characterises an Irishman, for he only granted pecuniary aid on condition of his quitting the sphere of danger. Goldsmith gladly consented to leave Holland, being anxious to visit other parts. He intended to proceed to Paris, and pursue his studies there, and was furnished by his friend with money for the journey. Unluckily, he rambled into the garden of a florist just before quitting Leyden. The tulip mania was still prevalent in Holland, and some species of that splendid flower brought immense prices. In wandering through the garden, Goldsmith recollected that his uncle Contarine was a tulip fancier. The thought suddenly struck him that here was an opportunity of testifying, in a delicate manner, his sense of that generous uncle's past kindnesses. In an instant his hand was in his pocket; a number of choice and costly tulip-roots were purchased and packed up for Mr.\nContarine; and it was not until he had paid for them that he bethought himself that he had spent all the money borrowed for his travelling expenses. Too proud, however, to give up his journey, and too shamefaced to make another appeal to his friend's liberality, he determined to travel on foot, and depend upon chance and good luck for the means of getting forward; and it is said that he actually set off on a tour of the Continent, in February, 1775, with but one spare shirt, a flute, and a single guinea.\n\n\"Blessed,\" says one of his biographers, \"with a good constitution, an adventurous spirit, and with that thoughtless, or, perhaps, happy disposition which takes no care for to-morrow, he continued his travels for a long time in spite of innumerable privations.\" In his amusing narrative of the adventures of a \"Philosophic Vagabond\" in the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" we find shadowed out the expedients he pursued. \"I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice; I now turned what was once my amusement into a present means of subsistence. I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry, for I ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a peasant's house towards nightfall, I played one of my merriest tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day; but in truth I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them.\"\n\nAt Paris, he attended the chemical lectures of Rouelle, then in great vogue, where he says he witnessed as bright a circle of beauty as graced the court of Versailles. His love of theatricals, also, led him to attend the performances of the celebrated actress Mademoiselle Clairon, with which he was greatly delighted. He seems to have looked upon the state of society with the eye of a philosopher, but to have read the signs of the times with the prophetic eye of a poet. In his rambles about the environs of Paris he was struck with the immense quantities of game running about almost in a tame state; and saw in those costly and rigid preserves for the amusement and luxury of the privileged few, a sure \"badge of the slavery of the people.\" This slavery he predicted was drawing towards a close. \"When I consider that these parlia-\nments, the members of which are all created by the court, and\nthe presidents of which can only act by immediate direction,\npresume even to mention privileges and freedom, who till of\nlate received directions from the throne with implicit humility,\nwhen this is considered, I cannot help fancying that the\ngenius of Freedom has entered that kingdom in disguise. If\nthey have but three weak monarchs more successively on the\nthrone, the mask will be laid aside, and the country will cer-\ntainly once more be free.\u201d Events have testified to the sage\nforecast of the poet.\n\nDuring a brief sojourn in Paris, he appears to have gained\naccess to valuable society, and to have had the honour and\npleasure of making the acquaintance of Voltaire; of whom,\nin after years, he wrote a memoir. \u201cAs a companion,\u201d says\nhe, \u201cno man ever exceeded him when he pleased to lead the\nconversation; which, however, was not always the case. In\ncompany which he either disliked or despised, few could be\nmore reserved than he; but when he was warmed in discourse,\nand got over a hesitating manner, which sometimes he was\nsubject to, it was rapture to hear him. His meagre visage\nseemed insensibly to gather beauty; every muscle in it had\nmeaning, and his eye beamed with unusual brightness. The\nperson who writes this memoir,\u201d continues he, \u201cremembers\nto have seen him in a select company of wits of both sexes at\nParis, when the subject happened to turn upon English taste\nand learning. Fontenelle, (then nearly a hundred years old,) who was of the party, and who, being unacquainted with the\nlanguage or authors of the country he undertook to condemn,\nwith a spirit truly vulgar, began to revile both. Diderot, who\nliked the English, and knew something of their literary pre-\ntensions, attempted to vindicate their poetry and learning, but\nwith unequal abilities. The company quickly perceived that\nFontenelle was superior in the dispute, and were surprised at\nthe silence which Voltaire had preserved all the former part\nof the night, particularly as the conversation happened to\nturn upon one of his favourite topics. Fontenelle continued\nhis triumph until about twelve o\u2019clock, when Voltaire appeared\nat last roused from his reverie. His whole frame seemed\nanimated. He began his defence with the utmost defiance\nmixed with spirit, and now and then let fall the finest strokes\nof raillery upon his antagonist, and his harangue lasted till\nthree in the morning. I must confess that, whether from\nnational partiality or from the elegant sensibility of his manner, I never was so charmed, nor did I ever remember so absolute a victory as he gained in this dispute.\" Goldsmith's ramblings took him into Germany and Switzerland, from which last-mentioned country he sent to his brother in Ireland the first brief sketch, afterwards amplified into his poem of the \"Traveller.\"\n\nAt Geneva he became travelling tutor to a mongrel young gentleman, son of a London pawnbroker, who had been suddenly elevated into fortune and absurdity by the death of an uncle. The youth, before setting up for a gentleman, had been an attorney's apprentice, and was an arrant pettifogger in money matters. Never were two beings more illy assorted than he and Goldsmith. We may form an idea of the tutor and the pupil, from the following extract from the narrative of the \"Philosophic Vagabond.\"\n\n\"I was to be the young gentleman's governor, but with a proviso that he should always be permitted to govern himself. My pupil, in fact, understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than I. He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by an uncle in the West Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of it, had bound him apprentice to an attorney. Thus avarice was his prevailing passion; all his questions on the road were, how money might be saved, which was the least expensive course of travel, whether anything could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London? Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at, but if the sight of them was to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told that they were not worth seeing. He never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive travelling was; and all this though not yet twenty-one.\"\n\nIn this sketch Goldsmith undoubtedly shadows forth his annoyances as travelling tutor to this concrete young gentleman, compounded of the pawnbroker, the pettifogger, and the West Indian heir, with an overlaying of the city miser. They had continual difficulties on all points of expense until they reached Marseilles, where both were glad to separate.\n\nOnce more on foot, but freed from the irksome duties of \"bear leader,\" and with some of his pay as tutor in his pocket, Goldsmith continued his half vagrant peregrinations\nthrough part of France and Piedmont, and some of the Italian states. He had acquired, as has been shown, a habit of shifting along and living by expedients, and a new one presented itself in Italy. \"My skill in music,\" says he, in the \"Philosophic Vagabond,\" \"could avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musician than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which answered my purpose as well, and this was a skill in disputation. In all the foreign universities and convents, there are, upon certain days, philosophical theses maintained against every adventitious disputant, for which, if the champion opposes with any dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night.\" Though a poor wandering scholar, his reception in these learned piles was as free from humiliation as in the cottages of the peasantry. \"With the members of these establishments,\" said he, \"I could converse on topics of literature, and then I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances.\"\n\nAt Padua, where he remained some months, he is said to have taken his medical degree. It is probable he was brought to a pause in this city by the death of his uncle Contarine, who had hitherto assisted him in his wanderings by occasional, though, of course, slender remittances. Deprived of this source of supplies, he wrote to his friends in Ireland, and especially to his brother-in-law, Hodson, describing his destitute situation. His letters brought him neither money nor reply. It appears, from subsequent correspondence, that his brother-in-law actually exerted himself to raise a subscription for his assistance among his relatives, friends, and acquaintance, but without success. Their faith and hope in him were most probably at an end; as yet he had disappointed them at every point, he had given none of the anticipated proofs of talent, and they were too poor to support what they may have considered the wandering propensities of a heedless spendthrift.\n\nThus left to his own precarious resources, Goldsmith gave up all further wandering in Italy, without visiting the south, though Rome and Naples must have held out powerful attractions to one of his poetical cast. Once more resuming his pilgrim staff, he turned his face toward England, \"walking along from city to city, examining mankind more nearly, and seeing both sides of the picture.\" In traversing France, his\nflute\u2014his magic flute!\u2014was once more in requisition, as we may conclude by the following passage in his \"Traveller\":\n\n\"Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,\nPleased with thyself, whom all the world can please,\nHow often have I led thy sportive choir\nWith tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire!\nWhere shading elms along the margin grew,\nAnd freshened from the wave the zephyr flew;\nAnd haply, though my harsh note faltering still,\nBut mocked all tune, and marred the dancer's skill;\nYet would the village praise my wondrous power,\nAnd dance forgetful of the noontide hour.\nAlike all ages: Dames of ancient days\nHave led their children through the mirthful maze,\nAnd the gay grandsire, skill'd in gestic lore,\nHas friak'd beneath the burden of threescore.\"\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nAfter two years spent in roving about the continent, \"pursuing novelty,\" as he said, \"and losing content,\" Goldsmith landed at Dover early in 1756. He appears to have had no definite plan of action. The death of his uncle Con tarine, and the neglect of his relatives and friends to reply to his letters, seem to have produced in him a temporary feeling of loneliness and destitution, and his only thought was to get to London, and throw himself upon the world. But how was he to get there? His purse was empty. England was to him as completely a foreign land as any part of the continent, and where on earth is a penniless stranger more destitute? His flute and his philosophy were no longer of any avail; the English boors cared nothing for music; there were no convents; and as to the learned and the clergy, not one of them would give a vagrant scholar a supper and night's lodging for the best thesis that ever was argued. \"You may easily imagine,\" says he in a subsequent letter to his brother-in-law, \"what difficulties I had to encounter, left as I was without friends, recommendations, money, or impudence, and that in a country, where being born an Irishman was sufficient to keep me unemployed. Many, in such circumstances, would have had recourse to the friar's cord or the suicide's halter. But, with all my follies, I had principle to resist the one, and resolution to combat the other.\"\n\nHe applied at one place, we are told, for employment in the\nshop of a country apothecary; but all his medical science gathered in foreign universities could not gain him the management of a pestle and mortar. He even resorted, it is said, to the stage as a temporary expedient, and figured in low comedy at a country town in Kent. This accords with his last shift of the Philosophic Vagabond, and with the knowledge of country theatricals displayed in his \"Adventures of a Strolling Player,\" or may be a story suggested by them. All this part of his career, however, in which he must have trod the lowest paths of humility, are only to be conjectured from vague traditions, or scraps of autobiography gleaned from his miscellaneous writings.\n\nAt length, we find him launched on the great metropolis, or rather drifting about its streets, at night, in the gloomy month of February, with but a few halfpence in his pocket. The Deserts of Arabia are not more dreary and inhospitable than the streets of London at such a time, and to a stranger in such a plight. Do we want a picture as an illustration? We have it in his own works, and furnished, doubtless, from his own experience.\n\n\"The clock has just struck two; what a gloom hangs all around! no sound is heard but of the chiming clock, or the distant watchdog. How few appear in those streets, which but some few hours ago were crowded! But who are those who make the streets their couch, and find a short repose from wretchedness at the doors of the opulent? They are strangers, wanderers, and orphans, whose circumstances are too humble to expect redress, and whose distresses are too great even for pity. Some are without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with disease; the world has disclaimed them; society turns its back upon their distress, and has given them up to nakedness and hunger. These poor shivering females have once seen happier days, and been flattered into beauty. They are now turned out to meet the severity of winter. Perhaps now, lying at the doors of their betrayers, they sue to wretches whose hearts are insensible, or debauch\u00e9es who may curse, but will not relieve them.\n\n\"Why, why was I born a man, and yet see the sufferings of wretches I cannot relieve! Poor houseless creatures! The world will give you reproaches, but will not give you relief.\"\n\nPoor houseless Goldsmith! we may here ejaculate\u2014to what shifts he must have been driven to find shelter and sustenance\nfor himself in this first venture into London! Many years afterwards, in the days of his social elevation, he startled a polite circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds's, by humorously dating an anecdote about the time he \"lived among the beggars of Axe Lane.\" Such may have been the desolate quarters with which he was fain to content himself when thus adrift upon the town, with but a few halfpence in his pocket.\n\nThe first authentic trace we have of him in this new part of his career, is filling the situation of an usher to a school, and even this employ he obtained with some difficulty, after a reference for a character to his friends in the University of Dublin. In the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" he makes George Primrose undergo a whimsical catechism concerning the requisites for an usher. \"'Have you been bred apprentice to the business?' 'No.' 'Then you won't do for a school.' 'Can you dress the boys' hair?' 'No.' 'Then you won't do for a school.' 'Can you lie three in a bed?' 'No.' 'Then you will never do for a school.' 'Have you a good stomach?' 'Yes.' 'Then you will by no means do for a school.' I have been an usher in a boarding-school myself, and may I die of an anodyne necklace, but I had rather be under-turnkey in Newgate. I was up early and late: I was browbeaten by the master, hated for my ugly face by the mistress, worried by the boys.\"\n\nGoldsmith remained but a short time in this situation, and to the mortifications experienced there, we doubtless owe the picturings given in his writings of the hardships of an usher's life. \"He is generally,\" says he, \"the laughing-stock of the school. Every trick is played upon him; the oddity of his manner, his dress or his language, is a fund of eternal ridicule; the master himself now and then cannot avoid joining in the laugh; and the poor wretch, eternally resenting this ill usage, lives in a state of war with all the family.\" . . . \"He is obliged, perhaps, to sleep in the same bed with the French teacher, who disturbs him for an hour every night in papering and filleting his hair, and stinks worse than a carrion with his rancid pomatums, when he lays his head beside him on the bolster.\"\n\nHis next shift was as assistant in the laboratory of a chemist near Fish-street Hill. After remaining here a few months, he heard that Dr. Sleigh, who had been his friend and fellow student at Edinburgh, was in London. Eager to meet with\nfriendly face in this land of strangers, he immediately called on him; \"but though it was Sunday, and it is to be supposed I was in my best clothes, Sleigh scarcely knew me\u2014such is the tax the unfortunate pay to poverty. However, when he did recollect me, I found his heart as warm as ever, and he shared his purse and friendship with me during his continuance in London.\"\n\nThrough the advice and assistance of Dr. Sleigh, he now commenced the practice of medicine, but in a small way, in Bankside, Southwark, and chiefly among the poor; for he wanted the figure, address, polish, and management, to succeed among the rich. His old schoolmate and college companion, Beatty, who used to aid him with his purse at the University, met him about this time, decked out in the tarnished finery of a second-hand suit of green and gold, with a shirt and neckcloth of a fortnight's wear.\n\nPoor Goldsmith endeavoured to assume a prosperous air in the eyes of his early associate. \"He was practising physic,\" he said, \"and doing very well!\" At this moment poverty was pinching him to the bone in spite of his practice and his dirty finery. His fees were necessarily small, and ill paid, and he was fain to seek some precarious assistance from his pen. Here his quondam fellow-student, Dr. Sleigh, was again of service, introducing him to some of the booksellers, who gave him occasional, though starveling employment. According to tradition, however, his most efficient patron just now was a journeyman printer, one of his poor patients of Bankside; who had formed a good opinion of his talents, and perceived his poverty and his literary shifts. The printer was in the employ of Mr. Samuel Richardson, the author of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison; who combined the novelist and the publisher, and was in flourishing circumstances. Through the journeyman's intervention, Goldsmith is said to have become acquainted with Richardson, who employed him as reader and corrector of the press, at his printing establishment in Salisbury Court; an occupation which he alternated with his medical duties.\n\nBeing admitted occasionally to Richardson's parlour, he began to form literary acquaintances, among whom the most important was Dr. Young, the author of \"Night Thoughts,\" a poem in the height of fashion. It is not probable, however, that much familiarity took place at the time between the\nliterary lion of the day and the poor \u00c6sculapius of Bankside, the humble corrector of the press. Still the communion with literary men had its effect to set his imagination teeming. Dr. Farr, one of his Edinburgh fellow-students, who was at London about this time, attending the hospitals and lectures, gives us an amusing account of Goldsmith in his literary character.\n\n\"Early in January, he called upon me one morning before I was up, and, on my entering the room, I recognised my old acquaintance, dressed in a rusty full-trimmed black suit, with his pockets full of papers, which instantly reminded me of the poet in Garrick's farce of Lethe. After we had finished our breakfast, he drew from his pocket part of a tragedy, which he said he had brought for my correction. In vain I pleaded inability, when he began to read; and every part on which I expressed a doubt as to the propriety, was immediately blotted out. I then most earnestly pressed him not to trust to my judgment, but to take the opinion of persons better qualified to decide on dramatic compositions. He now told me he had submitted his production, so far as he had written, to Mr. Richardson, the author of Clarissa, on which I peremptorily declined offering another criticism on the performance.\"\n\nFrom the graphic description given of him by Dr. Farr, it will be perceived that the tarnished finery of green and gold had been succeeded by a professional suit of black, to which, we are told, were added the wig and cane indispensable to medical doctors in those days. The coat was a second-hand one, of rusty velvet, with a patch on the left breast, which he adroitly covered with his three-cornered hat during his medical visits; and we have an amusing anecdote of his contest of courtesy with a patient who persisted in endeavouring to relieve him from the hat, which only made him press it more devoutly to his heart.\n\nNothing further has ever been heard of the tragedy mentioned by Dr. Farr; it was probably never completed. The same gentleman speaks of a strange Quixotic scheme which Goldsmith had in contemplation at the time, \"of going to decipher the inscriptions on the written mountains,\" though he was altogether ignorant of Arabic, or the language in which they might be supposed to be written. \"The salary of three hundred pounds,\" adds Dr. Farr, \"which had been\nleft for the purpose, was the temptation.\" This was probably one of many dreamy projects with which his fervid brain was apt to teem. On such subjects, he was prone to talk vaguely and magnificently, but inconsiderately, from a kindled imagination rather than a well-instructed judgment. He had always a great notion of expeditions to the East, and wonders to be seen and effected in the Oriental countries.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAmong the most cordial of Goldsmith's intimates in London during this time of precarious struggle, were certain of his former fellow-students in Edinburgh. One of these was the son of Dr. Milner, a dissenting minister, who kept a classical school of eminence at Peckham, in Surrey. Young Milner had a favourable opinion of Goldsmith's abilities and attainments, and cherished for him that good will which his genial nature seems ever to have inspired among his school and college associates. His father falling ill, the young man negotiated with Goldsmith to take temporary charge of the school. The latter readily consented, for he was discouraged by the slow growth of medical reputation and practice, and as yet had no confidence in the coy smiles of the muse. Laying by his wig and cane, therefore, and once more wielding the ferule, he resumed the character of the pedagogue, and for some time reigned as vicegerent over the academy at Peckham. He appears to have been well treated by both Dr. Milner and his wife; and became a favourite with the scholars from his easy, indulgent good nature. He mingled in their sports; told them droll stories; played on the flute for their amusement, and spent his money in treating them to sweetmeats and other schoolboy dainties. His familiarity was sometimes carried too far; he indulged in boyish pranks and practical jokes, and drew upon himself retorts in kind, which, however, he bore with great good humour. Once, indeed, he was touched to the quick by a piece of schoolboy pertness. After playing on the flute, he spoke with enthusiasm of music, as delightful in itself, and as a valuable accomplishment for a gentleman, whereupon a youngster, with a glance at his ungainly person, wished to know if he considered himself a gentleman. Poor Goldsmith, feelingly alive to the awkwardness of his appearance\nand the humility of his situation, winced at this unthinking sneer, which long rankled in his mind.\n\nAs usual, while in Dr. Milner's employ, his benevolent feelings were a heavy tax upon his purse, for he never could resist a tale of distress, and was apt to be fleeced by every sturdy beggar; so that between his charity and his munificence, he was generally in advance of his slender salary. \"You had better, Mr. Goldsmith, let me take care of your money,\" said Mrs. Milner, one day. \"as I do for some of the young gentlemen.\"\u2014\"In truth, madam, there is equal need,\" was the good-humoured reply.\n\nDr. Milner was a man of some literary pretensions, and wrote occasionally for the \"Monthly Review,\" of which a bookseller, by the name of Griffiths, was proprietor. This work was an advocate for Whig principles, and had been in prosperous existence for nearly eight years. Of late, however, periodicals had multiplied exceedingly, and a formidable Tory rival had started up in the \"Critical Review,\" published by Archibald Hamilton, a bookseller, and aided by the powerful and popular pen of Dr. Smollett. Griffiths was obliged to recruit his forces. While so doing, he met Goldsmith, a humble occupant of a seat at Dr. Milner's table, and was struck with remarks on men and books, which fell from him in the course of conversation. He took occasion to sound him privately as to his inclination and capacity as a reviewer, and was furnished by him with specimens of his literary and critical talents. They proved satisfactory. The consequence was that Goldsmith once more changed his mode of life, and in April, 1757, became a contributor to the \"Monthly Review,\" at a small fixed salary, with board and lodging; and accordingly took up his abode with Mr. Griffiths, at the sign of the Dunciad, Paternoster Row. As usual, we trace this phase of his fortunes in his semi-fictional writings; his sudden transmutation of the pedagogue into the author being humorously set forth in the case of \"George Primrose,\" in the \"Vicar of Wakefield.\" \"Come,\" says George's adviser, \"I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning; what do you think of commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men of genius starving at the trade: at present I'll show you forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence. All honest, jog-trot men, who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and poetry, and make a comfortable living by it. Now, why should you not try it?\"\npolitics, and are praised; men, sir, who had they been bred cobblers, would all their lives only have mended shoes, but never made them.\" \"Finding,\" says George, \"that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal; and, having the highest respect for literature, hailed the antiqua mater of Grub street with reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden and Otway trod before me.\" Alas! Dryden struggled with indigence all his days; and Otway, it is said, fell a victim to famine in his thirty-fifth year, being strangled by a roll of bread, which he devoured with the voracity of a starving man.\n\nIn Goldsmith's experience, the track soon proved a thorny one; Griffiths was a hard business man, of shrewd, worldly good sense, but little refinement or cultivation. He meddled or rather muddled with literature, too, in a business-way, altering and modifying occasionally the writings of his contributors, and in this he was aided by his wife, who, according to Smollett, was \"an antiquated female critic and a dabbler in the 'Review.'\" Such was the literary vassalage to which Goldsmith had unwarily subjected himself. A diurnal drudgery was imposed on him, irksome to his indolent habits, and attended by circumstances humiliating to his pride. He had to write daily from nine o'clock until two, and often throughout the day; whether in the vein or not, and on subjects dictated by his task-master, however foreign to his taste; in a word, he was treated as a mere literary hack. But this was not the worst; it was the critical supervision of Griffiths and his wife which grieved him: the \"illiterate, bookselling Griffiths,\" as Smollett called him, \"who presumed to revise, alter, and amend the articles contributed to their 'Review.' Thank heaven,\" crowed Smollett, \"the 'Critical Review' is not written under the restraint of a bookseller and his wife. Its principal writers are independent of each other, unconnected with booksellers, and unawed by old women!\"\n\nThis literary vassalage, however, did not last long. The bookseller became more and more exacting. He accused his hack writer of idleness; of abandoning his writing-desk and literary workshop at an early hour of the day; and of assuming a tone and manner above his situation. Goldsmith, in return, charged him with impertinence; his wife, with meanness and parsimony in her household treatment of him, and\nboth of literary meddling and marring. The engagement was broken off at the end of five months, by mutual consent, and without any violent rupture, as it will be found they afterwards had occasional dealings with each other.\n\nThough Goldsmith was now nearly thirty years of age, he had produced nothing to give him a decided reputation. He was as yet a mere writer for bread. The articles he had contributed to the \"Review\" were anonymous, and were never avowed by him. They have since been, for the most part, ascertained; and though thrown off hastily, often treating on subjects of temporary interest, and marred by the Griffith interpolations, they are still characterized by his sound, easy good sense, and the genial grace of his style. Johnson observed that Goldsmith's genius flowered late; he should have said it flowered early, but was late in bringing its fruit to maturity.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nBeing now known in the publishing world, Goldsmith began to find casual employment in various quarters; among others, he wrote occasionally for the \"Literary Magazine,\" a production set on foot by Mr. John Newbery, bookseller, St. Paul's Churchyard, renowned in nursery literature throughout the latter half of the last century, for his picture-books for children. Newbery was a worthy, intelligent, kind-hearted man, and a seasonable, though cautious friend to authors, relieving them with small loans when in pecuniary difficulties, though always taking care to be well repaid by the labour of their pens. Goldsmith introduces him in a humorous, yet friendly manner in his novel of the \"Vicar of Wakefield.\"\n\n\"This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children; he called himself their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on business of importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately recollected this good-natured man's red-pimpled face.\"\n\nBesides his literary job-work, Goldsmith also resumed his medical practice, but with very trifling success. The scantiness of his purse still obliged him to live in obscure lodgings.\nsomewhere in the vicinity of Salisbury Square, Fleet Street; but his extended acquaintance and rising importance caused him to consult appearances. He adopted an expedient, then very common, and still practised in London among those who have to tread the narrow path between pride and poverty; while he burrowed in lodgings suited to his means, he \"hailed,\" as it is termed, from the Temple Exchange Coffee-house near Temple Bar. Here he received his medical calls; hence he dated his letters, and here he passed much of his leisure hours, conversing with the frequenters of the place.\n\n\"Thirty pounds a-year,\" said a poor Irish painter, who understood the art of shifting, \"is enough to enable a man to live in London without being contemptible. Ten pounds will find him in clothes and linen; he can live in a garret on eighteenpence a week; hail from a coffeehouse, where, by occasionally spending threepence, he may pass some hours each day in good company; he may breakfast on bread and milk for a penny; dine for sixpence; do without supper; and on clean-shirt-day he may go abroad and pay visits.\"\n\nGoldsmith seems to have taken a leaf from this poor devil's manual, in respect to the coffee-house at least. Indeed, coffeehouses in those days were the resorts of wits and literati, where the topics of the day were gossiped over, and the affairs of literature and the drama discussed and criticised. In this way, he enlarged the circle of his intimacy, which now embraced several names of notoriety.\n\nDo we want a picture of Goldsmith's experience in this part of his career? We have it in his observations on the life of an author in the \"Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning,\" published some years afterwards.\n\n\"The author, unpatronized by the great, has naturally recourse to the bookseller. There cannot, perhaps, be imagined a combination more prejudicial to taste than this. It is the interest of the one to allow as little for writing, and for the other to write as much as possible; accordingly tedious compilations and periodical magazines are the result of their joint endeavours. In these circumstances, the author bids adieu to fame; writes for bread; and for that only, imagination is seldom called in. He sits down to address the venal muse with the most phlegmatic apathy; and, as we are told of the Russian, courts his mistress by falling asleep in her lap.\"\n\nAgain,\n\n\"Those who are unacquainted with the world are apt to fancy the man of wit as leading a very agreeable life. They conclude, perhaps, that he is attended with silent admiration, and dictates to the rest of mankind...\"\nwith all the eloquence of conscious superiority. Very different is his present situation. He is called an author, and all know that an author is a thing only to be laughed at. His person, not his jest, becomes the mirth of the company. At his approach, the most fat, unthinking face brightens into malicious meaning. Even aldermen laugh, and avenging him the ridicule which was lavished on their forefathers.\"\n\n\"The poet's poverty is a standing topic of contempt. His writing for bread is an unpardonable offence. Perhaps, of all mankind, an author in these times is used most hardly. We keep him poor, and yet revile his poverty. We reproach him for living by his wit, and yet allow him no other means to live. His taking refuge in garrets and cellars has, of late been violently objected to him, and that by men who, I have hope, are more apt to pity than insult his distress. Is poverty a careless fault? No doubt he knows how to prefer a bottle of champagne to the nectar of the neighbouring alehouse, or a venison pasty to a plate of potatoes. Want of delicacy is not in him, but in those who deny him the opportunity of making an elegant choice. Wit, certainly, is the property of those who have it, nor should we be displeased if it is the only property a man sometimes has. We must not underrate him who uses it for subsistence, and flees from the ingratitude of the age, even to a bookseller for redress.\"\n\n\"If the author be necessary among us, let us treat him with proper consideration, as a child of the public, not as a rent-charge on the community. And, indeed, a child of the public he is in all respects; for while so well able to direct others, how incapable is he frequently found of guiding himself. His simplicity exposes him to all the insidious approaches of cunning; his sensibility to the slightest invasions of contempt. Though possessed of fortitude to stand unmoved the expected bursts of an earthquake, yet with feelings so exquisitely poignant, as to agonize under the slightest disappointment. Broken rest, tasteless meals, and causeless anxieties, shorten life, and render it unfit for active employments; prolonged vigils, and intense application still farther contract his span, and make his time glide insensibly away.\"\n\nWhile poor Goldsmith was thus struggling with the difficulties and discouragements which in those days beset the path of an author, his friends in Ireland received accounts of his literary success, and of the distinguished acquaintances he was making. This was enough to put the wise heads at Lissoy and Ballymahon in a ferment of conjectures. With the exaggerated notions of provincial relatives concerning the family great man in the metropolis, some of Goldsmith's poor kindred pictured him, to themselves, seated in high places, clothed in purple and fine linen, and hand and glove with the givers of gifts and dispensers of patronage. Accordingly, he was one day surprised at the sudden apparition, in his miserable lodging, of his younger brother Charles, a raw youth of twenty-one, endowed with a double share of the family heed-\nVery different is his jest, becomes the fat, unthinking face laugh, and avenge defathers.\"\n\nHis writing for mankind, an author in poor, and yet revile his and yet allow him no cells has, of who, I have hope, poverty a careless champagne to the pasty to a plate of those who deny him certainly, is the proceeded if it is the only derate him who uses of the age, even to a\n\neat him with proper at-charge on the complaints in all respects; for he frequently found to all the insidious invasions of concerned removed the expected visibly poignant, as to Broken rest, tasteless under it unfit for active application still farther away.\"\n\nWith the difficulties beset the received accounts of and acquaintances he the wise heads at conjectures. With concerning the of Goldsmith's poor situated in high places, and glove with the Accordingly, he in his miserables, a raw youth of the family heed-\n\nlessness, and who expected to be forthwith helped into some snug by-path to fortune, by one or other of Oliver's great friends. Charles was sadly disconcerted on learning that, so far from being able to provide for others, his brother could scarcely take care of himself. He looked round with a rueful eye on the poet's quarters, and could not help expressing his surprise and disappointment at finding him no better off.\n\n\"All in good time, my dear boy,\" replied poor Goldsmith, with infinite good humour; \"I shall be richer by-and-bye. Addison, let me tell you, wrote his poem of the 'Campaign' in a garret in the Haymarket, three stories high, and you see I am not come to that yet, for I have only got to the second story.\"\n\nCharles Goldsmith did not remain long to embarrass his brother in London. With the same roving disposition and inconsiderate temper of Oliver, he suddenly departed in an humble capacity to seek his fortune in the West Indies, and nothing was heard of him for above thirty years, when, after having been given up as dead by his friends, he made his reappearance in England.\n\nShortly after his departure, Goldsmith wrote a letter to his brother-in-law, Daniel Hodson, Esq., of which the following is an extract; it was partly intended, no doubt, to dissipate any further illusions concerning his fortunes, which might float on the magnificent imagination of his friends in Ballymahon.\n\n\"I suppose you desire to know my present situation. As there is nothing in it at which I should blush, or which mankind could censure, I see no reason for making it a secret. In short, by a very little practice as a physician, and a very little reputation as a poet, I make a shift to live. Nothing is more apt to introduce us to the gates of the muses as poverty; but it were well if they only left us at the door. The mischief is, they sometimes choose to give us their company to the entertainment; and Want, instead of being gentleman usher, often turns master of the ceremonies.\n\nThus, upon learning I write, no doubt you imagine I starve, and the name of an author naturally reminds you of a garret. In this particular, I do not think proper to undeceive my friends. But whether I eat or starve, live in a first floor or four pairs of stairs high, I still remember them with ardour; nay, my very country comes in for a share of my affection. Unaccountable fondness for country, this maladie du pays, as the French call it! Unaccountable that he should still have an affection for a place, who never, when in it, received above common civility; who never brought anything out of it except his\nbrogue and his blunders. Surely my affection is equally ridiculous with the Scotchman's, who refused to be cured of the itch, because it made him unco' thoughtful of his wife and bonny Inverary.\n\n\"But now, to be serious: let me ask myself what gives me a wish to see Ireland again? The country is a fine one, perhaps? No. There is good company in Ireland? No. The conversation there is generally made up of a smutty toast or a bawdy song; the vivacity supported by some humble cousin, who had just folly enough to earn his living. Then, perhaps, there's more wit and learning among the Irish? Oh, Lord, no! There has been more money spent in the encouragement of the Padareen mare there in one season, than given in rewards to learned men since the time of Usher. All their productions in learning amount to, perhaps, a translation, or a few tracts in divinity; and all their productions in wit to just nothing at all. Why the plague, then, so fond of Ireland? Then, all at once, because you, my dear friend, and a few more, who are exceptions to the general picture, have a residence there. This it is that gives me all the pangs I feel in separation. I confess I carry this spirit sometimes to the souring the pleasures I at present possess. If I go to the opera, where Signora Columba pours out all the mazes of melody, I sit and sigh for Lissoy fireside, and Johnny Armstrong's 'Last Good-night' from Peggy Golden. If I climb Hampstead Hill, than where nature never exhibited a more magnificent prospect, I confess it fine; but then I had rather be placed on the little mount before Lissoy gate, and there take in, to me, the most pleasing horizon in nature.\n\n\"Before Charles came hither, my thoughts sometimes found refuge from severer studies among my friends in Ireland, I fancied strange revolutions at home, but I find it was the rapidity of my own motion that gave an imaginary one to objects really at rest. No alterations there. Some friends, he tells me, are still lean, but very rich; others very fat, but still very poor. Nay, all the news I hear of you is, that you sally out in visits among the neighbours, and sometimes make a migration from the blue bed to the brown. I could from my heart wish that you and she (Mrs. Hodson), and Lissoy, and Ballymahon, and all of you, would fairly make a migration into Middlesex; though, upon second thoughts, this might be attended with a few inconveniences. Therefore, as the mountain will not come to Mohammed, why Mohammed shall go to the mountain; or, to speak plain English, as you cannot conveniently pay me a visit, if next summer I can contrive to be absent six weeks from London, I shall spend three of them among my friends in Ireland. But first, believe me, my design is purely to visit, and neither to cut a figure nor levy contributions; neither to excite envy nor solicit favour; in fact, my circumstances are adapted to neither. I am too poor to be gazed at, and too rich to need assistance.\"\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nFor sometime, Goldsmith continued to write miscellaneously for reviews and other periodical publications, but without making any decided hit, to use a technical term. Indeed as yet he appeared destitute of the strong excitement of literary ambition, and wrote only on the spur of necessity, and at the urgent importunity of his bookseller. His indolent and truant disposition, ever averse from labour and delighting in holiday, had to be scourged up to his task; still, it was this very truant disposition which threw an unconscious charm over everything he wrote; bringing with it honeyed thoughts and pictured images which had sprung up in his mind in the sunny hours of idleness: these effusions, dashed off on compulsion in the exigency of the moment, were published anonymously; so that they made no collective impression on the public, and reflected no fame on the name of their author.\n\nIn an essay published sometime subsequently in the \"Bee,\" Goldsmith adverts in his own humourous way, to his impatience at the tardiness with which his desultory and unacknowledged essays crept into notice. \"I was once induced,\" says he, \"to show my indignation against the public by discontinuing my efforts to please; and was bravely resolved, like Raleigh, to vex them by burning my manuscripts in a passion. Upon reflection, however, I considered what set or body of people would be displeased at my rashness. The sun, after so sad an accident, might shine next morning as bright as usual; men might laugh and sing the next day, and transact business as before; and not a single creature feel any regret but myself. Instead of having Apollo in mourning or the Muses in a fit of the spleen; instead of having the learned world apostrophising at my untimely decease; perhaps all Grub-street might laugh at my fate, and self-approving dignity be unable to shield me from ridicule.\"\n\nCircumstances occurred about this time to give a new direction to Goldsmith's hopes and schemes. Having resumed for a brief period the superintendence of the Peckham school during a fit of illness of Dr. Milner, that gentleman, in requital for his timely services, promised to use his influence with a friend, an East India Director, to procure him a medical appointment in India.\n\nThere was every reason to believe that the influence of Dr.\nMilner would be effectual; but how was Goldsmith to find the ways and means of fitting himself out for a voyage to the Indies? In this emergency, he was driven to a more extended exercise of the pen than he had yet attempted. His skirmishing among books as a reviewer, and his disputatious ramble among the schools and universities, and literati of the Continent, had filled his mind with facts and observations, which he now set about digesting into a treatise of some magnitude, to be entitled \"An Inquiry into the present State of Polite Learning in Europe.\" As the work grew on his hands, his sanguine temper ran ahead of his labours. Feeling secure of success in England, he was anxious to forestall the piracy of the Irish press; for as yet, the Union not having taken place, the English law of copyright did not extend to the other side of the Irish channel. He wrote, therefore, to his friends in Ireland, urging them to circulate his proposals for his contemplated work, and obtain subscriptions\u2014payable in advance\u2014the money to be transmitted to a Mr. Bradley, an eminent bookseller in Dublin, who would give a receipt for it, and be accountable for the delivery of the books. The letters written by him on this occasion are worthy of copious citation, as being full of character and interest. One was to his relative and college intimate, Edward Wells, who had studied for the bar, but was now living at ease on his estate at Roscommon.\n\n\"You have quitted,\" writes Goldsmith, \"the plan of life which you once intended to pursue, and given up ambition for domestic tranquillity. I cannot avoid feeling some regret that one of my few friends has declined a pursuit, in which he had every reason to expect success. I have often let my fancy loose when you were the subject, and have imagined you gracing the bench, or thundering at the bar; while I have taken no small pride to myself, and whispered to all that I could come near, that this was my cousin. Instead of this, it seems you are merely content to be a happy man; to be esteemed by your acquaintances; to cultivate your paternal acres; to take unmolested a nap under one of your own hawthorns, or in Mrs. Wells's bed-chamber, which even a poet must confess is rather the more comfortable place of the two. But, however your resolutions may be altered with regard to your situation in life, I persuade myself they are unalterable with respect to your friends in it. I cannot think the world has taken such entire possession of that heart (once so suscep-\ntible of friendship) as not to have left a corner there for a friend or two, but I flatter myself that even I have a place among the number. This I have a claim to from the similitude of our dispositions; or setting that aside, I can demand it as a right by the most equitable law of nature: I mean that of retaliation; for indeed you have more than your share in mine. I am a man of few professions; and yet at this very instant I cannot avoid the painful apprehension that my present professions (which speak not half my feelings) should be considered only as a pretext to cover a request, as I have a request to make. No, my dear Ned, I know you are too generous to think so, and you know me too proud to stoop to unnecessary insincerity\u2014I have a request, it is true, to make; but as I know to whom I am a petitioner, I make it without diffidence or confusion. It is in short this, I am going to publish a book in London,\u201d &c. The residue of the letter specifies the nature of the request, which was merely to aid in circulating his proposals, and obtaining subscriptions. The letter of the poor author, however, was unattended to, and unacknowledged by the prosperous Mr. Wells, of Roscommon, though in after years he was proud to claim relationship to Dr. Goldsmith, when he had risen to celebrity.\n\nAnother of Goldsmith\u2019s letters was to Robert Bryanton, with whom he had long ceased to be in correspondence. \u201cI believe,\u201d writes he, \u201cthat they who are drunk, or out of their wits, fancy everybody else in the same condition. Mine is a friendship that neither distance nor time can efface, which is probably the reason that, for the soul of me, I can\u2019t avoid thinking yours of the same complexion; and yet I have many reasons for being of a contrary opinion, else why, in so long an absence, was I never made a partner in your concerns? To hear of your success would have given me the utmost pleasure; and a communication of your very disappointments, would divide the uneasiness I too frequently feel for my own. Indeed, my dear Bob, you don\u2019t conceive how unkindly you have treated one, whose circumstances afford him few prospects of pleasure, except those reflected from the happiness of his friends. However, since you have not let me hear from you, I have in some measure disappointed your neglect by frequently thinking of you. Every day or so I remember the calm anecdotes of your life, from the fireside to the easy chair; recall the various adventures that first\ncemented our friendship; the school, the college, or the tavern; preside in fancy over your cards; and am displeased at your bad play when the rubber goes against you, though not with all that agony of soul as when I was once your partner. Is it not strange that two of such like affections should be so much separated, and so differently employed as we are? You seem placed at the centre of fortune's wheel, and, let it revolve ever so fast, are insensible of the motion. I seem to have been tied to the circumference, and whirled disagreeably round, as if on a whirligig.\"\n\nHe then runs into a whimsical and extravagant tirade about his future prospects. The wonderful career of fame and fortune that awaits him, and after indulging in all kinds of humourous gasconades, concludes: \"Let me, then, stop my fancy to take a view of my future self,\u2014and, as the boys say, light down to see myself on horseback. Well, now that I am down, where the d\u2014I is I? Oh gods! gods! here in a garret, writing for bread, and expecting to be dunned for a milk-score!\"\n\nHe would, on this occasion, have doubtless written to his uncle Contarinc, but that generous friend was sunk into a helpless, hopeless state, from which death soon released him.\n\nCut off thus from the kind co-operation of his uncle, he addressed a letter to his daughter Jane, the companion of his school-boy and happy days, now the wife of Mr. Lawder. The object was to secure her interest with her husband in promoting the circulation of his proposals. The letter is full of character.\n\n\"If you should ask,\" he begins, \"why, in an interval of so many years, you never heard from me, permit me, madam, to ask the same question. I have the best excuse in recrimination. I wrote to Kilmore from Leyden, in Holland, from Louvain, in Flanders, and Rouen, in France, but received no answer. To what could I attribute this silence but to displeasure or forgetfulness? Whether I was right in my conjecture I do not pretend to determine; but this I must ingenuously own, that I have a thousand times in my turn endeavoured to forget them, whom I could not but look upon as forgetting me. I have attempted to blot their names from my memory, and, I confess it, spent whole days in efforts to tear their image from my heart. Could I have succeeded, you had not now been troubled with this renewal of a discontinued correspondence; but, as every effort the restless make to procure sleep serves but to keep them waking, all my attempts contributed to impress what I would forget deeper on my imagination. But this subject I would willingly turn from, and yet, 'for the soul of\nme I can't tell I have said all. I was, madam, when I discontinued writing to Kilmore, in such circumstances, that all my endeavours to continue your regards might be attributed to wrong motives. My letters might be looked upon as the petitions of a beggar, and not the offerings of a friend; while all my professions, instead of being considered as the result of disinterested esteem, might be ascribed to venal insincerity. I believe, indeed, you had too much generosity to place them in such a light, but I could not bear even the shadow of such a suspicion. The most delicate friendships are always most sensible of the slightest invasion, and the strongest jealousy is ever attendant on the warmest regard. I could not\u2014I own I could not\u2014continue a correspondence in which every acknowledgment for past favours might be considered as an indirect request for future ones; and where it might be thought I gave my heart from a motive of gratitude alone, when I was conscious of having bestowed it on much more disinterested principles. It is true, this conduct might have been simple enough; but yourself must confess it was in character. Those who know me at all, know that I have always been actuated by different principles from the rest of mankind; and while none regarded the interest of his friend more, no man on earth regarded his own less. I have often affected bluntness to avoid the imputation of flattery; have frequently seemed to overlook those merits too obvious to escape notice, and pretended disregard to those instances of good nature and good sense, which I could not fail tacitly to applaud; and all this lest I should be ranked among the grinning tribe, who say, 'very true' to all that is said; who fill a vacant chair at a tea-table; whose narrow souls never moved in a wider circle than the circumference of a guinea; and who had rather be reckoning the money in your pocket than the virtue in your breast. All this, I say, I have done, and a thousand other very silly, though very disinterested, things in my time; and for all which no soul cares a farthing about me.\n\nIs it to be wondered that he should once, in his life, forget you, who has been all his life forgetting himself? However, it is probable you may, one of these days, see me turned into a perfect hunk, and as dark and intricate as a mouse-hole. I have already given my landlady orders for an entire reform in the state of my finances. I declaim against hot suppers, drink less sugar in my tea, and check my grate with brickbats. Instead of hanging my room with pictures, I intend to adorn it with maxims of frugality. Those will make pretty furniture enough, and won't be a bit too expensive; for I will draw them all out with my own hands, and my landlady's daughter shall frame them with the parings of my black waistcoat. Each maxim is to be inscribed on a sheet of clean paper, and wrote with my best pen; of which the following will serve as a specimen: Look sharp: Mind the main chance: Money is money now: If you have a thousand pounds, you can put your hands by your sides, and say you are worth a thousand pounds every day of the year: Take a farthing from a hundred and it will be a hundred no longer. Thus, which way soever I turn my eyes, they are sure to meet one of those friendly monitors; and as we are told of an actor who hung his room round with looking-glass to correct the defects of his person, my\napartments shall be furnished in a peculiar manner, to correct the errors of my mind. Faith! madam, I heartily wish to be rich, if it were only for this reason, to say without a blush how much I esteem you. But, alas! I have many a fatigue to encounter before that happy time comes, when your poor old simple friend may again give a loose to the luxuriance of his nature; sitting by Kilmore fireside, recount the various adventures of a hard-fought life; laugh over the follies of the day; join his flute to your harpsichord; and forget that ever he starved in those streets where Butler and Otway starved before him. And now I mention those great names\u2014my Uncle! he is no more that soul of fire as when I once knew him. Newton and Swift grew dim with age as well as he. But what shall I say? His mind was too active an inhabitant not to disorder the feeble mansion of its abode; for the richest jewels soonest wear their settings. Yet who but the fool would lament his condition! He now forgets the calamities of life. Perhaps indulgent Heaven has given him a foretaste of that tranquility here, which he so well deserves hereafter. But I must come to business, for business, as one of my maxims tells me, must be minded or lost. I am going to publish in London a book, entitled, 'The Present State of Taste and Literature in Europe.' The booksellers in Ireland republish every performance there without making the author any consideration. I would, in this respect, disappoint their avarice, and have all the profits of my labour to myself. I must, therefore, request Mr. Lawder to circulate among his friends and acquaintances a hundred of my proposals, which I have given the bookseller, Mr. Bradley, in Dame-street, directions to send to him. If, in pursuance of such circulation, he should receive any subscriptions, I entreat, when collected, they may be sent to Mr. Bradley, as aforesaid, who will give a receipt, and be accountable for the work, or a return of the subscription. If this request (which, if it be complied with, will, in some measure, be an encouragement to a man of learning) should be disagreeable or troublesome, I would not press it; for I would be the last man on earth to have my labours go a-begging; but if I know Mr. Lawder (and sure I ought to know him), he will accept the employment with pleasure. All I can say\u2014if he writes a book, I will get him two hundred subscribers, and those of the best wits in Europe. Whether this request is complied with or not, I shall not be uneasy; but there is one petition I must make to him and to you, which I solicit with the warmest ardour, and in which I cannot bear a refusal. I mean, dear madam, that I may be allowed to subscribe myself, your ever affectionate and obliged kinsman, Oliver Goldsmith. Now see how I blot and blunder when I am asking a favour.\"\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nWhile Goldsmith was yet labouring at his treatise, the promise made him by Dr. Milner was carried into effect, and he was actually appointed physician and surgeon to one of the\nfactories on the coast of Coromandel. His imagination was immediately on fire with visions of Oriental wealth and magnificence. It is true the salary did not exceed one hundred pounds, but then, as appointed physician, he would have the exclusive practice of the place, amounting to one thousand pounds per annum, with advantages to be derived from trade and from the high interest of money\u2014twenty per cent.; in a word, for once in his life, the road to fortune lay broad and straight before him.\n\nHitherto, in his correspondence with his friends, he had said nothing of his India scheme, but now he imparted to them his brilliant prospects, urging the importance of their circulating his proposals, and obtaining him subscriptions and advances on his forthcoming work, to furnish funds for his outfit.\n\nIn the meantime, he had to task that poor drudge, his muse, for present exigencies. Ten pounds were demanded for his appointment-warrant. Other expenses pressed hard upon him. Fortunately, though as yet unknown to fame, his literary capability was known to \"the trade,\" and the coinage of his brain passed current in Grub-street. Archibald Hamilton, proprietor of the Critical Review, the rival to that of Griffiths, readily made him a small advance on receiving three articles for his periodical. His purse thus slenderly replenished, Goldsmith paid for his warrant, wiped off the score of his milkmaid, abandoned his garret, and moved into a shabby first floor in a forlorn court near the Old Bailey, there to await the time for his migration to the magnificent coast of Coromandel.\n\nAlas! poor Goldsmith! ever doomed to disappointment. Early in the gloomy month of November, that month of fog and despondency in London, he learnt the shipwreck of his hope. The great Coromandel enterprise fell through, or, rather, the post promised to him was transferred to some other candidate. The cause of this disappointment it is now impossible to ascertain. The death of his quasi patron, Dr. Milner, which happened about this time, may have had some effect in producing it, or there may have been some heedlessness and blundering on his own part, or some obstacle arising from his insuperable indigence; whatever may have been the cause, he never mentioned it, which gives some ground to surmise that he himself was to blame. His friends learnt\nwith surprise that he had suddenly relinquished his appointment to India, about which he had raised such sanguine expectations; some accused him of fickleness and caprice, others supposed him unwilling to tear himself from the growing fascinations of the literary society of London.\n\nIn the meantime, cut down in his hopes, and humiliated in his pride by the failure of his Coromandel scheme, he sought, without consulting his friends, to be examined at the College of Physicians for the humble situation of hospital mate. Even here poverty stood in his way. It was necessary to appear in a decent garb before the examining committee; but how was he to do so? He was literally out of elbows as well as out of cash. Here again the muse, so often jilted and neglected by him, came to his aid. In consideration of four articles furnished to the \"Monthly Review,\" Griffiths, his old task-master, was to become his security to the tailor for a suit of clothes. Goldsmith said he wanted them but for a single occasion, on which depended his appointment to a situation in the army; as soon as that temporary purpose was served, they would either be returned or paid for. The books to be reviewed were accordingly lent to him; the muse was again set to her compulsory drudgery; the articles were scribbled off and sent to the bookseller, and the clothes came in due time from the tailor.\n\nFrom the records of the College of Surgeons, it appears that Goldsmith underwent his examination at Surgeons' Hall on the 21st of December, 1758. Either from a confusion of mind incident to sensitive and imaginative persons on such occasions, or from a real want of surgical science, which last is extremely probable, he failed in his examination, and was rejected as unqualified. The effect of such rejection was to disqualify him for every branch of public service, though he might have claimed a re-examination, after the interval of a few months devoted to further study. Such a re-examination he never attempted, nor did he ever communicate his discomfiture to any of his friends.\n\nOn Christmas Day, but four days after his rejection by the College of Surgeons, while he was suffering under the mortification of defeat and disappointment, and hard pressed for means of subsistence, he was surprised by the entrance into his room of the poor woman of whom he hired his wretched apartment, and to whom he owed some small arrears of rent.\nShe had a piteous tale of distress, and was clamorous in her afflictions. Her husband had been arrested in the night for debt, and thrown into prison. This was too much for the quick feelings of Goldsmith; he was ready at any time to help the distressed, but in this instance he was himself in some measure a cause of the distress. What was to be done? He had no money it is true; but there hung the new suit of clothes in which he had stood his unlucky examination at Surgeons' Hall. Without giving himself time for reflection, he sent it off to the pawnbroker's, and raised thereon a sufficient sum to pay off his own debt, and to release his landlord from prison.\n\nUnder the same pressure of penury and despondency, he borrowed from a neighbour a pittance to relieve his immediate wants, leaving, as a security, the books which he had recently reviewed. In the midst of these straits and harassments, he received a letter from Griffiths, demanding in peremptory terms, the return of the clothes and books, or immediate payment for the same. It appears that he had discovered the identical suit at the pawnbroker's. The reply of Goldsmith is not known; it was out of his power to furnish either the clothes or the money; but he probably offered once more to make the muse stand his bail. His reply only increased the ire of the wealthy man of trade, and drew from him another letter, still more harsh than the first, using the epithets of knave and sharper, and containing threats of prosecution and a prison.\n\nThe following letter from poor Goldsmith, gives the most touching picture of an inconsiderate but sensitive man, harassed by care, stung by humiliations, and driven almost to despondency.\n\n\"Sir,\u2014I know of no misery but a gaol to which my own imprudences and your letter seem to point. I have been in inevitable these three or four weeks, and, by heavens! request it as a favour,\u2014as a favour that may prevent something more fatal. I have been some years struggling with a wretched being\u2014with all that contempt and indigence brings with it\u2014with all those passions which make contempt insupportable. What, then, has a gaol that is formidable? I shall, at least, have the society of wretches, and such is to me true society. I tell you, again and again, that I am neither able nor willing to pay you a farthing; but I will be punctual to any appointment you or the tailor shall make; thus far, at least, I do not act the sharper, since, unable to pay my own debts one way, I would generally give some security...\"\nanother. No, sir; had I been a sharper\u2014had I been possessed of less good-nature and native generosity, I might surely now have been in better circumstances.\n\n\"I am guilty, I own, of meanness which poverty unavoidably brings with it: my reflections are filled with repentance for my imprudence, but not with any remorse for being a villain; that may be a character you unjustly charge me with. Your books, I can assure you, are neither pawned nor sold, but in the custody of a friend, from whom my necessities obliged me to borrow some money: whatever becomes of my person, you shall have them in a month. It is very possible both the reports you have heard, and your own suggestions, may have brought you false information with respect to my character; it is very possible that the man whom you now regard with detestation may inwardly burn with grateful resentment. It is very possible that, upon a second perusal of the letter I sent you, you may see the workings of a mind strongly agitated with gratitude and jealousy. If such circumstances should appear, at least spare invective till my book with Mr. Dodseley shall be published, and then, perhaps, you may see the bright side of a mind, when my professions shall not appear the dictates of necessity, but of choice.\n\n\"You seem to think Dr. Milner knew me not. Perhaps so: but he was a man I shall ever honour; but I have friendships only with the dead! I ask pardon for taking up so much time; nor shall I add to it by any other professions than that I am, sir, your humble servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\n\n\"P.S.\u2014I shall expect impatiently the result of your resolutions.\"\n\nThe dispute between the poet and the publisher was afterward imperfectly adjusted, and it would appear that the clothes were paid for by a short compilation advertised by Griffiths in the course of the following month; but the parties were never really friends afterward, and the writings of Goldsmith were harshly and unjustly treated in the \"Monthly Review.\"\n\nWe have given the preceding anecdote in detail, as furnishing one of the many instances in which Goldsmith's prompt and benevolent impulses outran all prudent forecast, and involved him in difficulties and disgraces which a more selfish man would have avoided. The pawning of the clothes, charged upon him as a crime by the grinding bookseller, and apparently admitted by him as one of \"the meannesses which poverty unavoidably brings with it,\" resulted, as we have shown, from a tenderness of heart and generosity of hand, in which another man would have gloried; but these were such natural elements with him, that he was unconscious of their\nIt is a pity that wealth does not oftener bring such \"meannesses\" in its train.\n\nAnd now let us be indulged in a few particulars about these lodgings in which Goldsmith was guilty of this thoughtless act of benevolence. They were in a very shabby house, No. 12, Green Arbour Court, between the Old Bailey and Fleet Market. An old woman was still living in 1820, who was a relative of the identical landlady whom Goldsmith relieved by the money received from the pawnbroker. She was a child about seven years of age at the time that the poet rented his apartment of her relative, and used frequently to be at the house in Green Arbour Court. She was drawn there, in a great measure, by the good-humoured kindness of Goldsmith, who was always exceedingly fond of the society of children. He used to assemble those of the family in his room, give them cakes, and sweetmeats, and set them dancing to the sound of his flute. He was very friendly to those around him, and cultivated a kind of intimacy with a watchmaker in the court, who possessed much native wit and humour. He passed most of the day, however, in his room, and only went out in the evenings. His days were, no doubt, devoted to the drudgery of the pen, and it would appear that he occasionally found the booksellers urgent taskmasters. On one occasion, a visitor was shown up to his room, and immediately their voices were heard in high altercation, and the key was turned within the lock. The landlady, at first, was disposed to go to the assistance of her lodger; but a calm succeeding, she forbore to interfere.\n\nLate in the evening the door was unlocked; a supper ordered by the visitor from a neighbouring tavern, and Goldsmith and his intrusive guest finished the evening in great good-humour. It was probably his old task-master, Griffiths, whose press might have been waiting, and who found no other mode of getting a stipulated task from Goldsmith, than by locking him in, and staying by him until it was finished.\n\nBut we have a more particular account of these lodgings in Green Arbour Court from the Rev. Thomas Percy, afterward Bishop of Dromore, and celebrated for his relics of ancient poetry, his beautiful ballads, and other works. During an occasional visit to London, he was introduced to Goldsmith by Grainger, and ever after continued one of his most steadfast and valued friends. The following is his description of\nthe poet's squalid apartment: \"I called on Goldsmith at his lodgings, in March, 1759, and found him writing his 'Inquiry,' in a miserable, dirty-looking room, in which there was but one chair; and when, from civility, he resigned it to me, he himself was obliged to sit in the window. While we were conversing together, some one tapped gently at the door, and being desired to come in, a poor, ragged, little girl, of a very becoming demeanour, entered the room, and, dropping a courtesy, said, 'My mamma sends her compliments, and begs the favour of you to lend her a chamber-pot full of coals.'\"\n\nWe are reminded in this anecdote of Goldsmith's picture of the lodgings of Beau Tibbs, and of the peep into the secrets of a makeshift establishment given to a visitor by the blundering old Scotch woman.\n\n\"By this time we were arrived as high as the stairs would permit us to ascend, till we came to what he was facetiously pleased to call the first floor down the chimney; and knocking at the door, a voice from within demanded 'Who's there?' My conductor answered that it was him. But this not satisfying the querist, the voice again repeated the demand, to which he answered louder than before; and now the door was opened by an old woman with cautious reluctance.\n\n\"When we got in, he welcomed me to his house with great ceremony; and, turning to the old woman, asked where was her lady. 'Good troth,' replied she, in a peculiar dialect, 'she's washing your twa shirts at the next door, because they have taken an oath against lending the tub any longer.' 'My two shirts,' cried he, in a tone that faltered with confusion; 'what does the idiot mean?' 'I ken what I mean weel enough,' replied the other; 'she's washing your twa shirts at the next door, because'\u2014Fire and fury! no more of thy stupid explanations,' cried he; 'go and inform her we have company. Were that Scotch hag to be for ever in my family, she would never learn politeness, nor forget that absurd, poisonous accent of hers, or testify the smallest specimen of breeding or high life; and yet it is very surprising too, as I had her from a Parliament man, a friend of mine from the Highlands, one of the politest men in the world; but that's a secret.\"*\n\nLet us a linger a little in Green Arbour Court, a place consecrated by the genius and the poverty of Goldsmith, but\n\n* Citizen of the World, Letter iv.\nrecently obliterated in the course of modern improvements. The writer of this memoir visited it not many years since, on a literary pilgrimage, and may be excused for repeating a description of it, which he has heretofore inserted in another publication. \"It then existed in its pristine state, and was a small square of tall and miserable houses, the very intestines of which seemed turned inside out, to judge from the old garments and frippery that fluttered from every window. It appeared to be a region of washerwomen, and lines were stretched about the little square, on which clothes were dangling to dry.\n\n\"Just as we entered the square, a scuffle took place between two viragoes about a disputed right to a washtub, and immediately the whole community was in a hubbub. Heads in mob caps popped out of every window, and such a clamour of tongues ensued, that I was fain to stop my ears. Every Amazon took part with one or other of the disputants, and brandished her arms, dripping with soapsuds, and fired away from her window as from the embrasure of a fortress; while the screams of children, nestled and cradled in every procreant chamber of this hive, waking with the noise, set up their shrill pipes to swell the general concert.\"*\n\nWhile in these forlorn quarters, suffering under extreme depression of spirits, caused by his failure at Surgeons' Hall, the disappointment of his hopes, and his harsh collisions with Griffiths, Goldsmith wrote the following letter to his brother Henry, some parts of which are most touchingly mournful.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014Your punctuality in answering a man whose trade is writing, is more than I had reason to expect; and yet you see me generally fill a whole sheet, which is all the recompence I can make for being so frequently troublesome. The behaviour of Mr. Mills and Mr. Lawder is a little extraordinary. However, their answering neither you nor me is a sufficient indication of their disliking the employment which I assigned them. As their conduct is different from what I had expected, so I have made an alteration in mine. I shall, the beginning of next month, send over two hundred and fifty books,+ which are all that I fancy can be well sold among you, and I would have you make some distinction in the persons who have subscribed. The money, which will amount to sixty pounds, may be left with Mr. Bradley as soon as possible. I am not certain but I shall quickly have occasion for it.\n\n* Tales of a Traveller.\n+ The \"Inquiry into Polite Literature.\" His previous remarks apply to the subscriptions.\n\"I have met with no disappointment with respect to my East India voyage; nor are my resolutions altered; though, at the same time, I must confess it gives me some pain to think I am almost beginning the world at the age of thirty-one. Though I never had a day's sickness since I saw you, yet I am not that strong active man you once knew me. You scarcely can conceive how much eight years of disappointment, anguish, and study, have worn me down. If I remember right, you are seven or eight years older than me, yet I dare venture to say, that if a stranger saw us both, he would pay me the honours of seniority. Imagine to yourself a pale, melancholy visage, with two great wrinkles between the eyebrows, with an eye disgustingly severe, and a big wig; and you may have a perfect picture of my present appearance. On the other hand, I conceive you as perfectly sleek and healthy, passing many a happy day among your own children, or those who knew you a child.\n\n\"Since I knew what it was to be a man, this is a pleasure I have not known. I have passed my days among a parcel of cool, designing beings, and have contracted all their suspicious manner in my own behaviour. I should actually be as unfit for the society of my friends at home, as I detest that which I am obliged to partake of here. I can now neither partake of the pleasure of a revel, nor contribute to raise its jollity. I can neither laugh nor drink; have contracted a hesitating, disagreeable manner of speaking, and a visage that looks ill-natured itself; in short, I have thought myself into a settled melancholy, and an utter disgust of all that life brings with it. Whence this romantic turn that all our family are possessed with? Whence this love for every place and every country but that in which we reside\u2014for every occupation but our own? This desire of fortune, and yet this eagerness to dissipate? I perceive, my dear sir, that I am at intervals for indulging this splenetic manner, and following my own taste regardless of yours.\n\n\"The reasons you have given me for breeding up your son a scholar are judicious and convincing; I should, however, be glad to know for what particular profession he is designed. If he be assiduous and divested of strong passions (for passions in youth always lead to pleasure), he may do very well in your college; for it must be owned that the industrious poor have good encouragement there\u2014perhaps better than in any other in Europe. But if he has ambition, strong passions, and an exquisite sensibility of contempt, do not send him there, unless you have no other trade for him but your own. It is impossible to conceive how much may be done by proper education at home. A boy, for instance, who understands perfectly well Latin, French, arithmetic, and five or six of the principles of the civil law, and can write a fine hand, has an education that may qualify him for any undertaking; and these parts of learning should be carefully inculcated, let him be designed for whatever calling he will.\n\n\"Above all things, let him never touch a romance or novel: they paint beauty in colours more charming than nature, and describe happiness that man never tastes. How delusive, how destructive are these pictures of consummate bliss! They teach the youthful mind to seek after beauty and happiness that never existed; to despise the little pleasures of...\"\nwhich fortune has mixed in our cup, by expecting more than she ever gave; and, in general, take the word of a man who has seen the world, and who has studied human nature more by experience than precept\u2014take my word for it, I say, that books teach us very little of the world. The greatest merit in a state of poverty, would only serve to make the possessor ridiculous\u2014may distress, but cannot relieve him. Frugality, and even avarice, in the lower orders of mankind, are true ambition. These afford the only ladder for the poor to rise to preferment. Teach, then, my dear sir, to your son, thrift and economy. Let his poor wandering uncle's example be placed before his eyes. I had learned from books to be disinterested and generous, before I was taught from experience the necessity of being prudent. I had contracted the habits and notions of a philosopher, while I was exposing myself to the approaches of insidious cunning; and often by being, even with my narrow finances, charitable to excess, I forgot the rules of justice, and placed myself in the very situation of the wretch who thanked me for my bounty. When I am in the remotest part of the world, tell him this, and perhaps he may improve from my example. But I find myself again falling into my gloomy habits of thinking.\n\n\"My mother, I am informed, is almost blind; even though I had the utmost inclination to return home, under such circumstances, I could not, for to behold her in distress without a capacity of relieving her from it, would add much to my splenetic habit. Your last letter was much too short; it should have answered some queries I had made in my former. Just sit down, as I do, and write forward until you have filled all your paper. It requires no thought, at least from the case with which my own sentiments rise when they are addressed to you. For, believe me, my head has no share in all I write; my heart dictates the whole. Pray give my love to Bob Bryanton, and entreat him from me not to drink. My dear sir, give me some account about poor Jenny.* Yet her husband loves her: if so, she cannot be unhappy.\n\n\"I know not whether I should tell you\u2014yet why should I conceal these trifles, or, indeed, anything from you? There is a book of mine will be published in a few days: the life of a very extraordinary man\u2014no less than the great Voltaire. You know already by the title that it is no more than a catchpenny. However, I spent but four weeks on the whole performance, for which I received twenty pounds. When published, I shall take some method of conveying it to you, unless you may think it dear of the postage, which may amount to four or five shillings. However, I fear you will not find an equivalent of amusement.\n\n\"Your last letter, I repeat it, was too short; you should have given me your opinion of the design of the hero-comical poem which I sent you. You remember I intended to introduce the hero of the poem as dying in a paltry alehouse. You may take the following specimen of the manner, which I flatter myself is quite original. The room in which he lies, may be described somewhat in this way\u2014\n\n* His sister, Mrs. Johnston; her marriage, like that of Mrs. Hodson, was private, but, in pecuniary matters, much less fortunate.\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH.\n\n\"The window, patched with paper, lent a ray\nThat feebly show'd the state in which he lay;\nThe sanded floor that grits beneath the tread,\nThe humid wall with paltry pictures spread;\nThe game of goose was there exposed to view,\nAnd the twelve rules the royal martyr drew;\nThe Seasons, framed with listing, found a place,\nAnd Prussia's monarch showed his lamp-black face.\nThe morn was cold; he views with keen desire\nA rusty grate unconscious of a fire;\nAn unpaid reckoning on the frieze was scored,\nAnd five crack'd teacups dress'd the chimney board.\"\n\n\"And now imagine, after this soliloquy, the landlord to make his appearance, in order to dun him for the reckoning:\n\n\"Not with that face, so servile and so gay,\nThat welcomes every stranger that can pay:\nWith sulky eye he smoked the patient man,\nThen pull'd his breeches tight, and thus began,' &c.*\n\n\"All this is taken, you see, from nature. It is a good remark of Montaigne's, that the wisest men often have friends with whom they do not care how much they play the fool. Take my present follies as instances of my regard. Poetry is a much easier and more agreeable species of composition than prose; and, could a man live by it, it were not unpleasant employment to be a poet. I am resolved to leave no space, though I should fill it up only by telling you what you very well know already, I mean that I am your most affectionate friend and brother,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nThe \"Life of Voltaire,\" alluded to in the latter part of the preceding letter, was the literary job undertaken to satisfy the demands of Griffiths. It was to have preceded a translation of the Henriade, by Ned Purdon, Goldsmith's old schoolmate, now a Grub-street writer, who starved rather than lived by the exercise of his pen, and often tasked Goldsmith's scanty means to relieve his hunger. His miserable career was summed up by our poet in the following lines, written some years after the time we are treating of, on hearing that he had suddenly dropped dead in Smithfield:\n\n\"Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,\nWho long was a bookseller's hack;\nHe led such a damnable life in this world,\nI don't think he'll wish to come back.\"\n\n* The projected poem, of which the above were specimens, appeared never to have been completed.\nThe memoir and translation, though advertised to form a volume, were not published together; but appeared separately in a magazine.\n\nAs to the hero\u00ef-comical poem, also cited in the foregoing letter, it appears to have perished in embryo; had it been brought to maturity, we should have had further traits of autobiography. The room already described was probably his own squalid quarters in Green Arbour Court; and in a subsequent morsel of the poem we have the poet himself, under the euphonious name of Scroggin:\n\n\"Where the Red Lion peering o'er the way,\nInvites each passing stranger that can pay;\nWhere Calvert's butt and Parson's black champaigne\nRegale the drabs and bloods of Drury Lane;\nThere, in a lonely room, from bailiffs snug,\nThe muse found Scroggins stretch'd beneath a rug;\nA nightcap deck'd his brows instead of bay,\nA cap by night, a stocking all the day!\"\n\nIt is to be regretted that this poetical conception was not carried out; like the author's other writings, it might have abounded with pictures of life and touches of nature, drawn from his own observation and experience, and mellowed by his own humane and tolerant spirit; and might have been a worthy companion, or rather contrast, to his \"Traveller\" and \"Deserted Village,\" and have remained in the language a first-rate specimen of the mock-heroic.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTowards the end of March, 1759, the treatise on which Goldsmith had laid so much stress, on which he at one time had calculated to defray the expenses of his outfit to India, and to which he had adverted in his correspondence with Griffiths, made its appearance. It was published by the Dodsleys, and entitled \"An Inquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe.\"\n\nIn the present day, when the whole field of contemporary literature is so widely surveyed and amply discussed, and when the current productions of every country are constantly collated and ably criticised, a treatise like that of Goldsmith would be considered as extremely limited and unsatisfactory; but at that time it possessed novelty in its views, and wideness\nin its scope, and being induced with the peculiar charm of style inseparable from the author, it commanded public attention and a profitable sale. As it was the most important production that had yet come from Goldsmith's pen, he was anxious to have the credit of it; yet it appeared without his name on the title-page. The authorship, however, was well known throughout the world of letters, and the author had now grown into sufficient literary importance to become an object of hostility to the underlings of the press. One of the most virulent attacks upon him was in a criticism on this treatise, and appeared in the \"Monthly Review,\" to which he himself had been recently a contributor. It slandered him as a man, while it decried him as an author, and accused him, by innuendo, of \"labouring under the infamy of having, by the vilest and meanest actions, forfeited all pretensions to honour and honesty,\" and of practising \"those acts which bring the sharper to the cart's tail or the pillory.\"\n\nIt will be remembered that the \"Review\" was owned by Griffiths the bookseller, with whom Goldsmith had recently had a misunderstanding. The criticism, therefore, was no doubt dictated by the lingerings of resentment; and the imputations upon Goldsmith's character for honour and honesty, and the vile and mean actions hinted at, could only allude to the unfortunate pawning of the clothes. All this, too, was after Griffiths had received the affecting letter from Goldsmith, drawing a picture of his poverty and perplexities, and after the latter had made him a literary compensation. Griffiths, in fact, was sensible of the falsehood and extravagance of the attack, and tried to exonerate himself by declaring that the criticism was written by a person in his employ; but we see no difference in atrocity between him who wields the knife and him who hires the cut-throat. It may be well, however, in passing, to bestow our mite of notoriety upon the miscreant who launched the slander\u2014he deserves it for a long course of dastardly and venomous attacks, not merely upon Goldsmith, but upon most of the successful authors of the day. His name was Kenrick; he was originally a mechanic, but possessing some degree of talent and industry, applied himself to literature as a profession. This he pursued for many years, and tried his hand in every department of prose and poetry; he wrote plays and satires, philosophical tracts, critical dissertations, and works on philology; nothing from his pen ever rose to first-rate merit. In his youth he read the works of Pope, Addison, Law, Steele, and others; but about the age of thirty he made a complete change.\n\nSome of his productions, other than those already mentioned, of interest to the literary notice of the day, are still preserved in manuscript, and are notorious for their merit. We shall give a specimen of his writings.\nfirst-rate excellence, or gained him a popular name, though he received from some University the degree of Doctor of Laws. Dr. Johnson characterized his literary career in one short sentence: \"Sir, he is one of the many who have made themselves public without making themselves known.\"\n\nSoured by his own want of success, jealous of the success of others, his natural irritability of temper increased by habits of intemperance, he at length abandoned himself to the practice of reviewing, and became one of the Ishmaelites of the press. In this, his malignant bitterness soon gave him a notoriety which his talents had never been able to attain. We shall dismiss him for the present with the following sketch of him, by the hand of one of his contemporaries:\n\n\"Dreaming of genius which he never had,\nHalf wit, half fool, half critic, and half mad;\nSeizing, like Shirley, on the poet's lyre,\nWith all his rage, but not one spark of fire;\nEager for slaughter, and resolved to tear\nFrom others' brows that wreath he must not wear\u2014\nNext Kenrick came: all furious and replete\nWith brandy, malice, pertness, and conceit;\nUnskill'd in classic lore, through envy blind\nTo all that's beauteous, learned, or refined;\nFor faults alone behold the savage prowl,\nWith reason's offal glut his ravening soul;\nPleased with his prey, its inmost blood he drinks,\nAnd mumbles, paws, and turns it\u2014till it stinks.\"\n\nThe British press about this time was extravagantly fruitful of periodical publications. That \"oldest inhabitant,\" the \"Gentleman's Magazine,\" almost co\u00ebval with St. John's Gate, which graced its title-page, had long been elbowed by magazines and reviews of all kinds; Johnson's \"Rambler\" had introduced the fashion of periodical essays, which he had followed up in his \"Adventurer\" and \"Idler.\" Imitations had sprung up on every side, under every variety of name, until British literature was entirely overrun by a weedy and transient efflorescence. Many of these rival periodicals choked each other almost at the outset, and few have escaped oblivion.\n\nGoldsmith wrote for some of the most successful, such as \"The Bee,\" \"The Busy-Body,\" and \"The Lady's Magazine.\" His essays, though characterized by his delightful style, his pure, benevolent morality, and his mellow, unobtrusive humour, did not produce equal effect at first with more garish writings of infinitely less value; they did not \"strike,\" as it is\ntermed; but they had that rare and enduring merit which rises in estimation on every perusal. They gradually stole upon the heart of the public, were copied into numerous contemporary publications, and now they are garnered up among the choice productions of British literature.\n\nIn his \"Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning,\" Goldsmith had given offence to David Garrick, at that time the autocrat of the drama, and was doomed to experience its effects. A clamour had been raised against Garrick for exercising a despotism over the stage, and bringing forward nothing but old plays, to the exclusion of original productions. Walpole joined in this charge. \"Garrick,\" said he, \"is treating the town as it deserves and likes to be treated, with scenes, fire-works, and his own writings. A good new play I never expect to see more; nor have seen since the 'Provoked Husband,' which came out when I was at school.\" Goldsmith, who was extremely fond of the theatre, and felt the evils of this system, inveighed in his treatise against the wrongs experienced by authors at the hands of managers. \"Our poets' performance,\" said he, \"must undergo a process truly chemical before it is presented to the public. It must be tried in the manager's fire; strained through a licenser, suffer from repeated corrections, till it may be a mere caput mortuum when it arrives before the public.\" Again: \"Getting a play on even in three or four years is a privilege reserved only for the happy few who have the arts of courting the manager as well as the muse; who have adulation to please his vanity, powerful patrons to support their merit, or money to indemnify disappointment. Our Saxon ancestors had but one name for a wit and a witch. I will not dispute the propriety of uniting those characters then; but the man who under present discouragements ventures to write for the stage, whatever claims he may have to the appellation of a wit, at least has no right to be called a conjuror.\" But a passage which perhaps touched more sensibly than all the rest on the sensibilities of Garrick, was the following:\n\n\"I have no particular spleen against the fellow who sweeps the stage with the besom, or the hero who brushes it with his train. It were a matter of indifference to me, whether our heroines are in keeping, or our candle-snuffers burn their fingers, did not such make a great part of public care and polite conversation. Our actors assume all that state off the stage, and from the stage to the audience, from the audience to the stage.\"\n\nThis was a subject which engaged himself very much, and he waited on the Secretary's office, and members of the House of Commons, intimating his desire to become a buddy. He was very importunate, and was observed to be very attentive after the first moment. His abilities were acknowledged. He made a speech, and was appointed to the second place. A passage which perhaps touched more sensibly than all the rest on the sensibilities of Garrick, was the following:\n\n\"I have no particular spleen against the fellow who sweeps the stage with the besom, or the hero who brushes it with his train. It were a matter of indifference to me, whether our heroines are in keeping, or our candle-snuffers burn their fingers, did not such make a great part of public care and polite conversation. Our actors assume all that state off the stage, and from the stage to the audience, from the audience to the stage.\"\nstage which they do on it; and, to use an expression borrowed from the green-room, every one is up in his part. I am sorry to say it, they seem to forget their real characters.\"\n\nThese strictures were considered by Garrick as intended for himself, and they were rankling in his mind when Goldsmith waited upon him and solicited his vote for the vacant secretaryship of the Society of Arts, of which the manager was a member. Garrick, puffed up by his dramatic renown, and his intimacy with the great, and knowing Goldsmith only by his budding reputation, may not have considered him of sufficient importance to be conciliated. In reply to his solicitations, he observed that he could hardly expect his friendly exertions after the unprovoked attack he had made upon his management. Goldsmith replied that he had indulged in no personalities, and had only spoken what he believed to be truth. He made no further apology nor application; failed to get the appointment, and considered Garrick his enemy. In the second edition of this treatise he expunged or modified the passages which had given the manager offence; but though the author and actor became intimate in after years, this false step at the outset of their intercourse was never forgotten.\n\nAbout this time Goldsmith engaged with Dr. Smollett, who was about to launch the British Magazine. Smollett was a complete schemer and speculator in literature, and intent upon enterprises that had money rather than reputation in view. Goldsmith has a good-humoured hit at this propensity in one of his papers in the \"Bee,\" in which he represents Johnson, Hume, and others, taking seats in the stage-coach bound for Fame, while Smollett prefers that destined for Riches.\n\nAnother prominent employer of Goldsmith was Mr. John Newbery, who engaged him to contribute occasional essays to a newspaper entitled the \"Public Ledger,\" which made its first appearance on the 12th of January 1760. His most valuable and characteristic contributions to this paper were his \"Chinese Letters,\" subsequently modified into the \"Citizen of the World.\" These lucubrations attracted general attention; they were reprinted in the various periodical publications of the day, and met with great applause. The name of the author, however, was as yet but little known.\n\nBeing now easier in circumstances, and in the receipt of frequent sums from the booksellers, Goldsmith, about the middle of 1760, emerged from his dismal abode in Green.\nArbour Court, and took respectable apartments in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street.\n\nStill he continued to look back with considerate benevolence to the poor hostess, whose necessities he had relieved by pawning his gala coat, for we are told that \"he often supplied her with food from his own table, and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her.\"\n\nHe now became a member of a debating club, called the \"Robin Hood,\" which used to meet near Temple Bar, and in which Burke, while yet a Temple student, had first tried his powers. Goldsmith spoke here occasionally, and is recorded in the Robin Hood archives as \"a candid disputant, with a clear head and an honest heart, though coming but seldom to the society.\" His relish was for clubs of a more social, jovial nature, and he was never fond of argument. An amusing anecdote is told of his first introduction to the club, by Samuel Derrick, an Irish acquaintance of some humour. On entering, Goldsmith was struck with the self-important appearance of the chairman, ensconced in a large gilt chair. \"This,\" said he, \"must be the Lord Chancellor at least.\" \"No, no,\" replied Derrick, \"he's only master of the rolls.\"\u2014The chairman was a baker.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nIn his new lodgings in Wine Office Court, Goldsmith began to receive visits of ceremony, and to entertain his literary friends. Among the latter he now numbered several names of note, such as Guthrie, Murphy, Christopher Smart, and Bickerstaff. He had also a numerous class of hangers-on, the small fry of literature; who, knowing his almost utter incapacity to refuse a pecuniary request, were apt, now that he was considered flush, to levy continual taxes upon his purse.\n\nAmong others, one Pilkington, an old college acquaintance, but now a shifting adventurer, duped him in the most ludicrous manner. He called on him with a face full of perplexity. A lady of the first rank having an extraordinary fancy for curious animals, for which she was willing to give enormous sums, he had procured a couple of white mice to be forwarded to her from India. They were actually on board of a ship in the river. Her grace had been apprised of their arrival, and was all impatience to see them, Unfortunately he had no\ncage to put them in, nor clothes to appear in before a lady of her rank. Two guineas would be sufficient for his purpose, but where were two guineas to be procured?\n\nThe simple heart of Goldsmith was touched; but, alas! he had but half-a-guinea in his pocket. It was unfortunate, but, after a pause, his friend suggested, with some hesitation, \"that money might be raised upon his watch; it would but be the loan of a few hours.\" So said, so done; the watch was delivered to the worthy Mr. Pilkington to be pledged at a neighbouring pawnbroker's, but nothing further was ever seen of him, the watch, or the white mice. The next that Goldsmith heard of the poor shifting scapegrace, he was on his death-bed, starving with want, upon which, forgetting or forgiving the trick he had played upon him, he sent him a guinea. Indeed he used often to relate with great humour the foregoing anecdote of his credulity, and was ultimately in some degree indemnified, by its suggesting to him the amusing little story of Prince Bonbennin and the White Mouse in the \"Citizen of the World.\"\n\nIn this year Goldsmith became personally acquainted with Dr. Johnson, toward whom he was drawn by strong sympathies, though their natures were widely different. Both had struggled from early life with poverty, but had struggled in different ways. Goldsmith, buoyant, heedless, sanguine, tolerant of evils, and easily pleased, had shifted along by any temporary expedient; cast down at every turn, but rising again with indomitable good-humour, and still carried forward by his talent at hoping. Johnson, melancholy and hypochondriacal, and prone to apprehend the worst, yet sternly resolute to battle with, and conquer it, had made his way doggedly and gloomily, but with a noble principle of self-reliance, and a disregard of foreign aid. Both had been irregular at college, Goldsmith, as we have shown, from the levity of his nature and his social and convivial habits; Johnson, from his acerbity and gloom. When in after life, the latter heard himself spoken of as gay and frolicsome at college, because he had joined in some riotous excesses there, \"Ah, sir!\" replied he, \"I was mad and violent. It was bitterness which they mistook for frolic. I was miserably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my wit. So I disregarded all power and all authority.\"\n\nGoldsmith's poverty was never accompanied by bitterness;\nbut neither was it accompanied by the guardian pride which kept Johnson from falling into the degrading shifts of poverty. Goldsmith had an unfortunate facility at borrowing, and helping himself along by the contributions of his friends; no doubt trusting, in his hopeful way, of one day making retribution. Johnson never hoped, and therefore never borrowed. In his sternest trials, he proudly bore the ills he could not master. In his youth, when some unknown friend, seeing his shoes completely worn out, left a new pair at his chamber door, he disdained to accept the boon, and threw them away.\n\nThough like Goldsmith, an immethodical student, he had imbibed deeper draughts of knowledge, and made himself a riper scholar. While Goldsmith's happy constitution and genial humours carried him abroad into sunshine and enjoyment, Johnson's physical infirmities and mental gloom drove him upon himself; to the resources of reading and meditation; threw a deeper though darker enthusiasm into his mind, and stored a retentive memory with all kinds of knowledge.\n\nAfter several years of youth passed in the country as usher, teacher, and an occasional writer for the press, Johnson, when twenty-eight years of age, came up to London with a half-written tragedy in his pocket; and David Garrick, late his pupil, and several years his junior, as a companion, both poor and penniless, both, like Goldsmith, seeking their fortune in the metropolis. \"We rode and tied,\" said Garrick, sportively, in after years of prosperity, when he spoke of their humble wayfaring. \"I came to London,\" said Johnson, \"with twopence-halfpenny in my pocket.\" \"Eh, what's that you say?\" cried Garrick, \"with twopence-halfpenny in your pocket?\" \"Why yes; I came with twopence-halfpenny in my pocket, and thou, Davy, with but three-halfpence in thine.\" Nor was there much exaggeration in the picture; for so poor were they in purse and credit, that after their arrival they had, with difficulty, raised five pounds, by giving their joint note to a bookseller in the Strand.\n\nMany, many years had Johnson gone on obscurely in London, \"fighting his way by his literature and his wit;\" enduring all the hardships and miseries of a Grub-street writer: so destitute at one time, that he and Savage the poet had walked all night about St. James's Square, both too poor to pay for a night's lodging, yet both full of poetry and patriotism, and determined to stand by their country; so shabby in dress\nat another time, that when he dined at Cave's, his bookseller, when there was prosperous company, he could not make his appearance at table, but had his dinner handed to him behind a screen.\n\nYet, through all the long and dreary struggle, often diseased in mind as well as in body, he had been resolutely self-dependent, and proudly self-respectful; he had fulfilled his college vow, he had \"fought his way by his literature and his wit.\" His \"Rambler\" and \"Idler\" had made him the great moralist of the age, and his \"Dictionary and History of the English Language,\" that stupendous monument of individual labour, had excited the admiration of the learned world. He was now at the head of intellectual society; and had become as distinguished by his conversational, as his literary powers. He had become as much an autocrat in his sphere, as his fellow-wayfarer and adventurer Garrick had become of the stage, and had been humorously dubbed by Smollett, \"The Great Cham of Literature.\"\n\nSuch was Dr. Johnson, when, on the 31st of May, 1761, he was to make his appearance as a guest at a literary supper given by Goldsmith, to a numerous party at his new lodgings in Wine Office Court. It was the opening of their acquaintance. Johnson had felt and acknowledged the merit of Goldsmith as an author, and been pleased by the honourable mention made of himself in the \"Bee\" and the \"Chinese Letters.\" Dr. Percy called upon Johnson to take him to Goldsmith's lodgings; he found Johnson arrayed with unusual care in a new suit of clothes, a new hat, and a well-powdered wig; and could not but notice his uncommon spruceness. \"Why, sir,\" replied Johnson, \"I hear that Goldsmith, who is a very great sloven, justifies his disregard of cleanliness and decency by quoting my practice, and I am desirous this night to show him a better example.\"\n\nThe acquaintance thus commenced, ripened into intimacy in the course of frequent meetings at the shop of Davies, the bookseller, in Russell-street, Covent Garden. As this was one of the great literary gossiping places of the day, especially to the circle over which Johnson presided, it is worthy of some specification. Mr. Thomas Davies, noted in after times as the biographer of Garrick, had originally been on the stage, and though a small man, had enacted tyrannical tragedy, with a pomp and magniloquence beyond his size, if we may trust the description given of him by Churchill in the \"Rosciad;\"\n\"Statesman all over\u2014in plots famous grown,\nHe mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone.\"\n\nThis unlucky sentence is said to have crippled him in the midst of his tragic career, and ultimately to have driven him from the stage. He carried into the bookselling craft somewhat of the grandiose manner of the stage, and was prone to be mouthy and magniloquent.\n\nChurchill had intimated, that while on the stage he was more noted for his pretty wife than his good acting:\n\n\"With him came mighty Davies; on my life,\nThat fellow has a very pretty wife.\"\n\n\"Pretty Mrs. Davies\" continued to be the lode-star of his fortunes; her tea-table became almost as much a literary lounge as her husband's shop. She found favour in the eyes of the Ursa Major of literature by her winning ways, and she poured out for him cups without stint of his favourite beverage. Indeed, it is suggested that she was one leading cause of his habitual resort to this literary haunt. Others were drawn thither for the sake of Johnson's conversation, and thus it became the resort of many of the notoriety of the day: here might occasionally be seen Bennet Langton, George Stephens, Dr. Percy, celebrated for his ancient ballads, and sometimes Warburton in prelatic state. Garrick resorted to it for a time, but soon grew shy and suspicious, declaring that most of the authors who frequented Mr. Davies's shop went merely to abuse him.\n\nFoote, the Aristophanes of the day, was a frequent visitor; his broad face beaming with fun and waggery, and his satirical eye ever on the look-out for characters and incidents for his farces. He was struck with the odd habits and appearance of Johnson and Goldsmith, now so often brought together in Davies's shop; he was about to put on the stage a farce called \"The Orators,\" intended as a hit at the Robin Hood debating club, and resolved to show up the two doctors in it for the entertainment of the town.\n\n\"What is the common price of an oak stick, sir?\" said Johnson to Davies. \"Sixpence,\" was the reply. \"Why then, sir, give me leave to send your servant to purchase a shilling one. I'll have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to take me off, as he calls it, and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity.\"\n\nFoote had no disposition to undergo the criticism of the\ncudgel, wielded by such potent hands, so the farce of \"The Orators\" appeared without the caricatures of the lexicographer and the essayist.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nNotwithstanding his growing success, Goldsmith continued to consider literature a mere make-shift, and his vagrant imagination teemed with schemes and plans of a grand but indefinite nature. One was for visiting the East and exploring the interior of Asia; he had, as has been before observed, a vague notion that valuable discoveries were to be made there, and many useful inventions in the arts brought back to the stock of European knowledge, \"Thus, in Siberian Tartary,\" observes he, in one of his writings, \"the natives extract a strong spirit from milk, which is a secret probably unknown to the chemists of Europe. In the most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dyeing vegetable substances scarlet, and that of refining lead into a metal which, for hardness and colour, is little inferior to silver.\"\n\nGoldsmith adds a description of the kind of person suited to such an enterprise, in which he evidently had himself in view.\n\n\"He should be a man of a philosophical turn, one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences; neither swollen with pride, nor hardened by prejudice; neither wedded to one particular system, nor instructed only in one particular science; neither wholly a botanist, nor quite an antiquarian; his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men; he should be in some measure an enthusiast to the design; fond of travelling, from a rapid imagination, and an innate love of change; furnished with a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger.\"\n\nIn 1761, when Lord Bute became prime minister on the accession of George the Third, Goldsmith drew up a memorial on the subject, suggesting the advantages to be derived from a mission to those countries solely for useful and scientific purposes; and, the better to ensure success, he preceded his application to the government by an ingenious essay to the same effect in the \"Public Ledger.\"\n\nHis memorial and his essay were fruitless, his project most probably being deemed the dream of a visionary. Still it continued to haunt his mind, and he would often talk of making\nan expedition to Aleppo some time or other, when his means were greater, to inquire into the arts peculiar to the East, and to bring home such as might be valuable. Johnson, who knew how little poor Goldsmith was fitted by scientific lore for this favourite scheme of his fancy, scoffed at the project when it was mentioned to him, \"Of all men,\" said he, \"Goldsmith is the most unfit to go out upon such an inquiry, for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we already possess, and, consequently, could not know what would be accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would bring home a grinding barrow, which you see in every street in London, and think that he had furnished a wonderful improvement.\"\n\nHis connexion with Newbery, the bookseller, now led him into a variety of temporary jobs, such as a pamphlet on the Cock-lane ghost, a \"Life of Beau Nash,\" the famous master of ceremonies at Bath, &c. One of the best things for his fame, however, was the remodelling and republication of his \"Chinese Letters,\" under the title of \"the Citizen of the World,\" a work which has long since taken its merited stand among the classics of the English language. \"Few works,\" it has been observed by one of his biographers, \"exhibit a nicer perception, or more delicate delineation of life and manners. Wit, humour, and sentiment, pervade every page; the vices and follies of the day are touched with the most playful and diverting satire; and English characteristics, in endless variety, are hit off with the pencil of a master.\"\n\nIn seeking materials for his varied views of life, he often mingled in strange scenes, and got involved in whimsical situations. In the summer of 1762, he was one of the thousands who went to see the Cherokee chiefs, whom he mentions in one of his writings. The Indians made their appearance in grand costume, hideously painted and besmeared. In the course of the visit Goldsmith made one of the chiefs a present, who, in the ecstasy of his gratitude, gave him an embrace, that left his face well bedaubed with oil and red ochre.\n\nTowards the close of 1762, he removed to \"merry Islington,\" then a country village, though now swallowed up in omnivorous London; he went there for the benefit of country air, his health being injured by literary application and confinement, and to be near his chief employer, Mr. Newbery, who resided in the Canonbury House. In this neighbourhood,\nhe used to take his solitary rambles, sometimes extending his walks to the gardens of the \"White Conduit House,\" so famous among the essayists of the last century. While strolling one day in these gardens, he met three females of the family of a respectable tradesman, to whom he was under some obligation. With his prompt disposition to oblige, he conducted them about the garden, treated them to tea, and ran up a bill in the most open-handed manner imaginable; it was only when he came to pay, that he found himself in one of his old dilemmas: he had not the wherewithal in his pocket. A scene of perplexity now took place between him and the waiter, in the midst of which, came up some of his acquaintances, in whose eyes he wished to stand particularly well. This completed his mortification. There was no concealing the awkwardness of his position. The sneers of the waiter revealed it; his acquaintances amused themselves for some time at his expense, professing their inability to relieve him. When they had enjoyed their banter, the waiter was paid, and poor Goldsmith enabled to convoy off the ladies with flying colors.\n\nAmong the various productions thrown off by him for the booksellers during this growing period of his reputation, was a small work in two volumes, entitled the \"History of England, in a series of Letters from a Nobleman to his Son.\" It was digested from Hume, Rapin, Carte, and Kennet. These authors he would read in the morning; make a few notes; ramble with a friend into the country about the skirts of \"merry Islington;\" return to a temperate dinner, and cheerful evening; and before going to bed, write off what had arranged itself in his head from the studies of the morning. In this way he took a more general view of the subject, and wrote in a more free and fluent style, than if he had been mousing all the time among authorities. The work, like many others written by him in the earlier part of his literary career, was anonymous. Some attributed it to Lord Chesterfield, others to Lord Orrery, and others to Lord Lyttleton. The latter seemed pleased to be the putative father, and never disowned the bantling thus laid at his door; and well might he have been proud to be considered capable of producing, what has been well-pronounced \"the most finished and elegant summary of English history in the same compass that has been or is likely to be written.\"\n\nThe reputation of Goldsmith, it will be perceived, grew...\nslowly; he was known and estimated by a few; but he had not those brilliant, though fallacious qualities which flash upon the public, and excite loud, but transient applause. His works were more read than cited; and the charm of style, for which he was especially noted, was more apt to be felt than talked about. He used often to repine, in a half-humorous, half-querulous manner, at his tardiness in gaining the laurels which he felt to be his due. \"The public,\" he would exclaim, \"will never do me justice; whenever I write anything, they make a point to know nothing about it.\"\n\nAbout the beginning of 1763, he became acquainted with Boswell, whose literary gossipings were destined to have a deleterious effect upon his reputation. Boswell was at that time a young man, light, buoyant, pushing, and presumptuous. He had a morbid passion for mingling in the society of men noted for wit and learning, and had just arrived from Scotland, bent upon making his way into the literary circles of the metropolis. An intimacy with Dr. Johnson, the great literary luminary of the day, was the crowning object of his aspiring, and somewhat ludicrous ambition. He expected to meet him at a dinner to which he was invited at Davies, the bookseller's, but was disappointed. Goldsmith was present, but he was not as yet sufficiently renowned to excite the reverence of Boswell. \"At this time,\" says he in his notes, \"I think he had published nothing with his name, though it was pretty generally understood that one Dr. Goldsmith was the author of 'An Inquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe,' and of 'The Citizen of the World,' a series of letters supposed to be written from London by a Chinee.\"\n\nA conversation took place at table between Goldsmith and Mr. Robert Dodsley, compiler of the well-known collection of modern poetry, as to the merits of the current poetry of the day. Goldsmith declared there was none of superior merit. Dodsley cited his own collection in proof of the contrary. \"It is true,\" said he, \"we can boast of no palaces now-a-days, like 'Dryden's Ode to St. Cecilia's Day,' but we have villages composed of very pretty houses.\" Goldsmith, however, maintained that there was nothing above mediocrity, an opinion in which Johnson, to whom it was repeated, concurred, and with reason, for the era was one of the dead levels of British poetry.\n\nBoswell has made no note of this conversation; he was an Unitarian in his literary devotion, and disposed to worship\nBECOMES ACQUAINTED WITH BOSWELL.\n\nnone but Johnson. Little Davies endeavoured to console him for his disappointment, and to stay the stomach of his curiosity, by giving him imitations of the great lexicographer; mouthing his words, rolling his head, and assuming as ponderous a manner as his petty person would permit. Boswell was shortly afterwards made happy by an introduction to Johnson, of whom he became the obsequious satellite. From him, he likewise imbibed a more favourable opinion of Goldsmith's merits, though he was fain to consider them derived in a great measure from his Magnus Apollo. \"He had sagacity enough,\" says he, \"to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance of Johnson, and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of such a model. To me, and many others, it appeared that he studiously copied the manner of Johnson, though, indeed, upon a smaller scale.\" So, on another occasion, he calls him \"one of the brightest ornaments of the Johnsonian school.\" \"His respectful attachment to Johnson,\" adds he, \"was then at its height; for his own literary reputation had not yet distinguished him so much, as to excite a vain desire of competition with his great master.\"\n\nWhat beautiful instances does the garrulous Boswell give of the goodness of heart of Johnson, and the passing homage to it by Goldsmith! They were speaking of a Mr. Levett, long an inmate of Johnson's house and a dependent on his bounty; but who, Boswell thought, must be an irksome charge upon him. \"He is poor and honest,\" said Goldsmith, \"which is recommendation enough to Johnson.\"\n\nBoswell mentioned another person of a very bad character, and wondered at Johnson's kindness to him. \"He is now become miserable,\" said Goldsmith, \"and that insures the protection of Johnson.\" Encomiums like these speak almost as much for the heart of him who praises, as of him who is praised.\n\nSubsequently, when Boswell had become more intense in his literary idolatry, he affected to undervalue Goldsmith, and a lurking hostility to him is discernible throughout his writings, which some have attributed to a silly spirit of jealousy of the superior esteem evinced for the poet by Dr. Johnson. We have a gleam of this in his account of the first evening he spent in company with those two eminent authors at their famous resort, the Mitre Tavern, in Fleet-street. This took place on the 1st of July, 1763. The trio supped together, and passed some time in literary conversation. On quitting the\ntavern, Johnson, who had now been sociably acquainted with Goldsmith for two years, and knew his merits, took him with him to drink tea with his blind pensioner, Miss Williams; a high privilege among his intimates and admirers. To Boswell, a recent acquaintance, whose intrusive sycophancy had not yet made its way into his confidential intimacy, he gave no invitation. Boswell felt it with all the jealousy of a little mind.\n\n\"Dr. Goldsmith,\" says he, in his memoirs, \"being a privileged man, went with him, strutting away, and calling to me with an air of superiority, like that of an esoteric over an exoteric disciple of a sage of antiquity, 'I go to Miss Williams.' I confess I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which he seemed to be so proud; but it was not long before I obtained the same mark of distinction.\"\n\nObtained! but how? not like Goldsmith, by the force of unpretending, but congenial merit, but by a course of the most pushing, contriving, and spaniel-like subserviency. Really, the ambition of the man to illustrate his mental insignificance, by continually placing himself in juxtaposition with the great lexicographer, has something in it perfectly ludicrous. Never, since the days of Don Quixotte and Sancho Panza, has there been presented to the world a more whimsically contrasted pair of associates than Johnson and Boswell.\n\n\"Who is this Scotch cur at Johnson's heels?\" asked some one, when Boswell had worked his way into incessant companionship. \"He is not a cur,\" replied Goldsmith, \"you are too severe: he is only a burr. Tom Davies flung him at Johnson in sport, and he has the faculty of sticking.\"\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nAmong the intimates who used to visit the poet occasionally in his retreat at Islington, was Hogarth the painter. Goldsmith had spoken well of him in his essays in the \"Public Ledger,\" and this formed the first link in their friendship. He was at this time upwards of sixty years of age, and is described as a stout, active, bustling little man, in a sky-blue coat, satirical and dogmatic, yet full of real benevolence, and the love of human nature. He was the moralist and philosopher of the pencil; like Goldsmith, he had sounded the depths of vice and misery, without being polluted by them; and though his picturings had not the pervading amenity of those\nof the essayist, and dwelt more on the crimes and vices than\nthe follies and humours of mankind, yet they were all calcu-\nlated, in like manner, to fill the mind with instruction and\nprecept, and to make the heart better.\n\nHogarth does not appear to have had much of the rural\nfeeling with which Goldsmith was so amply endowed, and may\nnot have accompanied him in his strolls about hedges and\ngreen lanes; but he was a fit companion with whom to\nexplore the mazes of London, in which he was continually on\nthe look out for character and incident. One of Hogarth's\nadmirers speaks of having come upon him in Castle-street,\nengaged in one of his street studies, watching two boys who\nwere quarrelling; patting one on the back who flinched, and\nendeavouring to spirit him up to a fresh encounter. \"At him\nagain! D\u2014him, if I would take it of him! at him again!\"\n\nA frail memorial of this intimacy between the painter and\nthe poet exists in a portrait in oil, called \"Goldsmith's\nHostess.\" It is supposed to have been painted by Hogarth\nin the course of his visits to Islington, and given by him to\nthe poet as a means of paying his landlady. There are no\nfriendships among men of talents more likely to be sincere\nthan those between painters and poets. Possessed of the\nsame qualities of mind, governed by the same principles of\ntaste and natural laws of grace and beauty, but applying them\nto different, yet mutually illustrative, arts, they are constantly\nin sympathy, and never in collision with each other.\n\nA still more congenial intimacy of the kind was that con-\ntracted by Goldsmith with Mr., afterwards Sir Joshua, Reynolds.\nThe latter was now about 40 years of age, a few years older\nthan the poet, whom he charmed by the blandness and benig-\nnity of his manners, and the nobleness and generosity of his\ndisposition, as much as he did by the graces of his pencil and\nthe magic of his colouring. They were men of kindred genius,\nexcelling in corresponding qualities of their several arts, for\nstyle in writing is what colour is in painting; both are innato\nendowments, and equally magical in their effects. Certain\ngraces and harmonies of both may be acquired by diligent\nstudy and imitation, but only in a limited degree; whereas\nby their natural possessors they are exercised spontaneously,\nalmost unconsciously, and with ever-varying fascination.\nReynolds soon understood and appreciated the merits of Gold-\nsmith, and a sincere and lasting friendship ensued between them.\nAt Reynolds's house, Goldsmith mingled in a higher range of company than he had been accustomed to. The fame of this celebrated artist, and his amenity of manners, were gathering round him men of talents of all kinds, and the increasing affluence of his circumstances enabled him to give full indulgence to his hospitable disposition. Poor Goldsmith had not yet, like Dr. Johnson, acquired reputation enough to atone for his external defects, and his want of the air of good society. Miss Reynolds used to inveigh against his personal appearance, which gave her the idea, she said, of a low mechanic, a journeyman tailor. One evening, at a large supper party, being called upon to give as a toast the ugliest man she knew, she gave Dr. Goldsmith, upon which a lady who sat opposite, and whom she had never met before, shook hands with her across the table, and \"hoped to become better acquainted.\"\n\nWe have a graphic and amusing picture of Reynolds's hospitable, but motley establishment, in an account given by a Mr. Courtenay to Sir James Mackintosh; though it speaks of a time after Reynolds had received the honour of knighthood. \"There was something singular,\" said he, \"in the style and economy of Sir Joshua's table, that contributed to pleasantry and good humour\u2014a coarse, inelegant plenty, without any regard to order and arrangement. At five o'clock precisely, dinner was served, whether all the invited guests were arrived or not. Sir Joshua was never so fashionably ill-bred as to wait an hour, perhaps, for two or three persons of rank or title, and put the rest of the company out of humour by this invidious distinction. His invitations, however, did not regulate the number of his guests. Many dropped in uninvited. A table prepared for seven or eight was often compelled to contain fifteen or sixteen. There was a consequent deficiency of knives, forks, plates, and glasses. The attendance was in the same style, and those who were knowing in the ways of the house took care, on sitting down, to call instantly for beer, bread or wine, that they might secure a supply before the first course was over. He was once prevailed on to furnish the table with decanters and glasses at dinner, to save time and prevent confusion. These gradually were demolished in the course of service, and were never replaced. These trifling embarrassments, however, only served to enhance the hilarity and singular pleasure of the entertainment. The wine, cookery, and dishes, were but little attended to; nor was the fish or\nvenison ever talked of or recommended. Amidst this convivial, animated bustle among his guests, our host sat perfectly composed; always attentive to what was said, never minding what was ate or drank, but left every one at perfect liberty to scramble for himself.\"\n\nOut of the casual, but frequent meeting of men of talent at this hospitable board rose that association of wits, authors, scholars, and statesmen, renowned as the Literary Club. Reynolds was the first to propose a regular association of the kind, and was eagerly seconded by Johnson, who proposed as a model, a club which he had formed many years previously in Ivy Lane, but which was now extinct. Like that club, the number of members was limited to nine. They were to meet and sup together, once a week on Monday night, at the Turk's Head, in Gerard Street, Soho, and two members were to constitute a meeting. It took a regular form in the year 1764, but did not receive its literary appellation until several years afterwards.\n\nThe original members were Reynolds, Johnson, Burke, Dr. Nugent, Bennet Langton, Topham Beauclerc, Chamier, Hawkins, and Goldsmith; and here a few words concerning some of the members may be acceptable. Burke was at that time about thirty-three years of age; he had mingled a little in politics and been under secretary to Hamilton at Dublin, but was again a writer for the booksellers, and as yet but in the dawning of his fame. Dr. Nugent was his father-in-law, a Roman Catholic, and a physician of talent and instruction. Mr., afterwards Sir John, Hawkins, was admitted into this association from having been a member of Johnson's Ivy Lane Club. Originally an attorney, he had retired from the practice of the law in consequence of a large fortune which fell to him in right of his wife, and was now a Middlesex magistrate. He was, moreover, a dabbler in literature and music, and was actually engaged on a history of music, which he subsequently published in five ponderous volumes. To him we are also indebted for a biography of Johnson, which appeared after the death of that eminent man. Hawkins was as mean and parsimonious, as he was pompous and conceited. He forbore to partake of the suppers at the club, and begged, therefore, to be excused from paying his share of the reckoning. \"And was he excused?\" asked Dr. Burney of Johnson. \"Oh yes, for no man is angry at another for being inferior to himself.\"\nWe all scorned him, and admitted his plea. Yet I really believe him to be an honest man at bottom, though, to be sure, he is penurious and he is mean, and it must be owned that he has a tendency to savageness.\" He did not remain above two or three years in the club, being in a manner elbowed out in consequence of his rudeness to Burke.\n\nMr. Anthony Chamier was secretary in the War Office, and a friend of Beauclerc, by whom he was proposed. We have left our mention of Bennet Langton and Topham Beauclerc until the last, because we have most to say about them. They were doubtless induced to join the club through their devotion to Johnson, and the intimacy of these two very young and aristocratic young men with the stern and somewhat melancholy moralist, is among the curiosities of literature.\n\nBennet Langton was of an ancient family, who held their ancestral estate of Langton in Lincolnshire, a great title to respect with Johnson. \"Langton, sir,\" he would say, \"has a grant of free warren from Henry the Second; and Cardinal Stephen Langton, in King John's reign, was of this family.\"\n\nLangton was of a mild, contemplative, enthusiastic nature. When but eighteen years of age, he was so delighted with reading Johnson's \"Rambler,\" that he came to London chiefly with a view to obtain an introduction to the author. Boswell gives us an account of his first interview, which took place in the morning. It is not often that the personal appearance of an author agrees with the preconceived ideas of his admirer. Langton, from perusing the writings of Johnson, expected to find him a decent, well-dressed\u2014in short, a remarkably decorous philosopher. Instead of which, down from his bed-chamber, about noon, came, as newly risen, a large uncoth figure, with a little dark wig which scarcely covered his head, and his clothes hanging loose about him. But his conversation was so rich, so animated, and so forcible, and his religious and political notions so congenial with those in which Langton had been educated, that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which he ever preserved.\n\nLangton went to pursue his studies at Trinity College, Oxford, where Johnson saw much of him during a visit which he paid to the University. He found him in close intimacy with Topham Beauclerc, a youth two years older than\nhimself, very gay and dissipated, and wondered what sympathies could draw two young men together of such opposite characters. On becoming acquainted with Beauclerc, he found that, rake though he was, he possessed an ardent love of literature, an acute understanding, polished wit, innate gentility, and high aristocratic breeding. He was, moreover, the only son of Lord Sidney Beauclerc, and grandson of the Duke of St. Albans, and was thought in some particulars to have a resemblance to Charles the Second. These were high recommendations with Johnson, and when the youth testified a profound respect for him, and an ardent admiration of his talents, the conquest was complete, so that in a \"short time,\" says Boswell, \"the moral, pious Johnson and the gay, dissipated Beauclerc were companions.\"\n\nThe intimacy begun in college chambers, was continued when the youths came to town during the vacations. The unctuous, unwieldy moralist was flattered at finding himself an object of idolatry to two high-born, high-bred, aristocratic young men, and, throwing gravity aside, was ready to join in their vagaries, and play the part of a \"young man upon town.\" Such, at least, is the picture given of him by Boswell on one occasion, when Beauclerc and Langton having supped together at a tavern, determined to give Johnson a rouse at three o'clock in the morning. They accordingly rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple. The indignant sage sallied forth in his shirt, poker in hand, and a little black wig on the top of his head, instead of helmet, prepared to wreak vengeance on the assailants of his castle; but when his two young friends, Lankey and Beau, as he used to call them, presented themselves, summoning him forth to a morning ramble, his whole manner changed. \"What, is it you, ye dogs?\" cried he; \"faith, I'll have a frisk with you!\"\n\nSo said, so done. They sallied forth together into Covent Garden, figured among the greengrocers and fruit-women just come in from the country with their hampers, repaired to a neighbouring tavern, where Johnson brewed a bowl of bishop, a favourite beverage with him, grew merry over his cups, and anathematized sleep in two lines, from Lord Lansdowne's drinking song:\n\n\"Short, very short, be then thy reign,\nFor I'm in haste to laugh and drink again.\"\n\nThey then took boat again, rowed to Billingsgate, and Johnson\nand Beauclerc determined, like \"mad wags,\" to \"keep it up\" for the rest of the day. Langton, however, the most sober-minded of the three, pleaded an engagement to breakfast with some young ladies; whereupon the great moralist reproached him with \"leaving his social friends to go and sit with a set of wretched un-idea'd girls.\n\nThis madcap freak of the great lexicographer made a sensation, as may well be supposed, among his intimates. \"I heard of your frolic t'other night,\" said Garrick to him; \"you'll be in the 'Chronicle.'\" He uttered worse forebodings to others. \"I shall have my old friend to bail out of the round-house,\" said he. Johnson, however, valued himself upon having thus enacted a chapter in the \"Rake's Progress,\" and crowed over Garrick on the occasion. \"He durst not do such a thing!\" chuckled he; \"his wife would not let him!\"\n\nWhen these two young men entered the club, Langton was about twenty-two, and Beauclerc about twenty-four years of age, and both were launched on London life. Langton, however, was still the mild, enthusiastic scholar, steeped to the lips in Greek, with fine conversational powers, and an invaluable talent for listening. He was upwards of six feet high, and very spare. \"Oh, that we could sketch him!\" exclaims Miss Hawkins, in her Memoirs, \"with his mild countenance, his elegant features, and his sweet smile, sitting with one leg twisted round the other, as if fearing to occupy more space than was equitable, his person inclining forward, as if wanting strength to support his weight, and his arms crossed over his bosom, or his hands locked together on his knee.\" Beauclerc, on such occasions, sportively compared him to a stork in Raphael's cartoons, standing on one leg. Beauclerc was more a \"man upon town,\" a lounger in St. James's Street, an associate with George Selwyn, with Walpole, and other aristocratic wits, a man of fashion at court, a casual frequenter of the gaming-table; yet, with all this, he alternated in the easiest and happiest manner the scholar and the man of letters; lounged into the club with the most perfect self-possession, bringing with him the careless grace and polished wit of high-bred society, but making himself cordially at home among his learned fellow members.\n\nThe gay, yet lettered rake maintained his sway over Johnson, who was fascinated by that air of the world, that ineffable tone of good society in which he felt himself deficient.\nespecially as the possessor of it always paid homage to his superior talent. \"Beauchere,\" he would say, using a quotation from Pope, \"has a love of folly, but a scorn of fools; everything he does shows the one, and everything he says, the other.\" Beauchere delighted in rallying the stern moralist, of whom others stood in awe, and no one, according to Boswell, could take equal liberty with him with impunity. Johnson, it is well known, was often shabby and negligent in his dress, and not over cleanly in his person. On receiving a pension from the Crown, his friends vied with each other in respectful congratulations. Beauchere simply scanned his person with a whimsical glance, and hoped that, like Falstaff, \"he'd in future purge, and live cleanly like a gentleman.\" Johnson took the hint with unexpected good humour, and profited by it.\n\nStill, Beauchere's satirical vein, which darted shafts on every side, was not always tolerated by Johnson. \"Sir,\" said he, on one occasion, \"you never open your mouth but with intention to give pain, and you have often given me pain, not from the power of what you have said, but from seeing your intention.\"\n\nWhen it was at first proposed to enrol Goldsmith among the members of this association, there seems to have been some demur, at least, so says the pompous Hawkins. \"As he wrote for the booksellers, we of the club looked on him as a mere literary drudge, equal to the task of compiling and translating, but little capable of original, and still less of poetical composition.\"\n\nEven for some time after his admission, he continued to be regarded in a dubious light by some of the members. Johnson and Reynolds, of course, were well aware of his merits, nor was Burke a stranger to them; but to the others he was as yet a sealed book, and the outside was not prepossessing. His ungainly person and awkward manners were against him with men accustomed to the graces of society, and he was not sufficiently at home to give play to his humour and to that bonhomie which won the hearts of all who knew him. He felt strange and out of place in this new sphere; he felt at times the cool, satirical eye of the courtly Beauchere scanning him, and the more he attempted to appear at his ease, the more awkward he became.\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nJohnson had now become one of Goldsmith's best friends and advisers. He knew all the weak points of his character, but he knew also his merits; and while he would rebuke him like a child, and rail at his errors and follies, he would suffer no one else to undervalue him. Goldsmith knew the soundness of his judgment and his practical benevolence, and often sought his counsel and aid amid the difficulties into which his heedlessness was continually plunging him.\n\n\"I received one morning,\" says Johnson, \"a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion: I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its merit; told the landlady I should soon return; and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill.\"\n\nThe novel in question was the \"Vicar of Wakefield;\" the bookseller to whom Johnson sold it, was Francis Newbery, nephew to John. Strange as it may seem, this captivating work, which has obtained and preserved an almost unrivalled popularity in various languages, was so little appreciated by press; the bookseller, that he kept it by him for nearly two years unpublished!\n\nGoldsmith had, as yet, produced nothing of moment in poetry. Among his literary jobs, it is true, was an Oratorio anecdoted entitled \"The Captivity,\" founded on the bondage of the Israelites in Babylon. It was one of those unhappy offspring calling of the muse ushered into existence amid the distortions of remote music. Most of the Oratorio has passed into oblivion; but the following song from it will never die:\n\"The wretch condemned from life to part,\nStill, still on hope relics,\nAnd every pang that rends the heart\nBids expectation rise.\nHope, like the glimmering taper's light,\nIllumes and cheers our way;\nAnd still, as darker grows the night,\nEmits a brighter ray.\"\n\nGoldsmith distrusted his qualifications to succeed in poetry, and doubted the disposition of the public mind in regard to it. \"I fear,\" said he, \"I have come too late in the world; Pope and other poets have taken up the places in the Temple of Fame; and as few at any period can possess poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire it.\" Again, on another occasion, he observes: \"Of all kinds of ambition, as things are now circumstanced, perhaps that which pursues poetical fame is the wildest. What from the increased refinement of the times, from the diversity of judgment produced by opposing systems of criticism, and from the more prevalent divisions of opinion influenced by party, the strongest and happiest efforts can expect to please but in a very narrow circle.\"\n\nAt this very time, he had by him his poem of \"The Traveller.\" The plan of it, as has already been observed, was conceived many years before, during his travels in Switzerland, and a sketch of it sent from that country to his brother Henry in Ireland. The original outline is said to have embraced a wider scope; but it was probably contracted through diffidence, in the process of finishing the parts. It had lain by him for several years in a crude state, and it was with extreme hesitation, and after much revision, that he at length submitted it to Dr. Johnson. The frank and warm approbation of the latter encouraged him to finish it for the press; and Dr. Johnson himself contributed a few lines towards its conclusion.\n\nWe hear much about \"poetic inspiration,\" and the \"poet's nothing of moment in love in a fine frenzy rolling;\" but Sir Joshua Reynolds gives is true, was an Oratorian anecdote of Goldsmith while engaged upon his poem, calling on the bondage of the soul to cure our notions about the ardour of composition. Those unhappy offspring, falling upon the poet one day, he opened the door without amid the distortions of ceremony, and found him in the double occupation of turning passed into oblivion; but couplet, and teaching a pet dog to sit upon his haunches. One time he would glance his eye at his desk, and at\nanother shake his finger at the dog to make him retain his position. The last lines on the page were still wet; they form a part of the description of Italy:\n\n\"By spots like these are all their cares beguiled,\nThe spots of children satisfy the child.\"\n\nGoldsmith, with his usual good-humour, joined in the laugh caused by his whimsical employment, and acknowledged that his boyish sport with the dog suggested the stanza.\n\nThe poem was published on the 19th of December, 1764, in a quarto form, by Newbery, and was the first of his works to which Goldsmith prefixed his name. As a testimony of cherished, and well-merited affection, he dedicated it to his brother Henry. There is an amusing affectation of indifference as to its fate, expressed in the dedication. \"What reception a poem may find,\" says he, \"which has neither abuse, party, nor blank verse to support it, I cannot tell, nor am I solicitous to know.\" The truth is, no one was more emulous and anxious for poetic fame; and never was he more anxious than in the present instance, for it was his grand stake. Dr. Johnson aided the launching of the poem by a favourable notice in the \"Critical Review;\" other periodical works came out in its favour. Some of the author's friends complained that it did not command instant and wide popularity; that it was a poem to win, not to strike; it went on rapidly increasing in favour; in three months a second edition was issued; shortly afterwards, a third; then a fourth; and before the year was out, the author was pronounced the best poet of his time.\n\nThe appearance of \"The Traveller\" at once altered Goldsmith's intellectual standing in the estimation of society; but its effect upon the club, if we may judge from the account given by Hawkins, was almost ludicrous. They were lost in astonishment that a \"newspaper essayist\" and \"bookseller drudge\" should have written such a poem. On the evening of its announcement to them, Goldsmith had gone away early after \"rattling away as usual,\" and they knew not how to reconcile his heedless garrulity with the serene beauty, the easy grace, the sound good sense, and the occasional elevation of his poetry. They could scarcely believe that such magic numbers had flowed from a man to whom in general, say, Dr. Johnson, \"it was with difficulty they could give a hearing.\" Only \"Well,\" exclaimed Chamier, \"I do believe he wrote it...\"\npoem himself, and let me tell you, that is believing a great deal.\"\n\nAt the next meeting of the club, Chamier sounded the author a little about his poem. \"Mr. Goldsmith,\" said he, \"what do you mean by the last word in the first line of your Traveller, 'remote, unfriended, solitary, slow?' do you mean tardiness of locomotion?\"\u2014\"Yes,\" replied Goldsmith, inconsiderately, being probably flurried at the moment. \"No, sir,\" interposed his protecting friend Johnson, \"you did not mean tardiness of locomotion; you meant that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude.\"\u2014\"Ah!\" exclaimed Goldsmith, \"that was what I meant.\" Chamier immediately believed that Johnson himself had written the line, and a rumour became prevalent that he was the author of many of the finest passages. This was ultimately set at rest by Johnson himself, who marked with a pencil all the verses he had contributed, nine in number, inserted towards the conclusion, and by no means the best in the poem. He moreover, with generous warmth, pronounced it the finest poem that had appeared since the days of Pope.\n\nBut one of the highest testimonials to the charm of the poem, was given by Miss Reynolds, who had toasted poor Goldsmith as the ugliest man of her acquaintance. Shortly after the appearance of \"The Traveller,\" Dr. Johnson read it aloud, from beginning to end, in her presence. \"Well,\" exclaimed she, when he had finished, \"I never more shall think Dr. Goldsmith ugly!\"\n\nOn another occasion, when the merits of \"The Traveller\" were discussed at Reynolds's board, Langton declared \"there was not a bad line in the poem, not one of Dryden's careless verses.\" \"I was glad,\" observed Reynolds, \"to hear Charles Fox say it was one of the finest poems in the English language.\" \"Why was you glad?\" rejoined Langton, \"you surely had no doubt of this before.\" \"No,\" interposed Johnson, decisively; \"the merit of 'The Traveller' is so well established, that Mr. Fox's praise cannot augment it, nor his ensure diminish it.\"\n\nBoswell, who was absent from England at the time of the publication of \"The Traveller,\" was astonished, on his return, to find Goldsmith, whom he had so much undervalued, suddenly elevated almost to a par with his idol. He accounted for it by concluding, that much, both of the sentiments and\nexpression of the poem had been derived from conversations with Johnson. \"He imitates you, sir,\" said this incarnation of toadyism. \"Why no, sir,\" replied Johnson, \"Jack Hawkesworth is one of my imitators, but not Goldsmith. Goldy, sir, has great merit,\" \"But, sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting so high in the public estimation.\" \"Why, sir, he has, perhaps, got sooner to it by his intimacy with me.\"\n\nThe poem went through several editions in the course of the first year, and received some few additions and corrections from the author's pen. It produced a golden harvest to Mr. Newbery, but all the remuneration on record, doled out by his niggard hand to the author, was twenty guineas!\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nGoldsmith, now that he was rising in the world, and becoming a notoriety, felt himself called upon to improve his style of living. He accordingly emerged from Wine-Office Court, and took chambers in the Temple. It is true they were but of humble pretensions, situated on what was then the library staircase, and it would appear that he was a kind of inmate with Jeffs, the butler of the society. Still he was in the Temple, that classic region rendered famous by the Spectator and other essayists, as the abode of gay wits and thoughtful men of letters; and which, with its retired courts and embowered gardens, in the very heart of a noisy metropolis, is, to the quiet-seeking student and author, an oasis freshening with verdure in the midst of a desert. Johnson, who had become a kind of growling supervisor of the poet's affairs, paid him a visit soon after he had installed himself in his new quarters, and went prying about the apartment, in his near-sighted manner, examining everything minutely. Goldsmith was fidgeted by this curious scrutiny, and apprehending a disposition to find fault, exclaimed, with the air of a man who had money in both pockets, \"I shall soon be in better chambers than these.\" The harmless bravado drew a reply from Johnson, which touched the chord of proper pride. \"Nay, sir,\" said he, \"never mind that. Nil te quasiveris extra,\" implying that his reputation rendered him independent of outward show. Happy would it have been for poor Gold-\nsmith, could he have kept this consolatory compliment perpetually in mind, and squared his expenses accordingly.\n\nAmong the persons of rank who were struck with the merits of \"The Traveller,\" was the Earl (afterwards Duke) of Northumberland. He procured several other of Goldsmith's writings, the perusal of which tended to elevate the author in his good opinion, and to gain for him his good will. The earl held the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and understanding Goldsmith was an Irishman, was disposed to extend to him the patronage which his high post afforded. He intimated the same to his relative, Dr. Percy, who, he found, was well acquainted with the poet, and expressed a wish that the latter should wait upon him. Here, then, was another opportunity for Goldsmith to better his fortune, had he been knowing and worldly enough to profit by it. Unluckily, the path to fortune lay through the aristocratical mazes of Northumberland House, and the poet blundered at the outset. The following is the account he used to give of his visit: \"I dressed myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some compliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland House, and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with the duke. They showed me into an antechamber, where, after waiting some time, a gentleman, very elegantly dressed, made his appearance: taking him for the duke, I delivered all the fine things that I had composed in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me: when, to my great astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master, who would see me immediately. At that instant, the duke came into the apartment, and I was so confounded on the occasion, that I wanted words barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke's politeness, and went away exceedingly chagrined at the blunder I had committed.\"\n\nSir John Hawkins, in his \"Life of Dr. Johnson,\" gives some further particulars of this visit, of which he was, in part, a witness. \"Having one day,\" says he, \"a call to make on the late Duke, then Earl, of Northumberland, I found Goldsmith waiting for an audience in an outer room: I asked him what had brought him there; he told me, an invitation from his lordship. I made my business as short as I could, and, as a reason, mentioned that Dr. Goldsmith was waiting without. The earl asked me if I was acquainted with him. I told him...\"\nI was, adding what I thought was most likely to recommend him. I retired, and stayed in the outer room to take him home. Upon his coming out, I asked him the result of his conversation. 'His lordship,' said he, 'told me he had read my poem, meaning \"The Traveller,\" and was much delighted with it; that he was going to be Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and that hearing I was a native of that country, he should be glad to do me any kindness.' 'And what did you answer,' said I, 'to this gracious offer?' 'Why,' said he, 'I could say nothing but that I had a brother there, a clergyman, that stood in need of help: as for myself, I have no great dependence on the promises of great men; I looked to the booksellers for support; they are my best friends, and I am not inclined to forsake them for others.' Thus,\" continues Sir John, \"did this idiot, in the affairs of the world, trifle with his fortunes, and put back the hand that was held out to assist him.\"\n\nWe cannot join with Sir John in his worldly sneer at the conduct of Goldsmith on this occasion. While we admire that honest independence of spirit which prevented him from asking favours for himself, we love that warmth of affection which instantly sought to advance the fortunes of a brother; but the peculiar merits of poor Goldsmith seem to have been little understood by the Hawkinses, the Boswells, and the other biographers of the day.\n\nAfter all, the introduction to Northumberland House did not prove so complete a failure as the humorous account given by Goldsmith, and the cynical account given by Sir John Hawkins, might lead one to suppose. Dr. Percy, the heir male of the ancient Percies, brought the poet into the acquaintance of his kinswoman, the countess, who, before her marriage with the earl, was in her own right heiress of the house of Northumberland. \"She was a lady,\" says Boswell, \"not only of high dignity of spirit, such as became her noble blood, but of excellent understanding and lively talents.\" Under her auspices, a poem of Goldsmith's had an aristocratical introduction to the world. This was the beautiful ballad of \"The Hermit,\" originally published under the name of \"Edwin and Angelina.\" It was suggested by an old English ballad beginning \"Gentle Herdsman,\" shown him by Dr. Percy, who was at that time making his famous collection, entitled \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,\" which he\nsubmitted to the inspection of Goldsmith prior to publication. A few copies only of \"The Hermit\" were printed at first, with the following title-page: \"Edwin and Angelina: a Ballad. By Mr. Goldsmith. Printed for the Amusement of the Countess of Northumberland.\"\n\nAll this, though it may not have been attended with any immediate pecuniary advantage, contributed to give Goldsmith's name and poetry the high stamp of fashion so potent in England. The circle at Northumberland House, however, was of too stately and aristocratical a nature to be much to his taste, and we do not find that he became familiar in it.\n\nHe was much more at home at Gosford, the noble seat of his countryman, Robert Nugent, afterwards Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare, who appreciated his merits even more heartily than the Earl of Northumberland, and occasionally made him his guest both in town and country. Nugent is described as a jovial voluptuary, who left the Roman Catholic for the Protestant religion, with a view to bettering his fortunes; he had an Irishman's inclination for rich widows, and an Irishman's luck with the sex: having been thrice married, and gained a fortune with each wife. He was now nearly sixty, with a remarkably loud voice, broad Irish brogue, and ready, but somewhat coarse wit. With all his occasional coarseness, he was capable of high thought, and had produced poems which showed a truly poetic vein. He was long a member of the House of Commons, where his ready wit, his fearless decision, and good-humoured audacity of expression, always gained him a hearing, though his tall person, and awkward manner gained him the nickname of Squire Gawky among the political scribblers of the day. With a patron of this jovial temperament, Goldsmith probably felt more at ease than with those of higher refinement.\n\nThe celebrity which Goldsmith had acquired by his poem of \"The Traveller,\" occasioned a resuscitation of many of his miscellaneous and anonymous tales and essays, from the various newspapers, and other transient publications in which they lay dormant. These he published in 1765, in a collected form, under the title of \"Essays by Mr. Goldsmith.\" \"The following Essays,\" observes he in his preface, \"have already appeared at different times, and in different publications. The pamphlets in which they were inserted being generally unsuccessful, these shared the common fate, without assisting the book-\nsellers' aims, or extending the author's reputation. The public were too strenuously employed with their own follies to be assiduous in estimating mine, so that many of my best attempts in this way have fallen victims to the transient topic of the time\u2014the Ghost in Cock Lane, or the Siege of Ticonderoga.\n\n\"But, though they have passed pretty silently into the world, I can by no means complain of their circulation. The magazines and papers of the day have indeed been liberal enough in this respect. Most of these Essays have been regularly reprinted twice or thrice a year, and conveyed to the public through the kennel of some engaging compilation. If there be a pride in multiplied editions, I have seen some of my labours sixteen times reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own. I have seen them flourished at the beginning with praise, and signed at the end with the names of Philautos, Philalethes, Phileleutheros, and Philanthropos. It is time, however, at last to vindicate my claims; and as these entertainers of the public, as they call themselves, have partly lived upon me for some years, let me now try if I cannot live a little upon myself.\"\n\nIt was but little, in fact, for all the pecuniary emolument he received from the volume was twenty guineas. It had a good circulation, however, was translated into French, and has maintained its stand among the British classics.\n\nNotwithstanding that the reputation of Goldsmith had greatly risen, his finances were often at a very low ebb, owing to his heedlessness as to expense, his liability to be imposed upon, and a spontaneous and irresistible propensity to give to every one who asked. The very rise in his reputation had increased these embarrassments. It had enlarged his circle of needy acquaintances, authors poorer in pocket than himself, who came in search of literary counsel; which generally meant a guinea and a breakfast. And then his Irish hangers-on! \"Our Doctor,\" said one of these sponges, \"had a constant levee of his distressed countrymen, whose wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has often been known to leave himself without a guinea, in order to supply the necessities of others.\"\n\nThis constant drainage of the purse, therefore, obliged him to undertake all jobs proposed by the booksellers, and to keep up a kind of running account with Mr. Newbery, who was his banker on all occasions, sometimes for pounds, sometimes for\nA MEDICAL CAMPAIGN.\n\nshillings; but who was a rigid accountant, and took care to be amply repaid in manuscript. Many effusions, hastily penned in these moments of exigency, were published anonymously, and never claimed. Some of them have but recently been traced to his pen; while of many the true authorship will probably never be discovered. Among others, it is suggested, and with great probability, that he wrote for Mr. Newbery the famous nursery story of \"Goody Two Shoes,\" which appeared in 1765, at a moment when Goldsmith was scribbling for Newbery, and much pressed for funds. Several quaint little tales introduced in his Essays show that he had a turn for this species of mock history; and the advertisement and title-page bear the stamp of his sly and playful humour:\n\n\"We are desired to give notice, that there is in the press, and speedily will be published, either by subscription or otherwise, as the public shall please to determine, the History of Little Goody Two-Shoes, otherwise Mrs. Margery Two-Shoes; with the means by which she acquired learning and wisdom, and in consequence thereof, her estate; set forth at large for the benefit of those\n\n\"Who, from a state of rags and care,\nAnd having shoes but half a pair,\nTheir fortune and their fame should fix,\nAnd gallop in a coach and six.\"\n\nThe world is probably not aware of the ingenuity, humour, good sense, and sly satire, contained in many of the old English nursery tales. They have evidently been the sportive productions of able writers, who would not trust their names to productions that might be considered beneath their dignity. The ponderous works on which they relied for immortality, have perhaps sunk into oblivion, and carried their names down with them; while their unacknowledged offspring, \"Jack the Giant Killer,\" \"Giles Gingerbread,\" and \"Tom Thumb,\" flourish in wide-spreading and never-ceasing popularity.\n\nAs Goldsmith had now acquired popularity, and an extensive acquaintance, he attempted, with the advice of his friends, to procure a more regular and ample support by resuming the medical profession. He accordingly launched himself upon the town in style; hired a man-servant; replenished his wardrobe at considerable expense, and appeared in a profes-\nsional wig and cane, purple silk small-clothes, and a scarlet roquelaure, buttoned to the chin; a fantastic garb, as we should think at the present day, but not unsuited to the fashion of the times.\n\nWith his sturdy little person thus arrayed in the unusual magnificence of purple and fine linen, and his scarlet roquelaure flaunting from his shoulders, he used to strut into the apartments of his patients, swaying his three-cornered hat in one hand and his medical sceptre, the cane, in the other, and assuming an air of gravity and importance suited to the solemnity of his wig; at least, such is the picture given of him by the waiting-gentlewoman who let him into the chamber of one of his lady patients.\n\nHe soon, however, grew tired and impatient of the duties and restraints of his profession; his practice was chiefly among his friends, and the fees were not sufficient for his maintenance; he was disgusted with attendance on sick chambers and capricious patients, and looked back with longing to his tavern haunts and broad convivial meetings, from which the dignity and duties of his medical calling restrained him. At length, on prescribing to a lady of his acquaintance who, to use a hackneyed phrase, \"rejoiced\" in the aristocratical name of Sidebotham, a warm dispute arose between him and the apothecary as to the quantity of medicine to be administered. The Doctor stood up for the rights and dignities of his profession, and resented the interference of the compounder of drugs. His rights and dignities, however, were disregarded; his wig, and cane, and scarlet roquelaure were of no avail; Mrs. Sidebotham sided with the hero of the pestle and mortar, and Goldsmith flung out of the house in a passion. \"I am determined henceforth,\" said he to Topham Beauclerc, \"to leave off prescribing for friends.\" \"Do so, my dear doctor,\" was the reply; \"whenever you undertake to kill, let it be only your enemies.\"\n\nThis was the end of Goldsmith's medical career.\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nThe success of the poem of \"The Traveller,\" and the popularity which it had conferred on its author, now roused the attention of the bookseller in whose hands the novel of \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" had been slumbering for nearly\ntwo long years. The idea has generally prevailed that it was Mr. John Newberry to whom the manuscript had been sold, and much surprise has been expressed that he should be insensible to its merits, and suffer it to remain unpublished, while putting forth various inferior writings by the same author. This, however, is a mistake; it was his nephew, Francis Newbery, who had become the fortunate purchaser. Still the delay is equally unaccountable. Some have imagined that the uncle and nephew had business arrangements together, in which this work was included, and that the elder Newbery, dubious of its success, retarded the publication until the full harvest of \"The Traveller\" should be reaped. Booksellers are prone to make egregious mistakes as to the merit of works in manuscript, and to undervalue, if not reject, those of classic and enduring excellence when destitute of that false brilliancy commonly called \"effect.\" In the present instance, an intellect vastly superior to that of either of the booksellers was equally at fault. Dr. Johnson, speaking of the work to Boswell, some time subsequent to its publication, observed, \"I myself did not think it would have had much success. It was written and sold to a bookseller before 'The Traveller,' but published after, so little expectation had the bookseller from it. Had it been sold after 'The Traveller' he might have had twice as much money, though sixty guineas was no mean price.\"\n\nSixty guineas for the \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" and this could be pronounced no mean price by Dr. Johnson, at that time the arbiter of British talent, and who had had an opportunity of witnessing the effect of the work upon the public mind, for its success was immediate. It came out on the 27th of March, 1766; before the end of May a second edition was called for; in three months more, a third; and so it went on, widening in a popularity that has never flagged. Rogers, the Nestor of British literature, whose refined purity of taste and exquisite mental organization rendered him eminently calculated to appreciate a work of the kind, declared that of all the books which, through the fitful changes of three generations he had seen rise and fall, the charm of the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" had alone continued as at first, and could he revisit the world after an interval of many more generations, he should as surely look to find it undiminished. Nor has its celebrity been confined to Great Britain. Though so exclu-\nsively a picture of British scenes and manners, it has been translated into almost every language, and everywhere its charm has been the same. Goethe, the great genius of Germany, declared, in his eighty-first year, that it was his delight at the age of twenty, that it had, in a manner, formed a part of his education, influencing his taste and feelings throughout life, and that he had recently read it again from beginning to end\u2014with renewed delight, and with a grateful sense of the early benefit derived from it.\n\nIt is needless to expatiate upon the qualities of a work which has thus passed from country to country, and language to language, until it is now known throughout the whole reading world, and is become a household book in every hand. The secret of its universal and enduring popularity is undoubtedly its truth to nature, but to nature of the most amiable kind\u2014to nature such as Goldsmith saw it. The author, as we have occasionally shown in the course of this memoir, took his scenes and characters in this, as in his other writings, from originals in his own motley experience; but he has given them as seen through the medium of his own indulgent eye, and has set them forth with the colourings of his own good head and heart. Yet how contradictory it seems that this, one of the most delightful pictures of home and home-felt happiness, should be drawn by a homeless man; that the most amiable picture of domestic virtue, and all the endearments of the married state, should be drawn by a bachelor, who had been severed from domestic life almost from boyhood; that one of the most tender, touching, and affecting appeals on behalf of female loveliness should have been made by a man whose deficiency in all the graces of person and manner seemed to mark him out for a cynical disparager of the sex.\n\nWe cannot refrain from transcribing from the work a short passage illustrative of what we have said, and which, within a wonderfully small compass, comprises a world of beauty of imagery, tenderness of feeling, delicacy and refinement of thought, and matchless purity of style. The two stanzas which conclude it, in which is told a whole history of woman's wrongs and sufferings, are, for pathos, simplicity, and euphony, a gem in the language. The scene depicted is where the poor vicar is gathering around him the wrecks of his shattered family, and endeavouring to rally them back to happiness.\n\"The next morning, the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season, so that we agreed to breakfast together on the honeysuckle bank, where, while we sat, my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her voice to the concert on the trees about us. It was in this place my poor Olivia first met her seducer, and every object served to recall her sadness. But that melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure, or inspired by sounds of harmony, soothes the heart instead of corroding it. Her mother, too, upon this occasion, felt a pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her daughter as before. 'Do, my pretty Olivia,' cried she, 'let us have that melancholy air your father was so fond of; your sister Sophy has already obliged us. Do, child, it will please your old father.' She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me.\n\n\"When lovely woman stoops to folly,\nAnd finds too late that men betray,\nWhat charm can soothe her melancholy,\nWhat art can wash her guilt away.\nThe only art her guilt to cover,\nTo hide her shame from every eye,\nTo give repentance to her lover,\nAnd wring his bosom\u2014is to die.\"\n\nScarce had the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" made its appearance, and been received with acclamation, than its author was subjected to one of the usual penalties that attend success. He was attacked in the newspapers. In one of the chapters he had introduced his ballad of \"The Hermit,\" of which, as we have mentioned, a few copies had been printed some considerable time previously, for the use of the Countess of Northumberland. This brought forth the following article in a fashionable journal of the day.\n\n\"To the Printer of the St. James's Chronicle.\n\n\"Sir,\u2014In the 'Reliques of Ancient Poetry,' published about two years ago, is a very beautiful little ballad, called 'A Friar of Orders Gray.' The ingenious editor, Mr. Percy, supposes that the stanzas sung by Ophelia in the play of Hamlet were parts of some ballad well known in Shakespeare's time, and from these stanzas, with the addition of one or two of his own to connect them, he has formed the above-mentioned ballad; the subject of which is, a lady comes to a convent to inquire for her lover, who has been driven there by her disdain. She is answered by a friar that he is dead:\n\n'No, no, he is dead, gone to his death's bed.\nHe never will come again.'\"\nThe lady weeps, and laments her cruelty; the friar endeavours to comfort her with morality and religion, but all in vain; she expresses the deepest grief, and the most tender sentiments of love, till at last the friar discovers himself:\n\n'And lo! beneath this gown of grey,\nThy own true love appears.'\n\n\"This catastrophe is very fine, and the whole joined with the greatest tenderness, has the greatest simplicity; yet, though this ballad was so recently published in the 'Ancient Reliques,' Dr. Goldsmith has been hardy enough to publish a poem called 'The Hermit,' where the circumstances and catastrophe are exactly the same, only with this difference, that the natural simplicity and tenderness of the original are almost entirely lost in the languid smoothness and tedious paraphrase of the copy, which is as short of the merits of Mr. Percy's ballad as the insipidity of negus is to the genuine flavour of champagne.\n\n\"I am, sir, yours, &c.\n\n\"Detector.\"\n\nThis attack, supposed to be by Goldsmith's constant persecutor, the malignant Kenrick, drew from him the following note to the editor:\n\n\"SIR,\u2014As there is nothing I dislike so much as newspaper controversy, particularly upon trifles, permit me to be as concise as possible in informing a correspondent of yours that I recommended 'Blainville's Travels' because I thought the book was a good one; and I think so still. I said I was told by the bookseller that it was then first published; but in that it seems I was misinformed, and my reading was not extensive enough to set me right.\n\n\"Another correspondent of yours accuses me of having taken a ballad I published some time ago, from one by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great resemblance between the two pieces in question. If there be any, his ballad was taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy some years ago; and he, as we both considered these things as trifles at best, told me, with his usual good-humour, the next time I saw him, that he had taken my plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare into a ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may so call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty anecdotes as these are scarcely worth printing; and, were it not for the busy disposition of some of your correspondents, the public should never have known that he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friendship and learning for communications of a much more important nature.\n\n\"I am sir, yours, &c.,\n\n\"Oliver Goldsmith.\"\n\nThe unexpected circulation of the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" enriched the publisher, but not the author. Goldsmith no doubt thought himself entitled to participate in the profits of\nthe repeated editions; and a memorandum, still extant, shows that he drew upon Mr. Francis Newbery, in the month of June, for fifteen guineas, but that the bill was returned dishonoured. He continued, therefore, his usual job-work for the booksellers, writing introductions, prefaces, and head and tail pieces for new works! revising, touching up, and modifying travels and voyages; making compilations of prose and poetry, and \"building books,\" as he sportively termed it. These tasks required little labour or talent, but that taste and touch which are the magic of gifted minds. His terms began to be proportioned to his celebrity. If his price was at any time objected to, \"Why, sir,\" he would say, \"it may seem large: but then a man may be many years working in obscurity before his taste and reputation are fixed or estimated; and then he is, as in other professions, only paid for his previous labours.\"\n\nHe was however, prepared to try his fortune in a different walk of literature from any he had yet attempted. We have repeatedly adverted to his fondness for the drama; he was a frequent attendant at the theatres; though, as we have shown, he considered them under gross mismanagement. He thought, too, that a vicious taste prevailed among those who wrote for the stage.\n\n\"A new species of dramatic composition,\" says he, in one of his essays, \"has been introduced under the name of sentimental comedy, in which the virtues of private life are exhibited rather than the vices exposed; and the distresses rather than the faults of mankind make our interest in the piece. In these plays, almost all the characters are good and exceedingly generous; they are lavish enough of their tin money on the stage; and though they want humour, have abundance of sentiment and feeling. If they happen to have faults or foibles, the spectator is taught not only to pardon, but to applaud them, in consideration of the goodness of their hearts, so that folly, instead of being ridiculed, is commended, and the comedy aims at touching our passions, without the power of being truly pathetic. In this manner we are likely to lose one great source of entertainment on the stage; for while the comic poet is invading the province of the tragic muse, he leaves her lively sister quite neglected. Of this, however, he is no ways solicitous, as he measures his fame by his profits.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Humour, at present, seems to be departing from the stage; and it will soon happen that our comic players will have nothing left for it but a fine coat and a song. It depends upon the audience whether they will actually drive those poor merry creatures from the stage, or sit at a play as gloomy as at the tabernacle. It is not easy to recover an art...\"\nwhen once lost; and it will be a just punishment, that when, by our being too fastidious, we have banished humour from the stage, we should ourselves be deprived of the art of laughing.\"\n\nSymptoms of reform in the drama had recently taken place. The comedy of the \"Clandestine Marriage,\" the joint production of Colman and Garrick, and suggested by Hogarth's inimitable pictures of \"Marriage-\u00e0-la-mode,\" had taken the town by storm, crowded the theatre with fashionable audiences, and formed one of the leading literary topics of the year. Goldsmith's emulation was roused by its success. The comedy was in what he considered the legitimate line, totally different from the sentimental school; it presented pictures of real life, delineations of character, and touches of humour, in which he felt himself calculated to excel. The consequence was, that in the course of this year (1766), he commenced a comedy of the same class, to be entitled the \"Good-natured Man,\" at which he diligently wrought whenever the hurried occupation of \"book-building\" allowed him leisure.\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nThe social position of Goldsmith had undergone a material change since the publication of \"The Traveller.\" Before that event, he was but partially known as the author of some clever anonymous writings, and had been a tolerated member of the club and the Johnson circle, without much being expected from him. Now he had suddenly risen to literary fame, and become one of the lions of the day. The highest regions of intellectual society were now open to him; but he was not prepared to move in them with confidence and success. Balymahon had not been a good school of manners at the outset of life; nor had his experience as a \"poor student\" at colleges and medical schools contributed to give him the polish of society. He had brought from Ireland, as he said, nothing but his \"brogue and his blunders,\" and they had never left him. He had travelled, it is true; but the Continental tour, which in those days gave the finishing grace to the education of a patrician youth, had, with poor Goldsmith, been little better than a course of literary vagabondizing. It had enlarged his mind, deepened and widened the benevolence of his heart, and filled his memory with enchanting pictures, but his J...\nit had contributed little to disciplining him for the polite intercourse of the world. His life in London had hitherto been a struggle with sordid cares and sad humiliations. \"You scarcely can conceive,\" wrote he some time previously to his brother, \"how much eight years of disappointment, anguish, and study, have worn me down.\" Several more years had since been added to the term during which he had trod the lowly walks of life. He had been a tutor, an apothecary's drudge, a petty physician of the suburbs, a bookseller's hack, drudging for daily bread. Each separate walk had been beset by its peculiar thorns and humiliations. It is wonderful how his heart retained its gentleness and kindness through all these trials; how his mind rose above the \"meannesses of poverty,\" to which, as he says, he was compelled to submit; but it would be still more wonderful, had his manners acquired a tone corresponding to the innate grace and refinement of his intellect. He was near forty years of age when he published \"The Traveller,\" and was lifted by it into celebrity. As is beautifully said of him by one of his biographers, \"he has fought his way to consideration and esteem; but he bears upon him the scars of his twelve years' conflict; of the mean sorrows through which he has passed; and of the cheap indulgences he has sought relief and help from. There is nothing plastic in his nature now. His manners and habits are completely formed; and in them any further success can make little favourable change, whatever it may effect for his mind or genius.\"\n\nWe are not to be surprised, therefore, at finding him make an awkward figure in the elegant drawing-rooms which were now open to him, and disappointing those who had formed an idea of him from the fascinating ease and gracefulness of his poetry.\n\nEven the Literary Club, and the circle of which it formed a part, after their surprise at the intellectual flights of which he showed himself capable, fell into a conventional mode of judging and talking of him, and of placing him in absurd and whimsical points of view. His very celebrity operated here to his disadvantage. It brought him into continual comparison with Johnson, who was the oracle of that circle, and had given it a tone. Conversation was the great staple there, and of this Johnson was a master. He had been a reader and thinker.\n\n* Foster's Goldsmith.\nfrom childhood: his melancholy temperament, which unfitted him for the pleasures of youth, had made him so. For many years past, the vast variety of works he had been obliged to consult in preparing his Dictionary, had stored an uncommonly retentive memory with facts on all kinds of subjects; making it a perfect colloquial armory. \"He had all his life,\" says Boswell, \"habituated himself to consider conversation as a trial of intellectual vigour and skill. He had disciplined himself as a talker as well as a writer, making it a rule to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible language he could put it in, so that by constant practice and never suffering any careless expression to escape him, he had attained an extraordinary accuracy and command of language.\"\n\nHis common conversation in all companies, according to Sir Joshua Reynolds, was such as to secure him universal attention, something above the usual colloquial style being always expected from him.\n\n\"I do not care,\" said Orme, the historian of Hindostan, \"on what subject Johnson talks; but I love better to hear him talk than anybody. He either gives you new thoughts, or a new colouring.\"\n\nA stronger and more graphic eulogium is given by Dr. Percy:\u2014\"The conversation of Johnson,\" says he, \"is strong and clear, and may be compared to an antique statue, where every vein and muscle is distinct and clear.\"\n\nSuch was the colloquial giant with which Goldsmith's celebrity, and his habits of intimacy, brought him into continual comparison; can we wonder that he should appear to disadvantage? Conversation grave, discursive, and disputatious, such as Johnson excelled at, delighted in, was to him a severe task, and he never was good at a task of any kind. He had not, like Johnson, a vast fund of acquired facts to draw upon; nor a retentive memory to furnish them forth when wanted. He could not, like the great lexicographer, mould his ideas, and balance his periods while talking. He had a flow of ideas, but it was apt to be hurried and confused, and, as he said of himself, he had contracted a hesitating and disagreeable manner of speaking. He used to say that he always argued best when he argued alone; that is to say, he could master a subject in his study, with his pen in his hand; but when he came into company he grew confused, and was unable to talk about it. Johnson made a remark concerning\nhim to somewhat of the same purport. \"No man,\" said he, \"is more foolish than Goldsmith, when he has not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he has.\" Yet, with all this conscious deficiency, he was continually getting involved in colloquial contests with Johnson and other prime talkers of the literary circle. He felt that he had become a notoriety; that he had entered the lists and was expected to make fight; so, with that heedlessness which characterized him in everything else, he dashed on at a venture; trusting to chance in this as in other things, and hoping occasionally to make a lucky hit. Johnson perceived his hap-hazard temerity, but gave him no credit for the real diffidence which lay at bottom. \"The misfortune of Goldsmith in conversation,\" said he, \"is this, he goes on without knowing how he is to get off. His genius is great, but his knowledge is small. As they say of a generous man, it is a pity he is not rich, we may say of Goldsmith, it is a pity he is not knowing. He would not keep his knowledge to himself.\" And, on another occasion, he observes: \"Goldsmith, rather than not talk, will talk of what he knows himself to be ignorant, which can only end in exposing him. If in company with two founders, he would fall a talking on the method of making cannon, though both of them would soon see that he did not know what metal a cannon is made of.\" And again: \"Goldsmith should not be for ever attempting to shine in conversation; he has not temper for it, he is so much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes is composed partly of skill, partly of chance; a man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Goldsmith, putting himself against another, is like a man laying a hundred to one, who cannot spare the hundred. It is not worth a man's while. A man should not lay a hundred to one unless he can easily spare it, though he has a hundred chances for him; he can get but a guinea, and he may lose a hundred. Goldsmith is in this state. When he contends, if he gets the better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation; if he does not get the better, he is miserably vexed.\"\n\nJohnson was not aware how much he was himself to blame in producing this vexation. \"Goldsmith,\" said Miss Reynolds, \"always appeared to be overawed by Johnson, particularly when in company with people of any consequence; always as if impressed with fear of disgrace; and indeed well\nhe might. I have been witness to many mortifications he has suffered in Dr. Johnson's company.\"\n\nIt may not have been disgrace that he feared, but rudeness. The great lexicographer, spoiled by the homage of society, was still more prone than himself to lose temper, when the argument went against him. He could not brook appearing to be worsted, but would attempt to bear down his adversary by the rolling thunder of his periods; and when that failed, would become downright insulting. Boswell called it \"having recourse to some sudden mode of robust sophistry;\" but Goldsmith designated it much more happily. \"There is no arguing with Johnson,\" said he, \"for, when his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it.\"*\n\nIn several of the intellectual collisions recorded by Boswell as triumphs of Dr. Johnson, it really appears to us that Goldsmith had the best, both of the wit and the argument, and especially of the courtesy and good nature.\n\nOn one occasion he certainly gave Johnson a capital reproof as to his own colloquial peculiarities. Talking of fables, Goldsmith observed that the animals introduced in them seldom talked in character. \"For instance,\" said he, \"the fable of the little fishes who saw birds fly over their heads, and, envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds. The skill consists in making them talk like little fishes.\" Just then, observing that Dr. Johnson was shaking his sides and laughing, he immediately added, \"Why Dr. Johnson, this is not so easy as you seem to think; for if you were to make little fishes talk, they would talk like whales.\"\n\nBut though Goldsmith suffered frequent mortifications in society, from the overbearing, and sometimes harsh conduct of Johnson, he always did justice to his benevolence. When royal pensions were granted to Dr. Johnson and Dr. Shebbeare, a punster remarked that the king had pensioned a she-bear and a he-bear; to which Goldsmith replied, \"Johnson, to be sure, has a roughness in his manner, but no man alive has a more tender heart. He has nothing of the bear but the skin.\"\n\nGoldsmith, in conversation, shone most when he least\n\n* The following is given by Boswell, as an instance of robust sophistry:\u2014\"Once, when I was pressing upon him with visible advantage, he stopped me thus:\u2014'My dear Boswell, let's have no more of this; you'll make nothing of it. I'd rather hear you whistle a Scotch tune.'\"\nthought of shining, when he gave up all effort to appear wise and learned, or to cope with the oracular sententiousness of Johnson, and gave way to his natural impulses. Even Boswell could perceive his merits on these occasions. \"For my part,\" said he, condescendingly, \"I like very well to hear honest Goldsmith talk away carelessly;\" and many a much wiser man than Boswell delighted in these outpourings of a fertile fancy, and a generous heart. In his happy moods, Goldsmith had an artless simplicity and buoyant good-humour that led to a thousand amusing blunders and whimsical confessions, much to the entertainment of his intimates; yet, in his most thoughtless garrulity, there was occasionally the gleam of the gold and the flash of the diamond.\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nThough Goldsmith's pride and ambition led him to mingle occasionally with high society, and to engage in the colloquial conflicts of the learned circle, in both of which he was ill at ease, and conscious of being undervalued, yet he had some social resorts in which he indemnified himself for their restraints by indulging his humour without control. One of them was a shilling whist club, which held its meetings at the Devil Tavern, near Temple Bar, a place rendered classic, we are told, by a club held there in old times, to which \"Rare Ben Jonson\" had furnished the rules. The company was of a familiar, unceremonious kind, delighting in that very questionable wit which consists in playing off practical jokes upon each other. Of one of these, Goldsmith was made the butt. Coming to the club one night in a hackney coach, he gave the coachman, by mistake, a guinea instead of a shilling, which he set down as a dead loss, for there was no likelihood, he said, that a fellow of this class would have the honesty to return the money. On the next club evening, he was told a person at the street door wished to speak with him. He went forth, but soon returned with a radiant countenance. To his surprise and delight, the coachman had actually brought back the guinea. While he launched forth in praise of this unlooked-for piece of honesty, he declared it ought not to go unrewarded. Collecting a small sum from the club, and, no doubt, increasing it largely from his own purse, he dismissed the Jehu with many encomiums on his good conduct.\nwas still chanting his praises, when one of the club requested a sight of the guinea thus honestly returned. To Goldsmith's confusion, it proved to be a counterfeit. The universal burst of laughter which succeeded, and the jokes by which he was assailed on every side, showed him that the whole was a hoax, and the pretended coachman as much a counterfeit as the guinea. He was so disconcerted, it is said, that he soon beat a retreat for the evening.\n\nAnother of those free-and-easy clubs met on Wednesday evenings at the Globe Tavern in Fleet Street. It was somewhat in the style of the Three Jolly Pigeons; songs, jokes, dramatic imitations, burlesque parodies, and broad sallies of humour, formed a contrast to the sententious morality, pedantic casuistry, and polished sarcasm of the learned circle. Here a huge \"tun of man,\" by the name of Gordon, used to delight Goldsmith by singing the jovial song of \"Nottingham Ale,\" and looking like a butt of it. Here, too, a wealthy pig butcher, charmed, no doubt, by the mild philanthropy of \"The Traveller,\" aspired to be on the most sociable footing with the author; and here was Tom King, the comedian, recently risen to consequence by his performance of Lord Ogleby, in the new comedy of \"The Clandestine Marriage.\"\n\nA member of more note was one Hugh Kelly, a second-rate author, who, as he became a kind of competitor of Goldsmith's, deserves particular mention. He was an Irishman, about twenty-eight years of age, originally apprenticed to a stay maker in Dublin, then writer to a London attorney, then a Grub Street hack, scribbling for magazines and newspapers. Of late, he had set up for theatrical censor and satirist, and, in a paper called \"Thespis,\" in emulation of Churchill's \"Rosciad,\" had harrassed many of the poor actors without mercy, and often without wit, but had lavished his incense on Garrick, who, in consequence, took him into favour. He was the author of several works of superficial merit, but which had sufficient vogue to inflate his vanity. This, however, must have been mortified on his first introduction to Johnson; after sitting a short time he got up to take leave, expressing a fear that a longer visit might be troublesome: \"Not in the least, sir,\" said the surly moralist, \"I had forgotten you were in the room.\" Johnson used to speak of him as a man who had written more than he had read.\n\nA prime wag of this club was one of Goldsmith's poor\ncountrymen and hangers-on, by the name of Glover. He had originally been educated for the medical profession, but had taken in early life to the stage, though apparently without much success. While performing at Cork, he undertook, partly in jest, to restore life to the body of a malefactor who had just been executed. To the astonishment of every one, himself among the number, he succeeded. The miracle took wind. He abandoned the stage, resumed his wig and cane, and considered his fortune as secure. Unluckily, there were not many dead people to be restored to life in Ireland; his practice did not equal his expectation, so he came to London, where he continued to dabble indifferently, and rather unprofitably, in physic and literature.\n\nHe was a great frequenter of the Globe and Devil taverns, where he used to amuse the company by his talent at storytelling and his powers of mimicry, giving capital imitations of Garrick, Foote, Coleman, Sterne, and other public characters of the day. He seldom happened to have money enough to pay his reckoning, but was always sure to find some ready purse, among those who had been amused by his humours. Goldsmith, of course, was one of the readiest. It was through him that Glover was admitted to the Wednesday Club, of which his theatrical imitations became the delight. Glover, however, was a little anxious for the dignity of his patron, which appeared to him to suffer from the over-familiarity of some of the members of the club. He was especially shocked by the free and easy tone in which Goldsmith was addressed by the pig-butcher, \"Come, Noll,\" would he say, as he pledged him, \"here's my service to you, old boy!\"\n\nGlover whispered to Goldsmith, that he \"should not allow such liberties.\" \"Let him alone,\" was the reply, \"you'll see how civilly I'll let him down.\" After a time, he called out, with marked ceremony and politeness, \"Mr. B., I have the honour of drinking your good health.\" Alas! dignity was not poor Goldsmith's forte: he could keep no one at a distance. \"Thank'ee, thank'ee, Noll,\" nodded the pig-butcher, scarcely taking the pipe out of his mouth. \"I don't see the effect of your reproof,\" whispered Glover. \"I give it up,\" replied Goldsmith, with a good-humoured shrug, \"I ought to have known before now there is no putting a pig in the right way.\"\n\nJohnson used to be severe upon Goldsmith for mingling in\nthese motley circles, observing, that having been originally poor, he had contracted a love for low company. Goldsmith, however, was guided, not by a taste for what was low, but for what was comic and characteristic. It was the feeling of the artist; the feeling which furnished out some of his best scenes in familiar life; the feeling with which \"Rare Ben Jonson\" sought these very haunts and circles in days of yore, to study \"Every Man in his Humour.\"\n\nIt was not always, however, that the humour of these associates was to his taste: as they became boisterous in their merriment, he was apt to become depressed. \"The company of fools,\" says he, in one of his essays, \"may at first make us smile; but at last never fails of making us melancholy.\" \"Often he would become moody,\" says Glover, \"and would leave the party abruptly, to go home and brood over his misfortune.\"\n\nIt is possible, however, that he went home for quite a different purpose; to commit to paper some scene or passage suggested for his comedy of \"The Good-natured Man.\" The elaboration of humour is often a most serious task; and we have never witnessed a more perfect picture of mental misery than was once presented to us by a popular dramatic writer\u2014still, we hope, living\u2014whom we found in the agonies of producing a farce, which subsequently set the theatres in a roar.\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nThe comedy of \"The Good-natured Man\" was completed by Goldsmith early in 1767, and submitted to the perusal of Johnson, Burke, Reynolds, and others of the Literary Club, by whom it was heartily approved. Johnson, who was seldom half way, either in censure or applause, pronounced it the best comedy that had been written since \"The Provoked Husband,\" and promised to furnish the prologue. This immediately became an object of great solicitude with Goldsmith, knowing the weight an introduction from the Great Cham of literature would have with the public; but circumstances occurred which he feared might drive the comedy and the prologue from Johnson's thoughts. The latter was in the habit of visiting the royal library at the Queen's (Buckingham) House, a noble collection of books, in the formation\nof which he had assisted the librarian, Mr. Bernard, with his advice. One evening, as he was seated there by the fire reading, he was surprised by the entrance of the King (George III.), then a young man, who sought this occasion to have a conversation with him. The conversation was varied and discursive; the King shifting from subject to subject according to his wont; \"during the whole interview,\" says Boswell, \"Johnson talked to his majesty with profound respect, but still in his open, manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the lev\u00e9e and in the drawing-room. 'I found his majesty wished I should talk,' said he, 'and I made it my business to talk. I find it does a man good to be talked to by his sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a passion.'\" It would have been as well for Johnson's colloquial disputants, could he have often been under such decorous restraint. Profoundly monarchical in his principles, he retired from the interview highly gratified with the conversation of the King, and with his gracious behaviour. \"Sir,\" said he to the librarian, \"they may talk of the King as they will, but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.\" \"Sir,\" said he subsequently to Bennet Langton, \"his manners are those of as fine a gentleman, as we may suppose Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's face was still radiant with the reflex of royalty, he was holding forth one day to a listening group at Sir Joshua Reynolds's, who were anxious to hear every particular of this memorable conversation. Among other questions, the King had asked him whether he was writing anything. His reply was, that he thought he had already done his part as a writer. \"I should have thought so too,\" said the King, \"if you had not written so well.\"\u2014\"No man,\" said Johnson, commenting on this speech, \"could have made a handsomer compliment; and it was fit for a king to pay. It was decisive.\" \"But did you make no reply to this high compliment?\" asked one of the company. \"No, sir,\" replied the profoundly deferential Johnson, \"when the King had said it, it was to be so. It was not for me to bandy civilites with my sovereign.\"\n\nDuring all the time that Johnson was thus holding forth, Goldsmith, who was present, appeared to take no interest in the royal theme, but remained seated on a sofa at a distance.\nin a moody fit of abstraction; at length, recollecting himself, he sprang up, and advancing, exclaimed, with what Boswell calls his usual \"frankness and simplicity,\" \"Well, you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done, for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it.\" He afterwards explained his seeming inattention, by saying that his mind was completely occupied about his play, and by fears lest Johnson, in his present state of royal excitement, would fail to furnish the much-desired prologue.\n\nHow natural and truthful is this explanation. Yet Boswell presumes to pronounce Goldsmith's inattention affected; and attributes it to jealousy. \"It was strongly suspected,\" says he, \"that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honour Dr. Johnson had lately enjoyed.\" It needed the littleness of mind of Boswell to ascribe such pitiful motives to Goldsmith, and to entertain such exaggerated notions of the honour paid to Dr. Johnson.\n\n\"The Good-natured Man\" was now ready for performance, but the question was, how to get it on the stage. The affairs of Covent Garden, for which it had been intended, were thrown into confusion by the recent death of Rich, the manager. Drury Lane was under the management of Garrick, but a feud, it will be recollected, existed between him and the poet, from the animadversions of the latter on the mismanagement of theatrical affairs, and the refusal of the former to give the poet his vote for the secretaryship of the Society of Arts. Times, however, were changed. Goldsmith, when that feud took place, was an anonymous writer, almost unknown to fame, and of no circulation in society. Now he had become a literary lion; he was a member of the Literary Club; he was the associate of Johnson, Burke, Topham Beauclerc, and other magnates,\u2014in a word, he had risen to consequence in the public eye, and of course was of consequence in the eyes of David Garrick. Sir Joshua Reynolds saw the lurking scruples of pride existing between the author and actor, and thinking it a pity that two men of such congenial talents, and who might be so serviceable to each other, should be kept asunder by a worn-out pique, exerted his friendly offices to bring them together. The meeting took place in Reynolds's house in Leicester Square. Garrick, however, could not entirely put off the mock majesty of the stage; he\nmeant to be civil, but he was rather too gracious and condescending. Tom Davies, in his \"Life of Garrick,\" gives an amusing picture of the coming together of these punctilious parties. \"The manager,\" says he, \"was fully conscious of his (Goldsmith's) merit, and perhaps more ostentatious of his abilities to serve a dramatic author, than became a man of his prudence; Goldsmith was, on his side, as fully persuaded of his own importance and independent greatness. Mr. Garrick, who had so long been treated with the complimentary language paid to a successful patentee and admired actor, expected that the writer would esteem the patronage of his play a favour; Goldsmith rejected all ideas of kindness in a bargain that was intended to be of mutual advantage to both parties, and in this he was certainly justifiable; Mr. Garrick could reasonably expect no thanks for the acting a new play, which he would have rejected if he had not been convinced it would have amply rewarded his pains and expense. I believe the manager was willing to accept the play, but he wished to be courted to it; and the doctor was not disposed to purchase his friendship by the resignation of his sincerity.\" They separated, however, with an understanding on the part of Goldsmith, that his play would be acted. The conduct of Garrick subsequently proved evasive, not through any lingerings of past hostility, but from habitual indecision in matters of the kind, and from real scruples and delicacy. He did not think the piece likely to succeed on the stage, and avowed that opinion to Reynolds and Johnson; but hesitated to say as much to Goldsmith, through fear of wounding his feelings. A further misunderstanding was the result of this want of decision and frankness; repeated interviews and some correspondence took place without bringing matters to a point, and in the meantime the theatrical season passed away.\n\nGoldsmith's pocket, never well supplied, suffered grievously by this delay, and he considered himself entitled to call upon the manager, who still talked of acting the play, to advance him forty pounds upon a note of the younger Newbery. Garrick readily complied, but subsequently suggested certain important alterations in the comedy as indispensable to its success; these were indignantly rejected by the author, but pertinaciously insisted on by the manager. Garrick proposed to leave the matter to the arbitration of Whitehead, the Laureate, who officiated as his \"reader\" and elbow critic.\nGoldsmith was more indignant than ever, and a violent dispute ensued, which was only calmed by the interference of Burke and Reynolds.\n\nJust at this time, order came out of confusion in the affairs of Covent Garden. A pique having risen between Colman and Garrick, in the course of their joint authorship of \"The Clandestine Marriage,\" the former had become manager and part proprietor of Covent Garden, and was preparing to open a powerful competition with his former colleague. On hearing of this, Goldsmith made overtures to Colman, who, without waiting to consult his fellow proprietors, who were absent, gave instantly a favourable reply. Goldsmith felt the contrast of this warm, encouraging conduct, to the chilling delays and objections of Garrick. He at once abandoned his piece to the discretion of Colman. \"Dear sir,\" says he, in a letter dated Temple Garden Court, July 9th, \"I am very much obliged to you for your kind partiality in my favour, and your tenderness in shortening the interval of my expectation. That the play is liable to many objections I well know, but I am happy that it is in hands the most capable in the world of removing them. If then, dear sir, you will complete your favour by putting the piece into such a state as it may be acted, or of directing me how to do it, I shall ever retain a sense of your goodness to me. And indeed, though most probably this be the last I shall ever write, yet I can't help feeling a secret satisfaction that poets for the future are likely to have a protector, who declines taking advantage of their dreadful situation, and scorns that importance which may be acquired by trifling with their anxieties.\"\n\nThe next day Goldsmith wrote to Garrick, who was at Lichfield, informing him of his having transferred his piece to Covent Garden, for which it had been originally written, and by the patentee of which it was claimed, observing,\n\n\"As I found you had very great difficulties about that piece, I complied with his desire.\n\nI am extremely sorry that you should think me warm at our last meeting; your judgment certainly ought to be free, especially in a matter which must, in some measure, concern your own credit and interest. I assure you, sir, I have no disposition to differ with you on this or any other account, but am, with an high opinion of your abilities, and a very real esteem, sir, your most obedient humble servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\nIn his reply, Garrick observed,\n\n\"I was, indeed, much hurt that your warmth at our last meeting mistook my sincere and friendly attention to your play, for the remains of a former misunderstanding, which I had as much forgot as if it had never existed. What I said to you at my own house, I now repeat, that I felt more pain in giving my sentiments than you possibly would in receiving them. It has been the business, and ever will be, of my life to live on the best terms with men of genius; and I know that Dr. Goldsmith will have no reason to change his previous friendly disposition towards me, as I shall be glad of every future opportunity to convince him how much I am his obedient servant and well-wisher. D. Garrick.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nThough Goldsmith's comedy was now in train to be performed, it could not be brought out before Christmas; in the meantime, he must live. Again, therefore, he had to resort to literary jobs for his daily support. These obtained for him petty occasional sums, the largest of which was ten pounds, from the elder Newbery, for an historical compilation; but this scanty rill of quasi patronage, so sterile in its products, was likely soon to cease; Newbery being too ill to attend to business, and having to transfer the whole management of it to his nephew.\n\nAt this time Tom Davies, the sometime Roscius, sometime bibliopole, stepped forward to Goldsmith's relief, and proposed that he should undertake an easy popular history of Rome in two volumes. An arrangement was soon made. Goldsmith undertook to complete it in two years, if possible, for two hundred and fifty guineas, and forthwith set about his task with cheerful alacrity. As usual, he sought a rural retreat during the summer months, where he might alternate his literary labours with strolls about the green fields, \"Merry Islington\" was again his resort, but he now aspired to better quarters than formerly, and engaged the chambers occupied occasionally by Mr. Newbery, in Canonbury House, or Castle, as it is popularly called. This had been a hunting lodge of Queen Elizabeth, in whose time it was surrounded by parks and forests. In Goldsmith's day, nothing remained of it but an old brick tower; it was still in the country, amid rural scenery, and was a favourite nestling-place of authors, pub-\nlishers, and others of the literary order.* A number of these he had for fellow occupants of the castle, and they formed a temporary club, which held its meetings at the Crown Tavern, on the Islington lower road; and here he presided in his own genial style, and was the life and delight of the company.\n\nThe writer of these pages visited old Canonbury Castle some years since, out of regard to the memory of Goldsmith. The apartment was still shown which the poet had inhabited, consisting of a sitting-room and small bed-room, with paneled wainscots and Gothic windows. The quaintness and quietude of the place were still attractive. It was one of the resorts of citizens on their Sunday walks, who would ascend to the top of the tower and amuse themselves with reconnoitring the city through a telescope. Not far from this tower were the gardens of the White Conduit House, a Cockney Elysium, where Goldsmith used to figure in the humbler days of his fortune. In the first edition of his Essays he speaks of a stroll in these gardens, where he at that time, no doubt, thought himself in perfectly genteel society. After his rise in the world, however, he became too knowing to speak of such plebeian haunts. In a new edition of his Essays, therefore, the White Conduit House and its garden disappears, and he speaks of \"a stroll in the Park.\"\n\nWhile Goldsmith was literally living from hand to mouth by the forced drudgery of the pen, his independence of spirit was subjected to a sore pecuniary trial. It was the opening of Lord North's administration, a time of great political excitement. The public mind was agitated by the question of American taxation, and other questions of like irritating tendency. Junius and Wilkes and other powerful writers were attacking the administration with all their force; Grub-street was stirred up to its lowest depths; inflammatory talent of all kinds was in full activity, and the kingdom was deluged with\n\n* \"See on the distant slope, majestic shows\nOld Canonbury's tower, an ancient pile\nTo various fates assigned; and where by turns\nMeanness and grandeur have alternate reigned;\nThither, in latter days, hath genius fled\nFrom yonder city, to respire and die.\nThere the sweet bard of Auburn sat, and tuned\nThe plaintive moanings of his village dirge.\nThere learned Chambers treasured lore for men,\nAnd Newbery there his A B C's for babes.\"\npanphlets, lampoons and libels of the grossest kinds. The ministry were looking anxiously round for literary support. It was thought that the pen of Goldsmith might be readily enlisted. His hospitable friend and countryman, Robert Nugent, politically known as Squire Gawky, had come out strenuously for colonial taxation; had been selected for a lordship of the board of trade, and raised to the rank of Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare. His example, it was thought, would be enough of itself to bring Goldsmith into the ministerial ranks; and then what writer of the day was proof against a full purse or a pension? Accordingly one Parson Scott, chaplain to Lord Sandwich, and author of \"Anti-Sejanus Panurge,\" and other political libels in support of the administration, was sent to negotiate with the poet, who at this time was returned to town. Dr. Scott, in after years, when his political subserviency had been rewarded by two fat crown livings, used to make what he considered a good story out of this embassy to the poet. \"I found him,\" said he, \"in a miserable suite of chambers in the Temple. I told him my authority. I told how I was empowered to pay most liberally for his exertions; and, would you believe it! he was so absurd as to say 'I can earn as much as will supply my wants without writing for any party; the assistance you offer is therefore unnecessary to me;'\u2014and so I left him in his garret!\" Who does not admire the sturdy independence of poor Goldsmith, toiling in his garret for nine guineas the job, and smile with contempt at the indignant wonder of the political divine, albeit his subserviency was repaid by two fat crown livings!\n\nNot long after this occurrence, Goldsmith's old friend, though frugal-handed employer, Newbery, of picture-book renown, closed his mortal career. The poet has celebrated him as the friend of all mankind; he certainly lost nothing by his friendship. He coined the brains of his authors in the times of their exigency, and made them pay dear for the plank put out to keep them from drowning. It is not likely his death caused much lamentation among the scribbling tribe; we may express decent respect for the memory of the just, but we shed tears only at the grave of the generous.\n\n---\n\nA number of these people, and they formed a club at the Crown Tavern, where he presided in his own right of the company.\n\nOld Canonbury Castle was the memory of Goldsmith. The poet had inhabited, in a small bed-room, with panelling. The quaintness and primitive. It was one of the spots which walks, who would ascend themselves with reconnoitre. Not far from this White Conduit House, a place used to figure in the first edition of his Essays, where he at that time, in society genteel society.

Garrick, notwithstanding his professions, had still a lurking grudge against the author, and tasked his managerial arts to thwart him in his theatrical enterprise. For this purpose he undertook to build up Hugh Kelly, Goldsmith's boon companion of the Wednesday club, as a kind of rival. Kelly had written a comedy called \"False Delicacy,\" in which were embodied all the meretricious qualities of the sentimental school. Garrick, though he had decried that school, and had brought out his comedy of \"The Clandestine Marriage\" in opposition to it, now lauded \"False Delicacy\" to the skies, and prepared to bring it out at Drury Lane, with all possible stage effect. He even went so far as to write a prologue and epilogue for it, and to touch up some parts of the dialogue. He had become reconciled to his former colleague, Colman, and it is intimated that one condition in the treaty of peace between these potentates of the realms of pasteboard (equally prone to play into each other's hands with the confederate potentates on the great theatre of life) was, that Goldsmith's play should be kept back until Kelly's had been brought forward.\n\nIn the meantime, the poor author, little dreaming of the deleterious influence at work behind the scenes, saw the appointed time arrive and pass by without the performance of his play; while \"False Delicacy\" was brought out at Drury Lane (January 23, 1768) with all the trickery of managerial management. Houses were packed to applaud it to the echo; the newspapers vied with each other in their venal praises, and night after night seemed to give it a fresh triumph.\n\nWhile \"False Delicacy\" was thus borne on the full tide of fictitious prosperity, \"The Good-natured Man\" was creeping through the last rehearsals at Covent Garden. The success of the rival piece threw a damp upon author, manager, and actors. Goldsmith went about with a face full of anxiety; Colman's hopes in the piece declined at each rehearsal; as to his fellow proprietors, they declared they had never entertained any. All the actors were discontented with their parts excepting Ned Shuter, an excellent low comedian, and a pretty actress named Miss Walford; both of whom the poor author ever afterward held in grateful recollection.\nJohnson, Goldsmith's growling monitor and unsparing investigator in times of heedless levity, stood by him at present with that protecting kindness with which he ever befriended him in time of need. He attended the rehearsals; he furnished the prologue according to promise; he pish'd and pshaw'd at any doubts and fears on the part of the author, but gave him sound counsel, and held him up with a stedfast and manly hand. Inspirited by his sympathy, Goldsmith plucked up new heart, and arrayed himself for the grand trial with unusual care. Ever since his elevation into the polite world, he had improved in his wardrobe and toilet. Johnson could no longer accuse him of being shabby in his appearance; he rather went to the other extreme. On the present occasion there is an entry in the books of his tailor, Mr. William Filby, of a suit of \"Tyrian bloom, satin grain, and garter blue silk breeches, 8l. 2s. 7d.\" Thus magnificently attired, he attended the theatre and watched the reception of the play, and the effect of each individual scene, with that vicissitude of feeling incident to his mercurial nature.\n\nJohnson's prologue was solemn in itself, and being delivered by Brinsley in lugubrious tones, suited to the Ghost in \"Hamlet,\" seemed to throw a portentous gloom on the audience. Some of the scenes met with great applause, and at such times Goldsmith was highly elated; others went off coldly, or there were slight tokens of disapprobation, and then his spirits would sink. The fourth act saved the piece; for Shuter, who had the main comic character of Croaker, was so varied and ludicrous in his execution of the scene in which he reads an incendiary letter, that he drew down thunders of applause. On his coming behind the scenes, Goldsmith greeted him with an overflowing heart; declaring that he exceeded his own idea of the character, and made it almost as new to him as to any of the audience.\n\nOn the whole, however, both the author and his friends were disappointed at the reception of the piece, and considered it a failure. Poor Goldsmith left the theatre with his towering hopes completely cut down. He endeavoured to hide his mortification, and even to assume an air of unconcern while among his associates; but the moment he was alone with Dr. Johnson, in whose rough but magnanimous nature he reposed unlimited confidence, he threw off all restraint, and gave way to an almost child-like burst of grief. Johnson, who had\nshown no want of sympathy at the proper time, saw nothing in the partial disappointment of overrated expectations to warrant such ungoverned emotions, and rebuked him sternly for what he termed a silly affectation, saying that \"no man should be expected to sympathize with the sorrows of vanity.\"\n\nWhen Goldsmith had recovered from the blow, he, with his usual unreserve, made his past distress a subject of amusement to his friends. Dining one day, in company with Dr. Johnson, at the chaplain's table at St. James's Palace, he entertained the company with a particular and comic account of all his feelings on the night of representation, and his despair when the piece was hissed. How he went, he said, to the Literary Club, chatted gaily, as if nothing had gone amiss; and, to give a greater idea of his unconcern, sang his favourite song about an old woman tossed in a blanket seventeen times as high as the moon \u2014 \"All this while,\" added he, \"I was suffering horrid tortures, and, had I put a bit in my mouth, I verily believe it would have strangled me on the spot, I was so excessively ill; but I made more noise than usual to cover all that; so they never perceived my not eating, nor suspected the anguish of my heart; but when all were gone except Johnson here, I burst out a-crying, and even swore that I would never write again.\"\n\nDr. Johnson sat in a maze at the odd frankness and childlike self-accusation of poor Goldsmith. When the latter had come to a pause, \"All this, doctor,\" said he, drily, \"I thought had been a secret between you and me, and I am sure I would not have said anything about it for the world.\" But Goldsmith had no secrets; his follies, his weaknesses, his errors, were all thrown to the surface; his heart was really too guileless and innocent, to seek mystery and concealment. It is too often the false, designing man that is guarded in his conduct, and never offends proprieties.\n\nIt is singular, however, that Goldsmith, who thus, in conversation, could keep nothing to himself, should be the author of a maxim which would inculcate the most thorough dissimulation. \"Men of the world,\" says he, in one of the papers of the \"Bee,\" \"maintain that the true end of speech is not so much to express our wants as to conceal them.\" How often is this quoted as one of the subtle remarks of the fine witted Talleyrand!\n\n\"The Good-natured Man\" was performed for ten nights in conti\nsuccession; the third, sixth, and ninth nights were for the author's benefit; the fifth night it was commanded by their majesties; after this it was played occasionally, but rarely, having always pleased more in the closet than on the stage.\n\nAs to Kelly's comedy, Johnson pronounced it entirely devoid of character, and it has long since passed into oblivion. Yet it is an instance how an inferior production, by dint of puffing and trumpeting, may be kept up for a time on the surface of popular opinion, or rather of popular talk. What had been done for \"False Delicacy\" on the stage, was continued by the press. The booksellers vied with the manager in launching it upon the town. They announced that the first impression of three thousand copies was exhausted before two o'clock on the day of publication; four editions, amounting to ten thousand copies, were sold in the course of the season; a public breakfast was given to Kelly at the Chapter Coffee-House, and a piece of plate presented to him by the publishers. The comparative merits of the two plays were continually subjects of discussion in green-rooms, coffee-houses, and other places, where theatrical questions were discussed.\n\nGoldsmith's old enemy, Kenrick, that \"viper of the press,\" endeavoured on this, as on many other occasions, to detract from his well-earned fame; the poet was excessively sensitive to these attacks, and had not the art and self-command to conceal his feelings.\n\nSome scribblers on the other side insinuated that Kelly had seen the manuscript of Goldsmith's play, while in the hands of Garrick or elsewhere, and had borrowed some of the situations and sentiments. Some of the wags of the day took a mischievous pleasure in stirring up a feud between the two authors. Goldsmith became nettled, though he could scarcely be deemed jealous of one so far his inferior. He spoke disparagingly, though no doubt sincerely, of Kelly's play: the latter retorted. Still, when they met one day behind the scenes of Covent Garden, Goldsmith, with his customary urbanity, congratulated Kelly on his success. \"If I thought you sincere, Mr. Goldsmith,\" replied the other, abruptly, \"I should thank you.\" Goldsmith was not a man to harbour spleen or ill-will, and soon laughed at this unworthy rivalry; but the jealousy and envy awakened in Kelly's mind long continued. He is even accused of having given vent to his\nhostility by anonymous attacks in the newspapers, the basest resource of dastardly and malignant spirits; but of this there is no positive proof.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nThe profits resulting from \"The Good-natured Man\" were beyond any that Goldsmith had yet derived from his works. He netted about four hundred pounds from the theatre, and one hundred pounds from his publisher.\n\nFive hundred pounds! and all at one miraculous draught! It appeared to him wealth inexhaustible. It at once opened his heart and hand, and led him into all kinds of extravagance. The first symptom was ten guineas sent to Shuter for a box ticket for his benefit, when \"The Good-natured Man\" was to be performed. The next was an entire change in his domicile. The shabby lodgings with Jeffs, the butler, in which he had been worried by Johnson's scrutiny, were now exchanged for chambers more becoming a man of his ample fortune. The apartments consisted of three rooms on the second floor of No. 2, Brick Court, Middle Temple, on the right hand ascending the staircase, and overlooked the umbrageous walks of the Temple garden. The lease he purchased for four hundred pounds, and then went on to furnish his rooms with mahogany sofas, card-tables and book-cases; with curtains, mirrors, and Wilton carpets. His awkward little person was also furnished out in a style befitting his apartment; for, in addition to his suit of \"Tyrian bloom, satin grain,\" we find another charge about this time, in the books of Mr. Filby, in no less gorgeous terms, being \"lined with silk and furnished with gold buttons.\" Thus lodged, and thus arrayed, he invited the visits of his most aristocratic acquaintances, and no longer quailed beneath the courtly eye of Beauclerc. He gave dinners to Johnson, Reynolds, Percy, Bickerstaff, and other friends of note; and supper parties to young folks of both sexes. These last were preceded by round games of cards, at which there was more laughter than skill, and in which the sport was to cheat each other; or by romping games of forfeits and blindman's buff, at which he enacted the lord of misrule. Blackstone, whose chambers were immediately below, and who was studiously occupied on his \"Commentaries...\"\nmentaries,\" used to complain of the racket made over-head by his revelling neighbour.\n\nSometimes Goldsmith would make up a rural party, composed of four or five of his \"Jolly Pigeon\" friends, to enjoy what he humourously called a \"shoemaker's holiday.\" These would assemble at his chambers in the morning, to partake of a plentiful and rather expensive breakfast; the remains of which, with his customary benevolence, he generally gave to some poor woman in attendance. The repast ended, the party would set out on foot, in high spirits, making extensive rambles by foot-paths and green lanes to Blackheath, Wandsworth, Chelsea, Hampton Court, Highgate, or some other pleasant resort, within a few miles of London. A simple, but gay, and heartily relished dinner at a country inn crowned the excursion. In the evening, they strolled back to town, all the better in health and spirits for a day spent in rural and social enjoyment. Occasionally, when extravagantly inclined, they adjourned from dinner to drink tea at the White Conduit House; and, now and then, concluded their festive day by supping at the Grecian or Temple Exchange Coffee Houses, or at the Globe Tavern, in Fleet Street. The whole expenses of the day never exceeded a crown, and were oftener from three and sixpence to four shillings; for the best part of their entertainment, sweet air and rural scenes, excellent exercise and joyous conversation, cost nothing.\n\nOne of Goldsmith's humble companions, on these excursions, was his occasional amanuensis, Peter Barlow, whose quaint peculiarities afforded much amusement to the company. Peter was poor, but punctilious, squaring his expenses according to his means. He always wore the same gurh; fixed his regular expenditure for dinner at a trifling sum, which, if left to himself, he never exceeded, but which he always insisted on paying. His oddities always made him a welcome companion on the \"shoemakers' holidays.\" The dinner, on these occasions, generally exceeded considerably his tariff; but be put down, however, no more than his regular sum, and Goldsmith made up the difference.\n\nAnother of these hangers-on, for whom, on such occasions, he was content to \"pay the shot,\" was his countryman, Glover, of whom mention has already been made, as one of the wags and sponges of the Globe and Devil taverns, and a constant mimic at the Wednesday Club.\nThis vagabond genius has bequeathed us a whimsical story of one of his practical jokes upon Goldsmith, in the course of a rural excursion in the vicinity of London. They had dined at an inn on Hampstead Heights, and were descending the hill, when, in passing a cottage, they saw through the open window a party at tea. Goldsmith, who was fatigued, cast a wistful glance at the cheerful tea-table. \"How I should like to be of that party!\" exclaimed he. \"Nothing more easy,\" replied Glover; \"allow me to introduce you.\" So saying, he entered the house with an air of the most perfect familiarity, though an utter stranger, and was followed by the unsuspecting Goldsmith, who supposed, of course, that he was a friend of the family. The owner of the house rose on the entrance of the strangers. The undaunted Glover shook hands with him, in the most cordial manner possible, fixed his eye on one of the company, who had a peculiarly good-natured physiognomy, muttered something like a recognition, and forthwith launched into an amusing story, invented at the moment, of something which he pretended had occurred upon the road. The host supposed the new-comers were friends of his guests; the guests that they were friends of the host. Glover did not give them time to find out the truth. He followed one droll story with another; brought his powers of mimicry into play, and kept the company in a roar. Tea was offered and accepted; an hour went off in the most sociable manner imaginable, at the end of which, Glover bowed himself and his companion out of the house, with many facetious last words, leaving the host and his company to compare notes, and to find out what an impudent intrusion they had experienced.\n\nNothing could exceed the dismay and vexation of Goldsmith when triumphantly told by Glover that it was all a hoax, and that he did not know a single soul in the house. His first impulse was to return instantly and vindicate himself from all participation in the jest; but a few words from his free and easy companion, dissuaded him. \"Doctor,\" said he, coolly, \"we are unknown; you quite as much as I; if you return and tell the story, it will be in the newspapers to-morrow; nay, upon recollection, I remember in one of their offices the face of that squinting fellow who sat in the corner, as if he was treasuring up my stories for future use, and we shall be sure of being exposed; let us therefore keep our own council.\"\nThis story was frequently afterwards told by Glover, with rich dramatic effect, repeating and exaggerating the conversation, and mimicking, in ludicrous style, the embarrassment, surprise, and subsequent indignation of Goldsmith.\n\nIt is a trite saying that a wheel cannot run in two ruts; nor a man keep two opposite sets of intimates. Goldsmith sometimes found his old friends of the \"Jolly Pigeon\" order turning up rather awkwardly when he was in company with his new aristocratic acquaintances. He gave a whimsical account of the sudden apparition of one of them at his gay apartments in the Temple, who may have been a welcome visitor at his squalid quarters in Green Arbour Court. \"How do you think he served me?\" said he to a friend. \"Why, sir, after staying away two years, he came one evening into my chambers, half drunk, as I was taking a glass of wine with Topham Beauclerc and General Oglethorpe; and sitting himself down, with most intolerable assurance, inquired after my health and literary pursuits, as if we were upon the most friendly footing. I was at first so much ashamed of ever having known such a fellow, that I stifled my resentment, and drew him into a conversation on such topics as I knew he could talk upon; in which, to do him justice, he acquitted himself very reputably; when all of a sudden, as if recollecting something, he pulled two papers out of his pocket, which he presented to me, with great ceremony, saying, 'Here, my dear friend, is a quarter of a pound of tea, and a half pound of sugar, I have brought you; for though it is not in my power at present to pay you the two guineas you so generously lent me, you, nor any man else, shall ever have it to say that I want gratitude.' This,\" added Goldsmith, \"was too much. I could no longer keep in my feelings, but desired him to turn out of my chambers directly; which he very coolly did, taking up his tea and sugar; and I never saw him afterwards.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nThe heedless expenses of Goldsmith, as may easily be supposed, soon brought him to the end of his \"prize-money;\" but when his purse gave out, he drew upon futurity, obtaining advances from his booksellers, and loans from his friends, in the confident hope of soon turning up another trump. The\ndebts which he thus thoughtlessly incurred, in consequence of a transient gleam of prosperity, embarrassed him for the rest of his life; so that the success of the \"Good-natured Man\" may be said to have been ruinous to him.\n\nHe was soon obliged to resume his old craft of book-building, and set about his \"History of Rome,\" undertaken for Davies.\n\nIt was his custom, as we have shown, during the summer time, when pressed by a multiplicity of literary jobs, or urged to the accomplishment of some particular task, to take country lodgings a few miles from town, generally on the Harrow or Edgware roads, and bury himself there for weeks and months together. Sometimes he would remain closely occupied in his room, at other times he would stroll out along the lanes and hedge-rows, and taking out paper and pencil, note down thoughts, to be expanded and connected at home. His summer retreat, for the present year, 1768, was a little cottage with a garden, pleasantly situated about eight miles from town on the Edgware Road. He took it in conjunction with a Mr. Edmund Botts, a barrister and man of letters, his neighbour in the Temple, having rooms immediately opposite him on the same floor. They had become cordial intimates, and Botts was one of those with whom Goldsmith now and then took the friendly, but pernicious liberty of borrowing.\n\nThe cottage which they had hired, belonged to a rich shoemaker of Piccadilly, who had embellished his little domain of half an acre, with statues, and jets, and all the decorations of landscape gardening; in consequence of which, Goldsmith gave it the name of \"The Shoemaker's Paradise.\" As his fellow-occupant, Mr. Botts, drove a gig, he sometimes, in an interval of literary labour, accompanied him to town, partook of a social dinner there, and returned with him in the evening. On one occasion, when they had probably lingered too long at the table, they came near breaking their necks on their way homeward, by driving against a post on the sidewalk, while Botts was proving, by the force of legal eloquence, that they were in the very middle of the broad Edgware Road.\n\nIn the course of this summer, Goldsmith's career of gaiety was suddenly brought to a pause by intelligence of the death of his brother Henry, then but forty-five years of age. He had led a quiet and blameless life amid the scenes of his youth, fulfilling the duties of village pastor with unaffected\npiety; conducting the school at Lissoy with a degree of industry and ability that gave it celebrity, and acquitting himself in all the duties of life with undeviating rectitude, and the mildest benevolence. How truly Goldsmith loved and venerated him, is evident in all his letters, and throughout his works, in which his brother continually forms his model for an exemplification of all the most endearing of the Christian virtues; yet his affection at his death was embittered by the fear that he died with some doubt upon his mind of the warmth of his affection. Goldsmith had been urged by his friends in Ireland, since his elevation in the world, to use his influence with the great, which they supposed to be all-powerful, in favour of Henry, to obtain for him church preferment. He did exert himself as far as his diffident nature would permit, but without success; we have seen that, in the case of the Earl of Northumberland, when, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, that nobleman proffered him his patronage, he asked nothing for himself, but only spoke on behalf of his brother. Still some of his friends, ignorant of what he had done, and of how little he was able to do, accused him of negligence. It is not likely, however, that his amiable and estimable brother joined in the accusation.\n\nTo the tender and melancholy recollections of his early days, awakened by the death of this loved companion of his childhood, we may attribute some of the most heartfelt passages in his \"Deserted Village.\" Much of that poem, we are told, was composed this summer, in the course of solitary strolls about the green lanes and beautifully rural scenes of the neighbourhood; and thus, much of the softness and sweetness of English landscape became blended with the ruder features of Lissoy. It was in these lonely and subdued moments, when tender regret was half mingled with self-upbraiding, that he poured forth that homage of the heart, rendered as it were at the grave of his brother. The picture of the village pastor in this poem, which we have already hinted was taken in part from the character of his father, embodied likewise the recollections of his brother Henry, for the natures of the father and son seem to have been identical. In the following lines, however, Goldsmith evidently contrasted the quiet settled life of his brother, passed at home in the benevolent exercise of the Christian duties, with his own restless, vagrant career:\n\"Remote from towns he ran his godly race,\nNor e'er had changed, nor wished to change his place.\"\n\nTo us, the whole character seems traced, as it were, in an expiatory spirit; as if, conscious of his own wandering restlessness, he sought to humble himself at the shrine of excellence, which he had not been able to practise:\n\n\"At church with meek and unaffected grace,\nHis looks adorn'd the venerable place:\nTruth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,\nAnd fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.\nThe service past, around the pious man,\nWith steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;\nEven children follow'd with endearing wile,\nAnd pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile:\nHis ready smile a parent's warmth express'd,\nTheir welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distress'd;\nTo them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,\nBut all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd, as a bird, each fond endearment tries\nTo tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,\nHe tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,\nAllur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nIn October, Goldsmith returned to town, and resumed his usual haunts. We hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author of \"Love in a Village,\" \"Lionel and Clarissa,\" and other dramatic successful pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman, somewhat idle and intemperate, who lived nobody knew how nor where, sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who was ever the vagabond's friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the dignity of a disease, which he termed *impecuniosity*, and against which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce had\nthe author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but continued to read in a more elevated tone. The louder he read, the louder Hiffernan snored; until the author came to a pause. \"Never mind the brute, Bick, but go on,\" cried Goldsmith. \"He would have served Homer just so, if he were here, and reading his own works.\"\n\nKenrick, Goldsmith's old enemy, travestied this anecdote in the following lines, pretending that the poet had compared his countryman Bickerstaff to Homer:\n\n\"What are your Bretons, Romans, Grecians,\nCompared with thorough-bred Milcians!\nStep into Griffin's shop, he'll tell ye\nOf Goldsmith, Bickerstaff, and Kelly *\n* *\nAnd, take one Irish evidence for t'other,\nEv'n Homer's self is but their foster brother.\"\n\nJohnson was a rough consoler to a man when wincing under an attack of this kind. \"Never mind, sir,\" said he to Goldsmith, when he saw that he felt the sting. \"A man whose business it is to be talked of, is much helped by being attacked. Fame, sir, is a shuttlecock; if it be struck only at one end of the room, it will soon fall to the ground; to keep it up, it must be struck at both ends.\"\n\nBickerstaff, at the time of which we are speaking, was in high vogue, the associate of the first wits of the day; a few years afterwards, he was obliged to fly the country to escape the punishment of an infamous crime. Johnson expressed great astonishment at hearing the offence for which he had fled. \"Why, sir?\" said Thrule, \"he had long been a suspected man.\" Perhaps there was a knowing look on the part of the eminent brewer, which provoked a somewhat contemptuous reply. \"By those who look close to the ground,\" said Johnson, \"dirt will sometimes be seen; I hope I see things from a greater distance.\"\n\nWe have already noticed the improvement, or rather the increased expense, of Goldsmith's wardrobe, since his elevation into polite society. \"He was fond,\" says one of his contemporaries, \"of exhibiting his muscular little person in the gayest apparel of the day, to which was added a bag-wig and sword.\" Thus arrayed, he used to figure about in the sunshine in the Temple Gardens, much to his own satisfaction, but to the amusement of his acquaintances.\nBoswell, in his memoirs, has rendered one of his suits for ever famous. That worthy, on the 16th of October in this same year, gave a dinner to Johnson, Goldsmith, Reynolds, Garrick, Murphy, Bickerstaff, and Davies. Goldsmith was generally apt to bustle in at the last moment, when the guests were taking their seats at table, but on this occasion he was unusually early. While waiting for some lingerers to arrive, \"he strutted about,\" says Boswell, \"bragging of his dress, and I believe was seriously vain of it, for his mind was undoubtedly prone to such impressions. 'Come, come,' said Garrick, 'talk no more of that. You are perhaps the worst\u2014eh, eh!' Goldsmith was eagerly attempting to interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing ironically, 'Nay, you will always look like a gentleman; but I am talking of your being well or ill-dressed.' 'Well, let me tell you,' said Goldsmith, 'when the tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he said, 'Sir, I have a favour to beg of you; when anybody asks you who made your clothes, be pleased to mention John Filby, at the Harrow, in Water Lane.' 'Why, sir,' cried Johnson, 'that was because he knew the strange colour would attract crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and see how well he could make a coat of so absurd a colour.'\"\n\nBut though Goldsmith might permit this raillery on the part of his friends, he was quick to resent any personalities of the kind from strangers. As he was one day walking the Strand in grand array with bag-wig and sword, he excited the merriment of two coxcombs, one of whom called to the other to \"look at that fly with a long pin stuck through it. Stung to the quick, Goldsmith's first retort was to caution the passers-by to be on their guard against that \"brace of disguised pickpockets\"\u2014his next was to step into the middle of the street, where there was room for action, half-draw his sword, and beckon the joker, who was armed in like manner, to follow him. This was literally a war of wit which the other had not anticipated. He had no inclination to push the joke to such an extreme, but abandoning the ground, sneaked off with his brother wag, amid the hootings of the spectators.\n\nThis proneness to finery in dress, however, which Boswell and others of Goldsmith's contemporaries, who did not understand the secret plies of his character, attributed to vanity, arose, we are convinced, from a widely different motive. It was from a painful idea of his own personal defects, which\nhad been cruelly stamped upon his mind in his boyhood, by the sneers and jeers of his playmates, and had been ground deeper into it by rude speeches made to him in every step of his struggling career, until it had become a constant cause of awkwardness and embarrassment. This he had experienced the more sensibly since his reputation had elevated him into polite society; and he was constantly endeavouring by the aid of dress to acquire that personal acceptability, if we may use the phrase, which nature had denied him. If ever he betrayed a little self-complacency on first turning out in a new suit, it may, perhaps, have been because he felt as if he had achieved a triumph over his ugliness.\n\nThere were circumstances, too, about the time of which we are treating, which may have rendered Goldsmith more than usually attentive to his personal appearance. He had recently made the acquaintance of a most agreeable family from Devonshire, which he met at the house of his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds. It consisted of Mrs. Horneck, widow of Captain Kane Horneck; two daughters, seventeen and nineteen years of age, and an only son, Charles, the Captain in Lace, as his sisters playfully and somewhat proudly called him, he having lately entered the Guards. The daughters are described as uncommonly beautiful, intelligent, sprightly, and agreeable. Catherine, the eldest, went among her friends by the name of Little Comedy, indicative, very probably, of her disposition. She was engaged to William Henry Bunbury, second son of a Suffolk baronet. The hand and heart of her sister Mary were yet unengaged, although she bore the by-name among her friends of the Jessamy Bride. This family was prepared, by their intimacy with Reynolds and his sister, to appreciate the merits of Goldsmith. The poet had always been a chosen friend of the eminent painter, and Miss Reynolds, as we have shown, ever since she had heard his poem of \"The Traveller\" read aloud, had ceased to consider him ugly. The Hornecks were equally capable of forgetting his person in admiring his works. On becoming acquainted with him too, they were delighted with his guileless simplicity; his buoyant good-nature and his innate benevolence, and an enduring intimacy soon sprang up between them. For once poor Goldsmith had met with polite society, with which he was perfectly at home, and by which he was fully appreciated; for once he had met with lovely women, to whom his ugly features were\nnot repulsive. A proof of the easy and playful terms in which he was with them, remains in a whimsical epistle in verse, of which the following was the occasion. A dinner was to be given to their family, by a Dr. Baker, a friend of their mother's, at which Reynolds and Angelica Kauffman were to be present. The young ladies were eager to have Goldsmith of the party, and their intimacy with Dr. Baker allowing them to take the liberty, they wrote a joint invitation to the poet at the last moment. It came too late, and drew from him the following reply; on the top of which was scrawled, \"This is a poem! This is a copy of verses!\"\n\n\"Your mandate I got,\nYou may all go to pot;\nHad your senses been right,\nYou'd have sent before night\u2014\nSo tell Horneck and Nesbitt,\nAnd Baker and his bit,\nAnd Kauffmann beside,\nAnd the Jessamy Bride,\nWith the rest of the crew,\nThe Reynoldses too,\nBut, alas! your good worships, how could they be wiser,\nWhen both have been spoil'd in to-day's Advertiser!\"*\n\nIt has been intimated that the intimacy of poor Goldsmith with the Miss Hornecks, which began in so sprightly a vein, gradually assumed something of a more tender nature, and that he was not insensible to the fascinations of the younger sister. This may account for some of the phenomena which about this time appeared in his wardrobe and toilet. During the first year of his acquaintance with these lovely girls, the tell-tale book of his tailor, Mr. William Filby, displays entries of four or five full suits, besides separate articles of dress. Among the items, we find a green, half-trimmed frock and\n\n* The following lines had appeared in that day's Advertiser, on the portrait of Sir Joshua, by Angelica Kauffman:\n\n\"While fair Angelica, with matchless grace,\nPaints Conway's burly form and Stanhope's face;\nOur hearts to beauty willing homage pay,\nWe praise, admire, and gaze our souls away.\nBut when the likeness she hath done for thee,\nO Reynolds! with astonishment we see,\nForced to submit, with all our pride we own,\nSuch strength, such harmony, excelled by none,\nAnd thou art rivalled by thyself alone.\"\nbreeches, lined with silk; a queen's blue dress suit; a half-dress suit of ratteen, lined with satin; a pair of silk stocking breeches, and another pair of a bloom colour. Alas! poor Goldsmith! how much of this silken finery was dictated, not by vanity, but humble consciousness of thy defects; how much of it was to atone for the uncouthness of thy person, and to win favour in the eyes of the Jessamy Bride!\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nIn the winter of 1768-9, Goldsmith occupied himself at his quarters in the Temple, slowly \"building up\" his \"Roman History.\" We have pleasant views of him in this learned and half-cloistered retreat of wits, and lawyers, and legal students, in the reminiscences of Judge Day of the Irish Bench, who in his advanced age, delighted to recall the days of his youth, when he was a Templar, and to speak of the kindness with which he and his fellow student, Grattan, were treated by the poet. \"I was just arrived from college,\" said he, \"full freighted with academic gleanings, and our author did not disdain to receive from me some opinions and hints towards his Greek and Roman Histories. Being then a young man, I felt much flattered by the notice of so celebrated a person. He took great delight in the conversation of Grattan, whose brilliancy in the morning of life furnished full earnest of the unrivalled splendour which awaited his meridian; and finding us dwelling together in Essex Court, near himself, where he frequently visited my immortal friend, his warm heart became naturally prepossessed toward the associate of one whom he so much admired.\"\n\nThe judge goes on, in his reminiscences, to give a picture of Goldsmith's social habits, similar in style to those already furnished. He frequented much the Grecian Coffee-House, then the favourite resort of the Irish and Lancashire Templars. He delighted in collecting his friends around him at evening parties at his chambers, where he entertained them with a cordial and unostentatious hospitality. \"Occasionally,\" adds the judge, \"he amused them with his flute, or with whist, neither of which he played well, particularly the latter, but, on losing his money, he never lost his temper. In a run of bad luck and worse play, he would fling his cards upon the\nfloor, and exclaim, 'Byefore George, I ought for ever to renounce thee, fickle, faithless, fortune.'\"\n\nThe judge was aware, at the time, that all the learned labour of poor Goldsmith upon his \"Roman History\" was mere hack work to recruit his exhausted finances. \"His purse replenished;\" adds he, \"by labours of this kind, the season of relaxation and pleasure took its turn, in attending the theatres, Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and other scenes of gaiety and amusement. Whenever his funds were dissipated\u2014and they fled more rapidly from being the dupe of many artful persons, male and female, who practised upon his benevolence\u2014he returned to his literary labours, and shut himself up from society to provide fresh matter for his bookseller, and fresh supplies for himself.\"\n\nHow completely had the young student discerned the characteristics of poor, genial, generous, drudging, holiday-loving Goldsmith; toiling, that he might play; earning his bread by the sweat of his brains, and then throwing it out of the window.\n\nThe \"Roman History\" was published in the middle of May, in two volumes of five hundred pages each. It was brought out without parade or pretension, and was announced as for the use of schools and colleges; but, though a work written for bread, not fame, such is its ease, perspicuity, good sense, and the delightful simplicity of its style, that it was well received by the critics, commanded a prompt and extensive sale, and has ever since remained in the hands of young and old.\n\nJohnson, who, as we have before remarked, rarely praised or dispraised things by halves, broke forth in a warm eulogy of the author and the work, in a conversation with Boswell, to the great astonishment of the latter. \"Whether we take Goldsmith,\" said he, \"as a poet, as a comic writer, or as a historian, he stands in the first class.\" Boswell.\u2014\"An historian! My dear sir, you surely will not rank his compilation of the 'Roman History' with the works of other historians of this age?\" Johnson.\u2014\"Why, who are before him?\" Boswell.\u2014\"Hume, Robertson, Lord Lyttleton.\" Johnson (his antipathy against the Scotch beginning to rise).\u2014\"I have not read Hume; but doubtless Goldsmith's History is better than the verbiage of Robertson, or the popery of Dalrymple.\"\nin whose history we find such penetration, such painting?\"\n\nJohnson.\u2014\"Sir, you must consider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not history, it is imagination. He who describes what he never saw, draws from fancy. Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces in a history piece; he imagines an heroic countenance. You must look upon Robertson's work as a romance, and try it by that standard. History it is not. Besides, sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Goldsmith has done this in his history. Now Robertson might have put twice as much in his book. Robertson is like a man who has packed gold in wool; the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, sir, I always thought Robertson would be crushed with his own weight\u2014would be buried under his own ornaments. Goldsmith tells you shortly all you want to know; Robertson detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robertson's cumbrous detail a second time; but Goldsmith's plain narrative will please again and again. I would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his pupils: 'Read over your compositions, and, whenever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out!' Goldsmith's abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to say, that if you compare him with Vertot in the same places of the Roman History, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the art of compiling, and of saying everything he has to say in a pleasing manner. He is now writing a Natural History, and will make it as entertaining as a Persian tale.\"\n\nThe Natural History to which Johnson alluded was the \"History of Animated Nature,\" which Goldsmith commenced in 1769, under an engagement with Griffin the bookseller, to complete it as soon as possible in eight volumes, each containing upwards of four hundred pages, in pica; a hundred guineas to be paid to the author on the delivery of each volume in manuscript.\n\nHe was induced to engage in this work by the urgent solicitations of the booksellers, who had been struck by the striking merits and captivating style of an introduction which he wrote to \"Brookes's Natural History.\" It was Goldsmith's intention originally to make a translation of Pliny, with a popular commentary; but the appearance of Buffon's work\ninduced him to change his plan, and make use of that author for a guide and model.\n\nCumberland, speaking of this work, observes: \"Distress drove Goldsmith upon undertakings neither congenial with his studies nor worthy of his talents. I remember him when, in his chambers in the Temple, he showed me the beginning of his 'Animated Nature;' it was with a sigh, such as genius draws when hard necessity diverts it from its bent to drudge for bread, and talk of birds and beasts, and creeping things, which Pidock's showman would have done as well. Poor fellow, he hardly knows an ass from a mule, nor a turkey from a goose, but when he sees it on the table.\"\n\nOthers of Goldsmith's friends entertained similar ideas with respect to his fitness for the task, and they were apt now and then to banter him on the subject, and to amuse themselves with his easy credulity. The custom among the natives of Otaheite of eating dogs being once mentioned in company, Goldsmith observed that a similar custom prevailed in China; that a dog-butcher is as common there as any other butcher; and that, when he walks abroad, all the dogs fall on him. Johnson.\u2014\"That is not owing to his killing dogs; sir, I remember a butcher at Lichfield, whom a dog that was in the house where I lived always attacked. It is the smell of carnage which provokes this, let the animals be has killed be what they may.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"Yes, there is a general abhorrence in animals at the signs of massacre. If you put a tub full of blood into a stable, the horses are likely to go mad.\" Johnson.\u2014\"I doubt that.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"Nay, sir, it is a fact well authenticated.\" Thrale.\u2014\"You had better prove it before you put it into your book on Natural History. You may do it in my stable if you will.\" Johnson.\u2014\"Nay, sir, I would not have him prove it. If he is content to take his information from others, he may get through his book with little trouble, and without much endangering his reputation. But if he makes experiments for so comprehensive a book as his, there would be no end to them; his erroneous assertions would fall then upon himself; and he might be blamed for not having made experiments as to every particular.\"\n\nJohnson's original prediction, however, with respect to this work, that Goldsmith would make it as entertaining as a Persian tale, was verified; and though much of it was borrowed\nfrom Buffon, and but little of it written from his own observation; though it was by no means profound, and was chargeable with many errors, yet the charms of his style, and the play of his happy disposition throughout have continued to render it far more popular and readable than many works on the subject of much greater scope and science. Cumberland was mistaken, however, in his notion of Goldsmith's ignorance, and lack of observation as to the characteristics of animals. On the contrary, he was a minute and shrewd observer of them; but he observed them with the eye of a poet and moralist as well as a naturalist. We quote two passages from his works illustrative of this fact, and we do so the more readily because they are in a manner a part of his history, and give us another peep into his private life in the Temple; of his mode of occupying himself in his lonely, and apparently idle moments, and of another class of acquaintances which he made there.\n\nSpeaking in his \"Animated Nature\" of the habitudes of rooks, \"I have often amused myself,\" says he, \"with observing their plans of policy from my window in the Temple, that looks upon a grove, where they have made a colony in the midst of a city. At the commencement of spring, the rookery, which, during the continuance of winter, seemed to have been deserted, or only guarded by about five or six, like old soldiers in a garrison, now begins to be once more frequented; and in a short time, all the bustle and hurry of business will be fairly commenced.\"\n\nThe other passage which we take the liberty to quote at some length, is from an admirable paper in the \"Bee,\" and relates to the House Spider.\n\n\"Of all the solitary insects I have ever remarked, the spider is the most sagacious, and its motions to me, who have attentively considered them, seem almost to exceed belief. * * * I perceived, about four years ago, a large spider in one corner of my room making its web; and, though the maid frequently levelled her broom against the labours of the little animal, I had the good fortune then to prevent its destruction, and I may say it more than paid me by the entertainment afforded.\n\n\"In three days, the web was, with incredible diligence, completed; nor could I avoid thinking that the insect seemed to exult in its new abode. It frequently traversed it round, examined the strength of every part of it, retired into its hole, and came out very frequently. The first enemy, however, it had to encounter was another and a much larger spider, which, having no web of its own, and having probably exhausted\nall its stock in former labours of this kind, came to invade the property of its neighbour. Soon, then, a terrible encounter ensued, in which the invader seemed to have the victory, and the laborious spider was obliged to take refuge in its hole. Upon this I perceived the victor using every art to draw the enemy from its stronghold. He seemed to go off, but quickly returned; and when he found all arts in vain, began to demolish the new web without mercy. This brought on another battle, and, contrary to my expectations, the laborious spider became conqueror, and fairly killed his antagonist.\n\n\"Now, then, in peaceable possession of what was justly its own, it waited three days with the utmost impatience, repairing the breaches of its web, and taking no sustenance that I could perceive. At last, however, a large blue fly fell into the snare, and struggled hard to get loose. The spider gave it leave to entangle itself as much as possible, but it seemed to be too strong for the cobweb. I must own I was greatly surprised when I saw the spider immediately sally out, and, in less than a minute weave a new net round its captive, by which the motion of its wings was stopped; and, when it was fairly hampered in this manner, it was seized and dragged into the hole.\n\n\"In this manner it lived, in a precarious state; and nature seemed to have fitted it for such a life, for upon a single fly it subsisted for more than a week. I once put a wasp into the net; but when the spider came out in order to seize it as usual, upon perceiving what kind of an enemy it had to deal with, it instantly broke all the bands that held it fast, and contributed all that lay in its power to disengage so formidable an antagonist. When the wasp was set at liberty, I expected the spider would have set about repairing the breaches that were made in its net; but those, it seems, were irreparable: wherefore the cobweb was now entirely forsaken, and a new one begun, which was completed in the usual time.\n\n\"I had now a mind to try how many cobwebs a single spider could furnish, wherefore I destroyed this, and the insect set about another. When I destroyed the other also, its whole stock seemed entirely exhausted, and it could spin no more. The arts it made use of to support itself, now deprived of its great means of subsistence, were, indeed, surprising. I have seen it roll up its legs like a ball, and lie motionless for hours together, but cautiously watching all the time. When a fly happened to approach sufficiently near, it would dart out all at once, and often seize its prey.\n\n\"Of this life, however, it soon began to grow weary, and resolved to invade the possession of some other spider, since it could not make a web of its own. It formed an attack upon a neighbouring fortification with great vigour, and at first was as vigorously repulsed. Not daunted, however, with one defeat, in this manner it continued to lay siege to another's web for three days, and at length, having killed the defendant, actually took possession. When smaller flies happen to fall into the snare, the spider does not sally out at once, but very patiently waits till it is sure of them; for, upon his immediately approaching, the terror of his appearance might give the captive strength sufficient to get loose: the manner, then, is to wait patiently till, by ineffectual and impotent\nstruggles, the captive has wasted all its strength, and then he becomes a certain and easy conquest.\n\n\"The insect I am now describing lived three years; every year it changed its skin and got a new set of legs. I have sometimes plucked off a leg, which grew again in two or three days. At first it dreaded my approach to its web, but at last it became so familiar as to take a fly out of my hand; and, upon my touching any part of the web, would immediately leave its hole, prepared either for a defence or an attack.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nThe latter part of the year 1768 had been made memorable in the world of taste by the institution of the Royal Academy of Arts, under the patronage of the king, and the direction of forty of the most distinguished artists. Reynolds, who had been mainly instrumental in founding it, had been unanimously elected president, and had thereupon received the honour of knighthood.* Johnson was so delighted with his friend's elevation, that he broke through a rule of total abstinence with respect to wine, which he had maintained for several years, and drank bumpers on the occasion. Sir Joshua eagerly sought to associate his old and valued friends with him in his new honours, and it is supposed to be through his suggestions that, on the first establishment of professorships, which took place in December, 1769, Johnson was nominated to that of Ancient Literature, and Goldsmith to that of History. They were mere honorary titles, without emolument, but gave distinction, from the noble institution to which they appertained. They also gave the possessors honourable places at the annual banquet, at which were assembled many of the most distinguished persons of rank and talent, all proud to be classed among the patrons of the Arts.\n\nThe following letter of Goldsmith to his brother alludes to the foregoing appointment, and to a small legacy bequeathed to him by his uncle Contarine:\n\n* We must apologise for the anachronism we have permitted ourselves in the course of this memoir, in speaking of Reynolds as Sir Joshua, when treating of circumstances which occurred prior to his being dubbed; but it is so customary to speak of him by that title, that we found it difficult to dispense with it.\n\"To Mr. Maurice Goldsmith, at James Lawder's, Esq., at Kilmore, near Carrick-on-Shannon.\n\n\"January, 1770.\n\n\"Dear Brother,\u2014I should have answered your letter sooner, but, in truth, I am not fond of thinking of the necessities of those I love, when it is so very little in my power to help them. I am sorry to find you are every way unprovided for; and what adds to my uneasiness is, that I have received a letter from my sister Johnson, by which I learn that she is pretty much in the same circumstances. As to myself, I believe I think I could get both you and my poor brother-in-law something like that which you desire, but I am determined never to ask for little things, nor exhaust any little interest I may have, until I can serve you, him, and myself more effectually. As yet, no opportunity has offered; but I believe you are pretty well convinced that I will not be remiss when it arrives.\n\n\"The king has lately been pleased to make me Professor of Ancient History in the Royal Academy of Painting, which he has just established, but there is no salary annexed, and I took it rather as a compliment to the Institution than any benefit to myself. Honours to one in my situation are something like ruffles to one that wants a shirt.\n\n\"You tell me that there are fourteen or fifteen pounds left me in the hands of my cousin Lawder, and you ask me what I would have done with them. My dear brother, I would by no means give any directions to my dear worthy relations at Kilmore how to dispose of money which is, properly speaking, more theirs than mine. All that I say is, that I entirely, and this letter will serve to witness, give up any right and title to it; and I am sure they will dispose of it to the best advantage. To them I entirely leave it; whether they or you may think the whole necessary to fit you out, or whether our poor sister Johnson may not want the half, I leave entirely to their and your discretion. The kindness of that good couple to our shattered family, demands our sincerest gratitude; and, though they have almost forgotten me, yet, if good things at last arrive, I hope one day to return and increase their good humour by adding to my own.\n\n\"I have sent my cousin Jenny a miniature picture of myself, and believe it is the most acceptable present I can offer. I have ordered it to be left for her at George Faulkner's, folded in a letter. The face, you well know, is ugly enough, but it is finely painted. I will shortly also send my friends over the Shannon some mezzotinto prints of myself, and some more of my friends here, such as Burke, Johnson, Reynolds, and Colman. I believe I have written a hundred letters to different friends in your country, and never received an answer to any of them. I do not know how to account for this, or why they are unwilling to keep up with me those regards which I must ever retain for them.\n\n\"If, then, you have a mind to oblige me, you will write often, whether I answer you or not. Let me particularly have the news of our family, professors, and old acquaintances. For instance, you may begin by telling me...\"\nA SHATTERED FAMILY.\n\nJanuary, 1770.\n\nYour letter sooner, but, in the meantime, I am sorry to find you in such a state of uneasiness as to make me anxious for your welfare. You have been very kind to me, by which I learn that you are well aware of my situation. As to myself, I believe I am doing all in my power to help you out of your difficulties. I will not be remiss when opportunity offers; but until then, I will not be remiss when opportunity offers.\n\nI have been made Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy, which has just been opened. I have taken up residence there, and I took it rather as a favor than as a benefit to myself. Honours come easily to me, but they do not ruffle me.\n\nFifteen pounds left me in the hands of Maurice, whom I would have done anything for. He means any directions you may give him. I have no means to dispose of money which I do not need. All that I say is, that I am willing to lend you any money you may need, and I am sure you will be able to pay me back when you have the opportunity.\n\nI have ordered a miniature picture of myself, which I can offer. I have ordered a set of mezzotint prints of myself, and I will shortly send them to Burke, Johnson, Reynolds, and others. I have also ordered letters to different friends, but I have not yet received an answer to any of them. I do not know what you are unwilling to keep up with me, but I am sure you will be willing to keep up with me.\n\nAs to the rest of Goldsmith's relatives, he abandons his legacy of fifteen pounds to be shared amongst them. It is all he has to give. His heedless improvidence is eating up the money of the booksellers in advance. With all his literary success, he has neither money nor influence; but he has empty fame, and he is ready to participate with them; he is honorary professor, without pay: his portrait is to be engraved in mezzotint, in company with those of his friends, Burke, Reynolds, Johnson, Colman, and others, and he will send prints of\n\nYours, most affectionately,\n\nOLIVER GOLDSMITH.\n\nBy this letter, we find the Goldsmiths the same shifting, shiftless race as formerly; a \"shattered family,\" scrambling on each other's back as soon as any rise above the surface. Maurice is \"every way unprovided;\" living upon cousin Jane and her husband; and, perhaps, amusing himself by hunting otter in the river Inny. Sister Johnson and her husband are as poorly off as Maurice, with, perhaps, no one at hand to quarter themselves upon; as to the rest, \"what is become of them; where do they live; how do they do; what is become of Charles?\" What forlorn, hap-hazard life is implied by these questions! Can we wonder that, with all the love for his native place, which is shown throughout Goldsmith's writings, he had not the heart to return there? Yet his affections are still there. He wishes to know whether the Lawders (which means his cousin Jane, his early Valentine,) ever make mention of him; he sends Jane his miniature; he believes \"it is the most acceptable present he can offer;\" he evidently, therefore, does not believe she has almost forgotten him, although he intimates that he does; in his memory she is still Jane Contarine, as he last saw her, when he accompanied her harpsichord with his flute. Absence, like death, sets a seal on the image of those we have loved; we cannot realize the intervening changes, which time may have effected.\n\nAs to the rest of Goldsmith's relatives, he abandons his legacy of fifteen pounds to be shared amongst them. It is all he has to give. His heedless improvidence is eating up the money of the booksellers in advance. With all his literary success, he has neither money nor influence; but he has empty fame, and he is ready to participate with them; he is honorary professor, without pay: his portrait is to be engraved in mezzotint, in company with those of his friends, Burke, Reynolds, Johnson, Colman, and others, and he will send prints of\nthem to his friends over the Shannon, though they may not have a house to hang them up in. What a motley letter! How indicative of the motley character of the writer! By-the-by, the publication of a splendid mezzotinto engraving of his likeness by Reynolds was a great matter of glorification to Goldsmith, especially as it appeared in such illustrious company. As he was one day walking the streets in a state of high elation, from having just seen it figuring in the print-shop windows, he met a young gentleman with a newly-married wife hanging on his arm, whom he immediately recognised for Master Bishop, one of the boys he had petted and treated with sweetmeats when a humble usher at Milner's school. The kindly feelings of old times revived, and he accosted him with cordial familiarity, though the youth may have found some difficulty in recognising in the personage, arrayed, perhaps, in garments of Tyrian dye, the dingy pedagogue of the Milners. \"Come, my boy,\" cried Goldsmith, as if still speaking to a school-boy, \"Come, Sam, I am delighted to see you, I must treat you to something\u2014what shall it be? Will you have some apples?\" glancing at an old woman's stall; then, recollecting the print-shop window, \"Sam,\" said he, \"have you seen my picture, by Sir Joshua Reynolds? Have you seen it, Sam? Have you got an engraving?\" Bishop was caught; he equivocated: he had not yet bought it; but he was furnishing his house, and had fixed upon a place where it was to be hung. \"Ah, Sam!\" rejoined Goldsmith, reproachfully, \"if your picture had been published, I should not have waited an hour without having it.\"\n\nAfter all, it was honest pride, not vanity, in Goldsmith, that was gratified at seeing his portrait deemed worthy of being perpetuated by the classic pencil of Reynolds, and \"hung up in history\" beside that of his revered friend Johnson. Even the great moralist himself was not insensible to a feeling of this kind. Walking one day with Goldsmith, in Westminster Abbey, among the tombs of monarchs, warriors, and statesmen, they came to the sculptured mementoes of literary worthies in poets' corner. Casting his eye round upon these memorials of genius, Johnson muttered in a low tone to his companion,\n\n\"Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.\"\n\nGoldsmith treasured up the intimated hope, and shortly afterwards, as they were passing by Temple-bar, when...\nthoughts of home.\n\nthe heads of Jacobite rebels, executed for treason, were mouldering aloft on spikes, pointed up to the grizzly mementoes, and echoed the intimation,\n\n\"Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nSeveral years had now elapsed since the publication of \"The Traveller,\" and much wonder was expressed that the great success of that poem had not excited the author to further poetic attempts. On being questioned at the annual dinner of the Royal Academy by the Earl of Lisburn, why he neglected the muses to compile histories and write novels, \"My Lord,\" replied he, \"by courting the muses, I shall starve; but by my other labours I eat, drink, have good clothes, and can enjoy the luxuries of life.\" So, also, on being asked by a poor writer what was the most profitable mode of exercising the pen, \"My dear fellow,\" replied he, good-humouredly, \"pay no regard to the draggle-tailed muses; for my part, I have found productions in prose much more sought after, and better paid for.\"\n\nStill, however, as we have heretofore shown, he found sweet moments of dalliance to steal away from his prosaic toils, and court the muse among the green lanes and hedges in the rural environs of London, and on the 26th of May, 1770, he was enabled to bring his \"Deserted Village\" before the public.\n\nThe popularity of \"The Traveller\" had prepared the way for this poem, and its sale was instantaneous and immense. The first edition was immediately exhausted; in a few days a second was issued; in a few days more, a third; and by the 16th of August the fifth edition was hurried through the press. As is the case with popular writers, he had become his own rival, and critics were inclined to give the preference to his first poem; but with the public at large, we believe the \"Deserted Village\" has ever been the greatest favourite. Previous to its publication, the bookseller gave him in advance a note for the price agreed upon\u2014one hundred guineas. As the latter was returning home, he met a friend, to whom he mentioned the circumstance, and who, apparently judging of poetry by quantity rather than quality, observed that it was a\ngreat sum for so small a poem. \"In truth,\" said Goldsmith, \"I think so too; it is much more than the honest man can afford, or the piece is worth. I have not been easy since I received it.\" In fact, he actually returned the note to the bookseller, and left it to him to graduate the payment according to the success of the work. The bookseller, as may well be supposed, soon repaid him in full, with many acknowledgments of his disinterestedness. This anecdote has been called in question, we know not on what grounds; we see nothing in it incompatible with the character of Goldsmith, who was very impulsive, and prone to acts of inconsiderate generosity.\n\nAs we do not pretend, in this summary memoir, to go into a criticism or analysis of any of Goldsmith's writings, we shall not dwell upon the peculiar merits of this poem; we cannot help noticing, however, how truly it is a mirror of the author's heart, and of all the fond pictures of early friends and early life for ever present there. It seems to us as if the very last accounts received from home, of his \"shattered family,\" and the desolation that seemed to have settled upon the haunts of his childhood, had cut to the roots one feebly cherished hope, and produced the following exquisitely tender and mournful lines:\n\n\"In all my wand'ring round this world of care,\nIn all my griefs\u2014and God has giv'n my share\u2014\nI still had hopes my latest hours to crown,\nAmid these humble bowers to lay me down;\nTo husband out life's taper at the close,\nAnd keep the flame from wasting by repose:\nI still had hopes, for pride attends us still,\nAmid the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,\nAround my fire an ev'ning groupe to draw,\nAnd tell of all I felt and all I saw;\nAnd as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,\nPants to the place from which at first she flew;\nI still had hopes, my long vexations past,\nHere to return\u2014and die at home at last.\"\n\nHow touchingly expressive are the succeeding lines, wrung from a heart which all the trials, and temptations, and buffettings of the world could not render worldly; which, amid a thousand follies and errors of the head, still retained its childlike innocence; and which, doomed to struggle on to the last amidst the din and turmoil of the metropolis, had ever been cheating itself with a dream of rural quiet and seclusion:\n\" Oh, bless'd retirement! friend to life's decline,\nRetreats from care, that never must be mine,\nHow blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,\nA youth of labour with an age of ease;\nWho quits a world where strong temptations try,\nAnd, since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!\nFor him no wretches, born to work and weep,\nExplore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep:\nNor surly porter stands, in guilty state,\nTo spurn imploring famine from the gate;\nBut on he moves to meet his latter end,\nAngels around befriending virtue's friend;\nSinks to the grave with unperceived decay,\nWhile resignation gently slopes the way;\nAnd all his prospects brightening to the last,\nHis heaven commences ere the world be past.\"\n\nNOTE.\n\nThe following article, which appeared in a London periodical, shows the effect of Goldsmith's poem in renovating the fortunes of Lissoy.\n\n\"About three miles from Ballymahon, a very central town in the sister kingdom, is the mansion and village of Auburn, so called by their present possessor, Captain Hogan. Through the taste and improvement of this gentleman, it is now a beautiful spot, although fifteen years since it presented a very bare and unpictorial aspect. This, however, was owing to a cause which serves strongly to corroborate the assertion, that Goldsmith had this scene in view when he wrote his poem of 'The Deserted Village.' The then possessor, General Napier, turned all his tenants out of their farms that he might enclose them in his own private domain. Littleton, the mansion of the general, stands not far off, a complete emblem of the desolating spirit lamented by the poet, dilapidated, and converted into a barrack.\n\n\"The chief object of attraction is Lissoy, once the parsonage house of Henry Goldsmith, that brother to whom the poet dedicated his 'Traveller,' and who is represented as the village pastor,\n\n'Passing rich with forty pounds a year.'\n\n\"When I was in the country, the lower chambers were inhabited by pigs and sheep, and the drawing-rooms by oats. Captain Hogan, however, has, I believe, got it since into his possession, and has, of course, proved its condition.\n\n\"Though at first strongly inclined to dispute the identity of Auburn, Lissoy House overcame my scruples. As I clambered over the rotten gate, and crossed the grass-grown lawn or court, the tide of association became too strong for casuistry: here the poet dwelt and wrote, and here his thoughts fondly recurred when composing his 'Traveller' in a foreign land. Yonder was the decent church, that literally 'topped the neighbouring hill.' Before me lay the little hill of Knockrue, on\nwhich he declares, in one of his letters, he would rather sit with a book in hand than mingle in the proudest assemblies. And, above all, startlingly true, beneath my feet was\n\n'Yonder cope, where once the garden smiled,\nAnd still where many a garden-flower grows wild.'\n\n\"A painting from the life could not be more exact. 'The stubborn currant-bush' lifts its head above the rank grass, and the proud hollyhock flaunts where its sisters of the flower-knot are no more.\n\n\"In the middle of the village stands the old 'hawthorn-tree,' built up with masonry to distinguish and preserve it; it is old and stunted, and suffers much from the depredations of post-chaise travellers, who generally stop to procure a twig. Opposite to it is the village alehouse, over the door of which swings 'The Three Jolly Pigeons.' Within, everything is arranged according to the letter:\n\n'The whitewash'd wall, the nicely sanded floor,\nThe varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door:\nThe chest, contrived a double debt to pay,\nA bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;\nThe pictures placed for ornament and use,\nThe twelve good rules, the royal game of goose.'\n\n\"Captain Hogan, I have heard, found great difficulty in obtaining 'the twelve good rules,' but at length purchased them at some London bookstall to adorn the whitewashed parlour of 'The Three Jolly Pigeons.' However laudable this may be, nothing shook my faith in the reality of Auburn so much as this exactness, which had the disagreeable air of being got up for the occasion. The last object of pilgrimage is the quondam habitation of the schoolmaster:\n\n'There, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,\nIt is surrounded with fragrant proofs of identity in\n'The blossom'd furze, unprofitably gay.'\n\n\"There is to be seen the chair of the poet, which fell into the hands of its present possessors at the wreck of the parsonage-house; they have frequently refused large offers of purchase; but more, I dare say, for the sake of drawing contributions from the curious than from any reverence for the bard. The chair is of oak, with back and seat of cane, which precluded all hopes of a secret drawer, like that lately discovered in Gay's. There is no fear of its being worn out by the devout earnestness of sitters\u2014as the cocks and hens have usurped undisputed possession of it, and protest most clamorously against all attempts to get it cleansed, or to seat one's self.\n\n\"The controversy concerning the identity of this Auburn was formerly a standing theme of discussion among the learned of the neighbourhood; but since the pros and cons have been all ascertained, the argument has died away. Its abettors plead the singular agreement between the local history of the place and the Auburn of the poem, and the exactness with which the scenery of the one answers to the description of the other. To this is opposed the mention of the nightingale,\"\nAnd fill'd each pause the nightingale had made;\nthere being no such bird in the island. The objection is slighted, on\nthe other hand, by considering the passage as a mere poetical licence.\n'Besides,' say they, 'the robin is the Irish nightingale.' And if it\nbe hinted how unlikely it was that Goldsmith should have laid the\nscene in a place from which he was, and had been so long absent, the\nrejoinder is always, 'Pray, sir, was Milton in hell when he built Pan-\ndemonium?'\n\n\"The line is naturally drawn between; there can be no doubt that the\npoet intended England by\n\n'The land to hast'ning ills a prey,\nWhere wealth accumulates and men decay.'\n\nBut it is very natural to suppose that, at the same time, his imagination\nhad in view the scenes of his youth, which give such strong features of\nresemblance to the picture.\"\n\nBest, an Irish clergyman, told Davis, the traveller in\nAmerica, that the hawthorn-bush, mentioned in the poem,\nwas still remarkably large. \"I was riding once,\" said he,\n\"with Brady, titular Bishop of Ardagh, when he observed to\nme, 'Ma foy, Best, this huge overgrown bush is mightily in\nthe way. I will order it to be cut down.'\u2014'What, sir!' re-\nplied I, 'cut down the bush that supplices so beautiful an\nimage in 'The Deserted Village?'\u2014'Ma foy!' exclaimed\nthe bishop, 'is that the hawthorn-bush? Then let it be\nsacred from the edge of the axe, and evil be to him that\nshould cut off a branch.'\" The hawthorn-bush, however,\nhas long since been cut up, root and branch, in furnishing\nrelics to literary pilgrims.\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\"The Deserted Village\" had shed an additional poetio\ngrace round the homely person of the author; he was be-\ncoming more and more acceptable in ladies' eyes, and finding\nhimself more and more at ease in their society; at least in\nthe society of those whom he met in the Reynolds' circle,\namong whom he particularly affected the beautiful family of\nthe Hornecks.\n\nBut let us see what were really the looks and manners of\nGoldsmith about this time, and what right he had to aspire\nto ladies' smiles; and, in so doing, let us not take the sketches\nof Boswell and his compars, who had a propensity to repro-\nsent him in caricature; but let us take the apparently truthful and discriminating picture of him as he appeared to Judge Day, when the latter was a student in the Temple.\n\n\"In person,\" says the judge, \"he was short; about five feet five or six inches; strong, but not heavy in make; rather fair in complexion, with brown hair; such, at least, as could be distinguished from his wig. His features were plain, but not repulsive\u2014certainly not so when lighted up by conversation. His manners were simple, natural, and perhaps on the whole, we may say, not polished; at least, without the refinement and good-breeding which the exquisite polish of his compositions would lead us to expect. He was always cheerful and animated, often, indeed, boisterous in his mirth; entered with spirit into convivial society; contributed largely to its enjoyments by solidity of information, and the na\u00efvet\u00e9 and originality of his character, talked often without premeditation, and laughed loudly, without restraint.\"\n\nThis, it will be recollected, represents him as he appeared to a young Templar, who probably saw him only in Temple coffee-houses, at students' quarters, or at the jovial supper-parties given at the poet's own chambers; here, of course, his mind was in its rough dress; his laugh may have been loud, and his mirth boisterous; but we trust all these matters became softened and modified when he found himself in polite drawing-rooms, and in female society.\n\nBut what say the ladies themselves of him? and here, fortunately, we have another sketch of him, as he appeared at the time to one of the Horneck circle\u2014in fact, we believe, to the Jessamy Bride herself. After admitting, apparently with some reluctance, that \"he was a very plain man,\" she goes on to say, \"but had he been much more so, it was impossible not to love and respect his goodness of heart, which broke out on every occasion. His benevolence was unquestionable, and his countenance bore every trace of it: no one that knew him intimately, could avoid admiring and loving his good qualities.\" When to all this we add the idea of intellectual delicacy and refinement associated with him by his poetry, and the newly-plucked bays that were flourishing round his brow, we cannot be surprised that fine and fashionable ladies should be proud of his attentions, and that even a young beauty should not be altogether displeased with the thoughts of having a man of his genius in her chains.\nWe are led to indulge some notions of the kind from finding him in the month of July, but a few weeks after the publication of the \"Deserted Village,\" setting off on a six weeks' excursion to Paris, in company with Mrs. Horneck and her two beautiful daughters. A day or two before his departure, we find another new gala suit charged to him on the books of Mr. William Filby. Were the bright eyes of the Jessamy Bride responsible for this additional extravagance of wardrobe? Goldsmith had recently been editing the works of Parnell; had he taken courage from the example of Edwin, in the Fairy tale?\n\n\"Yet spite of all that nature did\nTo make his uncouth form forbid,\nThis creature dared to love,\nHe felt the force of Edith's eyes,\nNor wanted hope to gain the prize\nCould ladies look within\u2014\u2014\"\n\nAll this we throw out as mere hints and surmises, leaving it to our readers to draw their own conclusions. It will be found, however, that the poet was subjected to shrewd bantering among his contemporaries about the beautiful Mary Horneck, and that he was extremely sensitive on the subject.\n\nIt was in the month of June that he set out for Paris with his fair companions, and the following letter was written by him to Sir Joshua Reynolds, soon after the party landed at Calais:\n\n\"My dear Friend.\u2014We had a very quick passage from Dover to Calais, which we performed in three hours and twenty minutes, all of us extremely sea-sick, which must necessarily have happened, as my machine to prevent sea-sickness was not completed. We were glad to leave Dover, because we hated to be imposed upon; so were in high spirits at coming to Calais, where we were told that a little money would go a great way.\n\n\"Upon landing, with two little trunks, which v. all we carried with us, we were surprised to see fourteen or fifteen fellows all running down to the ship to lay their hands upon them; four got under each trunk, the rest surrounded and held the hasps; and in this manner, our little baggage was conducted with a kind of funeral solemnity, till it was safely lodged at the custom-house. We were well enough pleased with the people's civility till they came to be paid; every creature that had the happiness of but touching our trunks with their finger expected sixpence; and they had so pretty and civil a manner of demanding it, that there was no refusing them.\n\n\"When we had done with the porters, we had next to speak with the custom-house officers, who had their pretty civil way too. We were...\"\ndirected to the H\u00f4tel d'Angleterre, where a valet-de-place came to offer his service, and spoke to me ten minutes before I once found out that he was speaking English. We had no occasion for his services, so we gave him a little money because he spoke English, and because he wanted it. I cannot help mentioning another circumstance: I bought a new ribbon for my wig at Canterbury, and the barber at Calais broke it, in order to gain sixpence by buying me a new one.\"\n\nAn incident which occurred in the course of this tour has been tortured by that literary magpie, Boswell, into a proof of Goldsmith's absurd jealousy of any admiration shown to others in his presence. While stopping at an hotel in Lisle, they were drawn to the windows by a military parade in front. The extreme beauty of the Miss Hornecks immediately attracted the attention of the officers, who broke forth with enthusiastic speeches and compliments intended for their ears. Goldsmith was amused for awhile, but at length affected impatience at this exclusive admiration of his beautiful companions, and exclaimed with mock severity of aspect, \"Elsewhere I also would have my admirers.\"\n\nIt is difficult to conceive the obtuseness of intellect necessary to misconstrue so obvious a piece of mock petulance and dry humour, into an instance of mortified vanity and jealous self-conceit.\n\nGoldsmith jealous of the admiration of a group of gay officers for the charms of two beautiful young women! This even out-Boswells Boswell; yet this is but one of several similar absurdities, evidently misconceptions of Goldsmith's peculiar vein of humour, by which the charge of envious jealousy has been attempted to be fixed upon him. In the present instance, it was contradicted by one of the ladies herself, who was annoyed that it had been advanced against him. \"I am sure,\" said she, \"from the peculiar manner of his humour, and assumed frown of countenance, what was often uttered in jest was mistaken, by those who did not know him, for earnest.\" No one was more prone to err on this point than Boswell. He had a tolerable perception of wit, but none of humour.\n\nThe following letter to Sir Joshua Reynolds was subsequently written:\n\n\"To Sir Joshua Reynolds.\n\n\"Paris, July 29, (1770.)\n\n\"My dear friend,\u2014I began a long letter to you from Lisle, giving a description of all that we had done and seen, but finding it very dull, and knowing that you would show it again, I threw it aside, and it was\nlost. You see by the top of this letter that we are at Paris, and (as I have often heard you say) we have brought our own amusement with us, for the ladies do not seem to be very fond of what we have yet seen.\n\n\"With regard to myself, I find that travelling at twenty and forty are very different things. I set out with all my confirmed habits about me, and can find nothing on the continent so good as when I formerly left it. One of our chief amusements here is scolding at everything we meet with, and praising everything and every person we left at home. You may judge, therefore, whether your name is not frequently bandied at table among us. To tell you the truth, I never thought I could regret your absence so much as our various mortifications on the road have often taught me to do. I could tell you of disasters and adventures without number; of our lying in barns, and of my being half-poisoned with a dish of green peas; of our quarrelling with postilions, and being cheated by our landladies; but I reserve all this for a happy hour which I expect to share with you upon my return.\n\n\"I have little to tell you more but that we are at present all well, and expect returning when we have stayed out one month, which I did not care if it were over this very day. I long to hear from you all, how you yourself do, how Johnson, Burke, Dyer, Chamier, Colman, and every one of the club do. I wish I could send you some amusement in this letter, but I protest I am so stupefied by the air of this country (for I am sure it cannot be natural) tha' I have not a word to say. I have been thinking of the plot of a comedy, which shall be entitled 'A Journey to Paris,' in which a family shall be introduced with a full intention of going to France to save money. You know there is not a place in the world more promising for that purpose. As for the meat of this country, I can scarce eat it; and, though we pay two good shillings a-head for our dinner, I find it all so tough, that I spend less time with my knife than my toothpick. I said this as a good thing at the table, but it was not understood. I believe it to be a good thing.\n\n\"As for our intended journey to Devonshire, I find it out of my power to perform it; for, as soon as I arrive at Dover, I intend to let the ladies go on, and I will take a country lodging somewhere near that place in order to do some business. I have so outrun the constable that I must mortify a little to bring it up again. For God's sake, the night you receive this, take your pen in your hand and tell me something about yourself and myself, if you know anything that has happened. About Miss Reynolds, about Mr. Bickerstaff, my nephew, or anybody that you regard. I beg you will send to Griffin, the bookseller, to know if there be any letters left for me, and be so good as to send them to me at Paris. They may, perhaps, be left for me at the Porter's Lodge, opposite the pump in Temple Lane. The same messenger will do. I expect one from Lord Claro from Ireland. As for the others, I am not much uneasy about.\n\nIs there anything I can do for you at Paris? I wish you would tell me. The whole of my own purchases here is one silk coat, which I have put on, and which makes me look like a fool. But no more of that. I find that Colman has gained his lawsuit. I am glad of it. I suppose\nyou often meet. I will soon be among you, better pleased with my situation at home than I ever was before. And yet I must say, that if anything could make France pleasant, the very good women with whom I am at present would certainly do it. I could say more about that, but I intend showing them the letter before I send it away. What signifies teasing you longer with moral observations, when the business of my writing is over? I have one thing only more to say, and of that I think every hour in the day, namely, that I am your most sincere and most affectionate friend,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\n\n\"Direct to me at the H\u00f4tel de Danemarc,\nRue Jacob, Fauxbourg St. Germain.\"\n\nA word of comment on this letter:\n\nTravelling is, indeed, a very different thing with Goldsmith the poor student at twenty, and Goldsmith, the poet and professor at forty. At twenty, though obliged to trudge on foot from town to town, and country to country, paying for a supper and a bed by a tune on the flute, everything pleased, everything was good; a truckle-bed in a garret was a couch of down, and the homely fare of the peasant a feast fit for an epicure. Now, at forty, when he posts through the country in a carriage, with fair ladies by his side, everything goes wrong: he has to quarrel with postillions, he is cheated by landladies, the hotels are barns, the meat is too tough to be eaten, and he is half-poisoned by green peas! A line in his letter explains the secret: \"the ladies do not seem to be very fond of what we have yet seen.\" \"One of our chief amusements is scolding at everything we meet with, and praising everything and every person we have left at home!\" The true English travelling amusement. Poor Goldsmith! he has \"all his confirmed habits about him;\" that is to say, he has recently risen into high life, and acquired high-bred notions; he must be fastidious like his fellow travellers; he dare not be pleased with what pleased the vulgar tastes of his youth. He is unconsciously illustrating the trait so humorously satirized by him in Bill Tibbs, the shabby beau, who can find \"no such dressing as he had at Lord Crump's, or Lady Crimp's;\" whose very senses have grown genteel, and who no longer \"smacks at wretched wine or praises detestable custard.\" A lurking thorn, too, is worrying him throughout this tour; he has \"outrun the constable;\" that is to say, his expenses have outrun his means, and he will have to make up for this butterfly flight by toiling like a grub on his return.\nAnother circumstance contributes to mar the pleasure he had promised himself in this excursion. At Paris, the party is unexpectedly joined by a Mr. Hickey, a bustling attorney, who is well acquainted with that metropolis and its environs, and insists on playing the cicerone on all occasions. He and Goldsmith do not relish each other, and they have several petty altercations. The lawyer is too much a man of business and method for the careless poet, and is disposed to manage everything. He has perceived Goldsmith's whimsical peculiarities without properly appreciating his merits, and is prone to indulge in broad bantering and raillery at his expense, particularly irksome if indulged in presence of the ladies. He makes himself merry, on his return to England, by giving the following anecdote as illustrative of Goldsmith's vanity:\n\n\"Being with a party at Versailles, viewing the waterworks, a question arose among the gentlemen present, whether the distance from whence they stood to one of the little islands was within the compass of a leap. Goldsmith maintained the affirmative; but, being bantered on the subject, and remembering his former prowess as a youth, attempted the leap, but, falling short, descended into the water, to the great amusement of the company.\"\n\nWas the Jessamy bride a witness of this unlucky exploit? This same Hickey is the one of whom Goldsmith, some time subsequently, gave a good-humoured sketch, in his poem of \"The Retaliation.\"\n\n\"Here Hickey reclines, a most blunt, pleasant creature,\nAnd slander itself must allow him good nature;\nHe cherished his friend, and he relished a bumper,\nYet one fault he had, and that one was a thumper.\nPerhaps you may ask if the man was a miser;\nI answer No, no, for he always was wiser;\nToo courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat,\nHis very worst foe can't accuse him of that;\nPerhaps he confided in men as they go,\nAnd so was too foolishly honest? Ah, no;\nThen what was his failing? Come, tell it, and burn ye\u2014\nHe was, could he help it! a special attorney.\"\n\nOne of the few remarks extant made by Goldsmith during his tour is the following, of whimsical import, in his \"Animated Nature.\"\n\n\"In going through the towns of France, some time since, I could not help observing how much plainer their parrots\nspoke than ours, and how very distinctly I understood their parrots speak French, when I could not understand our own though they spoke my native language. I at first ascribed it to the different qualities of the two languages, and was for entering into an elaborate discussion on the vowels and consonants, but a friend that was with me solved the difficulty at once, by assuring me that the French women scarce did anything else the whole day than sit and instruct their feathered pupils; and that the birds were thus distinct in their lessons in consequence of continual schooling.\"\n\nHis tour does not seem to have left in his memory the most fragrant recollections; for being asked, after his return, whether travelling on the Continent repaid \"an Englishman for the privations and annoyances attendant on it,\" he replied, \"I recommend it by all means to the sick, if they are without the sense of smelling, and to the poor, if they are without the sense of feeling; and to both if they can discharge from their minds all idea of what in England we term comfort.\"\n\nIt is needless to say, that the universal improvement in the art of living on the Continent has at the present day taken away the force of Goldsmith's reply, though even at the time it was more humorous than correct.\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nOn his return to England, Goldsmith received the melancholy tidings of the death of his mother. Notwithstanding the fame as an author to which he had attained, she seems to have been disappointed in her early expectations from him. Like others of his family, she had been more vexed by his early follies than pleased by his proofs of genius; and in subsequent years, when he had risen to fame and to intercourse with the great, had been annoyed at the ignorance of the world, and want of management, which prevented him from pushing his fortune. He had always, however, been an affectionate son, and in the latter years of her life, when she had become blind, contributed from his precarious resources to prevent her from feeling want.\n\nHe now resumed the labours of the pen, which his recent excursion to Paris rendered doubly necessary. We should have mentioned a \"Life of Parnell,\" published by him shortly after the \"Deserted Village.\" It was, as usual, a\npiece of job-work, hastily got up for pocket-money. Johnson spoke slightingly of it, and the author himself thought proper to apologize for its meagreness; yet, in so doing, used a simile, which, for beauty of imagery, and felicity of language, is enough of itself to stamp a value upon the essay.\n\n\"Such,\" says he, \"is the very unpoetical detail of the life of a poet. Some dates, and some few facts, scarcely more interesting than those that make the ornaments of a country tombstone, are all that remain of one, whose labours now begin to excite universal curiosity. A poet, while living, is seldom an object sufficiently great to attract much attention; his real merits are known but to a few, and these are generally sparing in their praises. When his fame is increased by time, it is then too late to investigate the peculiarities of his disposition; the dews of morning are past, and we vainly try to continue the chase by the meridian splendour.\"\n\nHe now entered into an agreement with Davies to prepare an abridgment, in one volume duodecimo, of his \"History of Rome;\" but first to write a work for which there was a more immediate demand. Davies was about to republish Lord Bolingbroke's \"Dissertation on Parties,\" which he conceived would be exceedingly applicable to the affairs of the day, and make a probable hit during the existing state of violent political excitement; to give it still greater effect and currency, he engaged Goldsmith to introduce it with a prefatory life of Lord Bolingbroke.\n\nAbout this time, Goldsmith's friend and countryman, Lord Clare, was in great affliction, caused by the death of his only son, Colonel Nugent, and stood in need of the sympathies of a kind-hearted friend. At his request, therefore, Goldsmith paid him a visit at his noble seat of Gosford, taking his tasks with him. Davies was in a worry lest Gosford Park should prove a Capua to the poet, and the time be lost. \"Dr. Goldsmith,\" writes he to a friend, \"has gone with Lord Clare into the country, and I am plagued to get the proofs from him of the 'Life of Lord Bolingbroke.'\" The proofs, however, were furnished in time for the publication of the work in December. The biography, though written during a time of political turmoil, and introducing a work intended to be thrown into the arena of politics, maintained that freedom from party prejudice observable in all the writings of Goldsmith. It was a selection of facts, drawn from many unreadable sources, and\narranged into a clear, flowing narrative, illustrative of the career and character of one, who, as he intimates, \"seemed formed by nature to take delight in struggling with opposition; whose most agreeable hours were passed in storms of his own creating; whose life was spent in a continual conflict of politics, and, as if that was too short for the combat, has left his memory as a subject of lasting contention.\" The sum received by the author for this memoir, is supposed, from circumstances, to have been forty pounds.\n\nGoldsmith did not find the residence among the great unattended with mortifications. He had now become accustomed to be regarded in London as a literary lion, and was annoyed, at what he considered a slight on the part of Lord Camden. He complained of it on his return to town at a party of his friends. \"I met him,\" said he, \"at Lord Clare's house in the country; and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man.\" \"The company,\" says Boswell, \"laughed heartily at this piece of 'diverting simplicity.'\" And foremost among the laughers was doubtless the rattle-pated Boswell. Johnson, however, stepped forward, as usual, to defend the poet, whom he would allow no one to assail but himself; perhaps in the present instance he thought the dignity of literature itself involved in this question. \"Nay, gentlemen,\" roared he, \"Dr. Goldsmith is in the right. A nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as Goldsmith, and I think it is much against Lord Camden that he neglected him.\"\n\nAfter Goldsmith's return to town, he received from Lord Clare a present of game, which he has celebrated and perpetuated in his amusing verses, entitled the \"Haunch of Venison.\" Some of the lines pleasantly set forth the embarrassment caused by the appearance of such an aristocratic delicacy in the humble kitchen of a poet, accustomed to look up to mutton as a treat:\n\n\"Thanks, my lord, for your venison; for finer or fatter\nNever rang'd in a forest, or smok'd in a platter:\nThe haunch was a picture for painters to study,\nThe fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy;\nThough my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting,\nTo spoil such a delicate picture by eating;\nI had thought in my chambers to place it in view,\nTo be shown to my friends as a piece of vertu;\"\nDINNER AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY.\n\nAs in some Irish houses where things are so-so,\nOne gammon of bacon hangs up for a show;\nBut for eating a rasher, of what they take pride in,\nThey'd as soon think of eating the pan it was fry'd in.\n\n* * *\n\nBut hang it\u2014to poets, who seldom can eat,\nYour very good mutton's a very good treat;\nSuch dainties to them, their health it might hurt;\nIt's like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.\"\n\nWe have an amusing anecdote of one of Goldsmith's blunders, which took place on a subsequent visit to Lord Clare's, when that nobleman was residing in Bath.\n\nLord Clare and the Duke of Northumberland had houses next to each other, of similar architecture. Returning home one morning from an early walk, Goldsmith, in one of his frequent fits of absence, mistook the house, and walked up into the duke's dining-room, where he and the duchess were about to sit down to breakfast. Goldsmith, still supposing himself in the house of Lord Clare, and that they were visitors, made them an easy salutation, being acquainted with them, and threw himself on a sofa in the lounging manner of a man perfectly at home. The duke and duchess soon perceived his mistake, and while they smiled internally, endeavoured, with the considerateness of well-bred people, to prevent any awkward embarrassment. They accordingly chattered sociably with him about matters in Bath, until, breakfast being served, they invited him to partake. The truth at once flashed upon poor, heedless Goldsmith; he started up from his free-and-easy position, made a confused apology for his blunder, and would have retired, perfectly disconcerted, had not the duke and duchess treated the whole as a lucky occurrence to throw him in their way, and exacted a promise from him to dine with them.\n\nThis may be hung up as a companion-piece to his blunder on his first visit to Northumberland House.\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nOn St. George's day of this year (1771), the first annual banquet of the Royal Academy was held in the exhibition room, the walls of which were covered with works of art, about to be submitted to public inspection. Sir Joshua Rey-\nnolds, who first suggested this elegant festival, presided in his official character; Drs. Johnson and Goldsmith, of course, were present, as professors of the academy; and besides the academicians, there was a large number of the most distinguished men of the day as guests. Goldsmith on this occasion drew on himself the attention of the company, by launching out with enthusiasm on the poems recently given to the world by Chatterton, as the works of an ancient author by the name of Rowley, discovered in the tower of Redcliffe Church, at Bristol. Goldsmith spoke of them with rapture, as a treasure of old English poetry. This immediately raised the question of their authenticity, they having been pronounced a forgery of Chatterton's. Goldsmith was warm for their being genuine. When he considered, he said, the merit of the poetry, the acquaintance with life and the human heart displayed in them, the antique quaintness of the language, and the familiar knowledge of historical events of their supposed day, he could not believe it possible they could be the work of a boy of sixteen, of narrow education, and confined to the duties of an attorney's office. They must be the productions of Rowley.\n\nJohnson, who was a stout unbeliever in Rowley, as he had been in Ossian, rolled in his chair, and laughed at the enthusiasm of Goldsmith. Horace Walpole, who sat near by, joined in the laugh and jeer as soon as he found that the \"trouvaille,\" as he called it, \"of his friend Chatterton\" was in question. This matter, which had excited the simple admiration of Goldsmith, was no novelty to him, he said. \"He might, had he pleased, have had the honour of ushering the great discovery to the learned world.\" And so he might, had he followed his first impulse in the matter, for he himself had been an original believer; had pronounced some specimen verses sent to him by Chatterton wonderful for their harmony and spirit; and had been ready to print them and publish them to the world with his sanction. When he found, however, that his unknown correspondent was a mere boy, humble in sphere, and indigent in circumstances, and when Gray and Mason pronounced the poems forgeries, he had changed his whole conduct towards the unfortunate author, and by his neglect and coldness, had dashed all his sanguine hopes to the ground.\n\nExulting in his superior discernment, this cold-hearted man of society now went on to divert himself, as he says, with the\ncredulity of Goldsmith, whom he was accustomed to pronounce \"an inspired idiot;\" but his mirth was soon dashed, for on asking the poet what had become of Chatterton, he was answered, doubtless in the feeling tone of one who had experienced the pangs of desponding genius, that \"he had been to London, and had destroyed himself.\"\n\nThe reply struck a pang of self-reproach even to the cold heart of Walpole; a faint blush may have visited his cheek at his recent levity. \"The persons of honour and veracity who were present,\" said he, in after years, when he found it necessary to exculpate himself from the charge of heartless neglect of genius, \"will attest with what surprise and concern I thus first heard of his death.\" Well might he feel concern. His cold neglect had doubtless contributed to madden the spirit of that youthful genius, and hurry him towards his untimely end; nor have all the excuses and palliations of Walpole's friends and admirers been ever able entirely to clear this stigma from his fame.\n\nBut what was there in the enthusiasm and credulity of honest Goldsmith in this matter, to subject him to the laugh of Johnson, or the railery of Walpole? Granting the poems were not ancient, were they not good? Granting they were not the production of Rowley, were they the less admirable for being the productions of Chatterton? Johnson himself testified to their merits, and the genius of their composer, when, some years afterwards, he visited the tower of Redcliffe Church, and was shown the coffer in which poor Chatterton had pretended to find them. \"This,\" said he, \"is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge. It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things.\"\n\nAs to Goldsmith, he persisted in his credulity, and had subsequently a dispute with Dr. Percy on the subject, which interrupted and almost destroyed their friendship. After all, his enthusiasm was of a generous, poetic kind; the poems remain beautiful monuments of genius, and it is even now difficult to persuade oneself that they could be entirely the productions of a youth of sixteen.\n\nIn the month of August, was published anonymously the History of England, on which Goldsmith had been for some time employed. It was in four volumes, compiled chiefly, as he acknowledged in the preface, from Rapin, Carle, Smollett, and Hume, \"each of whom,\" says he, \"have their admirers,\nin proportion as the reader is studious in political antiquities, fond of minute anecdote, a warm partisan, or a deliberate reasoner.\" It possessed the same kind of merit as his other historical compilations; a clear, succinct narrative, a simple, easy, and graceful style, and an agreeable arrangement of facts; but was not remarkable for either depth of observation, or minute accuracy of research. Many passages were transferred, with little if any alteration, from his \"Letters from a Nobleman to his Son\" on the same subject. The work, though written without party feeling, met with sharp animadversions from political scribblers. The writer was charged with being unfriendly to liberty, disposed to elevate monarchy above its proper sphere; a tool of ministers; one who would betray his country for a pension. Tom Davies, the publisher, the pompous little bibliopole of Russell-street, alarmed lest the work should prove unsaleable, undertook to protect it by his pen, and wrote a long article in its defence in \"The Public Advertiser.\" He was vain of his critical effusion, and sought by nods, and winks, and inuendoes to intimate his authorship. \"Have you seen,\" said he, in a letter to a friend, \"'An Impartial Account of Goldsmith's History of England?' If you want to know who was the writer of it, you will find him in Russell-street;\u2014but, mum!\"\n\nThe history, on the whole, however, was well received; some of the critics declared that English history had never before been so usefully, so elegantly, and agreeably epitomized, \"and, like his other historical writings, it has kept its ground\" in English literature.\n\nGoldsmith had intended this summer, in company with Sir Joshua Reynolds, to pay a visit to Bennet Langton, at his seat in Lincolnshire, where he was settled in domestic life, having the year previously married the Countess Dowager of Rothes. The following letter, however, dated from his chambers in the Temple, on the 7th of September, apologizes for putting off the visit, while it gives an amusing account of his summer occupations, and of the attacks of the critics on his \"History of England,\"\n\n\"My Dear Sir,\u2014Since I had the pleasure of seeing you last, I have been almost wholly in the country, at a farmer's house, quite alone, trying to write a comedy. It is now finished; but when or how it will be acted, or whether it will be acted at all, are questions I cannot resolve. I am, therefore, so much employed upon that, that I am under the\nnecessity of putting off my intended visit to Lincolnshire for this season. Reynolds is just returned from Paris, and finds himself now in the case of a truant that must make up for his idle time by diligence. We have, therefore, agreed to postpone our journey till next summer, when we hope to have the honour of waiting upon Lady Rothes and you, and staying double the time of our late intended visit. We often meet, and never without remembering you. I see Mr. Beauchere very often both in town and country. He is now going directly forward to become a second Boyle; deep in chemistry and physics. Johnson has been down on a visit to a country parson, Dr. Taylor; and is returned to his old haunts at Mrs. Thrale's. Burke is a farmer, an attendant a better place; but visiting about too. Every soul is visiting about, and merry but myself; and that is hard, too, as I have been trying these three months to do something to make people laugh. There have I been strolling about the hedges, studying jests with a most tragic countenance. The 'Natural History' is about half-finished, and I will shortly finish the rest. God knows, I am tired of this kind of finishing, which is but bungling work; and that not so much my fault as the fault of my scurvy circumstances. They begin to talk in town of the Opposition's gaining ground; the cry of liberty is still as loud as ever. I have published, or Davies has published for me an 'Abridgment of the History of England,' for which I have been a good deal abused in the newspapers, for betraying the liberties of the people. God knows I had no thought for or against liberty in my head; my whole aim being to make up a book of a decent size, that, as 'Squire Richard says, 'would do no harm to nobody.' However, they set me down as an arrant Tory, and consequently an honest man. When you come to look at any part of it, you'll say that I am a sore Whig. God bless you, and with my most respectful compliments to her ladyship, I remain, dear sir, your most affectionate, humble servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nThough Goldsmith found it impossible to break from his literary occupations to visit Bennet Langton, in Lincolnshire, he soon yielded to attractions from another quarter, in which somewhat of sentiment may have mingled. Miss Catherine Horneck, one of his beautiful fellow travellers, otherwise called Little Comedy, had been married in August to Henry William Bunbury, Esq., a gentleman of fortune, who has become celebrated for the humorous productions of his pencil. Goldsmith was shortly afterwards invited to pay the newly married couple a visit at their seat, at Barton, in Suffolk. How could he resist such an invitation\u2014especially as the Jeasamy Bride would, of course, be among the guests? It is true,\nhe was hampered with work; he was still more hampered with debt; his accounts with Newbery were perplexed; but all must give way. New advances are procured from Newbery on the promise of a new tale in the style of the Vicar of Wakefield, of which he showed him a few roughly-sketched chapters; so, his purse replenished in the old way, \"by hook or by crook,\" he posted off to visit the bride at Barton. He found there a joyous household, and one where he was welcomed with affection. Garrick was there, and played the part of master of the revels, for he was an intimate friend of the master of the house. Notwithstanding early misunderstandings, a social intercourse between the actor and the poet had grown up of late, from meeting together continually in the same circle. A few particulars have reached us concerning Goldsmith while on this happy visit. We believe the legend has come down from Miss Mary Horneck herself.\n\n\"While at Barton,\" she says, \"his manners were always playful and amusing, taking the lead in promoting any scheme of innocent mirth, and usually prefacing the invitation with 'Come, now, let us play the fool a little.' At cards, which was commonly a round game, and the stake small, he was always the most noisy, affected great eagerness to win, and teased his opponents of the gentler sex with continual jest and banter on their want of spirit in not risking the hazard of the game. But one of his most favourite enjoyments was to romp with the children, when he threw off all reserve, and seemed one of the most joyous of the group.\n\n\"One of the means by which he amused us was his songs, chiefly of the comic kind, which were sung with some taste and humour: several, I believe, were of his own composition, and I regret that I neither have copies, which might have been readily procured from him at the time, nor do I remember their names.\"\n\nHis perfect good humour made him the object of tricks of all kinds; often in retaliation of some prank which he himself had played off. Unluckily these tricks were sometimes made at the expense of his toilet, which, with a view peradventure to please the eye of a certain fair lady, he had again enriched to the impoverishment of his purse. \"Being at all times gay in his dress,\" says this lady-like legend, \"he made his appearance at the breakfast-table in a smart black silk coat with an expensive pair of ruffles; the coat some one contrived to soil,\nand it was sent to be cleansed; but, either by accident, or probably by design, the day after it came home the sleeves became daubed with paint, which was not discovered until the ruffles also, to his great mortification, were irretrievably disfigured.\n\n\"He always wore a wig, a peculiarity which those who judge of his appearance only from the fine poetical head of Reynolds would not suspect; and on one occasion, some person contrived seriously to injure this important adjunct to dress. It was the only one he had in the country, and the misfortune seemed irreparable until the services of Mr. Bunbury's valet were called in, who, however, performed his functions so indifferently, that poor Goldsmith's appearance became the signal for a general smile.\"\n\nThis was wicked waggery, especially when it was directed to mar all the attempts of the unfortunate poet to improve his personal appearance, about which he was at all times dubiously sensitive, and particularly when among the ladies.\n\nWe have in a former chapter recorded his unlucky tumble into a fountain at Versailles, when attempting a feat of agility in presence of the fair Hornecks. Water was destined to be equally baneful to him on the present occasion. \"Some difference of opinion,\" says the fair narrator, \"having arisen with Lord Harrington respecting the depth of a pond, the poet remarked that it was not so deep but that, if anything valuable was to be found at the bottom, he would not hesitate to pick it up. His lordship, after some banter, threw in a guinea; Goldsmith, not to be outdone in this kind of bravado, in attempting to fulfil his promise without getting wet, accidentally fell in, to the amusement of all present, but persevered, brought out the money, and kept it, remarking that he had abundant objects on whom to bestow any further proofs of his lordship's whim or bounty.\"\n\nAll this is recorded by the beautiful Mary Horneck, the Jessamy Bride herself; but while she gives these amusing pictures of poor Goldsmith's eccentricities, and of the mischievous pranks played off upon him, she bears unqualified testimony, which we have quoted elsewhere, to the qualities of his head and heart, which shone forth in his countenance, and gained him the love of all who knew him.\n\nAmong the circumstances of this visit, vaguely called to mind by this fair lady in after years, was, that Goldsmith\nread to her and her sister the first part of a novel which he had in hand. It was doubtless the manuscript mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, on which he had obtained an advance of money from Newbery to stave off some pressing debts, and to provide funds for this very visit. It never was finished. The bookseller, when he came afterwards to examine the manuscript, objected to it as a mere narrative version of the Good-natured Man. Goldsmith, too easily put out of conceit of his writings, threw it aside, forgetting that this was the very Newbery who kept his Vicar of Wakefield by him for nearly two years, through doubts of its success. The loss of the manuscript is deeply to be regretted; it doubtless would have been properly wrought up before given to the press, and might have given us new scenes in life, and traits of character, while it could not fail to bear traces of his delightful style. What a pity he had not been guided by the opinions of his fair listeners at Barton, instead of that of the astute Mr. Newbery!\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nWe have mentioned old General Oglethorpe as one of Goldsmith's aristocratical acquaintances. This veteran, born in 1698, had commenced life early by serving, when a mere stripling, under Prince Eugene, against the Turks. He had continued in military life, and been promoted to the rank of major-general in 1745, and received a command during the Scottish rebellion. Being of strong Jacobite tendencies, he was suspected and accused of favouring the rebels; and though acquitted by a court of inquiry, was never afterwards employed; or, in technical language, was shelved. He had since been repeatedly a member of parliament, and had always distinguished himself by learning, taste, active benevolence, and high Tory principles. His name, however, has become historical, chiefly from his transactions in America and the share he took in the settlement of the colony of Georgia. It lies embalmed in honourable immortality in a single line of Pope's:\n\n\"One, driven by strong benevolence of soul,\nShall fly, like Oglethorpes, from pole to pole.\"\nThe veteran was now seventy-four years of age, but healthy and vigorous, and as much the preux chevalier as in his younger days, when he served with Prince Eugene. His table was often the gathering-place of men of talent. Johnson was frequently there, and delighted in drawing from the General details of his various \"experiences.\" He was anxious that he should give the world his life. \"I know no man,\" said he, \"whose life would be more interesting.\" Still the vivacity of the General's mind, and the variety of his knowledge, made him skip from subject to subject too fast for the Lexicographer. \"Oglethorpe,\" growled he, \"never completes what he has to say.\"\n\nBoswell gives us an interesting and characteristic account of a dinner party at the General's, (April 10th, 1722,) at which Goldsmith and Johnson were present. After dinner, when the cloth was removed, Oglethorpe, at Johnson's request, gave an account of the siege of Belgrade, in the true veteran style. Pouring a little wine upon the table, he drew his lines and parallels with a wet finger, describing the positions of the opposing forces. \"Here were we\u2014here were the Turks,\" to all which Johnson listened with the most earnest attention, poring over the plans and diagrams with his usual purblind closeness.\n\nIn the course of conversation, the general gave an anecdote of himself in early life, when serving under Prince Eugene. Sitting at table once in company with a Prince of Wurtemberg, the latter gave a fillip to a glass of wine, so as to make some of it fly in Oglethorpe's face. The manner in which it was done was somewhat equivocal. How was it to be taken by the stripling officer? If seriously, he must challenge the prince; but in so doing, he might fix on himself the character of a drawcanair. If passed over without notice, he might be charged with cowardice. His mind was made up in an instant. \"Prince,\" said he, smiling, \"that is an excellent joke: but we do it much better in England.\" So saying, he threw a whole glass of wine in the prince's face. \"Il a bien fait, mon prince,\" cried an old general present, \"cous l'aves commenc\u00e9.\" (He has done right, my prince; you commenced it.) The prince had the good sense to acquiesce in the decision of the veteran, and Oglethorpe's retort in kind was taken in good part.\n\nIt was probably at the close of this story that the officious\nBoswell, ever anxious to promote conversation for the benefit of his note-book, started the question whether duelling were consistent with moral duty. The old general fired up in an instant. \"Undoubtedly,\" said he, with a lofty air; \"undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his honour.\" Goldsmith immediately carried the war into Boswell's own quarters, and pinned him with the question, \"what he would do if affronted?\" The phant Boswell, who for the moment had the fear of the general, rather than of Johnson before his eyes, replied, \"he should think it necessary to fight.\" \"Why, then, that solves the question,\" replied Goldsmith. \"No, sir!\" thundered out Johnson; \"it does not follow that what a man would do, is therefore right.\" He, however, subsequently went into a discussion to show that there were necessities in the case, arising out of the artificial refinement of society, and its proscription of any one who should put up with an affront without fighting a duel. \"He then,\" concluded he, \"who fights a duel, does not fight from passion against his antagonist, but out of self-defence, to avert the stigma of the world, and to prevent himself from being driven out of society. I could wish there were not that superfluity of refinement; but while such notions prevail, no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel.\"\n\nAnother question started was, whether people who disagreed on a capital point, could live together in friendship. Johnson said they might. Goldsmith said they could not, as they had not the idem velle atque idem volle\u2014the same likings and aversions. Johnson rejoined, that they must shun the subject on which they disagreed. \"But, sir,\" said Goldsmith, \"when people live together who have something as to which they disagree, and which they want to shun, they will be in the situation mentioned in the story of Blue Beard: 'you may look into all the chambers but one;' but we should have the greatest inclination to look into that chamber, to talk of that subject.\" \"Sir,\" thundered Johnson, in a loud voice, \"I am not saying that you could live in friendship with a man from whom you differ as to some point; I am only saying that I could do it.\"\n\nWho will not say that Goldsmith had not the best of this petty contest? How just was his remark! how felicitous the illustration of the blue chamber! how rude and overbearing was the argumentum ad hominem of Johnson, when he felt that he had the worst of the argument!\nThe conversation turned upon ghosts. General Oglethorpe told the story of a Colonel Pendergast, an officer in the Duke of Marlborough's army, who predicted among his comrades that he should die on a certain day. The battle of Malplaquet took place on that day. The colonel was in the midst of it, but came out unhurt. The firing had ceased, and his brother officers jeered with him about the fallacy of his prediction. \"The day is not over,\" replied he, gravely; \"I shall die notwithstanding what you see.\" His words proved true. The order for a cessation of firing had not reached one of the French batteries, and a random shot from it killed the colonel on the spot. Among his effects was found a pocket-book, in which he had made a solemn entry, that Sir John Friend, who had been executed for high treason, had appeared to him, either in a dream or vision, and predicted that he would meet him on a certain day (the very day of the battle). Colonel Cecil, who took possession of the effects of Colonel Pendergast, and read the entry in the pocket-book, told this story to Pope, the poet, in the presence of General Oglethorpe.\n\nThis story, as related by the General, appears to have been well received, if not credited, by both Johnson and Goldsmith, each of whom had something to relate in kind. Goldsmith's brother, the clergyman in whom he had such implicit confidence, had assured him of his having seen an apparition. Johnson also had a friend, old Mr. Cave, the printer, at St. John's Gate, \"an honest man, and a sensible man,\" who told him he had seen a ghost: he did not, however, like to talk of it, and seemed to be in great horror whenever it was mentioned. \"And pray, sir,\" asked Boswell, \"what did he say was the appearance?\" \"Why, sir, something of a shadowy being.\"\n\nThe reader will not be surprised at this superstitious turn in the conversation of such intelligent men, when he recollects that but a few years before this time, all London had been agitated by the absurd story of the Cock Lane ghost; a matter which Dr. Johnson had deemed worthy of his serious investigation, and about which Goldsmith had written a pamphlet.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nAmong the agreeable acquaintances made by Goldsmith about this time, was a Mr. Joseph Cradock, a young gentleman of Leicestershire, living at his ease, but disposed to \"make himself uneasy,\" by meddling with literature and the theatre; in fact, he had a passion for plays and players, and had come up to town with a modified translation of Voltaire's tragedy of Zobeide, in a view to get it acted. There was no great difficulty in the case, as he was a man of fortune, had letters of introduction to persons of note, and was altogether in a different position from the indigent man of genius whom managers might harass with impunity. Goldsmith met him at the house of Yates, the actor, and finding that he was a friend of Lord Clare, soon became sociable with him. Mutual tastes quickened the intimacy, especially as they found means of serving each other. Goldsmith wrote an epilogue for the tragedy of Zobeide; and Cradock, who was an amateur musician, arranged the music for the Threnodia Augustalis, a lament on the death of the Princess Dowager of Wales, the political mistress and patron of Lord Clare, which Goldsmith had thrown off hastily to please that nobleman. The tragedy was played with some success at Covent Garden; the lament was recited and sung at Mrs. Cornely's rooms\u2014a very fashionable resort in Soho Square, got up by a woman of enterprise of that name. It was in whimsical parody of those gay, and somewhat promiscuous assemblages that Goldsmith used to call the motley evening parties at his lodgings, \"little Cornelys.\"\n\nThe Threnodia Augustalis was not publicly known to be by Goldsmith until several years after his death.\n\nCradock was one of the few polite intimates who felt more disposed to sympathize with the generous qualities of the poet, than to sport with his eccentricities. He sought his society whenever he came to town, and occasionally had him to his seat in the country. Goldsmith appreciated his sympathy and unburdened himself to him without reserve. Seeing the lettered ease in which this amateur author was enabled to live, and the time he could bestow on the elaboration of manuscript, \"Ah! Mr. Cradock,\" cried he, \"think of me that must write a volume every month!\" He complained to\nhim of the attempts made by inferior writers, and by others who could scarcely come under that denomination, not only to abuse and depreciate his writings, but to render him ridiculous as a man; perverting every harmless sentiment and action into charges of absurdity, malice, or folly. \"Sir,\" said he, in the fulness of his heart, \"I am as a lion baited by ours!\"\n\nAnother acquaintance, which he made about this time, was a young countryman of the name of M'Donnell, whom he met in a state of destitution, and, of course, befriended. The following grateful recollections of his kindness and his merits were furnished by that person in after years:\n\n\"It was in the year 1772,\" writes he, \"that the death of my elder brother\u2014when in London, on my way to Ireland\u2014left me in a most forlorn situation. I was then about eighteen; I possessed neither friends nor money, nor the means of getting to Ireland, of which, or of England, I knew scarcely anything, from having so long resided in France. In this situation, I had strolled about for two or three days, considering what to do, but unable to come to any determination, when Providence directed me to the Temple Gardens. I threw myself on a seat, and, willing to forget my miseries for a moment, drew out a book; that book was a volume of Boileau. I had not been there long, when a gentleman, strolling about, passed near me, and observing, perhaps, something Irish or foreign in my garb or countenance, addressed me: 'Sir, you seem studious; I hope you find this a favourable place to pursue it.' 'Not very studious, sir; I fear it is the want of society that brings me hither; I am solitary and unknown in this metropolis;' and a passage from Cicero\u2014Oratio pro Archia\u2014occurring to me, I quoted it: 'Haec studia pronostant nobiscum, perigrinantur, rusticantur.' 'You are a scholar, too, sir, I perceive.' 'A piece of one, sir; but I ought still to have been in the college where I had the good fortune to pick up the little I know.' A good deal of conversation ensued; I told him part of my history, and he, in return, gave his address in the Temple, desiring me to call soon, from which, to my infinite surprise and gratification, I found that the person who thus seemed to take an interest in my fate was my countryman, and a distinguished ornament of letters.\n\n\"I did not fail to keep the appointment, and was received in the kindest manner. He told me smilingly, that he was...\"\nnot rich; that he could do little for me in direct pecuniary aid, but would endeavour to put me in the way of doing something for myself; observing, that he could at least furnish me with advice not wholly useless to a young man placed in the heart of a great metropolis. 'In London,' he continued, 'nothing is to be got for nothing: you must work; and no man who chooses to be industrious need be under obligations to another, for here labour of every kind commands its reward. If you think proper to assist me occasionally as amanuensis, I shall be obliged, and you will be placed under no obligation, until something more permanent can be secured for you.' This employment, which I pursued for some time, was to translate passages from Buffon, which was abridged or altered, according to circumstances, for his Natural History.\"\n\nGoldsmith's literary tasks were fast getting a-head of him, and he began now to \"toil after them in vain.\"\n\nFive volumes of the \"Natural History\" here spoken of, had long since been paid for by Mr. Griffin, yet most of them were still to be written. His young amanuensis bears testimony to his embarrassments and perplexities, but to the degree of equanimity with which he bore them:\n\n\"It has been said,\" observed he, \"that he was irritable. Such may have been the case at times; nay, I believe it was so; for what with the continual pursuit of authors, printers, and booksellers, and occasional pecuniary embarrassments, few could have avoided exhibiting similar marks of impatience. But it was never so towards me. I saw him only in his bland and kind moods, with a flow, perhaps an overflow, of the milk of human kindness for all who were in any manner dependent upon him. I looked upon him with awe and veneration, and he upon me as a kind parent upon a child.\n\n\"His manner and address exhibited much frankness and cordiality, particularly to those with whom he possessed any degree of intimacy. His good-nature was equally apparent. You could not dislike the man, although several of his follies and foibles you might be tempted to condemn. He was generous and inconsiderate: money with him had little value.\"\n\nTo escape from many of the tormentors just alluded to, and to devote himself without interruption to his task, Goldsmith took lodgings for the summer at a farm-house near the six-mile stone on the Edgware-road, and carried down his books\nin two return post-chaises. He used to say he believed the farmer's family thought him an odd character, similar to that in which the Spectator appeared to his landlady and her children; he was The Gentleman. Boswell tells us that he went to visit him at the place in company with Mickle, translator of the Lusiad. Goldsmith was not at home. Having a curiosity to see his apartment, however, they went in, and found curious scraps of descriptions of animals scrawled upon the wall with a black-lead pencil.\n\nThe farm-house in question is still in existence, though much altered. It stands upon a gentle eminence in Hyde-lane, commanding a pleasant prospect towards Hendon. The room is still pointed out in which \"She Stoops to Conquer\" was written; a convenient and airy apartment, up one flight of stairs.\n\nSome matter of fact traditions concerning the author were furnished, a few years since, by a son of the farmer, who was sixteen years of age at the time Goldsmith resided with his father. Though he had engaged to board with the family, his meals were generally sent to him in his room, in which he passed the most of his time, negligently dressed, with his shirt-collar open, busily engaged in writing. Sometimes, probably when in moods of composition, he would wander into the kitchen without noticing any one, stand musing with his back to the fire, and then hurry off again to his room, no doubt to commit to paper some thought which had struck him.\n\nSometimes he strolled about the fields, or was to be seen loitering, and reading, and musing under the hedges. He was subject to fits of wakefulness, and read much in bed; if not disposed to read he still kept the candle burning; if he wished to extinguish it, and it was out of his reach, he flung his slipper at it, which would be found in the morning near the overturned candlestick, and daubed with grease. He was noted here, as everywhere else, for his charitable feelings. No beggar applied to him in vain, and he evinced on all occasions great commiseration for the poor.\n\nHe had the use of the parlour to receive and entertain company, and was visited by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Hugh Boyd, the reputed author of Junius, Sir William Chambers, and other distinguished characters. He gave, occasionally, though rarely, a dinner party; and on one occasion, when his guests\nwere detained by a thunder shower, he got up a dance, and carried the merriment late into the night.\n\nAs usual, he was the promoter of hilarity among the young, and at one time took the children of the house to see a company of strolling players at Hendon. The greatest amusement to the party, however, was derived from his own jokes on the road, and his comments on the performance, which produced infinite laughter among his youthful companions.\n\nNear to his rural retreat at Edgeware, a Mr. Seguin, an Irish merchant, of literary tastes, had country quarters for his family, where Goldsmith was always welcome.\n\nIn this family he would indulge in playful and even grotesque humour, and was ready for anything\u2014conversation, music, or a game of romps. He prided himself upon his dancing, and would walk a minuet with Mrs. Seguin, to the infinite amusement of herself and the children, whose shouts of laughter he bore with perfect good humour. He would sing Irish songs, and the Scotch ballad of Johnny Armstrong. He took the lead in the children's sports of blind man's buff, hunt the slipper, &c., or in their games at cards, and was the most noisy of the party, affecting to cheat, and to be excessively eager to win; while with children of smaller size, he would turn the hind part of his wig before, and play all kinds of tricks to amuse them.\n\nOne word as to his musical skill, and his performance on the flute, which comes up so invariably in all his fireside revels. He really knew nothing of music scientifically; he had a good ear, and may have played sweetly; but we are told he could not read a note of music. Roubillac, the statuary, once played a trick upon him in this respect. He pretended to score down an air as the poet played it, but put down crotchets and semibreves at random. When he had finished, Goldsmith cast his eyes over it and pronounced it correct! It is possible that his execution in music was like his style in writing; in sweetness and melody he may have snatched a grace beyond the reach of art.\n\nHe was at all times a capital companion for children, and knew how to fall in with their humours. \"I little thought,\" said Miss Hawkins, the woman grown, \"what I should have to boast when Goldsmith taught me to play Jack and Jill by two bits of paper on his fingers.\" He entertained Mrs. Car-\nrick, we are told, with a whole budget of stories and songs; delivered the \"Chimney Sweep\" with exquisite taste as a solo; and performed a duet with Garrick of \"Old Rose and Burn the Bellows.\"\n\n\"I was only five years old,\" says the late George Colman, \"when Goldsmith, one evening when drinking coffee with my father, took me on his knee and began to play with me, which amiable act I returned with a very smart slap in the face; it must have been a tingler, for I left the marks of my little spiteful paw upon his cheek. This infantile outrage was followed by summary justice, and I was locked up by my father in an adjoining room, to undergo solitary imprisonment in the dark. Here I began to howl and scream most abominably. At length, a friend appeared to extricate me from jeopardy; it was the good-natured doctor himself, with a lighted candle in his hand, and a smile upon his countenance, which was still partially red from the effects of my petulance. I sulked and sobbed, and he fondled and soothed until I began to brighten. He seized the propitious moment, placed three hats upon the carpet, and a shilling under each; the shillings, he told me, were England, France, and Spain. 'Hey, presto, creakolorum,' cried the doctor, and lo! on uncovering the shillings, they were all found congregated under one. I was no politician at the time, and therefore might not have wondered at the sudden revolution which brought England, France, and Spain all under one crown; but, as I was also no conjuror, it amazed me beyond measure. From that time, whenever the doctor came to visit my father,\n\n'I pluck'd his gown to share the good man's smile;'\n\na game of romps constantly ensued, and we were always cordial friends and merry playfellows.\"\n\nAlthough Goldsmith made the Edgeware farm-house his headquarters for the summer, he would absent himself for weeks at a time on visits to Mr. Cradock, Lord Clare, and Mr. Langton, at their country-seats. He would often visit town, also, to dine and partake of the public amusements. On one occasion he accompanied Edmund Burke to witness a performance of the Italian Fantoccini or Puppets, in Panton Street; an exhibition which had hit the caprice of the town, and was in great vogue. The puppets were set in motion by\nwires, so well concealed as to be with difficulty detected. Boswell, with his usual obtuseness with respect to Goldsmith, accuses him of being jealous of the puppets! \"When Burke,\" said he, \"praised the dexterity with which one of them tossed a pike, 'Pshaw,' said Goldsmith with some warmth, 'I can do it better myself.'\" \"The same evening,\" adds Boswell, \"when supping at Burke's lodgings, he broke his shin by attempting to exhibit to the company how much better he could jump over a stick than the puppets.\"\n\nGoldsmith jealous of puppets! This even passes in absurdity Boswell's charge upon him of being jealous of the beauty of the two Miss Hornecks.\n\nThe Panton Street puppets were destined to be a source of further amusement to the town, and of annoyance to the little autocrat of the stage. Foote, the Aristophanes of the English drama, who was always on the alert to turn every subject of popular excitement to account, seeing the success of the Fantoccini, gave out that he should produce a Primitive Puppet-show at the Haymarket, to be entitled \"The Handsome Chambermaid, or Piety in Pattens,\" intended to burlesque the sentimental comedy which Garrick still maintained at Drury Lane. The idea of a play to be performed in a regular theatre by puppets, excited the curiosity and talk of the town. \"Will your puppets be as large as life, Mr. Foote?\" demanded a lady of rank. \"Oh, no, my lady,\" replied Foote, \"not much larger than Garrick.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nGoldsmith returned to town in the autumn (1772), with his health much disordered. His close fits of sedentary application, during which he in a manner tied himself to the mast, had laid the seeds of a lurking malady in his system, and produced a severe illness in the course of the summer. Town life was not favourable to the health either of body or mind. He could not resist the siren voice of temptation, which, now that he had become a notoriety, assailed him on every side. Accordingly we find him launching away in a career of social dissipation; dining and supping out; at clubs, at routs, at theatres; he is a guest with Johnson at the\nThrales, and an object of Mrs. Thrale's lively sallies; he is a lion at Mrs. Vesey's and Mrs. Montagu's, where some of the high-bred blue-stockings pronounce him a \"wild genius,\" and others, peradventure, a \"wild Irishman.\" In the meantime, his pecuniary difficulties are increasing upon him, conflicting with his proneness to pleasure and expense, and contributing by the harassment of his mind to the wear and tear of his constitution. His \"Animated Nature,\" though not finished, has been entirely paid for, and the money spent. The money advanced by Garrick on Newbery's note, still hangs over him as a debt. The tale on which Newbery had loaned from two to three hundred pounds previous to the excursion to Barton, has proved a failure. The bookseller is urgent for the settlement of his complicated account; the perplexed author has nothing to offer in liquidation but the copyright of the comedy which he has in his portfolio; \"Though to tell you the truth, Frank,\" said he, \"there are great doubts of its success. The offer was accepted, and, like bargains wrung from Goldsmith in times of emergency, turned out a golden speculation to the bookseller.\n\nIn this way, Goldsmith went on \"overrunning the constable,\" as he termed it; spending everything in advance; working with an overtired head and weary heart to pay for past pleasure and past extravagance, and at the same time incurring new debts, to perpetuate his struggles and darken his future prospects. While the excitement of society and the excitement of composition conspire to keep up a feverishness of the system, he has incurred an unfortunate habit of quacking himself with James's powders, a fashionable panacea of the day.\n\nA farce produced this year by Garrick, and entitled \"The Irish Widow,\" perpetuates the memory of practical jokes played off a year or two previously upon the alleged vanity of poor simple-hearted Goldsmith. He was one evening at the house of his friend Burke, when he was beset by a tenth muse, an Irish widow and authoress, just arrived from Ireland, full of brogue and blunders, and poetic fire and rantipole gentility. She was soliciting subscriptions for her poems; and assailed Goldsmith for his patronage; the great Goldsmith\u2014her countryman, and of course her friend. She overpowered him with eulogiums on his own poems, and then read some of her\nown, with vehemence of tone and gesture, appealing continually to the great Goldsmith to know how he relished them.\n\nPoor Goldsmith did all that a kind-hearted and gallant gentleman could do in such a case; he praised her poems as far as the stomach of his sense would permit: perhaps a little further; he offered her his subscription, and it was not until she had retired, with many parting compliments to the great Goldsmith, that he pronounced the poetry that had been inflicted on him execrable. The whole scene had been a hoax got up by Burke for the amusement of his company, and the Irish widow, so admirably performed, had been personated by a Mrs. Balfour, a lady of his connexion, of great sprightliness and talent.\n\nWe see nothing in the story to establish the alleged vanity of Goldsmith, but we think it tells rather to the disadvantage of Burke; being unwarrantable under their relations of friendship, and a species of waggery quite beneath his genius.\n\nCroker, in his notes to Boswell, gives another of these practical jokes perpetrated by Burke at the expense of Goldsmith's credulity. It was related to Croker by Colonel O'Moore of Cloghan Castle, in Ireland, who was a party concerned. The Colonel and Burke, walking one day through Leicester Square, on their way to Sir Joshua Reynolds's, with whom they were to dine, observed Goldsmith, who was likewise to be a guest, standing and regarding a crowd which was staring and shouting at some foreign ladies in the window of an hotel. \"Observe Goldsmith,\" said Burke to O'Moore, \"and mark what passes between us at Sir Joshua's.\" They passed on, and reached there before him. Burke received Goldsmith with affected reserve and coldness; being pressed to explain the reason, \"Really,\" said he, \"I am ashamed to keep company with a person who could act as you have just done in the Square.\" Goldsmith protested that he was ignorant of what was meant. \"Why,\" said Burke, \"did you not exclaim as you were looking up at those women, what stupid beasts the crowd must be for staring with such admiration at those painted Jezebels, while a man of your talents passed by unnoticed?\" \"Surely, surely, my dear friend,\" cried Goldsmith, with alarm\u2014\"surely I did not say so?\" \"Nay,\" replied Burke, \"if you had not said so, how should I have known it?\" \"That's true,\" answered Goldsmith, \"I am very sorry\n\u2014it was very foolish: I do recollect that something of the kind passed through my mind, but I did not think I had uttered it.\"\n\nIt is proper to observe that these jokes were played off by Burke before he had attained the full eminence of his social position, and that he may have felt privileged to take liberties with Goldsmith as his countryman and college associate. It is evident, however, that the peculiarities of the latter, and his guileless simplicity, made him a butt for the broad waggery of some of his associates; while others, more polished, though equally perfidious, are on the watch to give currency to his bulls and blunders.\n\nThe Stratford jubilee, in honour of Shakspeare, where Boswell had made a fool of himself, was still in every one's mind. It was sportively suggested that a f\u00eate should be held at Lichfield in honour of Johnson and Garrick, and that the \"Beaux Stratagem\" should be played by the members of the Literary Club. \"Then,\" exclaimed Goldsmith, \"I shall certainly play Scrub. I should like of all things to try my hand at that character.\" The unwary speech, which any one else might have made without comment, has been thought worthy of record as whimsically characteristic. Beauclerc was extremely apt to circulate anecdotes at his expense, founded perhaps on some trivial incident, but dressed up with the embellishments of his sarcastic brain. One relates to a venerable dish of peas, served up at Sir Joshua's table, which should have been green, but were any other colour. A wag suggested to Goldsmith, in a whisper, that they should be sent to Hammer-smith, as that was the way to turn 'em green (Turnham-Green). Goldsmith, delighted with the pun, endeavoured to repeat it at Burke's table, but missed the point. \"That is the way to make 'em green,\" said he. Nobody laughed. He perceived he was at fault. \"I mean that is the road to turn 'em green.\" A dead pause and a stare; \"whereupon,\" adds Beauclerc, \"he started up disconcerted and abruptly left the table.\" This is evidently one of Beauclerc's caricatures.\n\nOn another occasion the poet and Beauclerc were seated at the theatre next to Lord Shelburne, the minister, whom political writers thought proper to nickname Malagrida. \"Do you know,\" said Goldsmith to his lordship, in the course of conversation, \"that I never could conceive why they call you Malagrida, for Malagrida was a very good sort of man.\" This\nwas too good a trip of the tongue for Beauclerc to let pass: he serves it up in his next letter to Lord Charlemont, as a specimen of a mode of turning a thought the wrong way, peculiar to the poet; he makes merry over it with his witty and sarcastic compeer, Horace Walpole, who pronounces it \"a picture of Goldsmith's whole life.\" Dr. Johnson alone, when he hears it bandied about as Goldsmith's last blunder, growls forth a friendly defence; \"Sir,\" said he, \"it was a mere blunder in emphasis. He meant to say, I wonder they should use Malagrida as a term of reproach.\" Poor Goldsmith! On such points he was ever doomed to be misinterpreted. Rogers, the poet, meeting in times long subsequent with a survivor from those days, asked him what Goldsmith really was in conversation. The old conversational character was too deeply stamped in the memory of the veteran to be effaced. \"Sir,\" replied the old wiseacre, \"He was a fool. The right word never came to him. If you gave him back a bad shilling, he'd say; Why it's as good a shilling as ever was born. You know he ought to have said coined. Coined, sir, never entered his head. He was a fool, sir.\"\n\nWe have so many anecdotes in which Goldsmith's simplicity is played upon, that it is quite a treat to meet with one in which he is represented playing upon the simplicity of others, especially when the victim of his joke is the \"Great Cham\" himself, whom all others are disposed to hold so much in awe. Goldsmith and Johnson were supping cosily together at a tavern in Dean-street, Soho, kept by Jack Roberts, a singer at Drury Lane, and a protege of Garrick's. Johnson delighted in these gastronomical t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates, and was expatiating in high good humour on a dish of rumps and kidneys, the veins of his forehead swelling with the ardour of mastication. \"These,\" said he, \"are pretty little things; but a man must eat a great many of them before he is filled.\" \"Aye; but how many of them,\" asked Goldsmith, with affected simplicity, \"would reach to the moon?\" \"To the moon! Ah, sir, that I fear, exceeds your calculation.\" \"Not at all, sir; I think I could tell.\" \"Pray, then, sir, let us hear.\" \"Why, sir, one, if it were long enough!\" Johnson growled for a time at finding himself caught in such a trite school-boy trap. \"Well, sir,\" cried he at length, \"I have deserved it. I should not have provoked so foolish an answer by so foolish a question.\"\nAmong the many incidents related as illustrative of Goldsmith's vanity and envy, is one which occurred one evening when he was in a drawing-room with a party of ladies, and a ballad-singer under the window struck up his favourite song of \"Sally Salisbury.\" \"How miserably this woman sings!\" exclaimed he. \"Pray, doctor,\" said the lady of the house, \"could you do it better?\" \"Yes, madam, and the company shall be judges.\" The company, of course, prepared to be entertained by an absurdity; but their smiles were well nigh turned to tears, for he acquitted himself with a skill and pathos that drew universal applause. He had, in fact, a delicate ear for music, which had been jarred by the false notes of the ballad-singer; and there were certain pathetic ballads, associated with recollections of his childhood, which were sure to touch the springs of his heart. We have another story of him, connected with ballad-singing, which is still more characteristic. He was one evening at the house of Sir William Chambers, in Berners-street, seated at a whist-table, with Sir William, Lady Chambers, and Baretti, when all at once he threw down his cards, hurried out of the room and into the street. He returned in an instant, resumed his seat, and the game went on. Sir William, after a little hesitation, ventured to ask the cause of his retreat, fearing he had been overcome by the heat of the room. \"Not at all,\" replied Goldsmith; \"but in truth I could not bear to hear that unfortunate woman in the street, half singing, half sobbing, for such tones could only arise from the extremity of distress; her voice grated painfully on my ear and jarred my frame, so that I could not rest until I had sent her away.\" It was in fact, a poor ballad-singer, whose cracked voice had been heard by others of the party, but without having the same effect on their sensibilities. It was the reality of his fictitious scene in the story of the Man in Black; wherein he describes a woman in rags, with one child in her arms and another on her back, attempting to sing ballads, but with such a mournful voice that it was difficult to determine whether she was singing or crying. \"A wretch,\" he adds, \"who, in the deepest distress, still aimed at good humour, was an object my friend was by no means capable of withstandin.\" The Man in Black gave the poor woman all that he had\u2014a bundle of\nmatches. Goldsmith, it is probable, sent his ballad-singer away rejoicing, with all the money in his pocket.\n\nRanelagh was at that time greatly in vogue as a place of public entertainment. It was situated near Chelsea; the principal room was a Rotunda of great dimensions, with an orchestra in the centre, and tiers of boxes all round. It was a place to which Johnson resorted occasionally. \"I am a great friend to public amusements,\" said he, \"for they keep people from vice.\" Goldsmith was equally a friend to them, though perhaps not altogether on such moral grounds. He was particularly fond of masquerades, which were then exceedingly popular, and got up at Ranelagh with great expense and magnificence. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who had likewise a taste for such amusements, was sometimes his companion, at other times he went alone; his peculiarities of person and manner would soon betray him, whatever might be his disguise, and he would be singled out by wags, acquainted with his foibles, and more successful than himself in maintaining their incognito, as a capital subject to be played upon. Some, pretending not to know him, would decry his writings, and praise those of his contemporaries; others would laud his verses to the skies, but purposely misquote and burlesque them; others would annoy him with parodies; while one young lady, whom he was teasing, as he supposed, with great success and infinite humour, silenced his rather boisterous laughter by quoting his own line about \"the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.\" On one occasion, he was actually driven out of the house by the persevering jokes of a wag, whose complete disguise gave him no means of retaliation.\n\nHis name appearing in the newspapers among the distinguished persons present at one of these amusements, his old\n\n\"Alas, sir!\" said Johnson, speaking, when in another mood, of grand houses, fine gardens, and splendid places of public amusement, \"alas, sir! these are only struggles for happiness. When I first entered Ranelagh, it gave an expansion and gay sensation to my mind such as I never experienced anywhere else. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army, and considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think.\"\n\nKean had made him a present of a new coat, which he had made for himself, and which he had given to his friend as a memorial.\n\nThe newspapers had been very kind to Mr. Reynolds, and had given him a great deal of notice. They had been very attentive to his affairs, and had been very attentive to his clothes.\nenemy, Kenrick, immediately addressed to him a copy of anonymous verses, to the following purport:\n\n\"To Dr. Goldsmith; on seeing his name in the list of mummers at the late masquerade:\n\n\"How widely different, Goldsmith, are the ways\nOf Doctors now, and those of ancient days!\nTheirs taught the truth in academic shades,\nOurs in lewd hops and midnight masquerades.\nSo changed the times! say, philosophic sage,\nWhose genius suits so well this tasteful age,\nIs the Pantheon, late a sink obscene,\nBecome the fountain of chaste Hippocrene?\nOr do thy moral numbers quaintly flow,\nInspired by th' Aganippe of Soho?\nDo wisdom's sons gorge cates and vermicelli,\nLike beastly Bickerstaffe or bothering Kelly?\nOr art thou tired of th' undeserved applause,\nBestowed on bards affecting Virtue's cause?\nIs this the good that makes the humble vain,\nThe good philosophy should not disdain?\nIf so, let pride dissemble all it can,\nA modern sage is still much less than man.\"\n\nGoldsmith was keenly sensitive to attacks of the kind, and, meeting Kenrick at the Chapter Coffee-house, called him to sharp account for taking such a liberty with his name, and calling his morals in question, merely on account of his being seen at a place of general resort and amusement. Kenrick shuffled and sneaked, protesting that he meant nothing derogatory to his private character. Goldsmith let him know, however, that he was aware of his having more than once indulged in attacks of this dastard kind, and intimated that another such outrage would be followed by personal chastisement.\n\nKenrick having played the craven in his presence, avenged himself as soon as he was gone, by complaining of his having made a wanton attack upon him, and by making coarse comments upon his writings, conversation, and person.\n\nThe scurrilous satire of Kenrick, however unmerited, may have checked Goldsmith's taste for masquerades. Sir Joshua Reynolds, calling on the poet one morning, found him walking about his room in somewhat of a reverie, kicking a bundle of clothes before him like a foot-ball. It proved to be an expen-\nsive masquerade dress, which he said he had been fool enough to purchase, and as there was no other way of getting the worth of his money, he was trying to take it out in exercise.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nFrom the feverish dissipations of town, Goldsmith is summoned away to partake of the genial dissipations of the country. In the month of December, a letter from Mrs. Bunbury invites him down to Barton, to pass the Christmas holidays. The letter is written in the usual playful vein which marks his intercourse with this charming family. He is to come in his \"smart spring-velvet coat,\" to bring a new wig to dance with the haymakers in, and, above all, to follow the advice of herself and her sister, (the Jessamy Bride,) in playing loo. This letter, which plays so archly, yet kindly, with some of poor Goldsmith's peculiarities, and bespeaks such real ladylike regard for him, requires a word or two of annotation. The spring-velvet suit alluded to appears to have been a gallant adornment, (somewhat in the style of the famous bloom-coloured coat,) in which Goldsmith had figured in the preceding month of May\u2014the season of blossoms\u2014for, on the 21st of that month, we find the following entry in the chronicle of Mr. William Filby, tailor: To your blue velvet suit, \u00a321 10s. 9d. Also, about the same time, a suit of livery and a crimson collar for the serving man. Again we hold the Jessamy Bride responsible for this gorgeous splendour of wardrobe.\n\nThe new wig no doubt is a bag-wig and solitaire, still highly the mode, and in which Goldsmith is represented as figuring when in full dress, equipped with his sword.\n\nAs to the dancing with the haymakers, we presume it alludes to some gambol of the poet, in the course of his former visit to Barton; when he ranged the fields and lawns a chartered libertine, and tumbled into the fish-ponds.\n\nAs to the suggestions about loo, they are in sportive allusion to the doctor's mode of playing that game in their merry evening parties; affecting the desperate gambler and easy dupe; running counter to all rule; making extravagant ventures; reproaching all others with cowardice; dashing at all hazards at the pool, and getting himself completely loo'd, to\nthe great amusement of the company. The drift of the fair sisters' advice was most probably to tempt him on, and then leave him in the lurch.\n\nWith these comments, we subjoin Goldsmith's reply to Mrs. Bunbury, a fine piece of off-hand humorous writing, which has only of late years been given to the public, and which throws a familiar light on the social circle at Barton.\n\n\"Madam,\u2014I read your letter with all that allowance which critical candour could require, but after all, find so much to object to, and so much to raise my indignation, that I cannot help giving it a serious answer.\u2014I am not so ignorant, madam, as not to see there are many sarcasms contained in it, and solecisms also. (Solecism is a word that comes from the town of Soleis, in Attica, among the Greeks, built by Solon, and applied as we use the word Kidderminster for curtains from a town also of that name\u2014but this is learning you have no taste for!)-I say, madam, there are many sarcasms in it, and solecisms also. But not to seem an ill-natured critic, I'll take leave to quote your own words, and give you my remarks upon them as they occur. You begin as follows:\n\n'I hope, my good Doctor, you soon will be here,\nAnd your spring-velvet coat very smart will appear,\nTo open our ball the first day of the year.'\n\n\"Pray, madam, where did you ever find the epithet 'good' applied to the title of doctor? Had you called me 'learned doctor,' or 'grave doctor,' or 'noble doctor,' it might be allowable, because they belong to the profession. But not to cavil at trifles, you talk of my 'spring-velvet coat,' and advise me to wear it the first day in the year, that is, in the middle of winter!\u2014a spring-velvet coat in the middle of winter!! That would be a solecism indeed! and yet, to increase the inconsistency, in another part of your letter you call me a beau. Now, on one side or other you must be wrong. If I am a beau, I can never think of wearing a spring-velvet in winter; and if I am not a beau, why then, that explains itself. But let me go on to your two next strange lines:\n\n'And bring with you a wig, that is modish and gay,\nTo dance with the girls that are makers of hay.'\n\n\"The absurdity of making hay at Christmas you yourself seem sensible of: you say your sister will laugh; and so, indeed, she well may! The Latins have an expression for a contemptuous kind of laughter, 'naso contemnere adunco;' that is, to laugh with a crooked nose. She may laugh at you in the manner of the ancients if she thinks fit. But now I come to the most extraordinary of all extraordinary propositions, which is to take your and your sister's advice in playing at loo. The presumption of the offer raises my indignation beyond the bounds of prose; it inspires me at once with verse and resentment. I take advice? and from whom? You shall hear:\"\n\"First let me suppose, what may shortly be true,\nThe company set, and the word to be Loo:\nAll smirking, and pleasant, and big with adventure,\nAnd ogling the stake which is fixed in the centre.\nRound and round go the cards, while I inwardly damn\nAt never once finding a visit from Pam.\nI lay down my stake, apparently cool,\nWhile the harpies about me all pocket the pool.\nI fret in my gizzard, yet, cautious and sly,\nI wish all my friends may be bolder than I:\nYet still they sit snug, not a creature will aim\nBy losing their money to venture at fame.\n'Tis in vain that at niggardly caution I scold,\n'Tis in vain that I flatter the brave and the bold:\nAll play their own way, and they think me an ass,\u2014\n'What does Mrs. Bunbury?'\u2014'I, Sir? I pass.'\n'Pray what does Miss Horneck? take courage, come de,'\u2014\n'Who, I? let me see, Sir, why I must pass too.'\nMr. Bunbury frets, and I fret like the devil,\nTo see them so cowardly, lucky, and civil.\nYet still I sit snug, and continue to sigh on,\nTill, made by my losses as bold as a lion,\nI venture at all, while my avarice regards\nThe whole pool as my own\u2014\u2014'Come, give me five cards.'\n'Well done!' cry the ladies: 'Ah, Doctor, that's good!\nThe pool's very rich\u2014ah! the Doctor is loc'd!'\nThus foil'd in my courage, on all sides perplexed,\nI ask for advice from the lady that's next:\n'Pray, ma'am, be so good as to give your advice;\nDon't you think the best way is to venture for't twice?'\n'I advise,' cries the lady, 'to try it, I own\u2014\n'Ah! the Doctor is loc'd! Come, Doctor, put down.'\nThus, playing, and playing, I still grow more eager,\nAnd so bold, and so bold, I'm at last a bold beggar.\nNow, ladies, I ask, if law matters you're skill'd in,\nWhether crimes such as yours should not come before Fielding:\nFor giving advice that is not worth a straw,\nMay well be call'd picking of pockets in law;\nAnd pickling of pockets, with which I now charge ye,\nIs, by quinto Elizabeth, Death without Clergy.\nWhat justice, when both to the Old Bailey brought!\nBy the gods, I'll enjoy it, though 'tis but in thought!\nBoth are placed at the bar, with all proper decorum,\nWith bunches of fennel, and nosegays before 'em;\nBoth cover their faces with mobs and all that,\nBut the judge bids them, angrily, take off their hat.\nWhen uncover'd, a buzz of inquiry runs round,\n'Pray what are their crimes?'\u2014'They've been pilfering found.'\nTHEATRICAL DELAYS.\n\n\"But pray who have they pilfer'd?\"\u2014\"A doctor, I hear,\"\n\"What, you solemn-faced, odd-looking man that stands near?\"\n\"The same.\"\u2014\"What a pity! how does it surprise me,\nTwo handsomer culprits I never set eyes on!\"\nThen their friends all come round me with cringing and leering,\nTo melt me to pity, and soften my swearing.\nFirst Sir Charles advances, with phrases well strung,\n\"Consider, dear Doctor, the girls are but young.\"\n\"The younger the worse,\" I return him again,\n\"It shows that their habits are all dyed in grain.\"\n\"But then they're so handsome, one's bosom it grieves,\"\n\"What signifies handsome, when people are thieves?\"\n\"But where is your justice? their cases are hard.\"\n\"What signifies justice? I want the reward.\"\n\n\"There's the parish of Edmonton offers forty pounds; there's the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, offers forty pounds; there's the parish of Tyburn, from the Hog-in-the-pound to St. Giles's watch-house offers forty pounds.\u2014I shall have all that if I convict them!\"\n\n\"But consider their case,\u2014it may yet be your own!\nAnd see how they kneel!

It cuts deep. But now for the rest of the letter: and next\u2014but I want room\u2014so I believe I'll battle the rest out at Barton some day next week\u2014I don't value you all!\"\n\n\"O. G.\"\n\nWe regret that we have no record of this Christmas visit to Barton; that the poet had no Boswell to follow at his heels, and take notes of all his sayings and doings. We can only picture him in our minds, casting off all care; enacting the lord of misrule; presiding at the Christmas revels; providing all kinds of merriment; keeping the card-table in an uproar, and finally opening the ball on the first day of the year in his spring-velvet suit, with the Jessamy Bride for a partner.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nThe gay life depicted in the two last chapters, while it kept Goldsmith in a state of continual excitement, aggravated the malady which was impairing his constitution; yet his increasing perplexities in money matters drove him to the dissipation of society as a relief from solitary care. The delays of the theatre added to these perplexities. He had long since finished his new comedy, yet the year 1772 passed away with-\nout his being able to get it on the stage. No one, uninitiated in the interior of a theatre, that little world of traps and trickery, can have any idea of the obstacles and perplexities multiplied in the way of the most eminent and successful author by the mismanagement of managers, the jealousies and intrigues of rival authors, and the fantastic and impertinent caprices of actors. A long and baffling negociation was carried on between Goldsmith and Colman, the manager of Covent Garden, who retained the play in his hands until the middle of January (1773) without coming to a decision. The theatrical season was rapidly passing away, and Goldsmith's pecuniary difficulties were augmenting and pressing on him. We may judge of his anxiety by the following letter:\n\n\"To George Colman, Esq.\n\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014I entreat you'll relieve me from that state of suspense in which I have been kept for a long time. Whatever objections you have made, or shall make to my play, I will endeavour to remove, and not argue about them. To bring in any new judges either of its merits or its faults, I can never submit to. Upon a former occasion, when my other play was before Mr. Garrick, he offered to bring me before Mr. Whitehead's tribunal, but I refused the proposal with indignation: I hope I shall not experience such harsh treatment from you as from him. I have, as you know, a large sum of money to make up shortly; by accepting my play, I can readily satisfy my creditors that way; at any rate, I must look about to some certainty to be prepared. For God's sake take the play, and let us make the best of it, and let me have the same measure, at least, which you have given as bad plays as mine.\n\n\"I am, your friend and servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nColman returned the manuscript, with the blank sides of the leaves scored with disparaging comments, and suggested alterations, but with the intimation that the faith of the theatre should be kept, and the play acted notwithstanding. Goldsmith submitted the criticisms to some of his friends, who pronounced them trivial, unfair, and contemptible, and intimated that Colman, being a dramatic writer himself, might be actuated by jealousy. The play was then sent, with Colman's comments written on it, to Garrick; but he had scarce sent it when Johnson interfered, represented the evil that might result from an apparent rejection of it by Covent Garden, and undertook to go forthwith to Colman, and have a talk with\nhim on the subject. Goldsmith, therefore, penned the following note to Garrick:\n\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014I ask many pardons for the trouble I gave you yesterday. Upon more mature deliberation, and the advice of a sensible friend, I began to think it indelicate in me to throw upon you the odium of confirming Mr. Colman's sentence. I therefore request you will send my play back by my servant; for having been assured of having it acted at the other house, though I confess yours in every respect more to my wish, yet it would be a folly in me to forego an advantage which lies in my power, of appealing from Mr. Colman's opinion to the judgment of the town. I entreat, if not too late, you will keep this affair a secret for some time.\n\n\"I am, dear Sir, your very humble servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nThe negociation of Johnson with the manager of Covent Garden was effective. \"Colman,\" he says, \"was prevailed on at last by much solicitation, nay, a kind of force,\" to bring forward the comedy. Still the manager was ungenerous; or, at least, indiscreet enough to express his opinion that it would not reach a second representation. The plot, he said, was bad, and the interest not sustained; \"it dwindled, and dwindled, and at last went off like the snuff of a candle.\" The effect of his croaking was soon apparent within the walls of the theatre. Two of the most popular actors, Woodward and Gentleman Smith, to whom the parts of Tony Lumpkin and Young Marlow were assigned, refused to act them; one of them alleging, in excuse, the evil predictions of the manager. Goldsmith was advised to postpone the performance of his play until he could get those important parts well supplied. \"No,\" said he, \"I would sooner that my play were damned by bad players than merely saved by good acting.\"\n\nQuick was substituted for Woodward in Tony Lumpkin, and Lee Lewis, the harlequin of the theatre, for Gentleman Smith in Young Marlow; and both did justice to their parts.\n\nGreat interest was taken by Goldsmith's friends in the success of his piece. The rehearsals were attended by Johnson, Cradock, Murphy, Reynolds and his sister, and the whole Horneck connexion, including, of course, the Jessamy Bride, whose presence may have contributed to flutter the anxious heart of the author. The rehearsals went off with great applause, but that Colman attributed to the partiality of friends. He continued to croak, and refused to incur any\nexpense in new scenery or dresses on a play which he was sure would prove a failure.\n\nThe time was at hand for the first representation, and as yet the comedy was without a title. \"We are all in labour for a name for Goldy's play,\" said Johnson, who, as usual, took a kind of fatherly protecting interest in poor Goldsmith's affairs. \"The Old House a New Inn\" was thought of for a time, but still did not please. Sir Joshua Reynolds proposed \"The Belle's Stratagem,\" an elegant title, but not considered applicable, the perplexities of the comedy being produced by the mistake of the hero, not the stratagem of the heroine. The name was afterwards adopted by Mrs. Cowley for one of her comedies. \"The Mistakes of a Night\" was the title at length fixed upon, to which Goldsmith prefixed the words, \"She Stoops to Conquer.\"\n\nThe evil bodings of Colman still continued: they were even communicated in the box office to the servant of the Duke of Gloucester, who was sent to engage a box. Never did the play of a popular writer struggle into existence through greater difficulties.\n\nIn the meantime Foote's \"Primitive Puppetshow,\" entitled \"The Handsome Housemaid, or Piety on Pattens,\" had been brought out at the Haymarket on the 15th of February. All the world, fashionable and unfashionable, had crowded to the theatre. The street was thronged with equipages\u2014the doors were stormed by the mob. The burlesque was completely successful, and sentimental comedy received its quietus. Even Garrick, who had recently befriended it, now gave it a kick, as he saw it going down hill, and sent Goldsmith a humorous prologue to help his comedy of the opposite school. Garrick and Goldsmith, however, were now on very cordial terms, to which the social meetings in the circle of the Hornecks and Bunburys may have contributed.\n\nOn the 15th of March, the new comedy was to be performed. Those who had stood up for its merits, and been irritated and disgusted by the treatment it had received from the manager, determined to muster their forces, and aid in giving it a good launch upon the town. The particulars of this confederation, and of its triumphant success, are amusingly told by Cumberland in his memoirs.\n\n\"We were not over sanguine of success, but perfectly\ndetermined to struggle hard for our author. We accordingly assembled our strength at the Shakspeare Tavern, in a considerable body, for an early dinner, where Samuel Johnson took the chair at the head of a long table, and was the life and soul of the corps: the poet took post silently by his side, with the Burkes, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Fitzherbert, Caleb Whitefoord, and a phalanx of North British predetermined applauders, under the banner of Major Mills, all good men and true. Our illustrious president was in inimitable glee; and poor Goldsmith that day took all his raillery as patiently and complacently as my friend Boswell would have done any day or every day of his life. In the meantime we did not forget our duty, and though we had a better comedy going, in which Johnson was chief actor, we betook ourselves in good time to our separate and allotted posts, and waited the awful drawing up of the curtain. As our stations were preconcerted, so were our signals for plaudits arranged and determined upon, in a manner that gave everyone his cue where to look for them, and how to follow them up.\n\n\"We had among us a very worthy and efficient member, long since lost to his friends and the world at large, Adam Drummond, of amiable memory, who was gifted by nature with the most sonorous, and at the same time the most contagious, laugh that ever echoed from the human lungs. The neighing of the horse of the son of Hystaspes was a whisper to it; the whole thunder of the theatre could not drown it. This kind and ingenious friend fairly forewarned us that he knew no more when to give his fire, than the cannon did that was planted on a battery. He desired, therefore, to have a flapper at his elbow, and I had the honour to be deputed to that office. I planted him in an upper box, pretty nearly over the stage, in full view of the pit and galleries, and perfectly well situated to give the echo all its play through the hollows and recesses of the theatre. The success of our manoeuvre was complete. All eyes were upon Johnson, who sat in a front row of a side box; and when he laughed, everybody thought themselves warranted to roar. In the meantime, my friend followed signals with a rattle so irresistibly comic, that, when he had repeated it several times, the attention of the spectators was so engrossed by his person and performances, that the progress of the play seemed likely to\nbecome a secondary object, and I found it prudent to insinuate to him that he might halt his music, without any prejudice to the author; but alas! it was now too late to rein him in; he had laughed, upon my signal, where he found no joke, and now, unluckily, he fancied that he found a joke in almost everything that was said, so that nothing in nature could be more mal-apropos than some of his bursts every now and then were. These were dangerous moments, for the pit began to take umbrage; \"but we carried our point through, and triumphed, not only over Colman's judgment, but our own.\"\n\nMuch of this statement has been condemned as exaggerated or discoloured. Cumberland's memoirs have generally been characterised as partaking of romance, and in the present instance he had particular motives for tampering with the truth. He was a dramatic writer himself, jealous of the success of a rival, and anxious to have it attributed to the private management of friends. According to various accounts, public and private, such management was unnecessary, for the piece was \"received throughout with the greatest acclamations.\"\n\nGoldsmith, in the present instance, had not dared, as on a former occasion, to be present at the first performance. He had been so overcome by his apprehensions, that, at the preparatory dinner, he could hardly utter a word, and was so choked that he could not swallow a mouthful. When his friends trooped to the theatre, he stole away to St. James's Park: there he was found by a friend, between seven and eight o'clock, wandering up and down the Mall like a troubled spirit. With difficulty he was persuaded to go to the theatre, where his presence might be important should any alteration be necessary. He arrived at the opening of the fifth act, and made his way behind the scenes. Just as he entered there was a slight hiss, at the improbability of Tony Lumpkin's trick on his mother, in persuading her she was forty miles off, on Crackscull Common, though she had been trundled about on her own grounds. \"What's that? What's that?\" cried Goldsmith to the manager, in great agitation. \"Pshaw! Doctor,\" replied Colman, sarcastically, \"don't be frightened at a squib, when we've been sitting these two hours on a barrel of gunpowder!\" Though of a most forgiving nature,\nGoldsmith did not easily forget this ungracious and ill-timed sally.\n\nIf Colman was, indeed, actuated by the paltry motives ascribed to him in his treatment of this play, he was most amply punished by its success, and by the taunts, epigrams, and censures levelled at him through the press, in which his false prophecies were jeered at, his critical judgment called in question, and he was openly taxed with literary jealousy. So galling and unremitting was the fire, that he at length wrote to Goldsmith, entreating him \"to take him off the rack of the newspapers;\" in the meantime, to escape the laugh that was raised about him in the theatrical world of London, he took refuge in Bath during the triumphant career of the comedy.\n\nThe following is one of the many squibs which assailed the ears of the manager:\n\n\"To George Colman, Esq.,\n\n\"On the success of Dr. Goldsmith's new Comedy.\"\n\n\"Come, Coley, doff those mourning weeds,\nNor thus with jokes be flamm'd:\nTho' Goldsmith's present play succeeds,\nHis next may still be damm'd.\nAs this has 'scaped without a fall,\nTo sink his next prepare;\nNow actors hire from Wapping Wall,\nAnd dresses from Rag Fair.\nFor scenes let tatter'd blankets fly,\nThe prologue Kelly write;\nThen swear again the piece must die\nBefore the author's night.\nShould these tricks fail, the lucky elf,\nTo bring to lasting shame,\nE'en write the best you can yourself;\nAnd print it in his name.\"\n\nThe solitary hiss, which had startled Goldsmith, was ascribed by some of the newspaper scribblers to Cumberland himself, who was \"manifestly miserable\" at the delight of the audience, or to Ossian Macpherson, who was hostile to the whole Johnson clique, or to Goldsmith's dramatic rival, Kelly. The following is one of the epigrams which appeared:\n\n\"At Dr. Goldsmith's merry play,\nAll the spectators laugh? they say,\"\nThe assertion, Sir, I must deny,\nFor Cumberland and Kelly cry.\nRide, st sapi.\"\n\nAnother, addressed to Goldsmith, alludes to Kelly's early apprenticeship to stay-making:\n\n\"If Kelly finds fault with the shape of your muse,\nAnd thinks that too loosely it plays,\nHe surely, dear Doctor, will never refuse\nTo make it a new Pair of Stays!\"\n\nCradock had returned to the country before the production of the play; the following letter, written just after the performance, gives an additional picture of the thorns which beset an author in the path of theatrical literature:\n\n\"My Dear Sir,\u2014The play has met with a success much beyond your expectations or mine. I thank you sincerely for your epilogue, which, however, could not be used, but with your permission shall be printed. The story, in short, is this. Murphy sent me rather the outline of an epilogue than an epilogue, which was to be sung by Miss Catley, and which she approved; Mrs. Bulkley, hearing this, insisted on throwing up her part (Miss Hardcastle) unless, according to the custom of the theatre, she were permitted to speak the epilogue. In this embarrassment, I thought of making a quarrelling epilogue between Catley and her, debating who should speak the epilogue; but then, Miss Catley refused, after I had taken the trouble of drawing it out. I was then at a loss indeed; an epilogue was to be made, and for none but Mrs. Bulkley. I made one, and Colman thought it too bad to be spoken; I was obliged, therefore, to try a fourth time, and I made a very mawkish thing, as you will shortly see. Such is the history of my stage adventures, and which I have at last done with. I cannot help saying that I am very sick of the stage; and though I believe I shall get three tolerable benefits, yet I shall on the whole, be a loser, even in a pecuniary light: my ease and comfort I certainly lost while it was in agitation.\n\n\"I am, my dear Cradock,\n\n\"Your obliged and obedient servant,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\n\n\"P.S.\u2014Present my most humble respects to Mrs. Cradock.\"\n\nJohnson, who had taken such a conspicuous part in promoting the interests of poor \"Goldy,\" was triumphant at the success of the piece. \"I know of no comedy for many years,\" said he, \"that has so much exhilarated an audience; that has answered so much the great end of comedy\u2014making an audience merry.\"\n\nGoldsmith was happy also in gleaning applause from less\nauthoritative sources. Northcote, the painter, then a youthful pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Ralph, Sir Joshua's confidential man, had taken their stations in the gallery to lead the applause in that quarter. Goldsmith asked Northcote's opinion of the play. The youth modestly declared he could not presume to judge in such matters. \"Did it make you laugh?\" \"Oh, exceedingly!\" \"That is all I require,\" replied Goldsmith; and rewarded him for his criticism by box-tickets for his first benefit night.\n\nThe comedy was immediately put to press, and dedicated to Johnson in the following grateful and affectionate terms:\n\n\"In inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the interests of mankind, also, to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in a character, without impairing the most unaffected piety.\"\n\nThe copyright was transferred to Mr. Newbery, according to agreement, whose profits on the sale of the work far exceeded the debts for which the author, in his perplexities, had pre-engaged it. The sum which accrued to Goldsmith from his benefit nights, afforded but a slight palliation of his pecuniary difficulties. His friends, while they exulted in his success, little knew of his continually increasing embarrassments, and of the anxiety of mind which kept tasking his pen, while it impaired the ease and freedom of spirit necessary to felicitous composition.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nThe triumphant success of \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" brought forth, of course, those carpings and cavillings of underling scribblers, which are the thorns and briars in the path of successful authors. Goldsmith, though easily nettled by attacks of the kind, was at present too well satisfied with the reception of his comedy to heed them; but the following anonymous letter, which appeared in a public paper, was not to be taken with equal equanimity:\n\"Sir,\u2014The happy knack which you have learned of puffing your own compositions, provokes me to come forth. You have not been the editor of newspapers and magazines not to discover the trick of literary humbug; but the gauze is so thin that the very foolish part of the world see through it, and discover the doctor's monkey face and cloven foot. Your poetic vanity is as unpardonable as your personal. Would men believe it, and will women bear it, to be told that for hours the great Goldsmith will stand surveying his grotesque orang-outang's figure in a pier glass? Was but the lovely H\u2014\u2014k as much enamoured, you would not sigh, my gentle swain, in vain. But your vanity is preposterous. How will this same bard of Bedlam ring the changes in the praise of Goldy? But what has he to be either proud or vain of? 'The Traveller' is a flimsy poem, built upon false principles\u2014principles diametrically opposite to liberty. What is the 'Goodnatured Man' but a poor water-gruel dramatic dose? What is 'The Deserted Village,' but a pretty poem of easy numbers, without fancy, dignity, genius, or fire? And pray what may be the last speaking pantomime, so praised by the doctor himself, but an incoherent piece of stuff, the figure of a woman with a fish's tail, without plot, incident, or intrigue? We are made to laugh at stale, dull jokes, wherein we mistake pleasantry for wit, and grimace for humour\u2014wherein every scene is unnatural, and inconsistent with the rules, the laws of nature, and of the drama, viz., two gentlemen come to a man of fortune's house, eat, drink, &c., and take it for an inn. The one is intended as a lover for the daughter; he talks with her for some hours, and, when he sees her again in a different dress, he treats her as a bar-girl, and swears she squinted. He abuses the master of the house, and threatens to kick him out of his own doors. The squire, whom we are told is to be a fool, proves to be the most sensible being of the piece; and he makes out a whole act by bidding his mother lie close behind a bush, persuading her that his father, her own husband, is a highwayman, and that he has come to cut their throats; and to give his cousin an opportunity to go off, he drives his mother over hedges, ditches, and through ponds. There is not, sweet, sucking Johnson, a natural stroke in the whole play, but the young fellow's giving the stolen jewels to the mother, supposing her to be the landlady. That Mr. Colman did no justice to this piece, I honestly allow; that he told all his friends it would be damned, I positively aver; and from such ungenerous insinuations, without a dramatic merit, it rose to public notice, and it is now the ton to go and see it, though I never saw a person that either liked or approved it, any more than the absurd plot of Home's tragedy of \"Alonzo.\" Mr. Goldsmith, correct your arrogance, reduce your vanity, and endeavour to believe\u2014as\na man, you are of the plainest sort; and, as an author, but a mortal piece of mediocrity.\n\n'Brise le miroir infid\u00e8le\nQui vous cache la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.'\n\n\"It would be difficult to devise a letter more calculated to wound the peculiar sensibilities of Goldsmith. The attacks upon him as an author, though annoying enough, he could have tolerated; but then the allusion to his \"grotesque\" person, to his studious attempts to adorn it; and, above all, to his being an unsuccessful admirer of the lovely H\u2014k (the Jessamy Bride), struck rudely upon the most sensitive part of his highly sensitive nature. The paragraph, it is said, was first pointed out to him by an officious friend, an Irishman, who told him he was bound in honour to resent it; but he needed no such prompting. He was in a high state of excitement and indignation, and accompanied by his friend, who is said to have been a Captain Higgins of the Marines, he repaired to Paternoster Row, to the shop of Evans, the publisher, whom he supposed to be the editor of the paper. Evans was summoned by his shopman from an adjoining room; Goldsmith announced his name. \"I have called,\" added he, \"in consequence of a scurrilous attack made upon me, and an unwarrantable liberty taken with the name of a young lady. As for myself, I care little; but her name must not be sported with.\"\n\nEvans professed utter ignorance of the matter, and said he would speak to the editor. He stooped to examine a file of the paper, in search of the offensive article; whereupon Goldsmith's friend gave him a signal, that now was a favourable moment for the exercise of his cane. The hint was taken as quick as given, and the cane was vigorously applied to the back of the stooping publisher. The latter rallied in an instant, and, being a stout, high-blooded Welshman, returned the blows with interest. A lamp hanging overhead was broken, and sent down a shower of oil upon the combatants; but the battle raged with unceasing fury. The shopman ran off for a constable; but Dr. Kenrick, who happened to be in the adjacent room, sallied forth, interfered between the combatants, and put an end to the affray. He conducted Goldsmith to a coach, in exceedingly battered and tattered plight,\nand accompanied him home, soothing him with much mock commiseration, though he was generally suspected, and on good grounds, to be the author of the libel.\n\nEvans immediately instituted a suit against Goldsmith for an assault, but was ultimately prevailed upon to compromise the matter, the poet contributing fifty pounds to the Welsh charity.\n\nNewspapers made themselves, as may well be supposed, exceedingly merry with the combat. Some censured him severely for invading the sanctity of a man's own house; others accused him of having, in his former capacity of editor of a magazine, been guilty of the very offences that he now resented in others. This drew from him the following vindication:\n\n\"To the Public.\n\n\"Lest it should be supposed that I have been willing to correct in others an abuse of which I have been guilty myself, I beg leave to declare that in all my life I never wrote or dictated a single paragraph, letter, or essay in a newspaper, except a few moral essays under the character of a Chinese, about ten years ago, in the 'Ledger,' and a letter, to which I signed my name, in the 'St. James's Chronicle.' If the liberty of the press, therefore, has been abused, I have had no hand in it.\n\n\"I have always considered the press as the protector of our freedom, as a watchful guardian, capable of uniting the weak against the encroachments of power. What concerns the public, most properly admits of a public discussion. But, of late, the press has turned from defending public interest to making inroads upon private life; from combating the strong to overwhelming the feeble. No condition is now too obscure for its abuse, and the protector has become the tyrant of the people. In this manner, the freedom of the press is beginning to sow the seeds of its own dissolution; the great must oppose it from principle, and the weak from fear; till at last every rank of mankind shall be found to give up its benefits, content with security from insult.\n\n\"How to put a stop to this licentiousness, by which all are indiscriminately abused, and by which vice consequently escapes in the general censure, I am unable to tell; all I could wish is, that, as the law gives us no protection against the injury, so it should give calumniators no shelter after having provoked correction. The insults which we receive before the public, by being more open, are the more distressing; by treating them with silent contempt, we do not pay a sufficient deference to the opinion of the world. By recurring to legal redress, we too often expose the weakness of the law, which only serves to increase our mortification by failing to relieve us. In short, every man should singly consider himself as the guardian of the liberty of the press, and,\nBOSWELL'S RELIGIOUS ADVICE.\n\nas far as his influence can extend, should endeavour to prevent its licentiousness becoming at last the grave of its freedom.\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nBoswell, who had just arrived in town, met with this article in a newspaper which he found at Dr. Johnson's. The doctor was from home at the time, and Bozzy and Mrs. Williams, in a critical conference over the letter, determined from the style that it must have been written by the lexicographer himself. The latter on his return soon undeceived them. \"Sir,\" said he to Boswell, \"Goldsmith would no more have asked me to have wrote such a thing as that for him, than he would have asked me to feed him with a spoon, or do anything else that denoted his imbecility. Sir, had he shown it to any one friend, he would not have been allowed to publish it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a foolish thing well done. I suppose he has been so much elated with the success of his new comedy, that he has thought everything that concerned him must be of importance to the public.\"\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nThe return of Boswell to town to his task of noting down the conversations of Johnson, enables us to glean from his journal some scanty notices of Goldsmith. It was now Holy-Week, a time, during which Johnson was particularly solemn in his manner and strict in his devotions. Boswell, who was the imitator of the great moralist in everything, assumed, of course, an extra devoutness on the present occasion. \"He had an odd mock solemnity of tone and manner,\" said Miss Burney, (afterwards Madame d'Arblay,) \"which he had acquired from constantly thinking of, and imitating Dr. Johnson.\" It would seem that he undertook to deal out some second-hand homilies, *\u00e0 la* Johnson, for the edification of Goldsmith during Holy-Week. The poet, whatever might be his religious feeling, had no disposition to be schooled by so shallow an apostle. \"Sir,\" said he in reply, \"as I take my shoes from the shoemaker, and my coat from the tailor, so I take my religion from the priest.\"\n\nBoswell treasured up the reply in his memory or his memorandum-book. A few days afterwards, the 9th of April, he\nkept Good Friday with Dr. Johnson, in orthodox style; breakfasted with him on tea and crossbuns; went to church with him morning and evening; fasted in the interval, and read with him in the Greek Testament; then, in the piety of his heart, complained of the sore rebuff he had met with in the course of his religious exhortations to the poet, and lamented that the latter should indulge in \"this loose way of talking.\" \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"Goldsmith knows nothing\u2014he has made up his mind about nothing.\"\n\nThis reply seems to have gratified the lurking jealousy of Boswell, and he has recorded it in his journal. Johnson, however, with respect to Goldsmith, and indeed with respect to everybody else, blew hot, as well as cold, according to the humour he was in. Boswell, who was astonished and piqued at the continually increasing celebrity of the poet, observed some time after to Johnson, in a tone of surprise, that Goldsmith had acquired more fame than all the officers of the last war who were not generals. \"Why, sir,\" answered Johnson, his old feeling of good-will working uppermost, \"you will find ten thousand fit to do what they did, before you find one to do what Goldsmith has done. You must consider that a thing is valued according to its rarity. A pebble that paves the street is in itself more useful than the diamond upon a lady's finger.\"\n\nOn the 13th of April, we find Goldsmith and Johnson at the table of old General Oglethorpe, discussing the question of the degeneracy of the human race. Goldsmith asserts the fact, and attributes it to the influence of luxury. Johnson denies the fact; and observes, that even admitting it, luxury could not be the cause. It reached but a small proportion of the human race. Soldiers, on sixpence a day, could not indulge in luxuries; the poor and laboring classes, forming the great mass of mankind, were out of its sphere. Wherever it could reach them, it strengthened them, and rendered them prolific. The conversation was not of particular force or point, as reported by Boswell: the dinner party was a very small one, in which there was no provocation to intellectual display.\n\nAfter dinner they took tea with the ladies, where we find poor Goldsmith happy and at home, singing Tony Lumpkin's song of the \"Three Jolly Pigeons,\" and another, called the \"Humours of Ballamaguery,\" to a very pretty Irish tune.\nIt was to have been introduced in \"She Stoops to Conquer,\" but was left out, as the actress who played the heroine could not sing.\n\nIt was in these genial moments that the sunshine of Goldsmith's nature would break out, and he would say and do a thousand whimsical and agreeable things, that made him the life of the strictly social circle. Johnson, with whom conversation was everything, used to judge Goldsmith too much by his own colloquial standard, and undervalue him for being less provided than himself with acquired facts, the ammunition of the tongue, and often the mere lumber of the memory; others, however, valued him for the native felicity of his thoughts, however carelessly expressed, and for certain good-fellow qualities, less calculated to dazzle than to endear. \"It is amazing,\" said Johnson one day, after he himself had been talking like an oracle; \"it is amazing how little Goldsmith knows; he seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else.\" \"Yet,\" replied Sir Joshua Reynolds, with affectionate promptness, \"there is no man whose company is more liked.\"\n\nTwo or three days after the dinner at General Oglethorpe's, Goldsmith met Johnson again at the table of General Paoli, the hero of Corsica. Martinelli, of Florence, author of an Italian History of England, was among the guests; as was Boswell, to whom we are indebted for minutes of the conversation which took place. The question was debated whether Martinelli should continue his history down to that day. \"To be sure he should,\" said Goldsmith. \"No, sir;\" cried Johnson, \"it would give great offence. He would have to tell of almost all the living great what they did not wish told.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"It may, perhaps, be necessary for a native to be more cautious; but a foreigner, who comes among us without prejudice, may be considered as holding the place of a judge, and may speak his mind freely.\" Johnson.\u2014\"Sir, a foreigner, when he sends a work from the press, ought to be on his guard against catching the error and mistaken enthusiasm of the people among whom he happens to be.\" Goldsmith.\u2014Sir, he wants only to sell his history, and to tell truth: one an honest, the other a laudable motive.\" Johnson.\u2014\"Sir, they are both laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wish to live by his labours; but he should write so as he may live by them,\nnot so as he may be knocked on the head. I would advise him to be at Calais before he publishes his history of the present age. A foreigner who attaches himself to a political party in this country is in the worst state that can be imagined; he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it from interest.\" Boswell.\u2014\" Or principle.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely, then, one may tell truth with perfect safety.\" Johnson.\u2014\"Why, sir, in the first place, he who tells a hundred lies has disarmed the force of his lies. But, besides, a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him, than one truth which he does not wish to be told.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"For my part, I'd tell the truth, and shame the devil.\" Johnson.\u2014\"Yes, sir, but the devil will be angry. I wish to shame the devil as much as you do, but I should choose to be out of the reach of his claws.\" Goldsmith.\u2014\"His claws can do you no hurt where you have the shield of truth.\"\n\nThis last reply was one of Goldsmith's lucky hits, and closed the argument in his favour.\n\n\"We talked,\" writes Boswell, \"of the king's coming to see Goldsmith's new play.\" \"I wish he would,\" said Goldsmith, adding, however, with an affected indifference, \"not that it would do me the least good.\" \"Well, then,\" cried Johnson, laughing, \"let us say it would do him good. No, sir, this affectation will not pass; it is mighty idle. In such a state as ours, who would not wish to please the chief magistrate!\"\n\n\"I do wish to please him,\" rejoined Goldsmith, \"I remember a line in Dryden:\n\n'And every poet is the monarch's friend;\nit ought to be reversed.' \" Nay,\" said Johnson, \"there are finer lines in Dryden on this subject:\n\n'For colleges on bounteous kings depend,\nAnd never rebel was to arts a friend.'\"\n\nGeneral Paoli observed that \"successful rebels might be.\" \"Happy rebellions,\" interjected Martinelli. \"We have no such phrase,\" cried Goldsmith. \"But have you not the thing?\" asked Paoli. \"Yes,\" replied Goldsmith, \"all our happy revolutions. They have hurt our constitution, and will hurt it, till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION.\"\nThis was a sturdy sally of Jacobitism, that quite surprised Boswell, but must have been relished by Johnson.\n\nGeneral Paoli mentioned a passage in the play, which had been construed into a compliment to a lady of distinction, whose marriage with the Duke of Cumberland had excited the strong disapprobation of the king, as a m\u00e9salliance. Boswell, to draw Goldsmith out, pretended to think the compliment unintentional. The poet smiled, and hesitated. The general came to his relief. \"Monsieur Goldsmith,\" said he, \"est comme la mer, qui jette des perles et beaucoup d'autres belles choses, sans s'en appercevoir.\" (Mr. Goldsmith is like the sea, which casts forth pearls and many other beautiful things without perceiving it.)\n\n\"Tr\u00e8s-bien dit, et tr\u00e8s-\u00e9l\u00e9gamment,\" (very well said, and very elegantly,) exclaimed Goldsmith; delighted with so beautiful a compliment from such a quarter.\n\nJohnson spoke disparagingly of the learning of a Mr. Harris, of Salisbury, and doubted his being a good Grecian. \"He is what is much better,\" cried Goldsmith, with prompt good nature, \"he is a worthy, humane man.\" \"Nay, sir,\" rejoined the logical Johnson, \"that is not to the purpose of our argument; that will prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian.\" Goldsmith found he had got into a scrape, and seized upon Giardini to help him out of it. \"The greatest musical performers,\" said he, dexterously turning the conversation, \"have but small emoluments; Giardini, I am told, does not get above seven hundred a year.\" \"That is indeed but little for a man to get,\" observed Johnson, \"who does best that which so many endeavour to do. There is nothing, I think, in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing on the fiddle. In all other things we can do something at first. Any man will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not so well as a smith, but tolerably. A man will saw a piece of wood, and make a box, though a clumsy one; but give him a fiddle and fiddlestick, and he can do nothing.\"\n\nThis, upon the whole, though reported by the one-sided Boswell, is a tolerable specimen of the conversation of Goldsmith and Johnson; the former heedless, often illogical, always on the kind-hearted side of the question, and prone to redeem himself by lucky hits; the latter closely argumenta-\ntive, studiously sententious, often profound, and sometimes laboriously prosaic.\n\nThey had an argument a few days later at Mr. Thrale's table, on the subject of suicide. \"Do you think, sir,\" said Boswell, \"that all who commit suicide are mad?\" \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"they are not often universally disordered in their intellects, but one passion presses so upon them that they yield to it, and commit suicide, as a passionate man will stab another. I have often thought,\" added he, \"that after a man has taken the resolution to kill himself, it is not courage in him to do anything, however desperate, because he has nothing to fear.\" \"I don't see that,\" observed Goldsmith. \"Nay, but my dear sir,\" rejoined Johnson, \"why should you not see what every one else does?\" \"It is,\" replied Goldsmith, \"for fear of something that he has resolved to kill himself; and will not that timid disposition restrain him?\" \"It does not signify,\" pursued Johnson, \"that the fear of something made him resolve; it was upon the state of his mind, after the resolution is taken, that I argue. Suppose a man, either from fear, or pride, or conscience, or whatever motive, has resolved to kill himself; when once the resolution is taken he has nothing to fear. He may then go and take the King of Prussia by the nose at the head of his army. He cannot fear the rack who is determined to kill himself.\" Boswell reports no more of the discussion, though Goldsmith might have continued it with advantage; for the very timid disposition, which, through fear of something, was impelling the man to commit suicide, might restrain him from an act, involving the punishment of the rack, more terrible to him than death itself.\n\nIt is to be regretted in all these reports by Boswell, we have scarcely anything but the remarks of Johnson; it is only by accident that he now and then gives us the observations of others, when they are necessary to explain or set off those of his hero. \"When in that presence\" says Miss Burney, \"he was unobservant, if not contemptuous, of every one else. In truth, when he met with Dr. Johnson, he commonly forebore even answering anything that was said, or attending to anything that went forward, lest he should miss the smallest sound from that voice, to which he paid such exclusive, though merited, homage. But the moment that voice burst forth, the attention which it excited on Mr. Boswell amounted almost to\npain. His eyes goggled with eagerness; he leant his ear almost on the shoulder of the Doctor; and his mouth dropped open to catch every syllable that might be uttered; nay, he seemed not only to dread losing a word, but to be anxious not to miss a breathing; as if hoping from it latently, or mystically, some information.\"\n\nOn one occasion, the Doctor detected Boswell, or Bozzy as he called him, eavesdropping behind his chair, as he was conversing with Miss Burney at Mr. Thrale's table. \"What are you doing there, sir?\" cried he, turning round angrily, and clapping his hand upon his knee; \"Go to the table, sir.\"\n\nBoswell obeyed, with an air of affright and submission which raised a smile on every face. Scarce had he taken his seat, however, at a distance than, impatient to get again at the side of Johnson, he rose, and was running off in quest of something to show him, when the doctor roared after him authoritatively, \"What are you thinking of, sir? Why do you get up before the cloth is removed? Come back to your place, sir:\"\u2014and the obsequious spaniel did as he was commanded.\u2014\"Running about in the middle of meals!\" muttered the Doctor, pursing his mouth at the same time to restrain his rising risibility.\n\nBoswell got another rebuff from Johnson, which would have demolished any other man. He had been teasing him with many direct questions, such as \"What did you do, sir?\"\u2014\"What did you say, sir?\" until the great philologist became perfectly enraged. \"I will not be put to the question!\" roared he. \"Don't you consider, sir, that these are not the manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with what and why; What is this? What is that? Why is a cow's tail long? Why is a fox's tail bushy?\" \"Why, sir,\" replied pil-garlick, \"you are so good that I venture to trouble you.\" \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"my being so good is no reason why you should be so ill.\" \"You have but two topics, sir,\" exclaimed he, on another occasion, \"yourself and me, and I am sick of both.\"\n\nBoswell's inveterate disposition to toad was a sore cause of mortification to his father, the old laird of Auchinleck (or Affleck). He had been annoyed by his extravagant devotion to Pauli, but then he was something of a military hero; but this tagging at the heels of Dr. Johnson, whom he considered\na kind of pedagogue, set his Scotch blood in a ferment. \"Ther's nae hope for Jamie, mon,\" said he to a friend; \"Jamie is gaen clean gyte. What do you think, mon? He's done wi' Paoli; he's off wi' the land-louping scoundrel of a Corsican; and whose tail do you think he has pinn'd himself to now, mon? A dominie, mon; an auld dominie: he keepeed a schule, and cau'd it an acadamy.\"\n\nWe shall show in the next chapter that Jamie's devotion to the dominie did not go unrewarded.\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nThe Literary Club (as we have termed the club in Gerard Street, though it took that name some time later) had now been in existence several years. Johnson was exceedingly chary at first of its exclusiveness, and opposed to its being augmented in number. Not long after its institution, Sir Joshua Reynolds was speaking of it to Garrick. \"I like it much,\" said little David, briskly: \"I think I shall be of you.\" \"When Sir Joshua mentioned this to Dr. Johnson,\" says Boswell, \"he was much displeased with the actor's conceit. 'He'll be of us!' growled he: 'How does he know we will permit him? The first duke in England has no right to hold such language.'\n\nWhen Sir John Hawkins spoke favourably of Garrick's pretensions, \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"he will disturb us by his buffoonery.\" In the same spirit he declared to Mr. Thrale, that if Garrick should apply for admission, he would black-ball him. \"Who, sir?\" exclaimed Thrale, with surprise: \"Mr. Garrick\u2014your friend, your companion\u2014black-ball him?\" \"Why, sir,\" replied Johnson, \"I love my little David dearly\u2014better than all or any of his flatterers do; but surely one ought to sit in a society like ours,\n\n'Unelbowed by a gamester, pimp, or player.'\"\n\nThe exclusion from the club was a sore mortification to Garrick, though he bore it without complaining. He could not help continually to ask questions about it\u2014what was going on there?\u2014whether he was ever the subject of conversation? By degrees, the rigour of the club relaxed; some of the members grew negligent. Beauclerc lost his right of membership\nby neglecting to attend. On his marriage, however, with Lady Diana Spencer, daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, and recently divorced from Viscount Bolingbroke, he had claimed and regained his seat in the club. The number of members had likewise been augmented. The proposition to increase it originated with Goldsmith. \"It would give,\" he thought, \"an agreeable variety to their meetings; for there can be nothing new amongst us,\" said he; \"we have travelled over each other's minds.\" Johnson was piqued at the suggestion. \"Sir,\" said he, \"you have not travelled over my mind, I promise you.\" Sir Joshua, less confident in the exhaustless fecundity of his mind, felt and acknowledged the force of Goldsmith's suggestion. Several new members, therefore, had been added; the first, to his great joy, was David Garrick. Goldsmith, who was now on cordial terms with him, had zealously promoted his election, and Johnson had given it his warm approbation. Another new member was Beauclerc's friend, Lord Charlemont; and a still more important one was Mr., afterwards Sir William Jones, the famous Orientalist, at that time a young lawyer of the Temple, and a distinguished scholar.\n\nTo the great astonishment of the club, Johnson now proposed his devoted follower, Boswell, as a member. He did it in a note addressed to Goldsmith, who presided on the evening of the 23rd of April. The nomination was seconded by Beauclerc. According to the rules of the Club, the ballot would take place at the next meeting (on the 30th); there was an intervening week, therefore, in which to discuss the pretensions of the candidate. We may easily imagine the discussions that took place. Boswell had made himself absurd in such a variety of ways, that the very idea of his admission was exceedingly irksome to some of the members. \"The honour of being elected into the Turk's Head Club,\" said the Bishop of St. Asaph, \"is not inferior to that of being representative of Westminster and Surrey:\" what had Boswell done to merit such an honour? What chance had he of gaining it? The answer was simple: he had been the persevering worshipper, if not sycophant of Johnson. The great lexicographer had a heart to be won by apparent affection; he stood forth authoritatively in support of his vassal. If asked to state the merits of the candidate, he summed them up in an indefinite, but comprehensive word of his own.\ncoining: he was clubable. He, moreover, gave significant hints, that if Boswell were kept out, he should oppose the admission of any other candidate. No further opposition was made: in fact, none of the members had been so fastidious and exclusive in regard to the club as Johnson himself; and if he were pleased, they were easily satisfied: besides, they knew that, with all his faults, Boswell was a cheerful companion, and possessed lively social qualities.\n\nOn Friday, when the ballot was to take place, Beauclerc gave a dinner, at his house in the Adelphi, where Boswell met several of the members who were favourable to his election. After dinner the latter adjourned to the club, leaving Boswell in company with Lady Di Beauclerc until the fate of his election should be known. He sat, he says, in a state of anxiety, which even the charming conversation of Lady Di could not entirely dissipate. It was not long before tidings were brought of his election, and he was conducted to the place of meeting, where, beside the company he had met at dinner, Burke, Dr. Nugent, Garrick, Goldsmith, and Mr. William Jones, were waiting to receive him. The club, notwithstanding all its learned dignity in the eyes of the world, could at times \"unbend and play the fool\" as well as less important bodies. Some of its jocose conversations have at times leaked out, and a society in which Goldsmith could venture to sing his song of \"An Old Woman tossed in a Blanket,\" could not be so very staid in its gravity. We may suppose, therefore, the jokes that had been passing among the members while awaiting the arrival of Boswell. Beauclerc himself could not have repressed his disposition for a sarcastic pleasantry. At least we have a right to presume all this from the conduct of Dr. Johnson himself.\n\nWith all his gravity, he possessed a deep fund of quiet humour, and felt a kind of whimsical responsibility to protect the club from the absurd propensities of the very questionable associate he had thus inflicted on them. Rising, therefore, as Boswell entered, he advanced with a very doctorial air, placed himself behind a chair, on which he leaned as on a desk or pulpit, and then delivered, ex cathedra, a mock solemn charge, pointing out the conduct expected from him as a good member of the club; what he was to do, and especially what he was to avoid; including in the latter, no doubt, all those petty, pry-\ning, questioning, gossiping, babbling habits which had so often grieved the spirit of the lexicographer. It is to be regretted that Boswell has never thought proper to note down the particulars of this charge, which, from the well-known characters and positions of the parties, might have furnished a parallel to the noted charge of Launcelot Gobbo to his dog.\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nA few days after the serio-comic scene of the elevation of Boswell into the Literary Club, we find that indefatigable biographer giving particulars of a dinner at the Dillys, booksellers in the Poultry, at which he met Goldsmith and Johnson, with several other literary characters. His anecdotes of the conversation of course go to glorify Dr. Johnson; for, as he observes in his biography, \"his conversation alone, or what led to it, or was interwoven with it, is the business of this work.\" Still, on the present, as on other occasions, he gives unintentional and perhaps unavoidable gleams of Goldsmith's good sense, which show that the latter only wanted a less prejudiced and more impartial reporter, to put down the charge of colloquial incapacity so unjustly fixed upon him. The conversation turned upon the natural history of birds, a beautiful subject, on which the poet, from his recent studies, his habits of observation, and his natural tastes, must have talked with instruction and feeling; yet, though we have much of what Johnson said, we have only a casual remark or two of Goldsmith. One was on the migration of swallows, which he pronounced partial; \"the stronger ones,\" said he, \"migrate, the others do not.\"\n\nJohnson denied to the brute creation the faculty of reason. \"Birds,\" said he, \"build by instinct; they never improve; they build their first nest as well as any one they ever build.\" \"Yet we see,\" observed Goldsmith, \"if you take away a bird's nest with the eggs in it, she will make a slighter nest and lay again.\" \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"that is because at first she has full time, and makes her nest deliberately. In the case you mention, she is pressed to lay, and must, therefore, make her nest quickly, and consequently it will be slight.\" \"The nidification of birds,\" rejoined Goldsmith, \"is what is least\nknown in natural history, though one of the most curious things in it.\" While conversation was going on in this placid, agreeable, and instructive manner, the eternal meddler and busy-body, Boswell, must intrude to put it in a brawl. The Dillys were dissenters; two of their guests were dissenting clergymen; another, Mr. Toplady, was a clergyman of the established church. Johnson himself was a zealous, uncompromising churchman. None but a Marplot like Boswell would have thought, on such an occasion, and in such company, to broach the subject of religious toleration; but, as has been well observed, \"it was his perverse inclination to introduce subjects that he hoped would produce difference and debate.\" In the present instance, he gained his point. An animated dispute immediately arose, in which, according to Boswell's report, Johnson monopolized the greater part of the conversation, not always treating the dissenting clergymen with the greatest courtesy, and even once wounding the feelings of the mild and amiable Bennet Langton by his harshness.\n\nGoldsmith mingled a little in the dispute, and with some advantage, but was cut short by flat contradictions when most in the right. He sat for a time silent, but impatient under such overbearing dogmatism, though Boswell, with his usual misinterpretation, attributes his \"restless agitation\" to a wish to get in and shine. \"Finding himself excluded,\" continues Boswell, \"he had taken his hat to go away, but remained for a time with it in his hand, like a gamester, who, at the end of a long night, lingers for a little while to see if he can have a favourable opportunity to finish with success.\" Once he was beginning to speak, when he was overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson, who was at the opposite end of the table, and did not perceive his attempt; whereupon he threw down, as it were, his hat and his argument, and darting an angry glance at Johnson, exclaimed in a bitter tone, \"Take it.\"\n\nJust then one of the disputants was beginning to speak, when Johnson uttered some sound, as if about to interrupt him, Goldsmith, according to Boswell, seized the opportunity to vent his own envy and spleen, under pretext of supporting another person. \"Sir,\" said he, to Johnson; \"the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray allow us now\nto hear him.\" It was a reproof in the lexicographer's own style, and he may have felt that he merited it; but he was not accustomed to be reproved. \"Sir,\" said he, sternly, \"I was not interrupting the gentleman; I was only giving him a signal of my attention. Sir, you are impertinent.\" Goldsmith made no reply, but after some time went away, having another engagement.\n\nThat evening, as Boswell was on the way with Johnson and Langton to the club, he seized the occasion to make some disparaging remarks on Goldsmith, which he thought would just then be acceptable to the great lexicographer. \"It was a pity,\" he said, \"that Goldsmith would, on every occasion, endeavour to shine, by which he so often exposed himself.\" Langton contrasted him with Addison, who, content with the fame of his writings, acknowledged himself unfit for conversation; and, on being taxed by a lady with silence in company, replied, \"Madam, I have but ninepence in ready money, but I can draw for a thousand pounds.\" To this Boswell rejoined, that Goldsmith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet, but was always taking out his purse. \"Yes, sir,\" chuckled Johnson, \"and that so often an empty purse.\"\n\nBy the time Johnson arrived at the club, however, his angry feelings had subsided, and his native generosity and sense of justice had got the uppermost. He found Goldsmith in company with Burke, Garrick, and other members, but sitting silent and apart, \"brooding,\" as Boswell says, \"over the reprimand he had received.\" Johnson's good heart yearned towards him; and knowing his placable nature, \"I'll make Goldsmith forgive me,\" whispered he; then, with a loud voice, \"Dr. Goldsmith,\" said he, \"something passed to-day where you and I dined\u2014I ask your pardon.\" The ire of the poet was extinguished in an instant, and his grateful affection for the magnanimous, though sometimes overbearing, moralist rushed to his heart. \"It must be much from you, sir,\" said he, \"that I take ill!\" \"And so,\" adds Boswell, \"the difference was over, and they were on as easy terms as ever, and Goldsmith rattled away as usual.\" We do not think these stories tell to the poet's disadvantage, even though related by Boswell.\n\nGoldsmith, with all his modesty, could not be ignorant of his proper merit; and must have felt annoyed, at times, at\nbeing undervalued and elbowed aside by light-minded or dull men, in their blind and exclusive homage to the literary autocrat. It was a fine reproof he gave to Boswell on one occasion, for talking of Johnson as entitled to the honour of exclusive superiority: \"Sir, you are for making a monarchy what should be a republic.\" On another occasion, when he was conversing in company with great vivacity, and apparently to the satisfaction of those around him, an honest Swiss who sat near, one George Michael Moser, keeper of the Royal Academy, perceiving Dr. Johnson rolling himself as if about to speak, exclaimed, \"Stay, stay! Toctor Shonson is going to say something.\" \"And are you sure, sir,\" replied Goldsmith, sharply, \"that you can comprehend what he says?\"\n\nThis clever rebuke, which gives the main zest to the anecdote, is omitted by Boswell, who probably did not perceive the point of it.\n\nHe relates another anecdote of the kind, on the authority of Johnson himself. The latter and Goldsmith were one evening in company with the Rev. George Graham, a master of Eton, who, notwithstanding the sobriety of his cloth, had got intoxicated \"to about the pitch of looking at one man and talking to another.\" \"Doctor,\" cried he, in an ecstasy of devotion and good-will, but goggling by mistake upon Goldsmith, \"I should be glad to see you at Eton.\" \"I shall be glad to wait upon you,\" replied Goldsmith, \"No, no!\" cried the other, eagerly; \"'tis not you I mean, Doctor Minor, 'tis Doctor Major there!\" \"You may easily conceive,\" said Johnson, in relating the anecdote, \"what effect this had upon Goldsmith, who was irascible as a hornet.\" The only comment, however, which he is said to have made, partakes more of quaint and dry humour than bitterness: \"That Graham,\" said he, \"is enough to make one commit suicide.\" What more could be said to express the intolerable nuisance of a consummate bore?\n\nWe have now given the last scenes between Goldsmith and Johnson which stand recorded by Boswell. The latter called on the poet a few days after the dinner at Dilly's to take leave of him prior to departing for Scotland; yet, even in this last interview, he contrives to get up a charge of \"jealousy and envy.\" Goldsmith, he would fain persuade us, is very angry that Johnson is going to travel with him in Scot-\nland; and endeavours to persuade him that he will be a dead weight \"to lug along through the Highlands and Hebrides.\" Any one else, knowing the character and habits of Johnson, would have thought the same; and no one but Boswell would have supposed his office of bear-leader to the ursa major a thing to be envied.*\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nThe works which Goldsmith had still in hand being already paid for, and the money gone, some new scheme must be devised to provide for the past and the future\u2014for impending debts, which threatened to crush him, and expenses which were continually increasing. He now projected a work of greater compass than any he had yet undertaken; a \"Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" on a comprehensive scale, which was to occupy a number of volumes. For this he received promises of assistance from several powerful hands. Johnson was to contribute an article on ethics; Burke, an abstract of his Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, an essay on the Berkeleyan system of philosophy, and others on political science; Sir Joshua Reynolds, an essay on painting; and Garrick, while he undertook on his own part to furnish an essay on acting, engaged Dr. Burney to contribute an\n\n* One of Peter Pindar's (Dr. Wolcot) most amusing jeux d'esprit is his congratulatory epistle to Boswell on this tour, of which we subjoin a few lines.\n\n\"O Boswell, Bozzy, Bruce, whate'er thy name,\nThou mighty shark for anecdote and fame;\nThou jackal, leading lion Johnson forth,\nTo eat M'Pherson 'midst his native north;\nTo frighten grave professors with his roar,\nAnd shake the Hebrides from shore to shore.\n\nBless'd be thy labours, most adventurous Bozzy,\nBold rival of Sir John and Dame Piozzi;\nHeavens! with what laurels shall thy head be crown'd!\nA grove, a forest, shall thy cars surround!\nYes! whilst the Rambler shall a comet blaze,\nAnd gild a world of darkness with his rays,\nThee, too, that world with wonderment shall hail,\nA lively bouncing cracker at his tail!\"\narticle on music. Here was a great array of talent positively engaged, while other writers of eminence were to be sought for the various departments of science. Goldsmith was to edit the whole. An undertaking of this kind, while it did not incessantly task and exhaust his inventive powers by original composition, would give agreeable and profitable exercise to his taste and judgment in selecting, compiling, and arranging, and he calculated to diffuse over the whole the acknowledged graces of his style.\n\nHe drew up a prospectus of the plan, which is said by Bishop Percy, who saw it, to have been written with uncommon ability, and to have had that perspicuity and elegance for which his writings are remarkable. This paper, unfortunately, is no longer in existence.\n\nGoldsmith's expectations, always sanguine respecting any new plan, were raised to an extraordinary height by the present project; and well they might be, when we consider the powerful coadjutors already pledged. They were doomed, however, to complete disappointment. Davies, the bibliopole of Russell Street, lets us into the secret of this failure. \"The booksellers,\" said he, \"notwithstanding they had a very good opinion of his abilities, yet were startled at the bulk, importance, and expense of so great an undertaking, the fate of which was to depend upon the industry of a man, with whose indolence of temper and method of procrastination they had long been acquainted.\"\n\nGoldsmith certainly gave reason for some such distrust by the heedlessness with which he conducted his literary undertakings. Those unfinished, but paid for, would be suspended, to make way for some job that was to provide for present necessities. Those thus hastily taken up would be as hastily executed, and the whole, however pressing, would be shoved aside and left \"at loose ends,\" on some sudden call to social enjoyment or recreation.\n\nCradock tells us that on one occasion, when Goldsmith was hard at work on his Natural History, he sent to Dr. Percy and himself, entreating them to finish some pages of his work which lay upon his table, and for which the press was urgent, he being detained by other engagements at Windsor. They met by appointment at his chambers in the Temple, where they found everything in disorder, and costly books lying\nscattered about on the tables and on the floor; many of the books on natural history, which he had recently consulted, lay open among uncorrected proof-sheets. The subject in hand, and from which he had suddenly broken off, related to birds.\n\n\"Do you known anything about birds?\" asked Dr. Percy, smiling. \"Not an atom,\" replied Cradock; \"do you?\"\n\n\"Not I! I scarcely know a goose from a swan: however, let us try what we can do.\" They set to work, and completed their friendly task. Goldsmith, however, when he came to revise it, made such alterations that they could neither of them recognise their own share. The engagement at Windsor, which had thus caused Goldsmith to break off suddenly from his multifarious engagements, was a party of pleasure with some literary ladies. Another anecdote was current, illustrative of the carelessness with which he executed works requiring accuracy and research. On the 22nd of June, he had received payment in advance for a Grecian History, in two volumes, though only one was finished. As he was pushing on doggedly at the second volume, Gibbon the historian called in. \"You are the man of all others I wish to see,\" cried the poet, glad to be saved the trouble of reference to his books.\n\n\"What was the name of that Indian king who gave Alexander the Great so much trouble?\" \"Montezuma,\" replied Gibbon, sportively. The heedless author was about committing the name to paper without reflexion, when Gibbon pretended to recollect himself, and gave the true name, Porus.\n\nThis story, very probably, was a sportive exaggeration; but it was a multiplicity of anecdotes, like this and the preceding one, some true, and some false, which had impaired the confidence of the booksellers in Goldsmith, as a man to be relied on for a task requiring wide and accurate research, and close and long-continued application. The project of the Universal Dictionary, therefore, met with no encouragement, and fell through.\n\nThe failure of this scheme, on which he had built such spacious hopes, sank deep into Goldsmith's heart. He was still further grieved and mortified by the failure of an effort made by some of his friends, to obtain for him a pension from government. There had been a talk of the disposition of the ministry to extend the bounty of the crown to distinguished literary men in pecuniary difficulty, without regard to their\npolitical creed: when the merits and claims of Goldsmith, however, were laid before them, they met no favour. The sin of sturdy independence lay at his door. He had refused to become a ministerial hack when offered a carte blanche by Parson Scott, the cabinet emissary. The wondering parson had left him in poverty and \"his garret,\" and there the ministry were disposed to suffer him to remain.\n\nIn the meantime Dr. Beattie comes out with his Essay on Truth, and all the orthodox world are thrown into a paroxysm of contagious ecstasy. He is cried up as the great champion of Christianity against the attacks of modern philosophers and infidels; he is feted and flattered in every way. He receives at Oxford the honorary degree of doctor of civil law at the same time with Sir Joshua Reynolds. The king sends for him, praises his Essay, and gives him a pension of two hundred pounds.\n\nGoldsmith feels more acutely the denial of a pension to himself, when one has thus been given unsolicited to a man he might without vanity consider so much his inferior. He was not one to conceal his feelings. \"Here's such a stir,\" said he one day at Thrale's table, \"about a fellow that has written one book, and I have written so many.\"\n\n\"Ah, Doctor!\" exclaimed Johnson, in one of his caustic moods, \"there go two and forty sixpences, you know, to one guinea.\" This is one of the cuts at poor Goldsmith, in which Johnson went contrary to head and heart in his love for saying what is called a \"good thing.\" No one knew better than himself the comparative superiority of the writings of Goldsmith; but the jingle of the sixpences and the guinea was not to be resisted.\n\n\"Everybody,\" exclaimed Mrs. Thrale, \"loves Dr. Beattie, but Goldsmith, who says he cannot bear the sight of so much applause as they all bestow upon him. Did he not tell us so himself, no one would believe he was so exceedingly ill-natured.\"\n\nHe told them so himself because he was too open and unrestrained to disguise his feelings, and because he really considered the praise lavished on Beattie extravagant, as in fact it was. It was all, of course, set down to sheer envy and uncharitableness. To add to his annoyance, he found his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds joining in the universal adulation. He had painted a full length portrait of Beattie, decked in the doctor's\n\nrobe.\nTOIL WITHOUT HOPE.\n\nrobes in which he had figured at Oxford, with the \"Essay on Truth\" under his arm, and the angel of truth at his side, while Voltaire figured as one of the demons of infidelity, sophistry, and falsehood, driven into utter darkness.\n\nGoldsmith had known Voltaire in early life; he had been his admirer and his biographer; he grieved to find him receiving such an insult from the classic pencil of his friend. \"It is unworthy of you,\" said he to Sir Joshua, \"to debase so high a genius as Voltaire before so mean a writer as Beattie. Beattie and his book will be forgotten in ten years, while Voltaire's fame will last for ever. Take care it does not perpetuate this picture to the shame of such a man as you.\" This noble and high-minded rebuke is the only instance on record of any reproachful words between the poet and the painter; and we are happy to find that it did not destroy the harmony of their intercourse.\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nTHWARTED in the plans, and disappointed in the hopes which had recently cheered and animated him, Goldsmith found the labour at his half-finished tasks doubly irksome, from the consciousness that the completion of them could not relieve him from his pecuniary embarrassments. His impaired health, also, rendered him less capable than formerly of sedentary application, and continual perplexities disturbed the flow of thought necessary for original composition. He lost his usual gaiety and good humour, and became, at times, peevish and irritable. Too proud of spirit to seek sympathy or relief from his friends for the pecuniary difficulties he had brought upon himself by his errors and extravagance, and unwilling, perhaps, to make known their amount, he buried his cares and anxieties in his own bosom, and endeavoured in company to keep up his usual air of gaiety and unconcern. This gave his conduct an appearance of fitfulness and caprice, varying suddenly from moodiness to mirth, and from silent gravity to shallow laughter; causing surprise and ridicule in those who were not aware of the sickness of heart which lay beneath.\n\nHis poetical reputation, too, was sometimes a disadvantage to him; it drew upon him a notoriety which he was not\nalways in the mood or the vein to act up to. \"Good heavens, Mr. Foote,\" exclaimed an actress at the Haymarket theatre, \"what a humdrum kind of man Dr. Goldsmith appears in our green-room, compared with the figure he makes in his poetry!\" \"The reason of that, Madam,\" replied Foote, \"is because the muses are better company than the players.\" Beauclerc's letters to his friend, Lord Charlemont, who was absent in Ireland, give us now and then an indication of the whereabouts of the poet during the present year. \"I have been but once to the club since you left England,\" writes he; \"we were entertained, as usual, with Goldsmith's absurdity.\" With Beauclerc, everything was absurd that was not polished and pointed. In another letter he threatens, unless Lord Charlemont returns to England, to bring over the whole club, and let them loose upon him to drive him home by their peculiar habits of annoyance\u2014Johnson shall spoil his books; Goldsmith shall pull his flowers; and last, and most intolerable of all, Boswell shall\u2014talk to him. It would appear that the poet, who had a passion for flowers, was apt to pass much of his time in the garden when on a visit to a country seat, much to the detriment of the flower-beds and the despair of the gardener.\n\nThe summer wore heavily away with Goldsmith. He had not his usual solace of a country retreat; his health was impaired and his spirits depressed. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who perceived the state of his mind, kindly gave him much of his company. In the course of their interchange of thought, Goldsmith suggested to him the story of Ugolino as a subject for his pencil. The painting founded on it remains a memento of their friendship.\n\nOn the 4th of August we find them together at Vauxhall; at that time a place in high vogue, and which had once been to Goldsmith a scene of oriental splendour and delight. We have, in fact, in the \"Citizen of the World,\" a picture of it as it had struck him in former years, and in his happier moods. \"Upon entering the gardens,\" says the Chinese philosopher, \"I found every sense occupied with more than expected pleasure; the lights everywhere glimmering through the scarcely-moving trees; the full-bodied concert bursting on the stillness of the night; the natural concert of the birds in the more retired part of the grove, viewing with that which was formed\nby art; the company gaily dressed, looking satisfaction, and\nthe tables spread with various delicacies, all conspired to fill\nmy imagination with the visionary happiness of the Arabian\nlawgiver, and lifted me into an ecstasy of admiration.\"*\n\nEverything, now, however, is seen with different eyes; with\nhim it is dissipation without pleasure; and he finds it impos-\nsible any longer, by mingling in the gay and giddy throng of\napparently prosperous and happy beings, to escape from the\ncarking care which is clinging to his heart.\n\nHis kind friend Cradock came up to town towards autumn,\nwhen all the fashionable world was in the country, to give his\nwife the benefit of a skilful dentist. He took lodgings in Nor-\nfolk-street, to be in Goldsmith's neighbourhood, and passed\nmost of his mornings with him. \"I found him,\" he says,\n\"much altered, and at times very low. He wished me to look\nover and revise some of his works; but, with a select friend\nor two, I was more pressing that he should publish by sub-\nscription his two celebrated poems of the 'Traveller' and the\n'Deserted Village,' with notes.\" The idea of Cradock was,\nthat the subscription would enable wealthy persons, favourable\nto Goldsmith, to contribute to his pecuniary relief without\nwounding his pride. \"Goldsmith,\" said he, \"readily gave\nup to me his private copies, and said, 'Pray, do what you\nplease with them.' But whilst he sat near me, he rather sub-\nmitted to than encouraged my zealous proceedings.\n\n\"I one morning called upon him, however, and found him\ninfinitely better than I had expected; and, in a kind of exult-\ning style, he exclaimed, 'Here are some of the best of my\nprose writings; I have been hard at work since midnight, and I\ndesire you to examine them.' 'These,' said I, 'are excellent\nindeed.' 'They are,' replied he, 'intended as an introduction\nto a body of arts and sciences.'\"\n\nPoor Goldsmith was, in fact, gathering together the frag-\nments of his shipwreck\u2014the notes and essays, and memoranda\ncollected for his Dictionary\u2014and proposed to found on them\na work in two volumes, to be entitled \"A Survey of Experi-\nmental Philosophy.\"\n\nThe plan of the subscription came to nothing, and the pro-\njected \"Survey\" never was executed. The head might yet\ndevice, but the heart was failing him; his talent at hoping,\n\n* Citizen of the World. Let LXXI.\nwhich gave him buoyancy to carry out his enterprises, was almost at an end.\n\nCradock's farewell scene with him is told in a simple but touching manner.\n\n\"The day before I was to set out for Leicestershire, I insisted upon his dining with us. He replied, 'I will, but on one condition, that you will not ask me to eat anything.' 'Nay,' said I, 'this answer is absolutely unkind, for I had hoped, as we are supplied from the Crown and Anchor, that you would have named something you might have relished.' 'Well,' was the reply, 'if you will but explain it to Mrs. Craddock, I will certainly wait upon you.'\"\n\nThe doctor found, as usual, at my apartments, newspapers and pamphlets, and with a pen and ink he amused himself as well as he could. I had ordered from the tavern some fish, a roasted joint of lamb, and a tart; and the doctor either sat down or walked about, just as he pleased. After dinner he took some wine with biscuits; but I was obliged soon to leave him for a while, as I had matters to settle prior to my next day's journey. On my return, coffee was ready, and the doctor appeared more cheerful, (for Mrs. Craddock was always rather a favourite with him,) and in the evening he endeavoured to talk and remark as usual, but all was force. He stayed till midnight, and I insisted on seeing him safe home, and we most cordially shook hands at the Temple gate.\" Craddock little thought that this was to be their final parting. He looked back to it with mournful recollections in after years, and lamented that he had not remained longer in town, at every inconvenience, to solace the poor broken-spirited poet.\n\nThe latter continued in town all the autumn. At the opening of the Opera House, on the 20th of November, Mrs. Yates, an actress whom he held in great esteem, delivered a poetical exordium of his composition. Beauclerc, in a letter to Lord Charlemont, pronounced it very good, and predicted that it would soon be in all the papers. It does not appear, however, to have been ever published. In his fitful state of mind Goldsmith may have taken no care about it, and thus it has been lost to the world, although it was received with hearty applause by a crowded and brilliant audience.\n\nA gleam of sunshine breaks through the gloom that gathering over the poet. Towards the end of the\nreceives another Christmas invitation to Barton. A country Christmas! with all the cordiality of the fireside circle, and the joyous revelry of the oaken hall\u2014what a contrast to the loneliness of a bachelor's chambers in the Temple! It is not to be resisted. But how is poor Goldsmith to raise the ways and means? His purse is empty; his booksellers are already in advance to him. As a last resource, he applies to Garrick. Their mutual intimacy at Barton may have suggested him as an alternative. The old loan of forty pounds has never been paid: and Newbery's note, pledged as a security, has never been taken up. An additional loan of sixty pounds is now asked for, thus increasing the loan to one hundred, to insure the payment, he now offers, besides Newbery's note, the transfer of the comedy of the \"Good-natured Man\" to Drury Lane, with such alterations as Garrick may suggest. Garrick, in reply, evades the offer of the altered comedy, alludes significantly to a new one which Goldsmith had talked of writing for him, and offers to furnish the money required on his own acceptance.\n\nThe reply of Goldsmith bespeaks a heart brimful of gratitude, and overflowing with fond anticipations of Barton and the smiles of its fair residents. \"My dear friend,\" writes he, \"I thank you. I wish I could do something to serve you. I shall have a comedy for you in a season, or two at farthest, that I believe will be worth your acceptance, for I fancy I will make it a fine thing. You shall have the refusal. * * * I will draw upon you one month after date for sixty pounds, and your acceptance will be ready money, part of which I want to go down to Barton with. May God preserve my honest little man, for he has my heart.\u2014Ever,\n\n\"OLIVER GOLDSMITH.\"\n\nAnd having thus scrambled together a little pocket-money, by hard contrivance, poor Goldsmith turns his back upon care and trouble, and Temple quarters, to forget for a time his desolate bachelorhood, in the family circle and a Christmas at Barton.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nThe Barton festivities are over; Christmas, with all its home-felt revelry of the heart, has passed like a dream; the Jessamy Bride has beamed her last smile upon the poor poet, and the early part of 1774 finds him in his now dreary bachelor abode in the Temple, toiling fitfully and hopelessly at a multiplicity of tasks. His \"Animated Nature,\" so long delayed, so often interrupted, is at length announced for publication, though it has yet to receive a few finishing touches. He is preparing a third \"History of England,\" to be compressed and condensed in one volume for the use of schools. He is revising his \"Inquiry into Polite Learning,\" for which he receives the pittance of five guineas, much needed in his present scantiness of purse; he is arranging his \"Survey of Experimental Philosophy,\" and he is translating the \"Comic Romance of Scarron.\" Such is a part of the various labours of a drudging, depressing kind, by which his head is made weary and his heart faint. \"If there is a mental drudgery,\" says Sir Walter Scott, \"which lowers the spirits, and lacerates the nerves, like the toil of a slave, it is that which is exacted by literary composition, when the heart is not in unison with the work upon which the head is employed. Add to the unhappy author's task, sickness, sorrow, or the pressure of unfavourable circumstances, and the labour of the bondsman becomes light in comparison.\" Goldsmith again makes an effort to rally his spirits by going into gay society. \"Our Club,\" writes Beauclerc to Charlemont, on the 12th of February, \"has dwindled away to nothing. Sir Joshua and Goldsmith have got into such a round of pleasures that they have no time.\" This shows how little Beauclerc was the companion of the poet's mind, or could judge of him below the surface. Reynolds, the kind participator in joyless dissipation, could have told a different story of his companion's heart-sick gaiety.\n\nIn this forced mood Goldsmith gave entertainments in his chambers in the Temple, the last of which was a dinner to Johnson, Reynolds, and others of his intimates, who partook with sorrow and reluctance of his imprudent hospitality. The first course vexed them by its needless profusion. When a\nsecond, equally extravagant, was served up, Johnson and Reynolds declined to partake of it; the rest of the company, understanding their motives, followed their example, and the dishes went from the table untasted. Goldsmith felt sensibly this silent and well-intended rebuke.\n\nThe gaieties of society, however, cannot medicine for any length of time a mind diseased. Wearied by the distractions and harassed by the expenses of a town life, which he had not the discretion to regulate, Goldsmith took the resolution, too tardily adopted, of retiring to the serene, quiet, and cheap and healthful pleasures of the country, and of passing only two months of the year in London. He accordingly made arrangements to sell his right in the Temple chambers, and in the month of March retired to his country quarters at Hyde, there to devote himself to toil. At this dispirited juncture when inspiration seemed to be at an end, and the poet's fire extinguished, a spark fell on his combustible imagination and set it in a blaze.\n\nHe belonged to a temporary association of men of talent, some of them members of the Literary Club, who dined together occasionally at the St. James's Coffee-house. At these dinners, as usual, he was one of the last to arrive. On one occasion, when he was more dilatory than usual, a whim seized the company to write epitaphs on him, as \"The late Dr. Goldsmith,\" and several were thrown off in a playful vein, hitting off his peculiarities. The only one extant was written by Garrick, and has been preserved, very probably, by its pungency:\n\n\"Here lies poet Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll,\nWho wrote like an angel, but talked like poor poll.\"\n\nGoldsmith did not relish the sarcasm, especially as coming from such a quarter. He was not very ready at repartee; but he took his time, and in the interval of his various tasks, concocted a series of epigrammatic sketches, under the title of \"Retaliation,\" in which the characters of his distinguished intimates were admirably hit off, with a mixture of generous praise and good-humoured raillery. In fact the poem, for its graphic truth, its nice discrimination, its terse good sense, and its shrewd knowledge of the world, must have electrified the club almost as much as the first appearance of \"The Traveller,\" and let them still deeper into the character and talents\nof the man they had been accustomed to consider as their butt. Retaliation, in a word, closed his accounts with the club, and balanced all his previous deficiencies.\n\nThe portrait of David Garrick is one of the most elaborate in the poem. When the poet came to touch it off, he had some lurking piques to gratify, which the recent attack had revived. He may have forgotten David's cavalier treatment of him, in the early days of his comparative obscurity; he may have forgiven his refusal of his plays; but Garrick had been capricious in his conduct in the times of their recent intercourse, sometimes treating him with gross familiarity, at other times affecting dignity and reserve, and assuming airs of superiority; frequently he had been facetious and witty in company at his expense, and, lastly, he had been guilty of the couplet just quoted. Goldsmith, therefore, touched off the lights and shadows of his character with a free hand, and, at the same time, gave a side hit at his old rival, Kelly, and his critical persecutor Kenrick, in making them sycophant satellites of the actor. Goldsmith, however, was void of gall even in his revenge, and his very satire was more humorous than caustic:\n\n\"Here lies David Garrick, describe him who can,\nAn abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;\nAs an actor confess'd without rival to shine;\nAs a wit, if not first, in the very first line;\nYet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart,\nThe man had his failings, a dope to his art.\nLike an ill-judging beauty, his colours he spread,\nAnd beplastered with rouge his own natural red.\nOn the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;\n'Twas only that when he was off he was acting.\nWith no reason on earth to go out of his way,\nHe turn'd and he varied full ten times a day:\nThough secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick\nIf they were not his own by finessing and trick:\nHe cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,\nFor he knew, when he pleased, he could whistle them back.\nOf praise a mere glutton, he swallow'd what came,\nAnd the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;\nTill his relish, grown callous almost to disease,\nWho pepper'd the highest was surest to please.\nBut let us be candid, and speak out our mind,\nIf dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.\"\nYe Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls so grave,\nWhat a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave?\nHow did Grub-street re-echo the shouts that you raised,\nWhile he was be-Rosclused and you were be-praised!\nBut peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,\nTo act as an angel and mix with the skies:\nThose poets who owe their best fame to his skill,\nShall still be his flatterers, go where he will;\nOld Shakspeare receive him with praise and with love,\nAnd Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.\"\n\nThis portion of \"Retaliation\" soon brought a retort from Garrick, which we insert as giving something of a likeness of Goldsmith, though in broad caricature:\n\n\"Here, Hermes, says Jove, who with nectar was mellow,\nGo fetch me some clay\u2014I will make an odd fellow:\nRight and wrong shall be jumbled, much gold and some dross,\nWithout cause be he pleased, without cause be he cross;\nBe sure, as I work, to throw in contradictions,\nA great love of truth, yet a mind turn'd to fictions;\nNow mix these ingredients, which, warm'd in the baking,\nTurn'd to learning and gaming, religion and raking.\nWith the love of a wench, let his writings be chaste;\nTip his tongue with strange matter, his lips with fine taste\nThat the rake and the poet o'er all may prevail,\nSet fire to the head and set fire to the tail;\nFor the joy of each sex on the world I'll bestow it,\nThis scholar, rake, Christian, dupe, gamester, and poet.\nThough a mixture so odd, he shall merit great fame,\nAnd among brother mortals be Goldsmith his name;\nWhen on earth this strange meteor no more shall appear,\nYou, Hermes, shall fetch him, to make us sport here.\"\n\nThe charge of raking, so repeatedly advanced in the foregoing lines, must be considered a sportive one, founded, perhaps, on an incident or two within Garrick's knowledge, but not borne out by the course of Goldsmith's life. He seems to have had a tender sentiment for the sex, but perfectly free from libertinism. Neither was he an habitual gamester. The strictest scrutiny has detected no settled vice of the kind. He was fond of a game of cards, but an unskilful and careless player. Cards in those days were universally introduced into society. High play was, in fact, a fashionable amusement, as at one time was deep drinking: and a man might occasionally lose large sums, and be beguiled into deep potations, without incurring the character of a gamester or a drunkard. Poor\nGoldsmith, on his advent into high society, assumed fine notions with fine clothes; he was thrown occasionally among high players, men of fortune, who could sport their cool hundreds as carelessly as his early comrades at Ballymahon could their half-crowns. Being at all times magnificent in money matters, he may have played with them in their own way, without considering that what was sport to them, to him was ruin. Indeed, part of his financial embarrassments may have arisen from losses of the kind, incurred inadvertently, not in the indulgence of a habit. \"I do not believe Goldsmith to have deserved the name of a gamester,\" said one of his contemporaries; \"he liked cards very well, as other people do, and lost and won occasionally; but as far as I saw or heard, and I had many opportunities of hearing, never any considerable sum. If he gamed with any one, it was probably with Beauclerc, but I do not know that such was the case.\"\n\n\"Retaliation,\" as we have already observed, was thrown off in parts, at intervals, and was never completed. Some characters, originally intended to be introduced, remained unattempted; others were but partially sketched\u2014such was the one of Reynolds, the friend of his heart, and which he commenced with a felicity which makes us regret that it should remain unfinished.\n\n\"Here Reynolds is laid, and to tell you my mind,\nHe has not left a wiser or better behind.\nHis pencil was striking, resistless, and grand:\nHis manners were gentle, complying and bland;\nStill born to improve us in every part,\nHis pencil our faces, his manners our heart.\nTo coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,\nWhen they judged without skill he was still hard of hearing:\nWhen they talked of their Raphaels, Corregios, and stuff,\nHe shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.\nBy flattery unspoiled\"\n\nThe friendly portrait stood unfinished on the easel; the hand of the artist had failed! An access of a local complaint, under which he had suffered for some time past, added to a general prostration of health, brought Goldsmith back to town before he had well settled himself in the country. The local complaint subsided, but was followed by a low nervous fever. He was not aware of his critical situation, and intended to be at the Club on the 25th of March, on which occasion Charles\nFox, Sir Charles Bunbury (one of the Horneck connexion), and two other new members, were to be present. In the afternoon, however, he felt so unwell as to take to his bed, and his symptoms soon acquired sufficient force to keep him there. His malady fluctuated for several days, and hopes were entertained of his recovery, but they proved fallacious. He had skilful medical aid and faithful nursing, but he would not follow the advice of his physicians, and persisted in the use of James's powders, which he had once found beneficial, but which were now injurious to him. His appetite was gone; his strength failed him, but his mind remained clear, and was perhaps too active for his frame. Anxieties and disappointments, which had previously sapped his constitution, doubtless aggravated his present complaint, and rendered him sleepless. In reply to an inquiry of his physician, he acknowledged that his mind was ill at ease. This was his last reply; he was too weak to talk, and in general took no notice of what was said to him. He sank at last into a deep sleep, and it was hoped a favourable crisis had arrived. He awoke, however, in strong convulsions, which continued without intermission until he expired, on the 4th of April, at five o'clock in the morning, being in the forty-sixth year of his age.\n\nHis death was a shock to the literary world, and a deep affliction to a wide circle of intimates and friends; for, with all his foibles and peculiarities, he was fully as much beloved as he was admired. Burke, on hearing the news, burst into tears. Sir Joshua Reynolds threw by his pencil for the day, and grieved more than he had done in times of great family distress. \"I was abroad at the time of his death,\" writes Dr. M'Donnell, the youth whom, when in distress, he had employed as an amanuensis, \"and I wept bitterly when the intelligence first reached me. A blank came over my heart as if I had lost one of my nearest relatives, and was followed for some days by a feeling of despondency.\" Johnson felt the blow deeply and gloomily. In writing some time afterwards to Boswell, he observed, \"Of poet Dr. Goldsmith there is little to be told more than the papers have made public. He died of a fever, made, I am afraid, more violent by uneasiness of mind. His debts began to be heavy, and all his resources were exhausted. Sir Joshua is of opinion that he owed no less than two thousand pounds. Was ever poet so trusted before?\"\nAmong his debts were seventy-nine pounds due to his tailor, Mr. William Filby, from whom he had received a new suit but a few days before his death. \"My father,\" said the younger Filby, \"though a loser to that amount, attributed no blame to Goldsmith; he had been a good customer, and, had he lived, would have paid every farthing.\" Others of his tradespeople evinced the same confidence in his integrity, notwithstanding his heedlessness. Two sister milliners in Temple Lane, who had been accustomed to deal with him, were concerned when told some time before his death, of his pecuniary embarrassments. \"Oh, sir,\" said they to Mr. Cradock, \"sooner persuade him to let us work for him gratis than apply to any other; we are sure he will pay us when he can.\"\n\nOn the stairs of his apartment, there was the lamentation of the old and infirm, and the sobbing of women, poor objects of his charity, to whom he had never turned a deaf ear, even when struggling himself with poverty.\n\nBut there was one mourner, whose enthusiasm for his memory, could it have been foreseen, might have soothed the bitterness of death. After the coffin had been screwed down, a lock of his hair was requested for a lady, a particular friend, who wished to preserve it as a remembrance. It was the beautiful Mary Horneck\u2014the Jessamy Bride. The coffin was opened again, and a lock of hair cut off, which she treasured to her dying day. Poor Goldsmith! could he have foreseen that such a memorial of him was to be thus cherished!\n\nOne word more concerning this lady, to whom we have so often ventured to advert. She survived almost to the present day. Hazlitt met her at Northcote's painting-room, about twenty years since, as Mrs. Gwyn, the widow of a General Gwyn of the army. She was at that time upwards of seventy years of age. Still, he said, she was beautiful, beautiful even in years. After she was gone, Hazlitt remarked how handsome she still was. \"I do not know,\" said Northcote, \"why she is so kind as to come and see me, except that I am the last link in the chain that connects her with all those she most esteemed when young\u2014Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmith\u2014and remind her of the most delightful period of her life.\" \"Not only so,\" observed Hazlitt, \"but you remember what she was at twenty; and you thus bring back to her the triumphs of\nher youth\u2014that pride of beauty, which must be the more fondly cherished as it has no external vouchers, and lives chiefly in the bosom of its once lovely possessor. In her, however, the Graces had triumphed over time; she was one of Ninon de l'Enclos's people, of the last of the immortals. I could almost fancy the shade of Goldsmith in the room, looking round with complacency.\"\n\nThe Jessamy Bride survived her sister upwards of forty years, and died in 1840, within a few days of completing her eighty-eighth year. \"She had gone through all the stages of life,\" says Northcote, \"and had lent a grace to each.\" However gaily she may have sported with the half-concealed admiration of the awkward poet in the heyday of her youth and beauty, and however much it may have been made a subject of teasing by her youthful companions, she evidently prided herself in after years upon having been an object of his affectionate regard; it certainly rendered her interesting throughout life in the eyes of his admirers, and has hung a poetical wreath above her grave.\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nIn the warm feeling of the moment, while the remains of the poet were scarce cold, it was determined by his friends to honour them by a public funeral, and a tomb in Westminster Abbey. His very pall-bearers were designated: Lord Shelburne, Lord Lowth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, the Hon. Mr. Beauclerc, Mr. Burke, and David Garrick. This feeling cooled down, however, when it was discovered that he died in debt, and had not left wherewithal to pay for such expensive obsequies. Five days after his death, therefore, at five o'clock on Saturday evening, the 9th of April, he was privately interred in the burying-ground of the Temple Church; a few persons attending as mourners, among whom we do not find specified any of his peculiar and distinguished friends. The chief mourner was Sir Joshua Reynolds's nephew, Palmer, afterwards Dean of Cashel. One person, however, from whom it was but little to be expected, attended the funeral, and evinced real sorrow on the occasion. This was Hugh Kelly, once the dramatic rival of the deceased, and often, it is said, his anonym-\nmous assailant in the newspapers. If he had really been guilty of this basest of literary offences, he was punished by the stings of remorse, for we are told that he shed bitter tears over the grave of the man he had injured. His tardy atonement only provoked the lash of some unknown satirist, as the following lines will show:\n\n\"Hence Kelly, who years, without honour or shame,\nHad been sticking his bodkin in Oliver's fame,\nWho thought, like the Tartar, by this to inherit\nHis genius, his learning, simplicity, spirit;\nNow sets every feature to weep o'er his fate,\nAnd acts as a mourner to blubber in state.\"\n\nOne base wretch deserves to be mentioned, the reptile Kenrick, who, after having repeatedly slandered Goldsmith while living, had the audacity to insult his memory when dead. The following distich is sufficient to show his malignancy, and to hold him up to execration:\n\n\"By his own art, who justly died,\nA blund'ring, artless, suicide;\nShare, earthworms, share, since now he's dead,\nHis megrim, maggot-bitten head.\"\n\nThis scurrilous epitaph produced a burst of public indignation, that awed, for a time, even the infamous Kenrick into silence. On the other hand, the press teemed with tributes in verse and prose to the memory of the deceased; all evincing the mingled feeling of admiration for the author, and affection for the man.\n\nNot long after his death the Literary Club set on foot a subscription, and raised a fund to erect a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey. It was executed by Nollekens, and consisted simply of a bust of the poet in profile, in high relief, in a medallion, and was placed in the area of a pointed arch, over the south door in Poet's Corner, between the monuments of Gay and the Duke of Argyle. Johnson furnished a Latin epitaph, which was read at the table of Sir Joshua Reynolds, where several members of the club, and other friends of the deceased, were present. Though considered by them a masterly composition, they thought the literary character of the poet not defined with sufficient exactness, and they preferred that the epitaph should be in English rather than Latin, as \"the memory of so eminent an\nEnglish writer ought to be perpetuated in the language to which his works were likely to be so lasting an ornament.\"\n\nThese objections were reduced to writing, to be respectfully submitted to Johnson, but such was the awe entertained of his frown, that every one shrank from putting his name first to the instrument; whereupon their names were written about it in a circle, making what mutinous sailors call a \"Round Robin.\" Johnson received it half graciously, half grimly. \"He was willing,\" he said, \"to modify the sense of the epitaph in any manner the gentlemen pleased; but he never would consent to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English inscription.\" Seeing the names of Dr. Warton and Edmund Burke among the signers, \"he wondered,\" he said, \"that Joe Warton, a scholar by profession, should be such a fool; and should have thought that Mund Burke would have had more sense.\" The following is the epitaph, as it stands inscribed on a white marble tablet beneath the bust:\n\nOLIVARIUS GOLDSMITH,\nPoet\u00e6, Physici, Historici,\nQui nullum fere scribendi genus\nNon tetigit,\nNullum quod tetigit non ornavit:\nSive risus essent movendi,\nSive lacrymae,\nAffectuum potens at lenis dominator:\nIngenio sublimis, vividus, versatilis,\nOratione grandis, nitidus, venustus:\nHoc monumento memoriam coluit\nSodalium amor,\nAmicorum fides,\nLectorum veneratio.\nNatus in Hibernia Forniae Longfordiensis,\nIn loco cui nomen Pallas,\nNov. XXIX. MDCCXXXII;\nEblana literis institutus;\nObilit Londini,\nApril IV. MDCCCLXXIV.\"\n\nWe shall not pretend to follow these anecdotes of the life of Goldsmith with any critical dissertation on his writings;\n\n* The following translation is from Croker's edition of Boswell's Johnson:\u2014\n\nOF OLIVER GOLDSMITH\u2014\nA Poet, Naturalist, and Historian,\ntheir merits have long since been fully discussed, and their station in the scale of literary merit permanently established. They have outlasted generations of works of higher power, and wider scope, and will continue to outlast succeeding generations, for they have that magic charm of style by which works are embalmed to perpetuity. Neither shall we attempt a regular analysis of the character of the poet, but will indulge in a few desultory remarks in addition to those scattered throughout the preceding chapters.\n\nNever was the trite because sage apothegm, that \"the child is father to the man,\" more fully verified than in the case of Goldsmith. He is shy, awkward, and blundering in childhood, yet full of sensibility; he is a butt for the jeers and jokes of his companions, but apt to surprise and confound them by sudden and witty repartees; he is dull and stupid at his tasks, yet an eager and intelligent devourer of the travelling tales and campaigning stories of his half-military pedagogue; he may be a dunce, but he is already a rhymer; and his early scintillations of poetry awaken the expectations of his friends. He seems from infancy to have been compounded of two natures, one bright, the other blundering: or to have had fairy gifts laid in his cradle by the \"good people\" who haunted his birth-place, the old goblin mansion on the banks of the Inny.\n\nWho left scarcely any style of writing untouched,\nAnd touched nothing that he did not adorn;\nOf all the passions,\nWhether smiles were to be moved\nor tears,\nA powerful yet gentle master;\nIn genius, sublime, vivid, versatile,\nIn style, elevated, clear, elegant\u2014\nThe love of companions,\nThe fidelity of friends,\nAnd the veneration of readers,\nHave by this monument honoured the memory.\n\nHe was born in Ireland,\nAt a place called Pallas,\n[In the parish] of Forney, [and county] of Longford\nOn the 29th Nov., 1731;\nEducated at [the University of] Dublin;\nAnd died in London,\n4th April, 1774.\nHe carries with him the wayward, elfin spirit, if we may so term it, throughout his career. His fairy gifts are of no avail at school, academy, or college; they unfit him for close study and practical science, and render him heedless of everything that does not address itself to his poetical imagination, and genial and festive feelings; they dispose him to break away from restraint, to stroll about hedges, green lanes, and haunted streams, to revel with jovial companions, or to rove the country like a gipsy, in quest of odd adventures.\n\nAs if confiding in these delusive gifts, he takes no heed of the present, nor care for the future, lays no regular and solid foundation of knowledge, follows out no plan, adopts and discards those recommended by his friends, at one time prepares for the ministry, next turns to the law, and then fixes upon medicine. He repairs to Edinburgh, the great emporium of medical science, but the fairy gifts accompany him; he idles and frolics away his time there, imbibing only such knowledge as is agreeable to him; makes an excursion to the poetical regions of the Highlands; and having walked the hospitals for the customary time, sets off to ramble over the continent, in quest of novelty rather than knowledge. His whole tour is a poetical one. He fancies he is playing the philosopher while he is really playing the poet; and though professedly he attends lectures and visits foreign universities, so deficient is he on his return in the studies for which he set out, that he fails in an examination as a surgeon's mate; and while figuring as a doctor of medicine, is outvied on a point of practice by his apothecary. Baffled in every regular pursuit, after trying in vain some of the humbler callings of common-place life, he is driven almost by chance to the exercise of his pen, and here the fairy gifts come to his assistance. For a long time, however, he seems unaware of the magic properties of that pen: he uses it only as a make-shift until he can find a legitimate means of support. He is not a learned man, and can write but meagrely and at second-hand on learned subjects: but he has a quick convertible talent, that seizes lightly on the points of knowledge necessary to the illustration of a theme: his writings for a time are desultory, the fruits of what he has seen and felt, or what he has recently and hastily read; but his gifted pen transmutes everything into gold, and his own genial nature reflects its sunshine through his pages.\nStill unaware of his powers, he throws off his writings anonymously, to go with the writings of less favoured men; and it is a long time, and after a bitter struggle with poverty and humiliation, before he acquires confidence in his literary talent as a means of support, and begins to dream of reputation.\n\nFrom this time, his pen is a wand of power in his hand, and he has only to use it discreetly, to make it competent to all his wants. But discretion is not a part of Goldsmith's nature; and it seems the property of these fairy gifts to be accompanied by moods and temperaments to render their effect precarious. The heedlessness of his early days, his disposition for social enjoyment, his habits of throwing the present on the neck of the future, still continue. His expenses forerun his means: he incurs debts on the faith of what his magic pen is to produce, and then, under the pressure of his debts, sacrifices its productions for prices far below their value. It is a redeeming circumstance in his prodigality, that it is lavished oftener upon others than upon himself: he gives without thought or stint, and is the continual dupe of his benevolence, and his trustfulness in human nature. We may say of him as he says of one of his heroes, \"He could not stifle the natural impulse which he had to do good, but frequently borrowed money to relieve the distressed; and when he knew not conveniently where to borrow, he has been observed to shed tears as he passed through the wretched supplicants who attended his gate.\"\n\n*Goldsmith's \"Life of Nahe.\"*\n\nHis simplicity in trusting persons whom he had no previous reason to place confidence in, seems to be one of those lights of his character which, while they impeach his understanding, do honour to his benevolence. The low and the timid are ever suspicious; but a heart impressed with honourable sentiments expects from others sympathetic sincerity.\n\nHis heedlessness in pecuniary matters, which had rendered his life a struggle with poverty, even in the days of his obscurity, rendered the struggle still more intense when his fairy gifts had elevated him into the society of the wealthy and luxurious, and imposed on his simple and generous\nspirit fancied obligations to a more ample and bounteous display.\n\n\"How comes it,\" says a recent and ingenious critic, \"that in all the miry paths of life which he had trod, no speck ever sullied the robe of his modest and graceful muse? How, amidst all that love of inferior company, which never to the last forsook him, did he keep his genius so free from every touch of vulgarity?\"\n\nWe answer that it was owing to the innate purity and goodness of his nature: there was nothing in it that assimilated to vice and vulgarity. Though his circumstances often compelled him to associate with the poor, they never could betray him into companionship with the depraved. His relish for humour and for the study of character, as we have before observed, brought him often into convivial company of a vulgar kind; but he discriminated between their vulgarity and their amusing qualities, or rather wrought from the whole those familiar pictures of life, which form the staple of his most popular writings.\n\nMuch, too, of this intact purity of heart may be ascribed to the lessons of his infancy under the paternal roof; to the gentle, benevolent, elevated, unworldly maxims of his father, who, \"passing rich with forty pounds a year,\" infused a spirit into his child, which riches could not deprave, nor poverty degrade. Much of his boyhood, too, had been passed in the household of his uncle, the amiable and generous Contarine; where he talked of literature with the good pastor, and practised music with his daughter, and delighted them both by his juvenile attempts at poetry. These early associations breathed a grace and refinement into his mind, and tuned it up after the rough sports on the green, or the frolics at the tavern. These led him to turn from the roaring glees of the club, to listen to the harp of his cousin Jane; and from the rustic triumph of \"throwing sledge,\" to a stroll with his flute along the pastoral banks of the Inny.\n\nThe gentle spirit of his father walked with him through life, a pure and virtuous monitor; and in all the vicissitudes of his career, we find him ever more chastened in mind by the sweet and holy recollections of the home of his infancy.\n\nIt has been questioned whether he really had any religious\nfeeling. Those who raise the question have never considered well his writings; his \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" and his pictures of \"the Village Pastor,\" present religion under its most endearing forms, and with a feeling that could only flow from the deep convictions of the heart. When his fair travelling companions at Paris urged him to read the Church Service on a Sunday, he replied that \"he was not worthy to do it.\" He had seen in early life the sacred offices performed by his father and his brother, with a solemnity which had sanctified them in his memory; how could he presume to undertake such functions? His religion has been called in question by Johnson and by Boswell: he certainly had not the gloomy hypochondriacal piety of the one, nor the babbling mouth-piety of the other, but the spirit of Christian charity breathed forth in his writings, and it illustrated in his conduct, give us reason to believe he had the indwelling religion of the soul.\n\nWe have made sufficient comments in the preceding chapters on his conduct in elevated circles of literature and fashion. The fairy gifts which took him there, were not accompanied by the gifts and graces necessary to sustain him in that artificial sphere. He can neither play the learned sage with Johnson, nor the fine gentleman with Beauclerc, though he has a mind replete with wisdom and natural shrewdness, and a spirit free from vulgarity. The blunders of a fertile but hurried intellect, and the awkward display of the student assuming the man of fashion, fix on him a character for absurdity and vanity which, like the charge of lunacy, it is hard to disprove, however weak the grounds of the charge, and strong the facts in opposition to it.\n\nIn truth, he is never truly in his place in these learned and fashionable circles, which talk and live for display. It is not the kind of society he craves. His heart yearns for domestic life; it craves familiar, confiding intercourse, family firesides, the guileless and happy company of children; these bring out the heartiest and sweetest sympathies of his nature.\n\n\"Had it been his fate,\" says the critic we have already quoted, \"to meet a woman who could have loved him, despite his faults, and respected him, despite his foibles, we cannot but think that his life and his genius would have been much more harmonious; his desultory affections would have been concentrated, his craving self-love appeased, his pursuits more\nsettled, his character more solid. A nature like Goldsmith's, so affectionate, so confiding\u2014so susceptible to simple, innocent enjoyments\u2014so dependant on others for the sunshine of existence, does not flower, if deprived of the atmosphere of home.\"\n\nThe cravings of his heart in this respect are evident, we think, throughout his career; and if we have dwelt with more significance than others upon his intercourse with the beautiful Horneck family, it is because we fancied we could detect, amid his playful attentions to one of its members, a lurking sentiment of tenderness, kept down by conscious poverty, and a humiliating idea of personal defects. A hopeless feeling of this kind\u2014the last a man would communicate to his friends\u2014might account for much of that fitfulness of conduct, and that gathering melancholy, remarked, but not comprehended, by his associates, during the last year or two of his life; and may have been one of the troubles of the mind which aggravated his last illness, and only terminated with his death.\n\nWe shall conclude these desultory remarks with a few which have been used by us on a former occasion. From the general tone of Goldsmith's biography, it is evident that his faults, at the worst, were but negative, while his merits were great and decided. He was no one's enemy but his own; his errors, in the main, inflicted evil on none but himself, and were so blended with humorous, and even affecting circumstances, as to disarm anger and conciliate kindness. Where eminent talent is united to spotless virtue, we are awed and dazzled into admiration, but our admiration is apt to be cold and reverential; while there is something in the harmless infirmities of a good and great, but erring individual, that pleads touchingly to our nature; and we turn more kindly towards the object of our idolatry, when we find that, like ourselves, he is mortal and is frail. The epithet so often heard, and in such kindly tones, of \"poor Goldsmith,\" speaks volumes. Few, who consider the real compound of admirable and whimsical qualities which form his character, would wish to prune away its eccentricities, trim its grotesque luxuriance, and clip it down to the decent formalities of rigid virtue. \"Let not his frailties be remembered,\" said Johnson, \"he was a very great man.\" But, for our part, we rather\nsay \"Let them be remembered,\" since their tendency is to endear; and we question whether he himself would not feel gratified in hearing his reader, after dwelling with admiration on the proofs of his greatness, close the volume with the kind-hearted phrase, so fondly and familiarly ejaculated, of \"Poor Goldsmith.\"\ntendency is to\nwould not feel\nwith admiration\nwith the kind-\nated, of \"Poor\n", "source": "olmocr", "added":
