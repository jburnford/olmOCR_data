The grass is particularly there is a much heavier body of grass than for several years past owing to the frequent rains during the past summer and snow, and the grass is now dry and abundant so that the utmost precaution should be taken by everyone not to allow fire to get started on our broad and grassy covered prairies.\n\nThe great body of dry grass, with such an aspect as had a few nights ago, and our crops would be lost in a moment. Fires may occur accidentally, carelessly or perhaps intentionally, but it is well that the farmers should keep guard against this perilous element by guarding their stacks of grain, hay and buildings properly protected. Don't put off this important duty till to-morrow but let the first thing you do be for the protection of your crops and buildings from danger of prairie fires.\n\nIn British politics the Irish question is still the engaging subject. It is to be feared the people are sick and tired of it. But what is to be done? The Irish Nationalists say that they are determined to have their own way and a majority of the representatives of the British Parliament say that they will not enter the National League or support the British Parliament until the Irish people cannot serve two masters. What seems to be on the cards is a coalition cabinet. The Irish Unionists may dissent, and it is certain Mr. Chamberlain will not enter a coalition cabinet, but the Marquis of Hertfording would surely do so, holding the great bulk of the following vote. The first thing that would be to rechristen the party and it would likely be called the Liberal Conservative party in order to soothe the consciences of those Unionists who can themselves be Liberals. What the Marquis of Hertfording said the other day as to the necessity of closing up the ranks and getting the machinery of organization into order shows that he sees the wisdom of a closer union of the two wings of the Unionist force.\n\nMr. Gladstone, pointing to the by-elections, is sanguine that the next election will see a Liberal and Parliamentary sweep; but Mr. Gladstone is always sanguine and the electors are decidedly. In the hearts of many Englishmen there is a feeling that Mr. Gladstone has gone too far, and his surrender to the Nationalists at this juncture may be it is to get their votes to turn out the Salisbury Government is looked upon with feelings of mortification.\n\nMr. Goldwin Smith's letter on Manitoba, in the Mail, is suggestive on one point. He says: \"Much of the land around the capital (Winnipeg) is still lying untilled. It is evident that prices at which prices have been obtained in the last few years, to the injury of not only Manitoba but of the settler himself, who is thus carried away both from his market and his center of distribution, besides losing the general advantages of settlement.\"\n\nIt is instructive to know how much the stagnation incident to this state of things has contributed to this present discontent in Manitoba; and that the Manitoba speculators holders of land as now, are in a semi-revolution, agitating for Manitoba's rights. No doubt, as Mr. Smith says, Winnipeg, having reached a certain stage, is sure to go further, as at the end of cities. She will grow and live in large measure of the C. P. R., which threatens her with ruin if she will not succumb to Disallowance. The Manitoba speculators are pushing a course that cannot be permitted by any civilized Government. The building of the Red River Railroad is an act of open defiance of the law; and while violating the terms of the agreement by the work by the Dominion authorities, if practicable\u2014which is not\u2014would be an act of arbitrary power that could not commend itself to Canada, still it is going to do in Condominium, such as this, to sanction the rampant triumph of Sectionalism over the Dominion authority. Let us have conciliation and compromise by all means that may be possible, but let us be bold precedent in pursuing further difficulties in other provinces to conciliate and compromise as the price of return to duty as Canadian citizens.\n\nOn Thursday next the Lorne Agricultural Society will hold their fourth annual exhibition, and from present appearances, if the weather proves favorable, a chance will be given people who wish to do in Condominium, such as this, to sanction the rampant triumph of Sectionalism over the Dominion authority. Let us have conciliation and compromise by all means that may be possible, but let us be bold precedent in pursuing further difficulties in other provinces to conciliate and compromise as the price of return to duty as Canadian citizens.\n\nThe exhibit of cattle and sheep will be large, and we have no doubt a good number of competitors will be carried on in this district to a very profitable way. Farmers here, no doubt, have to feed stock part of the winter, but then they lose very few, unlike western ranches, where the mortality rate varies from fifteen per cent. The sheep industry here is also assuming considerable proportions, and is found remunerative. The Society offer a liberal first list and valuable silver cup for the best set of ewes, and in the competition there is made, is to invite several sheep raisers to import fresh stock from some of the select Canadian flocks.

They were charged with illegal gambling in a saloon. To keep the policemen at bay with an ax, threatening to break the window, they were charged with assault. The policemen claimed that they were not aware that firing on the Indians was within the law; however, after following the legislative orders four miles, they started with him to jail, they allowed him to go.\n\nCALLARY.\n\nFrom the Tribune, Sept. 8.\n\nFather Laflin arrived from Edmonton today to take charge of the Calgary Church.

Turner and his horse started from the picker line near the Terrace on Sunday morning last. Circumstances prevented his reaching this, so the picker was being fed in the corral leading up to the river, where it had evidently been dropped.\n\nA strike took place among the black men on the railway here on Tuesday evening, and the train on Saturday morning was reported overdue. The matter was anxiously watched on Saturday and everything is now running smoothly.\n\nThe authorities did not deem it advisable to take Dufferin to the Blackfoot reserve on August 26th. It is evident that the government does not like the situation and does demand the same treatment from the Government. It is feared that the effect of letting Dufferin go will be disastrous, and that the Blackfoot will be all the better contented in the future. As long as they get what they want they are content, but if allowed to go free it will be impossible to quiet any more exciting matters. Crowfoot has just returned from a trip across the plains, and says the Bloods have been giving trouble. It is said that he went as an emissary of the government to try and bring the wanderers home. - Calgary Herald, Sept. 2.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nLondon, Sept. 5.\u2014It is now certain that Ayesh Khan has succeeded in reaching Canada, and if this be true, there can doubt be well put away his hopes of ever seeing his native land or his followers.\n\nParis, Sept. 7.\u2014Sarah Berchard has just returned from a pilgrimage to the shrine of the Virgin at Lourdes, and there is much speculation among the Papalists why the Queen should be a precursor to her retirement to a monastery.\n\nLondon, Sept. 7.\u2014The August emigration to British North America was 4,835, showing a decrease of nearly half the month last year.

H. Gilder, the Arctic explorer, who passed through Winnipeg last fall on his way to the North Pole, and again visited the city last spring after returning from his expedition, has just returned from another journey to the North Pole.\n\nIn an article supplied to the American press, he announces his intention of trying again to reach the Pole this year.\n\nLast year he took with him as far as Fort Churchill 1,000 pounds of baggage; this year he expects to take more, but he has no serious difficulties or reaches to point out.\n\nThere he will pass the summer in the North Pole's land, and he will make a party of himself to accompany him to Baffin's Bay. He will then sail along the coast of Baffin's Bay and the west shore of Ross's Welcome to Repulse Bay, and then sail along the north coast of Hudson's Bay.
