Mark v. 14.\n\n---\n\nPrinted at OONIKUP, by permission of\nGeo. Morish, 20, Paternoster Row, London.\nMDCCCXC.\nAs this book has not been composed for spelling, but for reading and instruction, the writer has not limited himself to words of three letters in the first pages, but simply to words of one syllable. The fact is, that reading is not really learnt by means of spelling, but by familiarity with the form of the word and the sound given to it. Spelling should be a separate exercise from reading, for correct spelling belongs more to the art of writing. Let the teacher endeavour to fix the scholar's attention on the form of the word, giving him the sound of it; then he will find him in a short time making easy and rapid progress without the tedious mode of spelling every word. The above principle also allows of the introduction of more advanced reading in the same book. Children learn to read much faster than they get understanding. It is the parent's and teacher's office to seek to exercise the intelligence of the child by explanations.\n\nThe instructions in this book are not given so fully as they would be if the sole object had been to explain truth; therefore the teacher must supply the lack in this, and by questioning, and explaining, and illustrating in a simple way, impress on the young minds the truths of the word of God, which are here but briefly touched upon.\n\nMay all who teach the young remember that it is for eternity they labour, and be led to teach with the high aim of leading sinners to Jesus, that they may have eternal life. Above all, forget not that it is only in dependence upon the Lord, who alone can by His Holy Spirit quicken the soul, that any should engage in this blessed work.\nFIRST READING BOOK.\n\nNistum Aym\u00e9chik\u00e1we Mussimuhikun.\n\na b c d e f g\nh i j k l m n\no p q r s t\nu v w x y z\n\nA B C D E F G\nH I J K L M N\nO P Q R S T\nU V W X Y Z\n1.

It was sin to eat what God said man was not to eat.\n26. Man did eat of it.\n27. So now sin is in man.\n28. Man dies now, for sin is in him.\n29. Sin is in us all, for we are born from the first man.\n30. Sin in us makes us do what is bad, and so we have no love for God.\n31. God will not let sin be near Him.\n\n19.

Jesus was taken from the cross, and put into a grave.\n\n22. A large stone was put before the door of the grave.\n\n23. Men with swords were sent to take care that no one broke open the door.\n\n24. But the angel of the Lord came, and took the stone from the door of the grave.\n\n25. The men did shake for fear of him, and were as if they were dead.\n\n26. But Jesus rose from the dead.\n\n27.

Mary and others who saw Him die, and saw Him put into the grave, saw Him alive again.\n\n29. Jesus often talked with those who loved Him after He rose from the dead.\n\n30. At last He left them and went up into Heaven.\n\n31. As He was talking to them He was taken up in a cloud.\n\n32. He went and sat down on the right hand of God.\n\n33. Those who saw Him ascend kept looking up into Heaven.\n\n34. And two angels told them that this same Jesus would come again.\n\n35. When Jesus went back to His Father, God sent His Holy Spirit.\n\n36. Jesus told those who loved Him to wait for the Holy Spirit.\n\n37. While they were all in one place the Holy Spirit came.\n\n---\n\n28.

They told how He had died and rose again.\n\n40. This made those who heard it think about their sins.\n\n41. It made them cry out and ask, What shall we do?\n\n42. Have you cried out, What shall I do to be saved?\n\n43. The Bible says, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.\n\n44. Till we believe in Jesus, we have nothing but sin and death in us.\n\n45. Jesus, the Son of God, has life.\n\n46. This life will last for ever and ever.\n\n47. If we do not get this life, we shall die, and go into hell, for ever and ever.\n\n48. We get this life by faith in Jesus.\n\n49.
