Irvine is held by them.\n\nThe list of buildings purchased in another column erected in this town in the year just closed is a most creditable one; but there is yet no building of any kind erected so far, at a cost of nearly $3,000; there has been a considerable amount of money spent in finishing buildings put up under former years and we have doubtless omitted one or two of late years erected. When we consider that there is no migration to the place the increase in building is something remarkable, and the substantial and costly nature of most of the buildings erected speaks very highly of the taste of the citizens and the increasing number of citizens in that time.\n\nNow that the municipal elections are over and the excitement occasioned thereby has subsided, we extend our congratulations to the successful candidates, and express the hope that they will drop all private and petty jealousies and direct their energies to the welfare and prosperity of the best interest of the town. We do not agree with those who say that we have the poorest council that it was possible to get on the other hand we believe that it would be difficult to find a more honourable or more practical or watch closer over interests. In Mr. Knowles we have a mayor who is in every way fitted for that position; we feel confident that our interests are safe in his keeping and that he will see that the public money will be wisely expended in the different wards of the town than have hitherto been. We have full confidence that the policy of the new council will be one of economy and that at the end of the year they will go out of office with a clean record.\n\nSome time ago we took the liberty of bringing to the notice of the Dominion Government at the first it is the expense of the late Assembly elections in the districts of Prince Albert and Kinistino had not been paid. We regret that, so far as known by the returning officers for those districts, they have not yet been paid, and those who acted as district returning officers and in other capacities are still anxiously waiting for their money. In some cases those officers have had to travel over 600 miles at a very large personal outlay and it is a gross injustice to keep them waiting so long as they have. The same now holds good and suffered over six months and should move in order for the Government to send up some officials from Ottawa to investigate the case. If there was anything irregular in the matter it should have been brought into the hands of the authorities sooner and settled one way or another; anything would have been more satisfactory than the treatment than that has been meted out to the returning officers and their deputies in the districts mentioned.\n\nWe have for some time felt that steps should be taken towards the formation of a society here having for its object the collection and preservation of information relative to the past and present history of the country; in other words a Scientific and Historical Society, and it ought to include a literary institute as well. We have considered several men who ought to be most likely to take an interest in such a society and all whom we have seen favor the project. We do not anticipate that its expense would be very great, with the result for the benefit of the town it would be invaluable. The country has a past history that should be preserved, and now is the time that it should be done. Many interesting facts, which at present are unknown except to a few natives, are buried in the memory of the Indians. Such a society would hang as its objects the collection of natural history specimens and other scientific works. The formation of a literary society would be of the utmost value and the residents of the town more in need of it today. We see no reason why the scheme could not be successfully carried out, and trust that some one will take the initiative and bring a number of our interested. No harm will be done by discussing the matter and until good may result.\n\nSILK RIBBONS!\nOne of our best dealers who were to have an elegant large package extra fine Assorted Ribbons (by mail) in different widths and at the latest prices.

Only two\u2014Knowles and Knowles of the same name\u2014were nominated for mayor, and the poll was closed Knowles had a majority of twenty-three votes. Of the 123 electors who voted only 120 cast their ballot for mayor, which shows that there were several who did not take part in the majority contest. For councillor in Ward No. 1 the electors were equally divided in their choice between Knowles and Donaldson, the former being declared Knowles elected. In Ward No. 2 a split of about equal strength was shown between Donaldson and Knowles, the latter being elected. In Ward No. 3 Knowles was returned by a majority of twenty-eight votes, while Donaldson received thirty-two votes. In Ward No. 4 Knowles received twenty-eight votes, while Donaldson received thirty-two votes.\n\nWARD NO. 1\n\nKnowles 12\nDonaldson 12\n\nTotal number of votes cast 24\n\nWARD NO. 2\n\nKnowles 27\nDonaldson 27\n\nTotal number of votes cast 54\n\nWARD NO. 3\n\nKnowles 38\nDonaldson 38\n\nTotal number of votes cast 76\n\nWARD NO. 4\n\nKnowles 56\nDonaldson 56\n\nTotal number of votes cast 112\n\nNOTICE.\n\nApplication will be made to the Provincial Court for an order declaring Knowles elected mayor.

In each case we give the name of the contractor and the cost of the building. It will be seen that there were twenty-five new buildings erected, at an aggregate cost of $45,910.\n\nThe first in importance in the Niedert, Kondorberg, is the log hill near the court house. It is a two-story brick building, 37x20 feet, with a bell-tower at the front of the roof and a porch over the front door, and is quite an ornament to the town. Through the courtesy of the contractors who built it, we have been able to see inside, and we must say that no better workmanship has ever been displayed in the North. The log hill contains five class rooms (20x35) fitted up for public instructions, but also used as present at a music room; hall, 30x60 feet; chapel, 20x30 feet; library, 12x12 feet; and 12x12 feet. On the second floor there are two class rooms 21x25 feet, reception rooms 12x12 feet, and a large room 12x12 feet, half 10x12 feet, the same being a fine piece of workmanship. The building is well lighted, and everything about it appears to be perfect. There are five class rooms now furnished with desks, to the number of thirty, the gift of Mr. J. M. McLeod. Mr. J. M. McLeod did a fine chair-case piece of work on the brick, stone and plaster work for $2,500, and A. & W. H. Goodfellow did all the carpenter work for $1,500. Mr. J. M. McLeod did all the carpenter work, etc., for $5,000. Total cost, with extras, about $8,500.\n\nThe log hill was built, and also factory work to the value of $2,000.\n\nT. J.
