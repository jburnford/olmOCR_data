Cochrane got excited (or desired a little publicity), at Cochrane, I am of the opinion it was no trouble to look after these 20 kids.\n\nThose left at Oskalence (Oskalence was out of flour, bread, etc., when the strike came on) 16 kids, I removed by aircraft on Sunday, provided for at Amos, at hospital, nurse was in-charge of the kids, the kids themselves had lot of fun out of all this.\n\nOthers are at home, that is 54 from Waswanipi and other points, as soon conditions return to normal they will moved by normal and usual means of transportation.\n\nHad we not been caught with bad weather, all the Mistassini kids would have been landed at Moose Fort, on time, before the strike went into effect.\n\nH. Lapiviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nThis will put us to-date fairly well, as regard the La Sarte kids, a few at Okaianee, they will have to wait until rail transport is resumed. Our quota for Mistassini - filled, 36 kids, Wawenipi 17, might send in only 16 depending on weight and authority from D.O.T., on the line, we have sufficient kids, returning to complete our allowance 60 kids.\n\nFor your information, the situation with us, is again about normal, at Okaianee, the Nurse and kids, came out, etc., this point is about the worse off on the line, they had no flour when strike came on, also very low on other items.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Children for Moose Fort School\n\nFurther to telephonic conversation, the following was done:\n\n1. Mr. Clark took care of the children at Cochrane - D and escort Miss. Midlige all at Moosonee now.\n\n2. Nurse at Oskelance, with 16 kids, had to be removed, on Amos, via Senneterre, this work was done combined with other Agency affairs.\n\n3. From Amos, we transferred to Moosonee, the 16 kids by air, one trip with permission from Department of Transport, to take number desired, providing we would not exceed maximum weight allowed for mileage to be done.\n\nAbove cleared all Mistassini children, the total cost, won't exceed very much, the regular transportation.\n\nMr. Clark requested our aircraft to proceed to Neskana, to take out via Senneterre a Mr. Jackman, Teacher, our aircraft landed at Neskana, found party out fishing instead of standing by waiting. Pilot requested instructions, I advised to return to his base at once. He waited in view to leave, etc., but found he was away by about 15 miles, so it was useless to wait extra time. The Pilot had to make Waswanipi for the night, weather bad, Miss. Midlige returned with him, on an Agency combined trip Miss. Midlige was returned to Oskelance.\n\nAs regard the Waswanipi children, waiting at home, further to telephonic conversation, they will be sent out direct from Waswanipi to Moose Factory, from Senneterre to Waswanipi trip both ways, will be combined trip, medical etc., usual run, Department of Transport is being requested to authorize, on same condition as we did for the Mistassini kids, One trip only.\n\n.........................\nAir Transport for stranded pupils, Moose Fort Residential school.\n\nOn Friday morning, August 25, I visited the office of the Austin Airways in South Porcupine and contracted with the pilot in charge for two and one-half trips (Cochrane to Moose Fort and return) to handle the twenty children and escorts.\n\nI escorted the first flight of children and was quite busy on route with air-sick children. Miss Fur Supervisor F.C. Racicot accompanied another flight, and the original escort, Miss Eva Molodge of Oskelano, also was flown to Moose Fort where she rode back to Amos in a plane that brought sixteen children from Amos. This plane may also have taken Mr. Jackson from Timiskwa to Amos.\n\nOn the last trip from Moose Fort to South Porcupine I brought out the two summer school teachers, Mr. Spurs and Miss McQuillan. Dr. Cosack of Health Services came out at the first opportunity.\n\nWe might have saved one trip by getting Air Transport Board authority to over-load the plane, but I thought you would prefer not to attract criticism of the handling of Indian children. Besides, phone calls require special permission and I would have had to negotiate with a Toronto office.\n\nIn all 36 children were transported (20 from Cochrane and 16 from Amos). On the phone Mr. Sept. Lariviere told me he would defer sending the remaining 24 of his quota until the railroads are again operating.\n\nCAT Clark\nMemorandum to:\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nMoose Fort Residential School - Stranded Pupils\n\nPlease find hereunder a report from Major Clark concerning the stranding of certain pupils from the Abitibi agency at Cochrane and other points during the recent railway strike.\n\nI would recommend that you authorize the payment of the account of $398.95 for the boarding expenses of these pupils and their escorts.\n\nBernard F.

School,\nMoose Fort via Moosonee, Ont.,\n\nOctober 31, 1950.\n\nI am returning your September Quarterly return as it is impossible to work out the average attendance of pupils during the Quarter.\n\nIt is a common procedure to show the girls on one set of returns and the boys on another with double spacing between the names. When re-submitting this return this rule should be put into practice.\n\nIt has been noted that a large number of pupils have been discharged from residence effective September 1. As these pupils were in residence during the June quarter the school is entitled to a grant of sixty-two days each, that is, for July and August. You have omitted to claim this grant; therefore, it is suggested that when the return is being re-written the pupils you propose to discharge or pupils that have not returned to residence be included on the return and grant claimed for sixty-two days.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the re-written return was forwarded to this office as soon as possible so we would like to have all the grants for residential schools paid prior to November 15.\n\nBernard F.

Should we sign same and forward without physical examination? From last years experience I found it was difficult to have this tended to by the Doctor.

(RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-1C, part 4)\nOttawa, November 18, 1950.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe David Koomayuk, Disc No. 24-364, Eskimo age 15\n\nIn February, 1949, a fifteen year old Eskimo boy, David Koomayuk, was flown by mercy plane from Creasewell Bay on Boothia Peninsula to the Dr. Charles Gamsell Memorial Hospital in Edmonton suffering the loss of both feet from gangrene. Since then he has been fitted with artificial limbs and is now able to move around quite freely. During his stay in hospital he has been taking advantage of the educational opportunities provided, and has learned to talk English fairly fluently already. He has received considerable amount of publicity due to his rather extraordinary progress for he is considered particularly brilliant. He has started Grade 3 arithmetic and in his reading has almost completed his Grade 2 reader.\n\nUnfortunately, a short time ago he contracted a slight case of tuberculosis, but this has been cleared up and Dr. Falconer advises that the boy will be ready for discharge about January 1, 1951.\n\nI am attaching herewith a copy of a letter I am sending to Dr. Moore. In this you will notice that the suggestion has been made that David should be placed at Moose Factory in order that he can attend the school there and also have the benefit of the medical service available at the hospital. Furthermore, he would be in the company of other Eskimo people and would possibly have the opportunity to work into a job that he could handle satisfactorily.\n\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nCapitol Theatre Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario,\n\nN.W.T. to pay the grant to Moose Factory School.\nIt sounds all right.\nC.J.C.\n... 2\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise me whether some arrangement might be made at Moose Factory through your services there for David's care.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 18, 1950.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nI have received a copy of Dr. Falconer's letter to you dated October 10 in which he advises that the above-named Eskimo boy, approximately fifteen years of age, should be ready for discharge about January 1, 1951. The question of David's immediate future was discussed between Mr. Bailey of this Administration and Dr. Falconer recently when it was learned that Dr. Falconer was not too anxious to see this boy return to the rigorous climate of the north too early. He suggested that it would be preferable for this young Eskimo to be placed in a residential school for the next year or two if possible close to a medical centre.\n\nThe problem of this boy's placement has been discussed with both Dr. Simpson and Dr. Procter, the latter of whom suggested that David might be sent to Moose Factory where he could attend school and be close to the hospital there. Furthermore, he might very well work himself into a reasonably good job either as an interpreter or clerk. At the same time being at the gateway to the Eastern Arctic, it might be easier to obtain a position for him in one of the Hudson's Bay Company posts if that became possible at a later date. Dr. Simpson has stated that he is in agreement with such a plan.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would ask Dr. Falconer to discuss this matter with David and ascertain whether this plan would be agreeable to the boy. In the meantime, a copy of this letter will be sent to Colonel Neary, Indian Affairs Branch to determine whether some arrangement might be made at Moose Factory for him at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. P.A. Moore,\nDirector of Indian Health Services,\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\n702 Booth Building,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I suggest that you communicate with Canon H.O.

Arrangements were made accordingly and Lawrence was sent to his sister at Clute, as I understood she had a farm and he could find work to do there. However, I was advised by Dr. Tilley by telephone that his sister Mrs. Webster was not in a position to take care of the boy and I immediately made arrangements for his return to Moose Factory where he was immediately employed on the hospital staff as a cleaner, receiving 60\u00a2 per hour.\n\nMrs. Webster has been advised that her brother is now gainfully employed and is quite capable of caring for himself.

Our last arrangement was as follows:\n\n1. Selecting children - Based on our medical records, free of T.B. and fully protected against contagious diseases - preventable by vaccination - also of a certain degree of intelligence. This to be done by AGENCY.\n\nThis method has given best results - none of our kids died etc., since.\n\n2. Transport arrangement.\n\n3. Can the children return home - every summer.\n\n4. The Residential school should favor us with results - Examination at end of year - indicate degree of intelligence, etc., for I feel a child cannot learn anything at school, it is useless to keep on sending him, when others could replace and do well.\n\nAt Mistassini and Waswanipi, we have reached the stage now, only children of school age, about 7, are available, this class is well protected etc., considering number ready, we can select among the most promising kids.\n\nThanking you in advance, I am leaving today for Mistassini, to return Amos on about July 1st.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nRe: Abitibi Agency children at Moose Factory\n\nThe Administration, each June, requires an annual report from each of its School Principals. The Rev. H. Seegmiller, Principal of the Moose Fort School, under the question \"comments or suggestions re pupils\" has answered as follows:\n\n\"Mr. H. Lariviere, the Superintendent of the Abitibi Agency has been most co-operative. He seems however, to have a tendency to give us a different group of children each year. This fills the school but does not give the promising children an opportunity of advancing as quickly as they should. Perhaps I.S.A. office could write to him at his office in Amos asking his assistance at consecutive schooling for the children from his Agency.\"\n\nI have not written Mr. Lariviere but have given you Mr. Seegmiller's comments instead. They are, I think very practical and sensible and I've been wondering if anything can be done to have the same pupils returned to the school after the holidays rather than a large proportion of new ones. All Mr. Lariviere is doing on behalf of the Anglican children of the Mistassini-Waswanipi country is certainly appreciated and we are not complaining at all but just wondering if the main purpose of operating residential schools is not being somewhat defeated when pupils are frequently changed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nNOA213 69 DL=AMOS QUE 8 1043A=\nTHE INDIAN AFFAIRS BR=\n303 EDUCATION DIVN OTTAWA=\n\nREVEREND SEEGMILLER PRINCIPAL MOOSE SCHOOL ADVISED OUR QUOTA EIGHTY CHILDREN STOP INDIANS INSIST THAT THEIR CHILDREN RETURN HOME FOR ANNUAL VACATION STOP PLEASE SAY IF WE CAN GIVE THEM DEFINITE ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL BE DONE STOP AS REGARD REMOVAL OF CHILDREN ADVISE IF MOOSE FORT SCHOOL WILL PROVIDE TRANSPORT OR IF YOU WISH US TO DO SO BY AIRCRAFT DIRECT OR VIA OSKELANEO AND SENNETERRE AIRCRAFT AND TRAIN=\n\nH LARIVIERE ABITIBI INDIAN AGENCY=\n\nIndian Affairs.

Seegmiller, Principal,\nBishop Borden Memorial School,\nJesuence, Ont.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn connection with the transfer of the children from Mistassini to Moose Fort School, on my arrival at Mistassini I found that our definite understanding had not been lived up to, that is selecting the children. This part you will recollect was definitely understood the Agency would carry out, based on medical records.\n\nOn the children transferred I regret to note child Emma Itapp, Edna Neeposh, Charlotte Joseph, Samuel Hosum, David Hosum, Sarah Jardine, Emma Coon and Emily Loon are TB infected and should have remained at home. Now that they are at school, nothing can be done about it except they should be followed up very closely. The result of this mix-up also that approximately 12 children of school age in perfect health remained at Mistassini.\n\nAs understood in June with you at Mistassini, I would do the selecting and be at Mistassini to do so latest August 17th. I cannot understand why it occurred.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH. Lauriviere - Superintendent\nCree Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the same time, she should be afforded to identify all our children with you, and your list (covering all admissions and those who were retained last year for various reasons) should be handed over to her.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Phelan, Supt. Education.\n\nAttached hereto copy of a letter which speaks for itself.\n\nI am taking advantage of the fact that our nurse is escorting child Roman Petawabano, of Mistassini, to the school, to bring about a definite check on our children taken care of at that point.\n\nThis year, it has been a proper mix-up. The Indians at Mistassini particularly delayed their departure for their trapping lands, which caused poor feeling, etc. At Hanunipi, the same difficulty was experienced, but it was not so serious. During summer it was understood with Bishop Clarke I would be given definite quota early in August, and date of admission to be definitely fixed, with that it would have been easy to arrange and cause no friction. We know nothing yet about the children who were returned to school; it follows we are running into complications, parents, family allowances, etc., etc. We understand the staff is changed at Moose Factory school. However, through our nurse, we hope to establish a definite record. On her return, copy or 'em.\n\nH. Lariviere - Superintendent\nAbitibi Indian Agency.\n\nP.S. To Mr. A.J.

L. Turcif, so that they met.\n\nMiss. Turcif, has been requested, to check and prepare a complete list of our children at hospital or school, she knows them and for definite identification has been furnished with a band list.\n\nThis year, we have had no information from the principal, who was returned home and knew nothing at all about who was returned to school for academic year 1932/1933.\n\nThanking you in advance, for any assistance given our Miss. Turcif.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Lariviere - Supt., Indian Agency.\n\nP.S. If it did happen that we have a child or children at hospital, that should return home, Miss.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc.\nMr. F. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Matters:\n\nComplying with request contained in your wire of Saturday, October 18th, I have to advise you as follows:\n\nI discussed with Father Houle, on Tuesday morning, the question of transferring these children from the Fort George P.C. Residential School to Moose Port. He stated that he had not received any word from the Bishop. In this connection and would be contacting him in the evening. I explained to Father Houle that this was the wishes of the Department but I would be willing to detain my flight to Fort George for a day or so in the event that there may be any further developments. Not hearing from father Houle by Saturday, I arranged for the trip to Fort George and left in the evening reaching Rupert House where I stopped over for the night. I arrived at Fort George at 12:35 Sunday morning and immediately made contact with Father Couture, presenting your wire regarding situation of the children now in his care. He informed me that he would not release these children without the authority of the Bishop and he also stated in any case they would not be able to return with me due to the fact that they were on a picnic. He further stated that he would only release the children on the authority of the Bishop or the parents of the children. Due to the fact that it was the close of the season and the pilot was afraid of being frozen in we had to return immediately without the children.\n\nAfter my return here, Father Houle informed me that two of the children were in hospital and four had been returned to their parents at Fort George. The other 4 children belonging to Rupert House would be returned to their parents at Rupert House by plane or snowmobile. Father Houle advised me that he had\nreceived this information from Father Couture through the Hudson Bay Co. radio and he would send me a letter of confirmation. To date I may advise that no confirmation has been received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.S. Allan\nSuperintendent\nJames Bay Indian Agency\n\nCC: Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nOctober 25, 1952.\n\nRev. Father Houle, O.M.I.,\nMoosonee, Ont.\n\nDear Father Houle:\n\nThis will confirm our conversation of Tuesday afternoon with regard to 10 children now at your Fort George Residential School.\n\nI may advise that I have been informed by our Regional Supervisor that the admission of these children into your school has not been authorised. I have been instructed that they be removed to Moose Fort Residential School at the earliest possible date. The names of these children is as follows:\n\n- Gertie Blackned\n- Roderick Blackned\n- Henry Diamond\n- Lawrence Heistche\n- Sam, Kitty\n- Nellie Duff\n- Billie Rupert\n- Andrew Sam\n- Margaret Pasiniquon\n- Stewart Matches\n\nFrom our conversation I gather that you were getting in touch with Bishop Belleau with regard to this matter, and not having heard any further from you in this connection, I am proceeding to Fort George this afternoon to pick up these children as I have been directed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.S.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n269 Main Street W.,\nNorth Bay, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 2 regarding application for admission forms for new pupils admitted to the Fort George R.C. Indian Residential School, we would like to review the correspondence on this matter:\n\n(a) On November 15th the following telegram was sent to Superintendent Allan: \"Re September Quarterly Return for Fort George R.C. Residential School have not received necessary applications for admission for pupils 69-88, 092-0106 Stop Grant claimed for these will be disallowed until applications received Stop Advise when these can be expected Stop\"\n\n(b) Attached is a list of pupils with the respective register numbers who were shown on the September Quarterly Return for the first time. These pupils do not appear on the June Return for this school. You will notice that the register numbers are the same as those referred to in the telegram.\n\n(c) On November 19 we received a telegram from Superintendent Allan reading \"Retal application for admission forms covering peoples mentioned were taken by Matters last visit\".\n\n(d) On receipt of this telegram we wrote a letter to you dated November 29 as it was presumed that you have all the applications for the children in question.\n(e) In your letter of December 2 you indicated that you had forwarded the applications for the Protestant children who were at the Fort George R.C. Residential School. We have received these applications and the children opposite whose names the X appears are the children for whom we have already received the applications. Applications for admission are required for the other children listed on the attached.\n\nWith reference to the sixth paragraph of your letter of December 2nd you may be very definitely assured that the Department does not pay Per Capita Grant for any children whose admission to a particular residential school has not been officially approved. Attached is a circular which was sent out to all the field officials and Indian Residential School principals indicating this policy and in no instance is Per Capita Grant paid when the admission of a pupil to a residential school has not been approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJanuary 19, 1953.\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Moose Port Indian Residential School, attached I am returning an extra copy of this Return which was inadvertently forwarded to this office. One copy of the Return is all that is required.\n\nOn Form I.A. 411, the Principal has included pupil # 302 Henry Cowboy, however, this boy's name does not appear on the September Quarterly Return nor do we have an application for admission for him. Please advise who this boy is and why his name was included on I.A. 411.\n\nFor pupils 248 and 0299, the Principal has claimed less than the prescribed number of days in the Quarter and for pupils # 0253, 0289 and 0317 the Principal has claimed ninety-two days grant and for all of these pupils he has indicated they were in hospital but he has not shown the period of absence. In other words he has not indicated the date on which these children left residence and later returned if they did return. Without this information we are unable to pay the Per Capita Grant for them. In order to avoid delaying payment of the Per Capita Grant for the whole Return we are disallowing the grant claimed for the above-mentioned children until the matter is clarified. The Principal may claim retroactive grant for these children on the March Return but he must indicate in the Remarks Column the reason for his action, the reasons for the pupils' absence and the required dates.\nIn many instances it is noted that the children were ill during the Quarter, however, the Principal has neglected to indicate whether these children remained in the school during their illness or were returned home or placed in a hospital. Please advise regarding each of the pupils. If any of the children were placed in hospital or sent home it will be necessary to indicate when these pupils left school and later returned to school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nJanuary 31, 1953\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am attaching hereto application for admission of Henry Cowboy, Rupert House Band No. 7, who was transferred from Moose Factory Indian Hospital on Nov. 13, 1952.\n\nJ.

The Indians for this are not to be blamed at all. They remained at Mistassini, waiting for transportation. Finally those that could not hold out any longer left for their trapping lands; more, one family left a child with another family waiting for transportation. Finally he could not be taken. That particular child had to winter away from home. The difficulties caused us last year were discussed with Right Reverend Bishop Clarke and I hope it will never repeat itself. I might add it prevented one family from reaching their trapping lands, and during winter we had to fly supplies to them.\n\nFor Mistassini, the children should be removed on August 15th; for Baawmipi, immediately after.\n\nPlease let us know if possible by return of mail how many children you can take care of this coming year from Abitibi Agency.

He apparently is in a cast and has to use a crutch to get around. The School, at the present time, is closed down as the school staff are on holidays and there they are not in a position to take care of this patient.\n\n\"I have discussed the matter with Dr. McKone and regret that it is not possible for us to take care of this Eskimo in our School at the present time.\"\n\nI regret that it has not been possible for us to be of assistance to you in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAmos, Que.,\nAugust 20th, 1953.\n\nReverend H.S. Shepherd, Principal,\nBishop Horden Memorial Indian Residential School,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Reverend Sir,\n\nIn connection with admission and discharge of Indian children attending Bishop Horden School, we find the admission date as fixed now is a cause of difficulties to all concerned. To solve the problem you suggest that the school close on June 15th and re-open on August 15th. I think this would be in line with the needs and prevailing conditions at Mistassini and Waswanipi, as it appears you cannot overcome the fact that the staff must have two months off, also the children.\n\nI suggest that you discuss the matter with Reverend Bishop Clarke and Reverend Canon Cook, and if you can arrive at something definite refer the matter to the Superintendent of Education in Ottawa.\n\nThe Indians at Mistassini particularly must get on the move to return to their trapping lands by early August, and they cannot very well leave children with others trapping closer to Mistassini awaiting for transportation and so on. The same remark applies to Waswanipi, although here they can wait a few days, etc.\n\nWhen at Mistassini and Waswanipi recently arrangements were made for children to return and be on hand for dates as called for by you, I might add the Indians at Mistassini were not too happy about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Moore\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 20th, John Sutherland died in Lady Minto Hospital, Cochrane, January 8th, of Tuberculous Meningitis.\n\nI was called to the School at Moose Factory to see him on December 19th. The day previous he had complained of a frontal headache and was put to bed with a Temperature of 101F. Before this time he had apparently been without any complaints.\n\nOn examination I found a very well nourished boy with absolutely no objective signs or symptoms of disease. He said he had occasional headaches and his Temperature had risen to 102F. He was immediately moved to the Hospital, on December 19th. On Dec. 20th there was some irregularity in the eye reflexes and he was somewhat irritable and had vomited once. The diagnosis of Meningeal infection was tentatively made but on examining his ears I found a fly imbedded in the left canal against the ear drum. There was peripheral inflammation of the drum and the vault of the canal was tender and blod easily. On pressure over the Mastoid area there was tenderness. The fly was removed, warm irrigations of boracic solution begun and he was given Sulphathiazole. After 48 hours there was no change and there seemed to be more Mastoid tenderness. Considering the possibility of a slow acting Mastoid infection which would require surgery I sent him to Cochrane December 25th, with his Father as escort, recommending to Doctor Empye that he keep in mind that the apparent ear condition might be masking a Tuberculous Meningitis.\n\nWhen I phoned Dr. Empye about the boy's condition a few days later the Mastoid infection had practically all cleared up and the evidence of his Meningitis was clearer.\n\nIn July 1943 on chest X-ray minimal active Tuberculosis was discovered in the right lung and he was recommended for rest by Toronto. He was kept in Hospital here to February 1944 and returned to School in greatly improved condition with a gain of 12 lbs. in weight. May 1944 X-ray showed the previous evidence of Tub. had cleared up\u2014the report from Toronto reading\u2014\"This case was previously diagnosed as Pulmonary Tuberculosis, minimal, active, but there is no definite evidence of parenchymal...\"\ninfiltration now.\"\n\nFrom then until the time of his last illness he had had no symptoms of disease and appeared to be healthy. He was due for re X-ray this month along with two other School boys who had previously been under treatment for Tuberculosis. These other boys have been X-rayed but reports from Toronto have not yet been received.\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Rev. T.J.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the Hon. the Indian Department,\nOttawa\n\nMy apology for not having replied to your inquiries but an earlier date is the foresight of the contemplated duties of my position to settle with the fact that I wished only to consider the bearing of all these changes on our work and what it would involve.\n\n1st - I am persuaded that a standard of education such as you have mentioned for admission to the school would be a great advantage. It would stimulate better adapted study before coming. It would create a wholesome competition among the reserve schools. It would be much easier to classify the pupils when they enter the institution. More work could be accomplished in a shorter term time allowing a greater number to share the benefits of the best.\n\n2nd - I am in favor of the course of four years for the boys but not only for the girls. Those who have worked with us decide the time about equally between the length of school during all of their term in the best. I do not think you can improve on that plan.\n\nMy experience has led me to the conclusion that it will be well to take the girls when about 18 or less than four years too much to send into foreign culture instead of the Indian women.\n\nA primary department would doubtless facilitate the work of the school but would involve the employment of an additional teacher and in any case an additional building. In my judgment the extra outlet would be a good investment for the Indians.\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. W. Sheppard, Governor of Great Slave Industrial Institution, referring to certain proposed changes in its conduct of Industrial Schools, have been forwarded to this office. As it is part of our agreement with the Department that all correspondence in regard to schools conducted by the Missionary Society shall be sent to the General Secretary, I take the liberty of replying to the letters above referred to.\n\nThe suggested changes in the conduct of Industrial or Schools appear to be the following:\n\n1. An Educational Standard of Admission to be adopted.\n2. The time for girls and boys to remain at these institutions to be limited to three and four years respectively; the last two years in the case of boys, the school being likely to learning trades, attending school only at night.\n3. A preparatory School in connection with Industrial Institutions.\n4. Government Certificate.\n\nIndian Affairs. (Re: 10, Volume 6205, file 408-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMethodist Church of Canada\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nToronto\n\nTo be granted to those who qualify in the local day schools for entrance into the higher schools.\n\n6. Granting Government Certificates to boys who have completed four years at the Institution and have shown steady at the trade learned interest for a period of two years. Such certificates to entitle them to advancement in other advantages.\n\n7. All institutions and day schools are subject to regular government inspection in the same manner as common schools among the white population.\n\n7. The Government Inspector will use his influence with the Indians to make the Indians attend the day schools, etc.\n\nIn regard to proposal No. 5, I want to observe that any regulation which will induce the Indians to keep their children steadily at the local schools is highly desirable, and it is quite possible an examination test might supply a much-needed stimulus. At the same time the standard should not be made too high, and due notice should be given to the various bands\u2014a year at least\u2014before the rule is enforced. Further, those who pass the articulation examination should be permitted to go to the higher school as a\nMethodist Church of Canada.\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nToronto,\n\nmatter of right, not merely of favor. To look out the prospect of admission to the higher School, and when the certificate is gained refuse permission to enter, would have a very injurious effect.\n\n2. In regard to the second proposal, I submit that the time specified is altogether too short. It would be too short in the case of white children, much more so in the case of Indian youths, where the habits of years, and too deeply imbedded tendencies have to be overcome. Experience convinces us that the only way in which Indians of this country can be permanently elevated and thoroughly civilized, is by removing the children from the surroundings of Indian home life and keeping them separate long enough to form those habits of order, industry, and systematic effort which they will never learn at home.\n\nThe proposal that boys should spend the last two years exclusively in learning trades, and attend school at night, is, in my humble judgment, impracticable, so far as the latter part is concerned. As a rule, Indian lads have no great love for study, and after having worked at a trade all day it will be very difficult.\nMethodist Church of Canada.\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nIf not altogether impossible, to induce them to spend their evenings in study. The present system of giving part of the day to study and part to work is preferable, as it supplies that variety of employment which is so necessary in the training of Indian youths.\n\n3. A preparatory School in connection with an Industrial Institution might answer a good end, or at all events such arrangements as would admit of a classification of pupils.\n\n4. Government certificates to those who reach a certain standard in the Day Schools would have a good effect; they carried the right of admission into the Institution Schools.\n\n5. Certificates to those boys who had completed the course and learned a trade would also be useful, provided opportunity is afforded the boy to continue his trade. Thus leaving the Institutions they leave no money wherewith to start a business on their own account, and it is difficult for an Indian youth to find employment in shops around by solitary areas.\n\n6. So far as I am aware all schools conducted by the Missionary Society are now open to Government inspection.\n\nIndian Affairs. (No. 10, Volume 6205, File 408-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMethodist Church of Canada\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nToronto.\n\n7. The influence of the Govt Inspector in inducing the Indians and their children regularly to the local Day School, would be of great value if constantly and wisely employed. Still it is of more importance to take children away from homes altogether than it can be done.\n\nReviewing the whole question I would respectfully submit for the consideration of the Superintendent several the following suggestions:\n\nI. In regard to Industrial Institutions:\n   1. Increase the number of pupils who may attend from 50 to say 150, and make due provision in the matter of school rooms etc., as well as unit of classification of pupils under two separate teachers. Give prizes for proficiency in the various branches.\n\n2. Fix the term of residence at five years for pupils and six years for boys, and make attendance for this term compulsory. The return of the children to their homes, even temporarily,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, File 46-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMethodist Church of Canada\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\n1871\n\n1. Has a bad effect, while true permanent removal after one or two years results in the loss of all they gained.\n\n2. When boys have completed their term and learned a trade, give them not only certificates, but help to start in business, such as a good set of tools and a small stock of material. If they have learned farming, give them land of their own on the reserve to which they belong, and advance a supply of seed and some implements, to be repaid out of annuities.\n\n3. Increase the number of trades taught at the institutions, and make provision for the sale of surplus manufactured stock.\n\n4. Goods are often purchased from the Industrial Institutions by Indians who give orders on their annuities in payment. Best in paying annuities, these orders are sometimes repudiated by Agents, so the money goes to independent traders who hold similar orders. If the design is to encourage these Industrial Institutions, Agents should be instructed to honor all proper orders held by the Governors against annuities.\n\nII. In regard to local Day Schools:\n\n1. Let the Indians be required to keep school houses in a state of thorough repair.\nMethodist Church of Canada\n\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT\n\n2. Let Agents be instructed to insist upon the regular attendance of all children & School age.\n\n3. Let Examinations be held at regular intervals by qualified persons appointed for the purpose; let certificates of honor be given for punctual attendance and good conduct, & prizes for proficiency in studies. The work of examination will properly be performed by the County inspectors of public schools.\n\n4. Increase Salaries of Teachers so as to secure a higher grade of qualification, & more efficient service. It is unreasonable to expect the services of an efficient teacher for $250 per annum. Should this suggestion meet your approval, the Missionary Society will be prepared to put its proportion of the advance, in the case of schools under its control.\n\nHoping that these suggestions will not be deemed out of place,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

With regard to the complaint made by Mr. Smith, the schoolmaster at the Mount Elgin Industrial School during March Quarter last, and to say that upon reference to the file quoted by you this found that you are correct in your statement that such extra time was allowed the Institute last year; and you were not officially informed that such allowance was only to be given for that year.\n\nThe Bath School had also been...\nto recognize the claim for the current fiscal year although it was not in accordance with the practice or policy which is automatically of the annual grant to Industrial Institutes on a fixed scale for the actual daily attendance of each pupil up to its maximum capacity and not on the average attendance as hitherto.\n\nUpon examination the quarterly returns from the Institutes for the current year also found that despite the first quarter, September 30th of the pupils were present at the Institute only 19 days while 13 attended for the full term of 42 days and the remainder of the pupils were reported returned for longer or shorter periods between their vacations. The total earnings for that quarter amounted to $50.00 a cheque for which amount was sent through the agency last December to the Institutes in the Northern Province.\nIt was found the full amount of the Quarterly Grant, $875.00, on cheque for $347.50. The next claimed in order will be made quarterly until the balance above stated.\n\nThe Dept does not consider that this way of carrying the full amount of the Grant should be followed after the close of the present fiscal year at the discretion of the people. It is believed by the addition of only $19.00, school days during any quarter, a more reasonable rate would be paid. While recognizing that the return of pupils for a short vacation to their homes in the older provinces where their parents are more keenly engaged may not be so prejudicial to them as in other parts of the Dominion, this will not happen here.\nMay break in the customary abundance of such kindnesses, n't likely to under them another visitor for this reason alone, not because of the time or work to be arranged, but as a means to bring back to discontent among parents to reply to our dear, but a step towards the best course to bring forth a short statement instead of the week, to both people or employers for the next year in the understanding that such need will come to gradually decrease.\n\nMay add that none of the other members receive any aid and are allowed any vacation whatever it is hoped that the future arrangement will be satisfactory to you.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

During that period not one of them ever obtained a certificate as a public school teacher.\n\nEight years ago after due consideration it was deemed to adopt the regular industrial system which gave the pupils two days in the school, and one out.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nAttorney.\nThis seemed the advantage of a graded school.\n\nThe senior classes were given four full days in the school each week, and two days to the different branches of industry. The junior pupils averaged three and a half days in school, and two and a half days at the different industries.\n\nAt the same time the summer vacations were commenced, and were limited to six weeks, with two weeks off for Christmas.\n\nIt was found however, that the winter vacation was impracticable as the pupils lacked the clothing necessary, and the Christmas vacation was added to that of the summer, making the two months.\nFour years ago, the vacation was extended three months, beginning from the third Wednesday in July to the third Wednesday of October.\n\nTo make up for this, it was decided to have school every Saturday afternoon, and to have the teacher present for one hour each evening to assist the pupils in the study of the lessons for the following day.\n\nTo all these changes the Indian Department consented, and the results have justified its action. Twenty pupils have obtained certificates in eight years, while for thirty previously there was none, while there has been an equally marked improvement in the different branches studied.\n\nBefore...\nBefore the establishment of a regular vacation, the principal and teachers were greatly perplexed with pupils going home without permission, and sometimes they were almost forced to send them home by threats to prevent them from running away. It was difficult to enforce discipline, and the efficiency of the school was greatly impaired because pupils were absent.\n\nUnder the present arrangement these difficulties are largely obviated.\n\nIt is well then in mind that Mr. Simpson gets his assistance from 16 and often from 20 different Reserves. The pupils earn money to take them home.\nUtica, and as a matter of course they require time for this purpose.\n\nIf Mr. Elson were like the Mohawk chief, and its purpose could be known and uttered in a day, without suspense, it would make a great difference to the teachers from five since months committing attention it is very desirable that they should be free for the annual vacation.\n\nTo make the change proposed would be a disadvantage to the school and a disappointment to the parents.\n\nI submit the points above mentioned.\nFor your consideration,\nand respectfully request\nthat an early reply be\nsent as the vacation\nbegins on the 18th prop.\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Shaw,\nActing Deputy.\nRes. A. Butler, Esq.,\nJail Head, Richmond,\nBurlington Street,\nToronto, Oct.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRes.

Last year however they were reduced to six weeks by the order of the Department. This reduction of time was felt to be a hardship in this way. Many of the pupils had to earn their passage money before leaving the Institute after the holidays commenced. This gave them a very brief stay at home.\n\nIf you could see your way to fix it at two months that would be halfway between the old and the new time.

She\nis quite improved, and that they are hopeful\nthat she will be able to do so in a short\ntime.\n\nNow I hardly know what I could\nhave done with her. I had had to take\nher care, and at Mr. Wilson's house and\nwould it take care of her at the institute,\nand as the extra care must have been\nconsiderable, and possibly expensive,\nI have thought that it might be well to send\na small amount (say five) with her own\nmoney which has been intended to the balance\nof each day's dues she has paid at the\nInstitution, to be placed to her credit, for the\npurpose of buying and dressing her\nclothing after her sickness, whatever\nmight be required, and let her keep\nthrough the summer, as it would only be a small\namount compared to what she would need\nin clothes and other necessities.\n6. The funds were taken without the consent of the Council of the Band.\n\nThere were other in Council authorizing the taking of the money. The Orders in Council are dated 12 June 1873 and 17 January 1875.\nThe Mount Hope Lunatic Asylum building was constructed in 1896. The Indian bands contributed $7,000 towards this and Parliament voted $2,500 for heating apparatus and plate roof. But Waller's $2,150 did not cover the total cost.\n\nAccording to the Principal's statement made to the Insurance Agent in January 1897 and to a Memorandum dated April 1897 or July 1897, the new building was then worth about $30,000.\nSir,\n\nI am glad of the opportunity to make a complaint in behalf of pupils and parents.\n\nOur custom is to allow each pupil an opportunity every two weeks for correspondence. This is done in the school room under the supervision of the teachers. All the appliances supplied by the Institute except the stamps. The letters both going and coming are under close supervision. Much of course has to be intercepted at times. It seems necessary to prevent letters written in Indian from going out, and the pupils under stand that all must be in English or the letter cannot go. It would be an advantage if all parents and guardians were compelled to the same.\n\nIf there is correspondence in the school of Indians making an immediate reply, it is our custom to answer it from the office. The pupils are very slow about answering. Parents can always get an answer to any question sent about the pupils by writing to me.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

STEWART\n\nActing Secretary\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Inland Revenue,\nOTTAWA\nLABORATORY OF THE INLAND REVENUE DEPARTMENT.\n\nOttawa, 24th July, 1901.\n\nMEMO\n\nThe following samples of water have been analyzed for the Dept. of Indian Affairs:\n\nNo. 1 Water Lime Cistern\nNo. 2 Well in lane\nNo. 3 next barn\nNo. 4 Spring next barn\n\nResults of Analysis\u2014(parts per million)\n\n| No. 1 | No. 2 | No. 3 | No. 4 |\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Dissolved Solids dry at 100\u00b0C | 580 | 920 | 484 | 440 |\n| Dissolved Solids on ignition | 286 | 464 | 304 | 250 |\n| Loss | 174 | 476 | 285 | 207 |\n\nThere was no blackening or fountillation on igniting.\n\nPhosphates\n\nVery faint \u2014 heavy \u2014 none \u2014 none \u2014\n\nNitrogen as free & Saline -0.185 \u2014 0.144 \u2014 0.074 \u2014 0.046 \u2014 Ammonia\n\nNitrogen as albuminoid 0.299 \u2014 0.337 \u2014 0.160 \u2014 0.314\n\nas Nitrates 23,000 \u2014 50,000 \u2014 49,000 \u2014 33,000\n\nChlorine in Chlorides \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014 4,000 \u2014 36,000 \u2014 18,000 10,000\n\nAs regards the Nitrogen in Nitrates, the amount is so very high as to call for special explanation. It has been determined by two independent methods, so that no error of work can account for these high numbers. Nor can I believe that they represent the true character of any naturally occurring water. I am therefore driven to conclude that the bottles (stopped Winchesters) need as containers have originally contained Nitric Acid and have not been properly washed out. It is remarkable that all the samples (and notably numbers 2 and 3) have a decidedly acid reaction\u2014which seems to favor the explanation suggested. If the Nitrate Nitrogen found by\nme, is actually present in the water, it must be held to indicate past sewage pollution to a frightful and most dangerous extent.\u2014But this I am not prepared to admit\u2014\n\nJudging from the other results of analysis, Sample No. 2 is to be regarded as distinctly objectionable, and probably dangerous. The Chlorides and phosphates as well as the ammonical nitrogen point to sewage.\n\nThe other samples are not altogether above suspicion of pollution; although the absence of marked traces of phosphates, make it possible that the nitrogenous pollution may have a vegetable rather than an animal origin. While I do not feel at liberty to condemn any of these samples (Nos. 1, 3, & 4) absolutely, I cannot pronounce any of them as safe or desirable sources of supply.\n\n(signed) A. Mc. Gill.\nLaboratory of the Inland Revenue,\nOttawa, 25th July, 1901.\n\nMr. Himsworth Esq., Sec.&c.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 3rd inst.,\nNo. 83941, I send herewith Mr. McGills report regarding\nthe analysis of four samples of water from the Dept. of Indian\nAffairs. You will see that he very much doubts whether the\nsamples were properly taken, i.e., whether the bottles con-\ntaining them were properly cleaned.\n\nI would suggest that inquiry be made as to whether\nthe directions were followed in procuring the samples which\nare given in the printed memo, also sent herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Thomas Macfarlane.\nPrecautions to be observed in procuring Water Samples for Analysis.\n\nTwo Winchester Steppered Bottles are to be used for each sample. (Stone-ware bottles should not be used.) They are first to be rinsed out then filled about one-third full with water and some coarse sand and shaken continuously for several minutes; they must then be again washed out and show themselves perfectly clean. In filling them with the sample water they are first to be rinsed out with it several times, then once completely filled and emptied, and after this has been done again filled with the water for analysis and securely stoppered; the stoppers should not be sealed, but firmly and securely tied over, either with a piece of cloth or, after the manner of druggists, with leather, and the string sealed with sealing wax, that the water may not be tampered with in transit. If the water is taken from a tap, enough should be pumped or allowed to run to waste to thoroughly clean the pipes. In taking water from a pond or river the bottle may be filled by plunging it beneath the surface so as to avoid any sown or floating material. The accompanying label should be filled up and affixed to the bottle.\nJuly 29th, 1871\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your communications of the 20th May and subsequent letter of the 25th June, relative to obtaining the analysis of the water taken from the Mount Royal Industrial School.

In doing so, I have had the bottles containing the water properly cleaned in accordance with the printed directions sent you, as the amount of nitrogen in nitrates as shown by the analysis is so very high that the officer considers that the bottles used as containers originally held nitric acid and were not properly washed out.

It is important that we follow these instructions carefully to ensure the accuracy of our samples.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to inform you that previous samples taken in St. John's contained ammonia.

The well near \"Centre of Cultivated Field\" is the source of which the water is brought in the stream from 3rd Creek to the river.\n\nAbout three fourths of the year this water flows from the source, but during the winter months it is carried by the river.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute drew attention to the unusual character of the water supply there, which is derived from underground springs and carried to the building by under-tiling drains and which he states for the most part are open-placed at no great depth and run through cultivated fields which are liberally cultivated with natural manure.\n\nThe Principal was asked to submit samples of the water taken from its source and also from the taps in the building for analysis. Four samples were forwarded to the Inland Revenue Department and the Dominion Analyst reports that one of the samples (No. 2) is to be regarded as distinctly objectionable and probably dangerous and the others are not altogether above suspicion of pollution. He thought that the pollution might be owing to the samples not being properly taken, that is that the bottles might not have been properly cleaned. The Principal was written to on this point and stated that the bottles in which the samples were forwarded had been cleaned in accordance with the directions given by the Inland Revenue Department by a chemist in St. Thomas and again at the school before being filled, and the Inland Revenue Dept. was so informed.\nSecretary of that Department writes under date of the 23rd instant that satisfactory results can only be obtained by personal inspection of the well and its surroundings and that he will be pleased to have this done if this Department should desire it, provided always that it bears the necessary travelling and incidental expenses.\n\nMr Macrae in his report above referred to says that he could not learn that sickness had been traced to the use of this water.\n\nIs it the wish of the Department that anything further should be done in this matter?\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Industrial school I beg to say that the analysis of the four samples submitted to the Department of Inland Revenue shows that sample No. 2, which is taken from the well in the land next the barn may be regarded as distinctly objectionable and probably dangerous; the chlorides and phosphates, as well as the ammoniacal nitrogen pointing to sewage.\n\nThe other samples are not altogether above suspicion of pollution and while the Analyst does not feel at liberty to condemn samples 1, 3 and 4 absolutely, he does not consider them as safe or desirable sources of supply.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Sheppard states, in reference to these samples that No. 1 is used in the house for cooking and drinking and that the water from the other three sources is used by the boys for drinking when in the vicinity.\n\nNo complaints were ever made concerning the water supply by the Principal, who has had charge of the school for over twenty years, and in his last annual report received on the 16th ultimo, he refers to this matter as follows:\n\n\"An abundant supply of living water, first class ventilation and a complete system of sewerage.\"\naccount in part for the excellent health of the pupils.\n\nThe attention of Mr Macrae was called to the matter by his having noticed that the ground over the tile pipes was covered with manure during his visit in the early spring, which was liable to percolate through into the pipes. The analysis shows that this has probably taken place especially as regards sample No.2. However in the face of the finding of the Analyst we have the continuous good health of the pupils and it is a question to my mind whether any drinking water can be found absolutely pure. I think however, that Rev. Mr Shepherd should be advised of the result of the analysis and asked for a report thereon. It would probably be a most expensive matter to introduce a new system of water supply, even if it were possible to do so as most likely all the available sources have been utilized on the premises and land in connection with the school already.\n\nI may add that the school was built by with funds contributed by the Indians and is situated on reserve land belonging to the Muncey Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In three cases the water is taken from water tank cisterns, the water being brought to them from a distance through tile drains at a depth of from 4 to 6 ft. below the surface. The water constantly running. Before sending it you, the town of Owen Sound had been visited and cleaned. Since sending the water, the town has been cleaned. I will now report sediment that has gathered during the year, for it is our custom to have them cleaned once a year.

We have decided in the future to use lime and wood ashes as fertilizers when necessary, and trust that in this way very possible objections may be removed.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nW.W.

Elgin Institution, I do not see what earthly good it will do for Mr. Macneill to hold an investigation into such indefinite charges. If there were sufficient grounds for prosecution all that the Principal would have to do is to lay a complaint and have Plain arrested. As this is a civil matter I do not see that the Department should interfere.\n\nMr. Macneill was sent up to the Mt. Elgin School last March to investigate certain complaints against the Principal. In his report he wandered away from these charges and asked that a watchman be appointed to guard the Institution from marauders and called the attention of the Department to the unsanitary condition of the water supply. A watchman was engaged at the expense of the department and the water was analyzed and Mr. Shepherd said that it was good and the water was treated. The department was put to the expense for the watchman's wages and if Mr. Shepherd had any just grounds for suspecting lack of investigation the law was open to him. It appears that Mr. Macneill, a lawyer of London, did not think it worth his while to pursue these charges, therefore I think the department would be unwise in going any further in the matter.\n\nMartin Ross\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo J.A.

Algic Institute, of the 9th instant hereunder, I beg to say\n\nFirst, in regard to his application to continue the services of a night watchman that I do not consider that the Department should be called upon to pay for his services any longer, and in fact there is nothing on file to show why they were ever authorized to engage him. This school is wholly maintained and managed by the Methodist Missionary Society and is not a grant from the Department of $20 for each of 200 pupils, and they are bound by their agreement with the Department in the same manner as all schools receiving such a grant, to provide a sufficient number of employees to properly conduct the school, and if a night watchman is deemed necessary the Missionary Society should pay for his services.\n\nA large insurance amounting to $5,000 is carried on this building which is sufficient to protect the Government from any loss by fire. The reason for placing the risk on the Institute was that different Bands in the Province of Ontario had contributed about $20,000 from their capital towards the erection of the new building.\n\nThe wages of the watchman, who has been employed for the last eight months, now amount to $200, which the Department will have to pay in any case.\nSecond, as to Mr. Shepherd's suggestion that Mr. Inspector Macrae be instructed to act as a detective with a view of bringing to justice a gang of thieves that have been a terror to the law abiding people on the reserve for years, I beg to say that in a letter from Mr. Macrae of the 8th instant hereunder to you, he says that McGee of London could not see what to do about the Sam Plain gang on the Cariboo Reserve and consequently did not act. Mr. McGee is a lawyer there. Sam Plain has the reputation of being a hard case but although a half-breed, he is connected by marriage with most of the Chiefs of the Band and any probing of unfounded charges would only create ill-feeling and make trouble for the new Agent.\n\nIf Mr. Shepherd will make formal and specific complaint, there would then be something to go upon. Plain has laid formal charges against Mr. Shepherd, which although they fell through, have created a good deal of bad feeling between them.\n\nIt seems to me that the Methodist Missionary Society, under whom Mr. Shepherd is working should be advised of the condition of affairs at this school.\nOTTAWA, 6th December, 1901\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 9th ultimo I am directed to inform you that the Department can no longer be responsible for the wages of the night watchman employed at the Mount Elgin Institute and it will now expect the Methodist Missionary Society to provide for this official, should his services be further retained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Within a few weeks from now a lot of horses, and a lot of other things have been stolen from people within a range of four miles from where we consider the center of the farming department. Also the Division House here has been rifled twice. We are quite sure this gang has its head quarter about 2 miles of the Smiths on the Caradoc River.\n\nOn the night of the 15th last our stable horses was stolen from our house stable. We have not been able to get any trace of it. We think if you could send an detective here with full power to take any necessary measures\nTo break up the gang, it could be done, but we cannot seem to accomplish anything through the local men.\n\nIt is now believed that the thieves are hiding the stolen goods in the North-West, where they have been known to be operating in former times, and perhaps there are white men connected with this. A car load of goods and chattels were sent out some time ago, and it is anticipated that another will go soon, and it is altogether likely that the thieves & other things will go in the car.\n\nNow I think if a good detective would come put a pipe on them and have the gang broken up, I may say as I have before, it is our belief that till some strong hands take the matter in charge it will only get worse.\n\nWe should have some better man than your General Agent, Mr. E.J.

As I stated we have tried it for a term of twenty years during which time we have been most economical, frugal and almost unwarrantably industrious and yet with all this effort we are seriously in debt today on current account. This does not include debt on account of improvement, of which I shall speak later. If we had a larger farm without paying rent it would put us in a different position. Two hundred and four acres is the amount of land belonging to the Institution for which we do not pay rent; the other land we occupy is rented from Indians through the Department, and after paying the rent and making use the fences (as we have to do) and properly tile draining the land the profits are comparatively small.\n\nAs far as I know there is no other institution...\nin like position. Take the Mohawks at Brantford, it is largely supported by the New England Company, so that the Government grant of that institution is supplementary, and in regard to the Pugwash at the Seal, a former principal told me, that nearly all their pupils were supported by Sunday Schools in different places, at a rate of from sixty to eighty-five dollars each, so that the income from that source he said was larger than the income from the department.\n\nYou intimated that this being an industrial school, we are entitled to a larger grant and that you would carefully look into the matter in view of such grant. If the department can see its way clear to double our grant we will be able to manage current on current accounts and keep out debt and enable us to lessen the amount of manual labor of the pupils and to more fully instruct and explain the reason for what they do together with increased social comfort which would probably include a library, reading-room, gymnasium shower baths etc.\n\nAs I stated the manner and cost of living are greatly increased during the last few years, as well as the expenses of the staff which is more than double what it formerly was.\n\nIn the second place I reminded you that our out-buildings were all constructed of wood originally and as they were built twenty to fifty years ago, it was about...\nnecessary if they were to be saved from dilapidation to go on with the work of repairing. This we have done until the cost of material (not labor) slightly exceeds two thousand dollars as you will see from invoices already in possession of the department, and other vouchers to be sent in a few days. In regard to this debt you were good enough to say that we need not have any anxiety as the department would provide.\n\nIn the third place I pointed out to you that the shops that have stood for over thirty years and are wooden buildings require new paint, roof, new floors and other repairs which at a low estimate will cost six hundred dollars for material.\n\nThe laundry also must have cement floor, new boiler and fittings at an estimated cost of four hundred dollars.\n\nThe last thing mentioned but possibly first in importance among the items of improvement is the erection of an elevated water tank and pipings to give us additional water pressure, as a better and larger preparation against fire. This is very important and should be constructed at the earliest possible date. The cost of this at a low estimate including the fittings will not be less than five hundred dollars.\n\nIn regard to these items we were delighted to have your encouraging promises.\nAll of which is respectfully submitted in hope of an early and satisfactory reply.\n\nW.M. Shepherd\nPrincipal\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 28th November, 1902\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Mr. Shepherd, Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, calls the attention of the Department to the requirements of this school, referring first to the insufficiency of the per capita grant.\n\nThis school was established more than fifty years ago and was placed in charge of the Methodist Missionary Society by whom it is still conducted, the Department contributing a per capita grant of $60 per annum to assist them in carrying it on. One hundred pupils are authorized to receive this grant, making the total contribution of the Department $6000.00 per annum. It must be admitted that $60.00 a year is not a sufficient sum for the maintenance and education of these pupils and unless such grant is supplemented by liberal contributions from the Methodist Missionary Society, or the earnings of the institute, financial disaster is bound to overtake the school. Mr. Shepherd, in his endeavor to make up the required difference has gone very extensively into stock farming, and, as he says, after the most careful economy, he is unable to make ends meet, the deficit on last year's transactions being $86.19. His statement of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ended 30th June 1902 does not show that he received any money from the Methodist Missionary Society.\nSociety, beyond the sum of $6000.00 sent to it by the Department. It may be therefore taken for granted that the Methodist Missionary Society does not contribute anything towards the support of this school, although so long as it remains under their control, they are bound to make up the deficit. This Society has other pressing calls on its funds and last year it withdrew its contributions to the day schools in Ontario, which were formerly carried on under its auspices. This leaves Mr. Shepherd to rely upon the Departmental grant and what he can make from his farm, which with the land attached to the institution and that rented from the Indians, comprises 504 acres. Mr. Shepherd has to pay rent for 300 acres of this land as well as keeping up the fencing and other improvements, all of which is quite a drain on his earnings, to say nothing of the expenditure of energy on the part of his pupils, who are, as he says, of necessity unwarrantably industrious! The care of over two hundred head of cattle, which chiefly involves an the pupils, entails more work than is good for them and leaves no time for other farming operations which they should be taught and in the interest of the school I consider that Mr. Shepherd's stock operations should be largely curtailed, even if it affects the income derived from this source. As the school cannot fall back upon the Methodist Missionary Society for aid, and they receive no contributions from other sources, it naturally looks to the Department to come to its relief. Mr. Shepherd asks that the present grant be doubled and if the school is to be kept up to a proper state of efficiency, a substantial increase will have to be provided. Experience has shown that it is difficult to finance a...\nupon even the largest per capita grant.\n\nIn the second place the Principal calls attention to the needs of the school in the way of buildings and repairs and asks for a grant of $2500.00 which the Minister has authorized. I may mention, however that the item of $1000.00 for material already expended is presumably for the construction of a large concrete stable for stock. This was require to furnish accommodation for his extensive operations in this direction. The other items appear to be for reasonable expenditure. In fact there are other requirements for which Mr Shepherd has not asked a grant and which I consider are absolutely necessary. The building set apart for the boys recreation room needs extensive repairs in the way of new flooring and some provision for bathing and ablutions. When I was at the school in September last I found that they had no bathing facilities except the water of the Thames in summer and wash-tubs in winter, taking their morning wash at the pump. Baths should also be placed in the laundry for the girls; the baths in the main building are not for the use of the pupils. The new building is a very handsome structure but the out-buildings are not at all in keeping with it and certainly want renovating, as a survey of the present premises presents a showy front and a shabby back.\n\nMr Shepherd was away when I visited the school, having taken his family to California and returning by way of Winnipeg to attend the Methodist Conference. He had then been away two months and during his absence and the state of the premises showed the lack of proper supervision. The teacher who was in charge, was doing all he could to get im\nthe crop with the assistance of the hired men and 24 boys who had remained at the school during vacation. There were also 23 girls at the school. Classes were not to be resumed until the 17th September, after the return of the Principal. Mr. Sheppard is an employee of the Methodist Missionary Society and the Department had no knowledge of his absence on this occasion, although it has been reported that he is frequently called away on Church Matters.\n\nIf the Department intends to make any change in the present arrangement with the Methodist Missionary Society, Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of that body, is the official to be consulted. Any additional grant that is made should be conditional upon an entire change of the present system of conducting the school. All the boys attending this institution come from reserves where farming could be successfully carried on and yet I was informed by the teacher in charge that none of them had ever handled a plow or were even allowed to drive a harrow as time could not be spared to teach them. The boys of this school are indeed hardworking not only working but are being worked, and they as well as their parents see the difference, hence the numerous complaints which reach the Department of ill-treatment of pupils. I saw the meals that were served, and while plentiful, they were not at all inviting and the pupils made of eating did not speak very well for their training in table etiquette. The supply of clothing on hand was scanty and well worn, but I was told it would be replenished after the Principal's return.\n\nEven at the risk of being considered too insistent I cannot help again expressing the opinion...\nthat the system of training pursued at this and other schools requires careful revision, as it is little less than a waste of time and money to follow the present methods as there is little use in our educating an Indians if, in our endeavor, we spoil a horn and fail to make a spoon. That our schools have failed in their object is generally admitted. I think I can point out why they have failed and make some practical suggestions as to their improvement is called upon to do so.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to the enquiry contained in your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to say that a grant to cover the cost of improvements at the Mt.

W.W. Shepherd,\nPrincipal\nMt. Alglin Institute,\nHuncoy, Ont.;-\nSir,\n\nIt is with deep regret that I announce the death of Rev. W.W. Shepherd, Principal of Elgin Institute, Muncie, who has so ably managed the affairs of that institution for so many years.\n\nHis death was caused by an accident in which he was thrown from his buggy last Monday evening; his suffering continuing until Saturday at five o'clock when he was relieved by death.\n\nThe position of Principal is therefore left vacant, a position which will be somewhat difficult to fill. The farm with all its different varied tasks comprising about one thousand acres and so many different departments cannot be successful.\nby an inexperienced person and to make it more difficult, almost a complete change in form had been taken place this spring. A principal to manage well requires some previous experience at the work and besides a thorough knowledge of farming in addition to the tact and ability to get along with employees and pupils.\n\nNow I am not an ordained preacher but since my coming into this Institution (Sept. 14, 1901) I have taken every second service with Mr. Shepherd as local preacher both in the Murray Road Church and also in the Institution and believe have given good satisfaction. I have also preached in many other churches around here, Mt. Brydges, Delaware, Middlesex, Melbourne and several others. I have taught the senior pupil of the School and since Aug. 8, 1902 have occupied the position of Assistant Principal being in full charge for a month and a half during Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd's visit to the coast in which time everything went on perfectly harmoniously among employees and pupils.\nI have made it a point to understand everything in connection with the working of the Institution. I propose to understand thoroughly Mr. Shepherd's method of farming and stock raising and I also have the advantage of having been brought up on a farm. I have been very successful in governing the pupils as anyone who has ever visited the Institution can tell. Two years ago when I attended Ottawa Normal School I obtained the highest number of honors granted that term to any student.\n\nI have sung in several different choirs and on one occasion before His Excellency General Sir John A. Macdonald. So that considering these things which I have just called your attention to, I feel like William Pitt when he said, \"I am sure I can save the country and that no one else can\". I feel that if I had the managing of this Institution I could keep it prosperous and out of debt and with the enlarged dividend, could execute a great many changes in the way of improving...\npupils better instruction along the industrial lines and in equipping ourselves with the necessary appliances. These changes referred to have for some time been contemplated by Mr. Shepherd and myself but owing to the small per capita grant it was impossible to carry them out. You will notice that this is the same hand writing as was received by you when we asked for a larger per capita grant, in fact it was I who urged him to make this request which you have thought fit to grant. I have done a great deal of the correspondence, business, and book-keeping so that I understand affairs pretty thoroughly so that in the interests of the Institution I feel that you would make no mistake in using your influence in securing for me the Principalship of this Institution. You have shown your deep interest in this Institution by increasing the per capita grant and now I am sure you are anxious to see it advance prosperously.\n\nIf it would be in order I would take it in an interview with a government Inspector.\nif it could be arranged for me then if you consider me worthy of the position I would be pleased to have you do what you can for me. The selecting of a principal, I should think, would be a matter of a good deal of importance to this government seeing that for years the institution has been entirely supported by the government (including the fees). In the meantime I would be pleased to hear from you regarding your idea of my chances.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have served in several different classes and mail quarters and on one occasion before the Governor General I understand music. I also understand musical training which I took up for some time.\n\nThe Institution at the present is prosperous and there is a great danger of its falling into the hands of someone who will prove altogether...\nunsuccessful. Up to Mr. Shepherd's time, the Institution was in rather a poor condition, but he being well up in farming principles, and possessing the tact to deal with men has been wonderfully successful. Now I heard a minister say that it would be more difficult now to select a minister from the Conference who understands farming properly than at the time when Mr. Shepherd was selected and see the many failures before Mr. Shepherd's time.\n\nI feel like William Pitt when he said \"I am sure I can save the country and that no one else can.\" I feel that I can manage this Institution as no one else can because I understand every detail thoroughly, which was not by Mr. H. D. Johnson. Putting on his last visit when he said Mr. Shepherd is getting old you should try in every way to understand Mr. Shepherd's methods so that you may have a chance to succeed him, as an inexperienced person would have a great deal of difficulty.

T.T. George, at present pastor of the Victoria Avenue Church, Chatham, and trust that this will meet with the approval of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Mr. George is a man forty years of age, has been some twenty years in the ministry, was brought up on a farm and has spent most of his subsequent life in country neighborhoods. He has good executive ability and in the judgment of the Committee is well qualified for the position in question. As it is very important that the present interregnum should be as short as possible, I will be glad to receive your reply at the earliest possible date.

Even when these are full, the water would not be sufficient to protect them. These tanks should be enlarged and made suitable and a fire tank should be placed in the cellar. The filling of these tanks should not be done by hand, as it is too uncertain. A proper plan would be to acquire from Mr. Henry and Mrs. Seneon, who has land flanking a creek about 25 rods distant from the gate of the schoolhouse, to run the creek, which has a constant flow, to be able to get sufficient head to run a ram and thus supply the building. The schoolmaster could be auxiliary to this purpose if necessary. Mr. Henry and Mrs. Seneon will be willing to run a pipe line to the school if the arrangement is made with them. I am sure, and I am sure they will agree, that it is possible to do so at a reasonable cost. I have not yet discussed the matter with Mr. Henry and Mrs. Seneon, but I am sure they will agree to it.\n\nIn order to make sure of sufficient land for the purpose of the school, he will furnish the ram, pipe, etc., and I will be obliged to assure him that he is dealt with fairly by the council in the matter of payments under the Capitation Grant which the school receives.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\nExtract\n\nOttawa 6th June 1879\n\nMr. Macdonald's report on Caradoc Bay.\n\nThe Caradoc Bay Industrial School was visited up to May 6th in connection with the question that smallpox existed in the vicinity of the reserve. Upon turning up there, I had the opportunity to see how many of the children had been vaccinated before they came to the school. It was found that many of them had not received the inoculation. The school authorities stated that they could do nothing for the children until the parents consented to have them vaccinated. The parents refused to have any of their children vaccinated. I then visited the school again and found that the children were still not vaccinated. I informed the school authorities that it was important to vaccinate the children promptly so that they would be protected against the disease. Further visits were made to the school to ensure that the children were vaccinated.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt., General,\n\nIn connection with the Rev. Dr. Sutherland's application made in a personal letter addressed to you on the 23rd July last for an increased per capita grant for the Muncey Institute, I beg to say that I have on several occasions pointed out that the contribution of $60.00 for each pupil by the Government to the Industrial Schools in Ontario is quite inadequate to meet the increased cost of living at the present day, and I think the desire of the different denominations conducting these schools to be placed on a better financial basis is only fair and reasonable, and that $100.00 per capita would not be an excessive amount to allow.\n\nWith reference to Mount Elgin School I may say that under management of the late Mr. Shepherd the school was carried on with a very small deficit: it was considerably less than $100 a year. This economical management is accounted for by the methods pursued by Mr. Shepherd who was extensively engaged in stock raising and feeding cattle for the market. To such an extent did he carry on these operations that I have no hesitation in saying that he sacrificed the interests of the school to make both ends meet. Rev. Mr. George who succeeded Mr. Shepherd about a year and a half ago has, as appears from his statement of receipts and expenditure for the year ended the 30th June accumulated a deficit of $3,498.40 since he has had charge of this school, and I think it would be well for the Department to examine carefully into his financial transactions and management with a view to discovering how this deficit occurred. My own impression is that he has lost on his cattle transactions and it would take a very skilful drover to carry on Mr. Shepherd's work in this line.\n\nWhen I was at this school two years ago I found that nearly all the energy of the school was directed to the care of\nof stock, and if Mr. George has let this run down in the interests of the school, he is hardly to blame. I think that if the grant were increased the Church would make no demand on the Department for the payment of the deficit, and if the cattle transactions were curtailed, it would be an advantage to the school as nearly all the pupils' spare time is taken up in attending to the live stock while their industrial training is neglected. In this connection I beg to refer you to my memo of the 28th November, 1902, on this file.\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr Pedley,- On the 23rd of July last I mailed a personal letter to your address referring to different matters connected with the Indian work in which the Methodist Missionary Society is interested. This letter you kindly acknowledged, saying that you would give the points mentioned your early attention; but I cannot find that such a communication has reached the Mission Rooms. It is likely that there will be a meeting of the Executive Committee of the General Board during the present month, and it would be gratifying to the members of the Executive if you would be good enough to let me have your reply before that meeting.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W.W. Shepherd, then Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, brought to the notice of the Superintendent General the impossibility of maintaining the Institute on the existing per capita basis, and strongly urged a substantial increase. Mr. Shepherd informed me that the Minister frankly acknowledged the justness of the claim, but was not prepared at that time to make the desired increase until the whole question of Indian Institutes had been more fully considered. For a number of years Mr. Shepherd was able, by extensive dealing in live stock, to earn sufficient to prevent the heavy deficiency that otherwise would have occurred; but the trade in live stock is a very fluctuating and uncertain source of income, and during the past two years very heavy deficiencies have occurred in carrying on the work. We think that these deficiencies, in so far as they represent legitimate work done by the Institute, should be met by the Indian Department, and such substantial increase made in the per capita grant for the future that the Principal may not be hampered in his work and worried by ceaseless endeavor to keep out of debt.\n\nI would respectfully request, therefore, that the Department grant such relief for existing deficiencies as may seem just and reasonable, and that the per capita grant be increased to at least One Hundred Dollars ($100) per annum.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dr. Sutherland has written the Department asking that a substantial increase be made to the per capita grant for the Mount Elgin Industrial School, which should, he says, be at least $100 per annum, and also that the Department should meet deficiencies that have occurred in that school, that is as regards the financial affairs.\n\nWith reference to the per capita grant it must be admitted that the increased cost of living a school of this class cannot be carried on with a per capita grant of $60, and such grant has been supplemented by mission funds in this case, and it is the annual expenditure above that amount that the Methodist Church wishes to be recouped.\n\nThe question of the management of the Protestant industrial and boarding schools was, I understand, discussed with the Minister this week, and I think that Dr. Sutherland's application might stand for the present, until a definite policy is arrived at as to the terms on which these schools are to be carried on in the future.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institution in company with Mr. Williams as my interpreter. On this occasion I met my adopted boy Mr. Donaldson and Mary Donaldson whom I adopted when he was one month old from his mother. When the child was given to me I told my Jane Donaldson to move the child two more months and I would allow her to stay at my place during that time. So she did according to my request.\n\nAnd afterwards she visited me frequently without going to work at some town in Michigan. And since that time the child has been under my care & support. Nothing was given to the child from her mother or anyone else until this time. The boy is now over 12 years of age, so I have always looked after this boy all this time, and have been living with him. However, I took the boy to the Mt. Elgin Institution last fall, summer to attend school there. And both having the understanding from some of the Indians at Muncey Reserve that my adopted boy was sick at school. I therefore at once went to this school in order to see him and with the intention of asking the principal to leave the school for couple days so that I could take him. After words take him back to school again. But when we arrived there I was permitted to see my adopted child. We came to come around the school. He said that he had full control of this for five years from Mrs. Mary Jane Donaldson, the boy's mother. She also said if she found any person attempting to get the boy away from school, she would take him to the chief. Therefore, I felt that Mr. Donaldson is my rightful adoptive son and wish to get him back to my house on account of the treatment I had from the principal of the said school.\n\nMrs. Elizabeth Donaldson\nMurray Ontario\nMarch 1st 1916.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI visited the Mt. Algoma Institution which is situated at Murray Barrow Reserve on the above date. In company with Mrs. Elizabeth Waddell of Wagstaff Island Ont. To inquire, and to seek the permission of Mr. George to permit, and allow us to take away the sick boy Joe. Mr. Donald whose Mrs. Elizabeth Waddell claims as her own rightful adopted child. On our arriving at the Institution we asked Mr. J.J. George the principal that the boy Joe Mr. Donald takes the school for two days with the intention of doctoring the boy, and afterwards allow him to return to the Institution. This he refused. He said he could not allow the boy to leave. He also stated that he would not permit Mrs. Elizabeth Waddell around the Institute whatever, and he went so far as to say that if any body attempts to get the boy away from the Institution he would take the law in his hands, and punish the parties. He said that he had full control of the boy for four years from Murray James Mr. Donald. The boys mother of Wagstaff Island. I want them as an interpreter of Mrs. Elizabeth Waddell.

Mr. Ferrier kindly complied with this request, and I now have the honor to enclose a copy of his Report for the information of the Department.\n\nI am sure that this may be of some service, I\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Butterland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nReport of the Rev. T. Ferrier\n\nMOUET ELGIN INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE\nApril 24-6, 1906.\n\nSTAFF.\nThe staff appear to be doing well and working harmoniously together, and it is just a question whether another likely member should not be added to the same; there being no laundress, nor seamstress and the matron has no assistant.\n\nCHILDREN.\nOne hundred and three boys and girls were in attendance to meet us; they bright, healthy-looking children. They appear to be well-fed, but their clothing is hardly up to the average.\n\nPROVISIONS.\nA very large supply of clothing - rich and provisions in one hand, our farm is fitted out to be for the proper equipment of an Institution of this kind.\n\nSTOCK.\nCattle. A herd of about two hundred and thirty-eight head of pretty fair cattle. Some twenty-four of these are ready for beef, and have been sold on hoof for five cents per pound. The outlook is that quite a number will be ready for next year's market.\n\nSome of the younger stock are not looking as well as we shall like to see them. There is considerable ringworm among the calves, notwithstanding preventatives and cures have been applied.\n\nHorses. About thirty horses, a few of which are not in the best condition, they having the appearance of not being properly grain-fed.\nHogs. From eight to twelve sows are kept for breeding purposes, and a large supply of pork is furnished.\n\nHens. About one hundred hens. These could be made more profitable if the number were increased and a more up-to-date henry provided.\n\nBees. Appear to do well, there being about eleven hundred pounds of honey on hand from last year's stock.\n\nFENCES. There is about a thousand acres of land under the control of the Institution, and such a large herd of cattle and horses with so many neighbor's interests to protect, the question of fencing is one that ought to receive due attention.\n\nTwo miles of new fencing has been done of late; some of it by fire and some by replacing the old rail fence. These rail fences are of short duration and are constantly needing repair. The length of new fence will be about that which would be made practicable by repairs, I had not tome to estimate. The Principal informed me that the wire fence costs about 40 cents per rod. This will be the most economical fence for the two hundred and twenty-five acres belonging to the Institute, also for all lands where the lease has a number of years to run, and for those lands where a new lease is a strong probability.\n\nSEWERS. During the past three years some repairs and changes have been made to the sewers. The sewer leading from the stable wing of the main building to the river has been diverted so as to empty into the river. This was a necessity since it existed without an outlet from the end of the building; it being kept with the intention of using it as a fertilizer which was found to be impracticable.\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nUntil recently there were three tile drains: 1st, One draining the surface of the land used for a garden situated close to the south-west of the main-building; 2nd, One draining the swamp three-quarters of a mile south-west; 3rd, One draining the springs from the hillside, about half a mile to the south\u2014all three uniting in a well in the yard from which the supply of water was taken for all purposes. As this supply of water from the garden and swamp was likely to be impure, unwholesome and very undesirable, the arrangement has been changed and the good spring water from the hillside is gathered in a manhole and driven from there by a hydraulic ram into the main building, thus furnishing a continual stream of pure water for all domestic purposes.\n\nThe water from the garden and swamp flows continually into the troughs situated at convenient points in the stock-yard and into drinking-panes in the stables, furnishing an abundant supply for all the stock.\n\nAn extensive system of drains from the west delivers water on the side of the hill, which is a little back by a cement dam, and from which a portion flows through a two-inch pipe to a man-hole, giving sufficient power to keep in motion a hydraulic ram that drives to the attic of the main building a constant stream of sufficient volume to supply the laundry, bath-room, closets, etc., for fire protection.\n\nIn order to complete this entire water and drainage system, I had brick (not hewn or cured) laid that about three million of bricks were used. The tile laid at the top of each pile of brick stood fast. This involved a vast amount of labor and the whole system has been carried out with considerable hydraulic skill, and is a decided success from a two-fold point of view.\n1st, These drains drain a large area of land thus making it more valuable for agricultural purposes.\n\n2nd, They furnish an abundant supply of water for all purposes, and for this there will be but little cost for many years to come.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION.\n\nThe whole Institution is practically without any fire protection, and the main building without any fire escapes.\n\nThere are two small water tanks in the attic of the main building. Another large tank should be built that will hold as great a volume as can be sustained by the floor of the attic. These three tanks should be all connected so as to allow the water to syphon from one to the other and will be kept full by this constant stream.\n\nIf four or five thousand gallons can be sustained, a 3\" stand pipe should be let into the flats below. There should be a system of pipes to carry it to two different points on each floor, and then connected, hose of sufficient length to reach any part of the flat. This would furnish some protection. The advisability of installing a chemical outfit is worthy of consideration. For the main building fire escapes should be constructed.\n\nBUILDING.\n\nThe building, some changes in the most affecting the girl's comfort and portion used for stores and bakery have been authorized by the Department, and when completed will be installed in accordance for convenience in the general work of the kitchen, library, the keeping of supplies, coal etc., and at the same time for the privacy and comfort of the girls.\n\nWhen the house-cleaning is done, with a good general whitewashing of the walls and ceilings, on all those portions\nthat are not painted or papered, it will add to the sweetness and the general appearance of the interior.\n\nThree sets of outside steps are worn out and rotting away, and must be replaced by new. The two on the east should have their position slightly changed in order to prevent shading the light of the kitchen windows.\n\nThe heating is by hot-water plant that appears to be in good condition and to give excellent results except in some rooms to the north-west in extreme weather. The radiation surface is not sufficient at these strategic points and should be increased.\n\nThe closet in the men's bath-room is without a breathing pipe; this ought to be remedied at once.\n\nA limited supply of soft water is obtained from the seven-inch tank tank whenever it reaches a depth of over five inches. This tank is served by a small well in the back, which is damaged by the freezing of the water from the cold private water. This should be remedied by strengthening the old tank or building a new one.\n\nVentilation. A small 4\" pipe in each dormitory has just been put into already overtaxed smoke-flues for the purpose of drawing air from the most important point in each, and it is in a position where the incoming vent will not come more than three feet from the inside of the building. In any case, it is all that could be accomplished by such a method and is far from being adequate, since it does not provide the air-breathing part of the volume that ought to be systematically taken from the entire building; and no provision whatever is made for supplying fresh air except by the use of open windows. In the interest of the health of the pupils and the staff this ought not to be continued.\nINSTITUTE BUILDING.\n\nThis building is occupied by the families of two employees, and is also used for two school rooms. These schoolrooms are heated by a hot-water plant which is too weak to do the work and has to be supplemented by a stove in each. They have been without ventilation until recently, when two 7\" galvanized iron pipes have been placed to draw air from the floor to the smoke-flues. This provides an exit for some of the foul air, but no provision is made for a supply of fresh air. While this has been accomplished at a small cost, and is an excellent scheme to the extent of its power and is about as strong as the flues will permit, yet, the fact remains, it is far from being sufficient, since the air, when the windows are closed, becomes stifling. If caging so many children in such, practically, unventilated buildings during the winter months does not break down the general health of the pupils and staff, it is more a matter of good fortune rather than of a good policy.\n\nLAUNDRY & BOYS' PLAY-HOUSE.\n\nA new steam boiler has been placed in the laundry and the old one discarded, and none too soon, for it was so badly rusted that it could be punched in places by a screwdriver. The boys' play-house is under repairs. These two buildings can be placed in good condition by the improvements which have been authorized and the amount already granted by the Department.\n\nNEW PIGGARY.\n\nA new piggery that will accommodate seventy-two hogs was built last year, also a NEW CATTLE STABLE sufficient for sixty-eight head.\n\nSome substantial repairs have been made to the horse stable which holds twenty-two horses.\nThe work in these new buildings and in the repairs is well executed. The buildings have excellent concrete foundations, well ventilated, and with many conveniences that will tend toward the saving of labor and the comfort of the stock.\n\n**BIG BARN.**\n\nThis building needs to be tied from eave plate to eave plate, for one of the main cross beams is badly cracked, and the plate of the north-side has broken one of the chief posts and is pressed out with the broken portion. These ties are a necessity before another crop is harvested.\n\nThe foundation beams and posts in this barn are in a bad state of decay. Two long beams from end to end were placed in last year; this postponed the much-needed and more extensive repairs, including shingles, which will have to be attended to in a year or two at the most.\n\nThere are three silos\u2014one of them is about rotten. The position they occupy prevents the utilizing of the space in the barn to the best advantage when threshing a harvest.\n\nWhen these posts and beams are placed in the foundation of the barn, the whole of the cattle stable should be rearranged and fitted up, and in doing this, one of the doors should be taken out, and if a thorough job is to be made of the barn and stable all three silos should be taken down and new ones placed at such places as will leave the entire space for granary, threshing and mowing purposes.\n\n**SMALL BARN.**\n\nThis building is in need of some repairs. One of its largest beams is broken at a very strategic point and must be strengthened by a new post or replaced by a new beam, and it will also have to be reshingled in the near future.\nSAPOR WORK-SHOP. This has a good strong frame. The foundation sill on the west side is about rotted away. The building should be raised and placed upon a concrete foundation and its many needed repairs attended to.\n\nThe undersigned was asked for an opinion on the advisability of removing this building over to the east side of the laundry. It would be more convenient on this new side, and much easier watched, since it now stands in the territory occupied by the boys for sport, and if placed by the laundry the power of the steam engine could be utilized at times to a great advantage in the work-shop. There is one serious objection to placing it there, and that is, it is of such a size and of such combustible material that, in the event of fire, it would make a strong connecting link between the barns and the two main buildings. The large number of sheds and outbuildings should have covered a much larger space than they do, and all changes of their position should tend toward expansion of the territory occupied.\n\nDRIVE HOUSE. The drive house or implement shed requires some repairs and new shingles.\n\nOTHER OUT-BUILDINGS. The lumber-shed, ice-house, wood-shed and coal-shed are all in a dilapidated and tumbling-down condition, and the only remedy is to take them down and rebuild.\n\nThe repairs authorized for the boys' play-house and laundry including a new steam boiler for the latter will be fully met by the $200 appropriated by the Department. The $800 assigned for repairs to the main building will fully cover all improvements sanctioned except fire pro-\ntection; it may also furnish material for the three sets of outside steps, soft water tank, breathing pipe for closet and material for general house-cleaning.\n\nThe necessity of fire-protection, fire escapes, increasing the radiation surface of the hot-water plant in the north-west portion of the main building, some system of ventilating dormitories and school rooms, the numerous repairs required to the barns and out-buildings, also fences are all of great importance and will have to be attended to in the near future. I would, therefore, recommend that a detailed statement of all these essential improvements with accompanying specifications of work and material required, together with a careful estimate of the cost, be presented in a business-like form to the Indian Department for their information and consideration, and I am sure that all reasonable and necessary requests will be favorably considered on their merits, providing they are assured that good material will be used, the work executed according to specifications and the money voted from time to time be expended for such improvements as have been authorized by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) T.

For many years this grant has been entirely insufficient and those in charge of the Institute have been compelled to make up the leeway by extensive dealings in live stock. This is very unsatisfactory, and involves risks which the Principal should not be required to assume. The reasonableness of an increase in the grant was freely admitted by the previous Superintendent General, and the arguments in favor of such a course are quite as strong today as they were then.\n\nI think the very lowest figure at which the per capita grant should be placed is \u00a3100 (One Hundred Dollars) per annum. With this amount, plus the proceeds of the farm, the institute could be maintained in efficiency without the risk involved by speculating in live stock.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on the 8th or 9th of November and would be very glad to see the Superintendent General or yourself respecting this matter and any other matters pertaining to our Indian Schools.\n\nHoping for a favorable issue, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

(R.O. 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 29, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRe Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nComplaints have lately been received from parents of Indian children at the Mt. Elgin Institute, reflecting on the management of that institution, and a short time ago Mr. Calvert, M.P., forwarded correspondence addressed to him by Jacob Fisher, demanding the return of his daughter from that institution on the ground of ill-health. Fisher's letter to Mr. Calvert was accompanied by a medical certificate, which stated that she was suffering from incident pulmonary tuberculosis and a general weak condition of the system and recommended her removal from the institute for proper care and medical attention.\n\nThe Principal was written to for a report regarding this case and he sent in a medical certificate from the regular attendant of the school, Dr. Norris, who said that he found her in good health and free from any active disease and taking into consideration the healthy surroundings he was of opinion that her remaining in the institution would be more beneficial than detrimental to her health. Mr. George, the Principal, in his\nreport gives it as his opinion that, owing to the girl's ability and qualification to earn good wages as a domestic, the father wishes to have her under his control and that he experiences the same difficulty in retaining girls over sixteen on this account.\n\nAnother letter was received last week from Mr. Fisher, through Mr. Calvert, renewing his application for his daughter's discharge.\n\nFrom the correspondence it would appear that something more than the alleged illness of the daughter is influencing Fisher in this case, and a telegram has just been received from Mr. George, stating that the institute kitchen was set on fire by Lottie Beaver, who says that Winnifred Fisher, the girl above referred to, told her to do so. Luckily no damage occurred and Mr. George has asked for instructions.\n\nI think that, under the circumstances, an immediate inspection of this school should be made.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa July 3, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will, at the earliest date possible, proceed to Nuneys for the purpose of inspecting the Mt. Elgin Institute there.\n\nYour inspection should deal chiefly with the management of this institution. Complaints have lately been received from the parents of Indian children attending the school reflecting on the way in which the school is conducted. It is stated that scabies (the itch) has been prevalent and for this reason some parents are not disposed to return their children to the school who have been absent on leave. The Department hesitates to have the regulations put in force until it is satisfied whether there is any truth in this statement or not.\n\nAnother complaint is that a girl, named Winnifred Fisher, has contracted tuberculosis while in the school and her father demands her discharge and has forwarded a medical certificate to the effect that she is suffering from incipient pulmonary tuberculosis; while the Principal, who was asked for a report regarding this case, has sent in a certificate from the regular medical attendant of the school.\n\nGordon J. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBrantford, Ont.\nconsider the effect that he found her in good health\nand free from any active disease and taking into consider-\nation the healthy surroundings he was of opinion that her\nremaining in the institution would be more beneficial\nthan detrimental to her health. A telegram was received\nfrom Mr. George, the Principal of the school, early\nthis week to the effect that the institute kitchen was\nset on fire by Lottie Beaver, who says that she acted\nat the instigation of the Fisher girl.\n\nThe Department would like you to satisfy\nyourself as to the conflicting statements regarding\nthis girl's health and also to make a searching enquiry\ninto the setting fire to the building. This is not\nthe first incendiary fire that has taken place at this\ninstitution and the Department would like you to try to\nfind out what has caused the pupils to take this means\nof avenging their real or imaginary wrongs. This must\nbe put a stop to or serious consequences may result. It\nwas only last November that the boys' play-house was\ndestroyed by fire and in January another fire was set\nto the new barn by pupils of the Institute, who believed\nthat they would not have to carry these if the buildings\nwere burned.\n\nIn your report you should set forth fully\nthe results of your investigations and give your own\npersonal impressions as to the management of the school.\nThere are certain needed improvements to put\nthe buildings in a thorough state of repair, and the\nDepartment would like you to state from personal examination what is absolutely required and what would be the probable cost, giving a separate estimate for each.\n\nThe Department does not consider it would do well to institute legal proceedings against the girls concerned in the last incendiary fire until it receives your report, which should be sent in as soon as possible after your inspection is made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJuly 8th., 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nFile No. 155001.\n\nI beg to advise you that I will on Monday next proceed to Muncey for the purpose of inspecting the Mt. Elgin Institute there along the lines stated in your letter of the 3rd. Inst.\n\nI am\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\nOttawa-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Office, Brantford,\nJuly 16th., 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nNo. 155001.\n\nPursuant to instructions contained in your letter of 3rd inst. to make an inspection of the Mt. Elgin Institute I left Brantford on Monday 13th inst. for Nuncy.\n\nFeeling that it was better policy to secure all the information I could before calling upon Mr. George i.e., the complaints of Indians themselves, the views of the Medical Officers and Agents. I first interviewed Dr. Lawrence of St. Thomas (where I was obliged to wait over for train connection). Dr. Lawrence formerly practiced among the Indians about Mt. Elgin Institute. He stated that scabies always existed more or less amongst these Indians. There was a predisposition to it where people were housed up in small houses and particularly in the winter time. About two years ago he sent a large quantity of ointment to Mr. George as a remedy for this disease.\n\nHe also stated that tuberculosis was very prevalent.\n\nI next interviewed Dr. McEwen of Melbourne, Medical Officer for the Chippewas and Nuncyes.\n\nThe Secretary-\nDept. of Indian Affairs-\nOttawa-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Sheppard was Principal of the Institute, scabies was very bad. Children were taken home and cured and when they went back caught it again. He frequently attended patients in the Institute then and knew of this but cannot speak of conditions under present regime, although he has frequently heard Indians complain still. Dr. McEwen says the drainage at the Institute is good and the water should be good. The situation is very healthy. There is no Doctor nearer than 7 miles.\n\nThe same evening I called upon Jacob Fisher the father of Winnifred Fisher. Fisher stated that he had no complaint whatever against the Institute other than as to its management.\n\nHis complaints are (1) Pupils are punished by being put to work during school hours when they should be at school, citing the case of Nelson Peters a Delaware from Six Nations who although at the Institute has not been in school for the past two years. (2) Pupils do not get enough to eat, and the same food is placed on the table day after day until it is eaten or becomes too stale or bad for food except when visitors are expected when the pupils get an extra good meal. (3) Pupils are made to nurse the sick and sometimes tubercular patients. Said his daughter had to nurse a child who died of tuberculosis and she afterwards contracted the disease. There is no tuberculosis in his family. (4) Parents are not notified if children get sick. (5) Has seen body lice in heads of pupils when at Church. Thinks pupils are left to wash themselves, without sufficient supervisions. \"There is no body lice in our people at their own homes\".\nHe did not know of any itch but said some pupils had skin diseases on their necks, a sort of acrofula. Knew nothing of the fire or its cause.\n\nI then called on Chief Joseph Fisher a brother of Jacob's. He said he had no children at the Institute. Some people will always complain and are never satisfied. He thinks the Institute is well managed and there is no cause for complaint. His brother's child Winnifred won a foot race after returning from her visit to Dr. Cairns (who declared she had insipient tuberculosis) therefore he thinks she could not have been very sick.\n\nDr. McEwen was with me when I made these two visits and informed me afterwards that Jacob Fisher was a chronic grumbler and that Chief Joseph Fisher was one of the most intelligent Indians on the Reserve. He also stated that Dr. Cairns was not a particularly reliable physician, was said to be a drug fiend, and had little weight in the profession.\n\nDr. McEwen is of opinion that he should be called in to attend patients from his own Reserve.\n\nNext morning (Tuesday) I saw Andrew McGahy who had a boy at the Institute last year very ill. He alleged that he or some of his family had to go to the Institute every second night to nurse his child while the Matron took a night off to rest. The child got worse and worse and nothing was done for him so that at last he determined to take him home and get his own Doctor to attend to him, but it was too late, for the child died soon after getting home. His charge is that the boy did not get proper attention.\nI also saw Murray Henry an Indian who was loud in his denunciations of the treatment of the pupils. He had none there himself but knew of several cases. None of these Indians had any complaint about the prevalence of scabies.\n\nOn Tuesday morning I met Mr. Sutherland the Agent at Muncey who drove me out to the Institute. Dr. McEwen told me that Mr. Sutherland would not hesitate to fully inform me of any cause of complaint if any existed, but evidently he is well satisfied as I could not get confirmation of any of the complaints above mentioned.\n\nDr. Morris of Delaware is his own and also Mr. George's family physician and is most attentive to his patients. He has telephone connection between his house and the Institute and can in his motor car reach them in 20 minutes if necessary.\n\nIt was about 11:45 before I informed Mr. George of the object of my visit as we were walking from the barn to the house. He asked me if I would like to see the children at dinner and when I said yes we went into the dining room. He said he knew no more than I did what they were going to have. Each child had a plate well filled with potato pie, plenty of gravy and a small piece of meat, four half-slices of bread, but no butter, and water to drink. Mr. George said they had milk as far as it would go, at every meal, if there was any, but sometimes they were short. There was abundance of the potato pie left over in the kitchen and I noticed that the children got a second supply if desired.\nI think there was sufficient food.\n\nThe first question I took up was the fire in the kitchen. Mr. George showed me statements written and signed by Lottie Beaver, Annie Comego and Lottie Nicholas respectively.\n\nLottie Beaver stated that she was asked by Winnie Fisher to light the fire in the kitchen. After supper about 7 o'clock she went into the kitchen, took some paper out of a warming closet in the range set light to it through the stove door and placed it among some shingles used for kindling wood against the wainscoting. While doing so Annie Comego was watching at an outer door and Lottie Nicholas at another door. Winnie Fisher stood at the kitchen door told Lottie Beaver to \"hurry up\" and after she had done it & asked her if it was done and Lottie said yes. Annie Comego confirmed this; the other girl was too far away to hear what was going on. I then had the girls brought in individually and cross-examined them and they all confirmed what they had written, but Mr. George said that Winnie Fisher said more to me than he could get her to admit viz., that she told Lottie Beaver to \"hurry up\" but Winnie persisted in saying that she did not ask Lottie Beaver to set the place on fire while the other girls all said they were asked to do what they did by Winnie. Lottie Beaver is a heavy stolid girl, who could probably be easily led, and influenced by fear if necessary, while Winnie is a small nervous child strong willed and aggressive, and sharp. The girls were told by Winnie to say if found out that she\n(Winnie) was in the clothes room changing her clothes. They would give no reason for the fire other than that they wanted to see it burn. I am of opinion that Winnie Fisher was the ring leader, that Lottie Beaver did the deed, but that the other girls Annie Comego and Lottie Nicholas though accessories, were not aware of what was actually going on or what was intended. Mr. George thinks the Fisher girl was put up to it by her father or some outside influence, but I do not think so, though perhaps she may have heard her father or others say \"I wish the whole place would burn down\" or something to that effect, which may have suggested the idea to her.\n\nOn the other hand I do not think there was anything in the daily surroundings or treatment of the girls to cause them to do the deed. In answer to a question Winnie told me she was happy at the school did not want to go home, got plenty to eat and did not have to work too hard. I think it was just a sudden attack of wickedness which came over the girl probably caused indirectly by complaints against Mr. George and the School which she was no doubt hearing every time she went home.\n\nThe fire in the barn last January Mr. George states was started by a boy in the belief that if the place burnt down he would get a holiday. The boy had been punished and was chaffing under discipline.\nThe fire in the boys play house in November was clearly incendiary, but happened about 3 A.M., when all the pupils were up in their rooms. Mr. George says it cannot be charged to the pupils.\n\nWith reference to the charges made by Jacob Fisher I took particular pains to question his daughter closely on these points. She said she had plenty to eat that day, was never hungry. Her food was good, and there was no bad food given to them. She was not sick and did not feel sick.\n\nAdmitted winning the foot race after returning from her examination by Dr. Cairns. Had not to work too hard. Some days she worked in the laundry and some days at something else.\n\nDid not have to nurse a sick girl, but only stayed in the room with another girl so that if the sick girl wanted anything she or the other girl could run for the matron. The sick girl, who had tuberculosis, was able to attend to her own immediate wants up till Sunday when she died. She had paper cones for her sputa which she wrapped up herself and put in the fire. Winnie was there off and on from Friday morning till Saturday night. The child died on Sunday. In view of the circumstances and the standing of the two physicians concerned I think that Dr. Morris's certificate should be received as containing the true statement of facts regarding Winnie Fisher's health.\n\nNone of the children had any sores on their faces or bodies but when questioned further she said there was one, naming her, who scratched her arms, but\nno others. I had this girl brought in, and saw a pretty healthy crop of scabies on her arms, chest and back. The matron informed me that her instructions were that no other child was to use her towels but she said it was almost impossible to prevent it. This was the only case in the school and they thought it must have been contracted at the girl's home. There were occasionally cases of it, but nothing more than might happen in any white public school.\n\nWith regard to Jacob Fisher's charge that a boy was 2 years at the Institute and not once in school Mr. George admitted this but said Nelson Peters, the boy in question was a good boy in most ways but when he was sent to school he always ran away, and after recapturing him several times Mr. George came to the conclusion that he would let him go for good the next time, as he could not afford to pay out so much Constable's fees and get no returns. He then suggested to the boy that he stay and work in the fields with a team and not go to school, and he has had no further trouble with him, but the moment school is suggested he rebels. Mr. George therefore concludes that it is better to teach the boy farming than have him run away for good.\n\nThe boy Mr. Gahey was full of disease when he came to the Institute and shortly after took to his bed and steadily declined despite the Doctor's care. Towards the end the parents persuaded him to let them come and sit with the boy, but as they smoked so much tobacco in the boy's bedroom did more harm than good, he refused them admission again. They then\ninsisted on taking the boy home, though Dr. Norris said it would be fatal. The case was fatal anyway but he had more comforts at the Institute than at the home.\n\nNaturally when he got home he died soon after and the parents blame the Institute for his death, because another Doctor said he could cure him. There is no case against Mr. George on this charge.\n\nI stayed at the Institute from Tuesday morning till Wednesday morning and had every opportunity of noting how affairs were managed.\n\nThe children appear bright, clean and happy. They have their sports after hours. All the boys take turns at different kinds of field work. One group today will be hoeing mangelas, while tomorrow they may be helping with the hay. The girls likewise change about. One girl waits on the Principal's dining table for a month, another on the officer's dining table, another helps the cook and so on giving each a turn, and varying their experience and occupations.\n\nThe discipline appears good, though not so strict and military-like as I believe is the custom at the Mohawk Institute. Mr. George strikes me as a man of great earnestness and enthusiastic in his work, and is doing his work faithfully and well.\nThe close proximity of the Reserve is the cause or most of the trouble I think. A boy after four when his duties are over, will skip away home across the fields perhaps two miles away and get back by six. They meet their parents at Church every Sunday, their friends and relations sometimes surreptitiously join them in their walks and if there is discontent it is kept alive by this means of communication. A boy quite clean has returned after one of these short visits infected with body lice. While I was there parents came asking permission to see their children. They join them in the play ground and in fact are hanging around the neighbourhood more or less all the time.\n\nThe sanitary condition is good. The kitchens, bakeshop, lavatories &c are clean and tidy. The barns yards and stables are clean and tidy and Mr. George appears to spare neither himself nor his officers in the discharge of his duties.\n\nThe only recommendation I have to make in regard to the management is that no pupil should be asked, in fact it should be forbidden, to attend any patient, suffering from tuberculosis, or even to enter the room where such a patient is, and I also think that greater precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of scabies by contact with towels clothes &c than is now done.\n\nAs to the fire I think some punishment should be inflicted upon Winnifred Fisher and Lottie Beaver though it may be difficult to satisfy a magistrate that the Fisher girl is guilty. The other girls are\npractically innocent of wrong doing. Lottie Beaver has been confined to a separate room ever since the fire and the matter should be attended to without delay.\n\nI will report on the matter if needed in improvements under separate cover.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSept-\nOttawa Aug 6, 1908.\n\nMemorandum for\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIn view of certain complaints received from parents of Indian children attending the Mt. Elgin Institute reflecting on the management of that school, Mr. Superintendent Smith of Brantford was sent there to make an inspection and report.\n\nMr. Smith's report which deals very fully with all the matters complained of goes to show that the school is in his opinion well managed. He makes one or two recommendations which it might be well to have carried out. The principal reason for sending Mr. Smith to the school was in connection with an outbreak of fire which was said to be the work of an incendiary. Mr. Smith obtained ample proof that the fire was set by one of the girl pupils at the instance of another girl named Winnie Fisher who is a daughter of Jacob Fisher, one of the strongest opponents of the school. Mr. Smith goes fully into the case and recommends that some punishment should be inflicted upon these two girls, although he says it would be difficult to satisfy a magistrate that the Fisher girl is guilty. She made a catapaw of Lottie Beaver who actually fired the building and if she could escape punishment there would be very little use in proceeding against the Beaver girl who is only a tool in her hands. In fact I do not think it would be a wise policy of the Department to bring...\neither girl before a magistrate; if conviction was secured they would most likely be sent to prison, which would do them more harm than good. In my opinion their punishment should be left to the Principal. The whole trouble appears to be that Jacob Fisher was anxious to get his daughter away from the school and he is more to blame than either of the girls. Fortunately the fire did little or no damage.\n\nAnother complaint refers to the prevalence of scabies in the school and Mr. Smith found only one case and it was thought that this must have been contracted at the home of the girl who was affected. There have been occasional cases, but nothing more than might happen in any white public school. On the whole Mr. Smith's report is favourable to the institution and he thinks that the proximity of the school to the reserve is the cause of most of the trouble.\n\nHe concludes by recommending that pupils should be forbidden to attend any patient suffering from tuberculosis and it would be well to instruct the Principal to this effect and that greater precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of scabies.\n\nIt would be well if the minds of the Indians could be disabused as to the treatment of pupils at this school. The Gibson Indians, who are all Methodists and have had several children in attendance, are especially bitter against the Principal and I would suggest that Mr. Supt. Macdonald should be instructed to inform these Indians when he next visits the reserve of the result of Mr. Smith's inspection, and that Agents Sutherland\nand McDonald be given similar instructions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, December 13th, 1908.\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nI see no action has been taken on memorandum of August 6th, herewith, approved by me. Will you please let me know what is the reason of this.\n\nD. S. J. I. A.\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nDictated - T.F., Toronto, April 28th, 1909.\n\nMy dear Mr. Pedley,\n\nOn my arrival here from Ottawa word is to hand from the Rev. S.R. McGivney stating that he will accept the principalship of the Mount Elgin Institute. This is in harmony with the nomination and appointment of the Executive of our General Board. I trust that it will meet with the hearty approval of the Department. You might write Dr. Sutherland sanctioning this appointment if it is satisfactory.\n\nAs I was informing you yesterday of the financial condition of this Institute, and from the experience of the last five years it appears to be an impossibility to manage it upon $60 (Sixty Dollars) per pupil. Now that the new Principal will be taking charge, the Church will meet all liabilities that are standing against the Institution and I trust that it will be possible for the Department to raise the grant to $100 (One Hundred Dollars) per pupil to take effect this fiscal year. No better time than now to make the change so that the new Principal may have a fair opportunity of managing the Institute in such a way that it will be a credit to the Church and to the Government. You might also, when writing Dr. Sutherland, re your approval of the appointment, give him the decision of the Department re the proposed increase of the per capita grant.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 6th., 1909.\n\nDear Dr. Sutherland,\n\nThe Rev. T. Perrier has informed the Department that the Rev. C. R. McNally has accepted the position of Principal of Mt. Elgin Institute. While the Department has no information as to the Reverend gentleman's qualifications, these are no doubt satisfactory, and his appointment is therefore confirmed in. It is to be hoped that so far as possible he will make a success of the work.\n\nMr. Perrier has brought to the notice of the Department the desirability of increasing the per capita grant at Mt. Elgin to $100 per pupil. As you may be aware, the Parliamentary appropriation for the purposes of Indian education in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec are voted separately from funds for like purposes in Western Canada and in British Columbia. The appropriation is therefore limited, and as it is closely estimated, there is hardly a possibility of making any wide deviation from the Estimates.\n\nUnder these circumstances the Department finds it quite impossible\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nSecretary, Methodist Missionary Society,\nTORONTO.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nto increase the grant during the current fiscal year, but a note will be made of the matter and when the Estimates for next year are being prepared the needs of this Institution, and others of like character in the Province of Ontario, will be brought to the attention of the Superintendent General, and an effort will be made to increase the rate of per capita grant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 4, 1969.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nWhen Rev. Mr. Perrier was here a few days ago he brought to my attention the following matters:\n\nONTARIO: Muncey Reserve.\n\nHe states the Church has paid the deficit and does not ask the Department to pay this. He would like $100.00 per pupil.\nMy dear Mr. Pedley,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 6th instant respecting the Mount Elgin Institute. I assume that Mr. Ferrier would give you all available information in regard to the new principal, Rev. S. R. McVitty. As you will readily understand the qualifications of a principal for such an institution are not easily tabulated, but after gathering information about Mr. McVitty from various quarters, and after a personal interview by Mr. Ferrier, we came to the conclusion that among a number of persons known to be available, Mr. McVitty seemed to be the most promising. He desires to become familiar with the wishes of the Department and will do his utmost to carry them out in a satisfactory way.\n\nI greatly regret that the Department cannot deal this year with the question of an increased per capita for the Mount Elgin Institute. If not dealt with at the next session of parliament, any increase will not be available till after the end of March, 1910, and in the meantime we have to face a very serious annual deficit of some $4000 (Four Thousand Dollars). However I suppose we must make the best of it and await a more satisfactory arrangement.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nREPORT OF THE MONT NIGIN INSTITUTE.\n\nAugust 7th, 1909.\n\nI spent from July 29th to August 7th at the School. The time was occupied in stock-taking and assisting Mr. McVitty in his initiation to the many duties devolving upon him as Principal of the Institute.\n\nMr. Shannon has made a careful audit of the books and accounts up to June 30th. This audit shows that the income for the past year was $13,659.42 made up as follows:\n\nMissionary Society. ................. $10,000\nGovernment Grant for Mission. ....... 1,758\nSale of cattle, horses, etc. .......... 1,701.42\n\nThe audit also shows a deficit of $4,618.90. If to this is added a normal loan of $1,000 from the Missionary Society and the increase of $4,000 from the Board over and above the Government grant, we have a total deficit of $13,618.90 all of which has been paid by the Missionary Society. From this it will be seen that the grants of $10,000 which were made by the Board for last year will have to be the minimum annual grant for main chance for the future.\n\nIt is therefore clear that the time has come when the Government grant must be increased from $100 to $170 per pupil.\n\nThe taking of stock took up the greater portion of the time at my disposal, and a complete inventory of all chattels to other with the value of the same is herewith given. From this it will be seen that the total value of the stock is $12,000.00 which is $6,000.00 less than that given by Mr. George. This difference is accounted for by the following:\n\n1. I have not included any part of the plant in my statement.\n2. The former valuation is, in my judgment, very much beyond its real value.\n3. A number of the farm and garden implements are absolutely worthless and have been so entered.\n\nThese articles I have had moved out of the buildings, sheds and yard to a private lot on the farm, their room being of more value than they are to the school. Mr. McVitty may be able to dispose of some of them for a pittance to the Indians, but he must have only value as scrap iron, and he ought to receive instructions as to what he should do with them and have them removed for they have disgraced the premises long enough.\nReport of the Mowat Plain Institute, August 7th, 1910.\n\nThe live stock has been severely culled and all that were suitable disposed of. The books show that since June 14th, $4,126 for horned cattle and $1,375 for horses have been received.\n\nAbout one-half of the milch cows are not of much use for milking purposes and are too light and poor for beef; only four of them were known to be with calf on July 1st. There were 35 cows milking at the beginning of July, and no cream was got for the month of June was 17.6%, and for the previous month 16%. The low returns are partly due to a lack of supervision of the milking. A new man has been put in charge of the stock and the revenue from this source will be increased.\n\n250 pounds of wheat were sold in June with only about two weeks' flour on hand.\n\nPotatoes have also to be purchased for 1 ton to use, and with only four acres in crop means that the most of the year's supply and seed will have to be provided.\n\nThe selling of so much of the live stock when pasture was abundant is a serious handicap on the chances of profit from the herd for the next year or two.\n\nI have looked up some of the leases containing certain lands used by the Institute. Some of these are numbered, and the following may be information:\n\nLEASE NO. 236. - Is for 47 acres and runs for 14 years at a rental of $8 per annum. This land lies east of the Institute and controls the water supply.\n\nLEASE NO. 235. - Is for 27 acres and runs for 16 years at a rental of $15 per annum.

All the land in the valley belonging to the Institute would be of no value without it because of the problem of fencing which has to be done on both sides of the river above the flood line.\n\n3. The removal lease is already signed by some of the parties concerned, and $500 paid on the contract.\n\nThis 170 acres is made up of lands owned by about nine different parties on the Ondina Reserve and is shown on the enclosed map.

I would therefore recommend that a loan of $100 be advanced to the Principal to purchase about 30 stock cattle and some good cows.\n\nThe Main Building, the two large barns, stables and hog-pen are in a good state of repair, but all the other out-buildings and sheds are in a neglected condition and will soon need to be rebuilt.\n\nThe bath tubs in the laundry are of wood and not plumbed with the rain.

Ferrier\nMy dear Mr. Pedley,\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of my Report of the Mount Elgin Institute. When in Ottawa I left a stock-sheet of all the chattels with the Department. You will see that the Missionary Society have had to pay $13,618 (Thirteen Thousand Six Hundred and Eighteen Dollars). The position I have taken with our Board is that when we agree to run any Institution, on a per capita basis, with the Government, that all deficits should be paid by the Church. Up to date this has been done, but I feel that the time has come when the grant for Muncy must be changed from $60 to $100 (Sixty Dollars to One Hundred Dollars) per pupil. I believe it to be next to impossible to run it satisfactorily on a smaller sum of money. It is true that for a number of years it was run without much additional cost during Mr. Sheppard's time, but then it must be remembered that in those days the stock market was much better and a more reliable asset to the Institution than it is today, and further the wages that were paid in those times are no longer adequate to get suitable members on the staff; also the class of goods that were used for clothing would not be acceptable to the Indians, and the same thing may be said regarding the food that used to be provided; these together with the fact that the purchasing power of money is not as great as it was ten or fifteen years ago make the advance a necessity.\n\nI believe that this Institution can do a good work in the education of Indian boys and girls for many yea...\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nToronto.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.\n\nto come, and I would not entertain any thought of closing it.\n\nThe object of this letter is to bring before you the necessity of a change of the financial basis. The General Board of Missions is to meet in Ottawa on the 7th of October. I would very much like to be able to say to this Board, when in your City, that the Department were going to give us the increased grant asked for, for the future.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with your approval, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nF. Ferrie\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnclosure.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe question of increasing the per capita grant paid the Mt. Elgin Institute is again brought to the attention of the Department in Mr. Ferrier's letter of the 10th instant. It is clear that these institutions in Ontario cannot be conducted upon a grant of $60. per capita and that such assistance must be largely supplemented by those who are interested in the educational work amongst the Indians. The representations of Mr. Ferrier in the interests of the Mt. Elgin School cannot be considered by themselves. Better treatment if accorded to this institution must also be extended to the others. The Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste. Marie has been compelled, owing to lack of funds and our failure to meet their request for an increased per capita grant, has been compelled to curtail its operations, to cut down its staff &c; and upon the present scale it hardly amounts to anything but a small boarding school. The R. C. School at Wikwemikong, with the largest number in attendance of any school in Ontario, is not in such financial straits as the others, but would certainly expect the increased grant if it were to be given anywhere. The Mohawk Institute at Brantford is hardly in the same position as it is partly supported by the New England\nCompany. In some late recommendations which I made I suggested that the per capita grant might be increased in Ontario to $85.00. Upon this basis it would be necessary for us to find funds for the following pupils:\n\nMt. Elgin, 100 $2500.00\nShingwauk Home, 50 $1250.00\nWikwemikong, 125 $1562.50\nChapleau, 40 $1000.00\nFt. William Orphanage, 25 $625.00\n\n$6850.00\n\nIf the per capita grant were to be increased to $100, the increase would be as follows:\n\nMt. Elgin, 100 $4000.00\nShingwauk Home, 50 $2000.00\nWikwemikong, 125 $3125.00\nChapleau, 40 $1600.00\nFt. Wm. Orphanage, 25 $1000.00\n\n$15,855.00\n\nI observe from Mr. Ferrier's communication that the question so far as the Methodist Church is concerned has reached a crisis and the Department should I think take the matter into serious consideration. I feel disposed to recommend, as before, an increase to $85 per capita. The question should be decided at an early date as the Estimates for the fiscal year 1910-11 are practically completed.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, August 23rd., 1930.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 10th dealing with the per capita grant paid for pupils in attendance at the Sir Elgin Institute, I have to inform you that your request has been considered, and it has not been found possible to provide funds for the proposed increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal Indian Boarding School,\nBRANDON, Man.\nAt a conference between Rev. Dr. Rutherford, Rev. Mr. Ferrier and the Dept. of Indian Education it was urged that the per capita grant at Mount Elgin Institute should be increased from $80 to $100.\n\nDuring the last four years the Methodist Missionary Society has provided $39,000 for the maintenance of this school and $10,000 has been voted for the current year, part of which is intended to pay off a deficit. The delegates urged in the strongest possible terms that some financial relief should be given them to conduct this institution. The Principal at present in charge of the school seems to be especially adapted for the work and under his management it is thought that the Mount Elgin Institute has great scope for usefulness.\n\nIt is desired that this matter be specially brought before the Minister and the Deputy Minister.\n\nOttawa, 18th October, 1909.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Public School Inspector on the Mount Elgin Institute, and he draws attention to the unsatisfactory work being performed by Miss Wismer, the junior teacher, and states that it will be necessary to make a change as soon as possible.\n\nI have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to take the necessary steps to obtain a properly qualified teacher to take up this work. The senior teacher, Mr. Dowdell, is doing splendid work at this school and it is evident that a capable teacher should be in charge of the junior room from which his pupils are drafted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, Dec. 8th, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have pleasure in stating that it has been decided to increase the per capita grant to the Mt. Elgin Institute from $60.00 to $80.00 on the 1st of April next. It is hoped that with this increased financial assistance and under the present management the School may continue to be successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D. D.,\nDeputy Methodist Missionary Society,\nTORONTO.\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, #155001-1, intimating that the per capita grant for the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute will be increased from $60 to $80 on the first of April next, and express our appreciation of this action of the Department. It is, I know, the judgment of the Rev. T. Ferrier, who is very familiar with the facts, that $10,000 (Ten Thousand Dollars) per annum\u2014which means a per capita of $100 (One Hundred Dollars)\u2014is the minimum required to carry on the Institution effectively, but we will do our best with the increase that the Department has sanctioned, and I feel sure that if anyone can carry through the work without a deficit, the present Principal will do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Toronto, December 9, 1909.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 2nd, calling attention to the unsatisfactory work being performed by Miss Wismer the junior teacher at the Mount Elgin Institute. I will communicate immediately with the Principal of the Institute and urge prompt measures to obtain a more satisfactory supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe Institute,\nMuncy, Dec. 11th, 1909.\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\n\nDear Bro.:\n\nYour favor of the 9th instant to hand this morning.\n\nIn reply would say the criticism of Mr. Inspector Johnston is just. Miss Wismer is not at all a success as a teacher, and I have tried my best to find someone more efficient. I told Mr. Johnston that if he could find us a good teacher we would pay any reasonable salary. He said I have no idea when one could be found just now. I have written several teachers whom I know to be efficient offering them salary equal to anything they are securing at present and other inducements beside but so far have failed. I have an add in paper at present time. In face of this difficulty I engaged a lady to take one half the children in the Junior Room that is the children of first class so that Miss Wismer has about 26 pupils at present instead of about 50. (I might say that 50 Indian children will tax any teacher to the utmost.) I do not propose to continue this arrangement any great length of time. I engaged this lady last Dec. for one month, I hope by beginning of the year to find someone quite efficient.\n\nI am pleased that Mr. Johnston spoke so favorably of Mr. Dowell. He is a splendid teacher and a Christian gentleman. I might add that each Officer in the Institute is a member of some Christian Church and I believe all are seeking by precept and example to help the pupils to the best things.\n\n(Sig.) B.R. McVitty.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 9th instant I wrote to the Rev. S. R. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, informing him of the criticism of Mr. Inspector Johnston respecting the work of Miss Wimer, teacher of the Junior Department of the Munsey School.

S. R. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, informing him of the action of the Department increasing the per capita grant from $60 to $80. I think it advisable to send you a copy of Mr. McVitty's reply, in which, after acknowledging the action of the Department in making the increase, he submits certain facts connected with the Institution and makes sundry suggestions, some of which \u2014 perhaps all of which \u2014 may be worthy of your consideration. You will notice at once that Mr. McVitty's spirit is of the best, and that he is getting a grasp of the whole situation which I think promises well for the future.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Smithwick,\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nThe Institute,\nKaneey, Dec. 10, 1909.\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\n\nDear Bro-\n\nYour favor of the 7th inst. to hand I am gratified that\nthe Department is moving in the right direction. I am sorry they\ndid not see their way clear to go a little further and make the\ngrant $160 per cap. as Mr. Faivier recommends. After nearly six\nmonth's close study of conditions here I am fully satisfied it\nwill take at least that amount to run the school successfully.\nThe school has been seriously handicapped in the past and its\nusefulness much lessened by lack of funds.\n\nPermit me to submit to you the following facts:\n\n1. We own but 280 acres of land all the rest is rented. We\nare practically on a rented farm. I am applying this week\nfor renewal of a lease - which means payment in advance of $1470.00.\nYet this is land we cannot do without. It lies right across the\nriver from the Institution. It is our cow pasture.\n\n2. It has become almost impossible to get efficient officers and\nteachers without paying very large salaries. Our head teacher is\nreceiving $600, free house heated and milk for use of his family.\nHis hours are from about 7 to 9 seven days of the week. I know he\nis offered a position in a white school at same salary - hours from\n9 to 4 p.m.\n\nThe position of Cook in our upper kitchen is vacant. I have\nreplied to fifteen persons advertising for position of cook etc., not one of them would accept the position even at a good salary. It is too confining and trying. Mr. McVitty has been forced to take it for past month or more.\n\n3. The price of food has increased enormously and the pupils and their parents are much more exacting than formerly. A five cent meal for a pupil would mean $4.75 per year, leaving $5.25 for clothing, sickness, education and all other necessary expense. To meet this condition pupils have been kept in the school longer than necessary simply for the work they could do and very many of them left it in the end far from being the friend either of the Government or the Missionary Society. It is my conviction that the aim of the school should be to fit boys and girls for farm and domestic work (not by any means for office work or even teachers unless in very few cases,) and just as soon as they are will fitted to earn their own living let them go out to good homes and do so. The last couple of years they are kept here after they and their parents think they should go tends to develop all that is sullen and revengeful in the Indian nature besides larger boys and girls in this mood have a most beneful effect upon younger pupils. As a rule pupils should enter the school at ten to twelve years and leave it about sixteen and they should be and would be pupils from the best families and would go out as a real asset to the church and the nation. The pupils would feel that they were kept here until they could help themselves and no longer and in most cases they and their parents would be our friends, and they would early take their place in the nations life and be a real help to those who so much need farm and domestic helps.\nWe are enjoying the work here and doing our very best to make the work a success. We are very grateful for the deep interest taken in us by your Department and the Department at Ottawa, and respectfully submit to you the above facts not in any spirit of complaint, but in an earnest endeavor that every thing possible be done to make the school a great blessing to the Indian people and their families.\n\n(Signed) S.

Shore, M.A., B.D.,\nSecretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nREPORT OF THE MOUNT ELGIN INSTITUTE\nYEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 1911.\n\nThe main building is kept neat and clean. Considerable furnishings have been put in and some improvements made, the most important being new range for the kitchens, some good furniture and the installation of an electric light plant, which furnishes light for the main buildings, cottages, laundry, stables and barns. The light plant was put in by the Government at a cost of about $2,400, also $500 for the material in a new hen house.\n\nCLASS ROOMS.\n\nThe half day system is carried out for most of the older scholars, while many of the younger attend the class rooms all day.\n\nThe teachers are doing good work and up-to-date methods are in vogue, especially in the senior rooms, where a class of nine are in preparation for the Entrance examinations in July.\n\nLIVE STOCK.\n\nThere are at present 196 head of cattle, 31 horses, and 74 pigs, all looking well for this season of the year. 70 cattle, 10 horses and 40 pigs, and a total increase of about $6,000 in the value of the live stock have been added since July, 1909.\n\nCHILDREN AND STAFF.\n\nThe health of all has been very good, the doctor's bill and drug account being only $35 for the past year and nine months.\n\nThe conduct of the pupils has been worthy of praise, and they have greatly assisted the Principal and his staff to create a homelike atmosphere about the entire Institution. There are 102 children in attendance.\n\nThe staff and salary paid is as follows:\n\n| Position          | Name                  | Salary |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Principal         | Rev.

All accounts have been settled monthly on a cash basis, goods have been purchased at a fair market value, and the cattle and products of the farm sold at a fair market price. The management of the milk cows is worthy of mention. The Institute has been kept in neat order. The milk and the cream sales averaged over $200 a month. The profits from the sale of the live stock have been good. The Principal has returned to the Mission Rooms the $200 voted him by the Board for cattle in 1909; all accounts are paid up to date, and there is a balance of $139.50 in the bank.\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT.\n\nYEAR ENDING MARCH 1911.\n\n| Cash on hand, April 1, 1910, | Receipts. |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|\n| Missionary Society,         | $1,450.21 |\n| Sale of Cattle,             | 10,003.00 |\n| = horses,                    | 5,222.85  |\n| = hogs,                     | 2,117.50  |\n| = cream,                    | 1,474.55  |\n| = from Farm and Garden,     | 2,256.06  |\n| = of sundries,              | 1,311.36  |\n| Annuities,                  | 560.47    |\n| Rent from Indians,          | 128.65    |\n\n| Disbursements. |\n|----------------|\n| Salaries,      | $4,008.08 |\n| Clothes,       | 1,159.55  |\n| Food,          | 1,507.66  |\n| Fuel and Light,| 755.24    |\n| Building and Repairs, | 160.71 |\n| House Equipment, | 1,751.96 |\n| Farm & Garden stock, | 13,881.39 |\n| Transport, freight, etc., | 128.26 |\n| Extra labor,   | 286.00    |\n| Miscellaneous, | 507.90    |\n| Balance in Bank, March 1911, | 132.50 |\n\n$25,151.65 $25,151.65\n\nTHE FUTURE MANAGEMENT OF THIS INSTITUTE.\n\nI paid a visit to Ottawa and discussed the basis of a new agreement with the Deputy Minister and the Superintendent of the Education Department. Two propositions were under consideration:\n\n1. The Church to make certain needed repairs to bring the school into Class \"A\". This would involve an outlay of about $5,000; also to keep the plant in repair from year to year. This would involve about $1,000 a year, and the Government would give a grant of $100 per pupil for 100 pupils.\n\n2. The Government to make all needed repairs and in so doing provide accommodation for 125 pupils, and keep the entire plant in repair; also pay the rents, which have averaged $900 per year for the last seven years, and give the management $50 per pupil up to the number of 125.\nIt was arranged by the Department that Mr. Scott should meet me at Muncey and decide on the proposition we would accept.\n\nThe second proposal was accepted and the contract will be made out by the Department. This, with good management will place the Institution on a self-sustaining basis.\n\nThe following are the needed repairs to place the school in Class \"A\":\n\n1. Fire Escapes, - Pole.\n2. The closets in the four dormitories to be set in cement and enclosures made.\n3. A Boys Building - to provide class rooms, boys' recreation room - boys' wash rooms, bath-tubs and shower baths, and lavatory.\n4. More bathing and washing accommodation for the girls.\n5. Steam plant to supply heat for all the buildings and necessary power.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nI have taken the liberty of submitting an additional statement - this aspect of the business.\nMt.

This land was rented by me from him March last, for cattle pasture and pay the rent when cattle were ready to go to pasture (about May 15) in April. John sought to borrow some money which should be held in trust for his grandson, a pupil here. I refused to lend it as John wouldn't settle his pasture bill another month longer. He is getting worse with me. It is not possible here and other pasture or lot for the season as of Oct. 3rd 1917, so he must remain where he is at 60\u00a2 if it reaches me until claim date date.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R.

D. Johnson, I.P.S., for West Middlesex, considers, after a long experience that an Indian teacher can produce the best results in an Indian school,\n\nAND WHEREAS the principal of Mt. Elgin Institute, Rev. S. H. McVitty, has agreed to a proposition herein-after outlined,\n\nWe, the members of this conference, wish to submit to the Department of Indian Affairs the following scheme for the relief of the situation:\n\n1. That Mt. Elgin Industrial Institution undertake to train a class of Indian students annually for reserve public school teaching, in addition to present work.\n2. That the government give the management of the institution an annual grant of $200 per capita for each pupil thus instructed, the institution to be responsible for the education, board and clothing of all such pupils.\n\n3. That the limit of the regular course in the main school be Provincial High School Entrance, and that this examination be admission to the special Model Class.\n\n4. That any Indian pupil in Canada having successfully passed the aforementioned examination be eligible for admission to the class.\n\n5. That the Government pay for transportation of all pupils from a distance.\n\n6. That all pupils entering this class must possess a certificate of good moral character signed by a clergyman, missionary, teacher, or other respectable person.\n\n7. That the term for such course be from Aug. 1st till June 30, pupils to be engaged in class work from 9 A.M. - 4 P.M.\n\n8. That a carefully defined curriculum on Model School work be prepared for this school on the following subjects:\n\n   1. Literature and History\n   2. Mathematics\n   3. Writing\n   4. Methods in teaching the subjects of the pupil's normal course.\n   5. Practical work in the arts.\n   6. Social studies.\n   7. Psychology with special reference to Indians and Indian school work.\n   8. Music. The Mt. Elgin Institute will add to its staff a thoroughly competent musical instructor.\n9. Callisthenics,\n10. Blackboard work.\n\n9. That a final examination, written and practical,\nbe conducted by the teacher in charge and by the local\ngovernment inspector of public schools, who shall\nhave supervision of the work done during the term.\n\n10. That successful candidates be awarded certifi-\ncates signed by the local government public school\ninspector and by the principal of the institution, which\nwill be accepted as sufficient legal qualification\nfor teaching in the Day school on a reserve.\n\n11. That the government make provision in the\ncontemplated building about to be erected, for three\nschool rooms, and such other equipment as may be nee-\ndary for the proposed work.\n\nJ. Perrier\nOttawa, June 20, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a memorandum signed by the Rev. T. Perrier outlining a scheme for normal training at the Mount Misin Institute to be given Indians who desire to fit themselves for teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after careful consideration, it is not thought advisable to favourably entertain the proposal. The experience of the Department with Indian teachers has not been very happy and does not tend to show that the educational extension proposed would be profitable. The spirit in which the document is composed is noted with gratification, as it shows an earnest desire to improve Indian educational conditions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

McVitty\n\nOf the many splendid enterprises, missionary and educational, connected with the work of the Church in Canada, none is more interesting than that of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, situated on the north bank of the river Thames, in the township of Caradoc, county of Oxford, about thirty-five miles west of the city of St. Thomas. The school was founded by the late Bishop John Henry McGregor, who was the first Bishop of the Methodist Church in Canada.\n\nAt the conference of 1854, held at Brockville, Ontario, the Rev. Peter Jones, a veteran missionary and pioneer, was appointed to raise funds for the erection of suitable buildings. He succeeded over to Great Britain, and spent several years preaching and laboring in the mission field. Upon his return, he found that the funds had been raised, and the school opened its doors in 1860. The school has since grown in size and influence, and now has a large number of pupils attending.\n\nAt the conference of 1859 the Rev. James G. B. George was appointed principal. After serving for some time, he was succeeded by Rev. James G. B. George, who continued until 1873.\n\nThe school has always been under the supervision of the Board of Education, and has been visited by many prominent persons. It is now under the administration of Mr. W. W. Sherrard, who has been very successful in his work.\n\nWe are constantly adding to the supply of our school and to the number of subjects being taught.

The boys are taught farming, mechanics, carpentry, care and management of live stock, gardening, carpentry, blacksmithing, cement work, fencing, the making and repairing of all kinds of farm machinery, including steam and gasoline engines. As the pupils advance and show an aptitude for certain lines of work, they are encouraged to specialize, and the last year or so of industrial training is usually spent on their chosen subject.\n\nOur buildings are thoroughly modern, and very suitable for the work being done. We have recently installed an electric hot water plant, consisting of an oil tank, boiler, and pump, with 100 16-candle-power lights, a fireless hot-water heating system, and an upright piano. In addition to these conveniences, we added two large wings to the main building, besides some minor improvements. All the time we have received most courteous and generous assistance from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, who supply us the funds and pay the wages entirely out of their own. We are pleased to say it has been carried through to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nIn addition to the per capita grant given us by the government, it takes an additional per year to run our school.

A Reply to Professor James Thorburn, D.D., LL.D., (Edinburgh University) by Rev. William Briggs. $1.50 net.\n\nProfessor Thorburn's reply to the reviewer of these lines would say that it was not worth while to write a whole book volume to disprove the historical existence of such men as Robertson, Drews and Smith, who did in fact exist, but only an localization of imperfectly known facts. Certainly the arguments in favor of such a theory are not very convincing, but they are being made apparently with all sincerity and in the spirit of deeper historical study, and they demand refutation. The refutation is by Mr. Thorburn given in most accurate and painstaking fashion, proving both the inadequacy of his theories and the correctness of his reasoning and methods by which it is carried out. It is not a cheap or illiberal but merciless reasoning, and the theory which he attacks is not merely anti-Christian, but a sorry lug to stand upon in the face of the evidence. Mr. Thorburn makes it abundantly clear that the Christian defense can only be maintained on the basis of historic Christianity. To some extent at least we must admit that he has succeeded in getting at the real historic figure of Jesus.\n\nSOCIAL RELIGION\u2014AN INTERPRETATION OF CHRISTIANITY IN TERMS OF MODERN LIFE.

The sketch of the life given in brief is interesting, but it seems more made up chiefly from the writings of others than from his own. He read widely in literature, and his comments are often keen, fresh and stimulating. Mr. Brash was a man of wide interests and his work, though contrary to what some might think, was not narrowly or singularly free from anything like narrowness. He visited Canada with a Kewick delegate and experienced a very entertaining time. His letters are full of spiritual stimulus.\n\nTHE GREAT OUTDOORS is the title of a very excellent tract by the Rev.

This tract is a thoughtful and practical exposition of the subject given in a very convincing manner, and will do good to all our people. We hope the pastors, the members of the churches, and all who will read it and urge the people to do the same, will find that the lesson as here taught, a mighty work would be accomplished in advancing the cause of God.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\nHonorable Sir,\n\nAttorney General,\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to call your attention to the matter as to the improper care given to my children attending school at Fort Elgin Institute. John and children came home in March to attend their father's funeral. They were poorly clad in everything. The underclothes they wore were thin. Their hands were neglected quite of dirt and nits. I washed their heads before returning. Now, they are home for a month's vacation. They come home from some conditions as mentioned above. I am told matters close not furnish any line clothes to the children to keep clean. I am told parents have to buy new clothes for children. In this connection, I am told Board is kept out for each pupil out of Indian funds $156.00 from the Government for a pupil.\nallowance for bread. If it were parents must aid to clothe their children while attending school at any Indian Institution in Canada. My eldest daughter Pearl Thomas age 16 yrs. shoes was not fit to come home with, she asked for a pair new shoes motion refuse her as her old ones were full of holes she was told by motion to put a paper inside to hide her feet. Pearl is in poor health. Is not fit for hard labor only light work. Instruction is the cause of her sickness. It appears the motion fails to see it this & does not furnish the girls what is required for such at short cut. My children says the motion has said time & again Thomas children were the poorest ones didn't do enough work to pay for their board. If that is the case why can my children remain at home. They also complain not getting sufficient of food & meat & not fit to\nnot being used. This school should be looked into or have some one to inspect every thing done on the table. When my children come home in March 14, 1914 they had the uniforms on they had while attending school at Mt. Pleasant which are now by this time are not fit for Sunday nor best.

I seek to make myself, as far as possible, conversant with every detail of the School life, and have not the least hesitation in saying I believe each and every officer in the School is doing everything for the pupils that could reasonably be expected from them.\n\nHaving spent 18 years in the pastorate in different parts of Ontario, and knowing the home life of the people quite intimately, I most solemnly believe that the pupils of this School are furnished better food, better clothing, better sleeping accommodation, and do less work than the average white child in the province of Ontario.\n\nSince taking charge of the School I have never knowingly done, or permitted to be done to any child in the School what I would not be willing to have done to a child of mine under similar circumstances.\n\nIndian Affairs.

McVitty, Principal\n\nMuneg, Ont., 191\n\nI have never, directly or indirectly, asked from, or hinted to\nthe parent of any child that they should in any way assist in\nclothing their children and I have never known of any officer\ndoing so. Occasionally the parents bring some little articles\nof clothing for the girls, usually hair ribbons or an ummade\ndress, which articles the matron accepts from them. We simply\ndo not interfere as it tends to keep a good feeling between par-\nents and children.\n\nFine and coarse combs, towels, and every other article\nreally necessary for the comfort and convenience of the pupils\nare regularly and systematically furnished them, but some of\nthem are so persistently destructive, that, no doubt, there are\ntimes when such pupils go without.\n\nAs to the Thomas children in particular, their mother\nseems possessed of an evil spirit. She has written me some\nreally dreadful letters, and, no doubt at all, she is prompting\nthem to all kinds of evil. When Pearl used the \"napkins\"\nreferred to, instead of washing them she puts them in the\nfurnace, and on several occasions in the toilet and stopped the\ndrain, so that on three different occasions it had to be taken\nup. A few days ago Pearl's duty was to place the spoons etc.\non the pupils' tables for breakfast. She deliberately put all\nthe large spoons on the small children's' tables and the small\nspoons on the big boys' table, save that she put the small\nspoons at her little sisters' plates. She is not to blame, her mother is, and besides Mrs. Thomas and the parents of Pearl Sands, also from Walpole Island, are telling the most outrageous stories about the School on the Island. I have not the least doubt, that, even Mr. Agent McCallum is influenced by them. His action in not returning pupils would indicate it.\n\nWould it not be a good thing for the Department to instruct Mr. McCallum to visit the School sometime at his convenience, and see for himself. I think that would settle the matter once for all.\n\nI might add, that, in answer to a letter from Mrs. Thomas, I have stated to her, that, if the Department would sanction it, we would be very pleased to have her children returned to her.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Institute in regard to being satisfactory. We hereby request the Department to investigate into the matter with no delay whatsoever, and with no partiality.

I do not think there is any cause for the parents to complain if the result their children received at this school...\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. James\nInd. Agent,\nDept. Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose a resolution from the Council of the Chippewas of the Thames regarding the complaint being made to the Council of the treatment of the pupil at the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nRegarding the complaints that have been laid I should like to say that the complaint has come from Mrs Joseph Waddilove, a member of the Munsey Band of the Thames, claiming that her son Frank Waddilove, a pupil at the Mt. Elgin Institute, has been punished too severely.\n\nAnd the above statement they explain that while they were threshing their wheat earlier on the institute farm, the weather having been very wet, the machine was forced to stand in the field for one whole evening waiting for the grain to get dry enough to thresh. When the grain became dry enough to thresh again they had been threshing one afternoon, and the thresher being anxious to get through with the job requested them to work for an hour or so after supper, and all hands appeared to agree to do so.\nSir,\n\nAs soon as the supper was over they began to thresh the grain. But they had only been threshing about five minutes when a large stone went through the threshing machine doing considerable amount of damage. The stone flew from the machine nearly killing one of the men which might have caused his death. At the time it happened it was supposed the stone had been gathered in the sheaf of wheat by accident. But by a short time afterwards sufficient information came forward to prove that it had been placed in the sheaf on purpose by some of the people so that they would not have to work any more that night. Mr. McCully immediately looked into the matter and traced it directly to the party who did it. Mr. McCully having got plenty of evidence to show that it shall be settled. He was pitching wheat on the waggon in the field got the stone and pedaled another boy by the name of Head who was on the waggon to place it firmly in the sheaf of wheat, saying that he would not work any more that night.\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nWhen Mr. McVitty had got the full details of how the thing happened, he considered for some time what steps he should take. He concluded that he could not allow such an act go by without some punishment. So he requested me to come to the Institution. He also had all the boys remain in the dining-rooms until it could be looked into. I was present when Mr. McVitty questioned several of the boys as to how the stone was put in the machine. When Willie Bread was questioned he stated that Frank Waddilove got the stone and made him put it into the ship. When Frank Waddilove was questioned and he admitted doing it, and when asked why he did it, he answered that he did it so that he would not have to work any more that night. But since then, when talking to his mother, he has denied the whole thing after admitting it all before the whole school. I myself Mr. McVitty shipped both of the boys over the land for what they had done. Personally I do not think there was any undue punishment administered to either of them.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The presence of Mr. Jones at the time was, I think, quite Providential as he is a magistrate as well as Agent.\n\nIn one sense an investigation would please me well.

The punishment administered was 6 or 7 straps on each hand with regulation strap, administered in the presence of Mr. Agent Janes and our Head Teacher, Mr. Littleproud. He was not even marked on the hands. He, and the four boys who saw him, all confessed the matter to me personally, each making his separate statement, and all agreeing as to the offence. Then all four confessed the matter two days later, in the presence of Mr. Janes and Mr. Littleproud.\n\nAll four now absolutely deny the confession and I think would swear they did not make it.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSeptember 29th, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. McVitty -\n\nI have your communication of the 27th instant, in reference to the resolution passed by the Chippewa Council that an investigation be held by the Department, regarding the treatment of pupils at the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nMr. James had written very fully regarding this special case of Francis Undecline, and I am of opinion that the punishment inflicted by you on this boy was fully deserved, and I do not propose to hold any investigation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

It was really clever, and typically Indian.\n\nHe had done the same thing before the Fair's Association, at Toronto, and made such an impression that they sent a representative to the meeting in question.\n\nIn a short speech, I pointed out what the government was doing for them in carrying on the Industrial...\nSchool, also pointed out, that, at the barns of said school was one of the best Imported Clydesdale Horses in Canada, an imported standard bred horse about as good as money could buy, a Holstein bull, sired by a full brother to the Champion cow of the world, and a Shorthorn bull, the highest priced animal at the Western Ontario Consignment Sales Co.'s sale last Fall. I said \"you are welcome to use these animals, in fact, you have been using our sires for seven years, some of you have paid, some have not, but none have been sent away. Now, for a period of three years, we are going to give you free use of these animals, and, I am sure the Government will assist the School in doing so:\n\nThey have bred about ninety mares, and I really don't know how many cows, but a great many. This will be a great advantage to them, and to the country, and, I think, is a real good move.\n\nWe have a great deal of money invested in these animals. Their care and food cost a great deal, and also the risk of loss, and I hereby leave to suggest to the Department, that, we think, a grant of about $100.00 each, or $400.00 in all, toward food and care, would be doing a splendid work for the Indians, and for the country, which is greatly in need of good animals instead of rubbish.\nOttawa, August 21st., 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th July, I beg to say that the Department fully realizes the great benefit derived by Indians from the use of the thorough-bred stock at the Mount Elgin Industrial School, but as no appropriation has been made by Parliament for payment for such service and as there are no other funds available from which payment could be made, it is regretted that it will not be possible to make payment in the manner suggested by you for the service in question. It is considered, however, that bands which have funds at their credit with the Department, the members of which use the stock in question, might make contributions towards the maintenance of the animals referred to. If therefore you will inform the Department of the proportion or cost which you consider each band should contribute, the question of arranging for payment from band/funds will be taken into consideration by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Of course it is only the larger ones who are wanted. We have about forty capable of rendering fairly efficient service. This leaves about eighty-five almost helpless ones to be cared for.\n\nTo permit the seniors to go would, of course, rob us of their assistance, and would also entail much extra labour on the members of our staff in carrying on the work of the school, yet, I feel something ought to be done. The following seems feasible:\n\n1. Permit such pupils as are capable, and so desire to go out to assist farmers, during the Summer.\n\n2. Said pupils to remain under charge of the school, and to receive one-half their wages weekly for spending money, and one-half to be retained for them, and held in trust by the school.\n\n3. The Department to pay the per capita grant to the School as if they were attending. This would be absolutely necessary, as our expense would be practically the same, and we would lose their assistance.\n\nI would very much prefer matters to remain as they are, so far as we are concerned, but just fear it is not the right thing to do.\n\nAwaiting your advice\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 3, 1917.\n\nRev.

For some time we have been missing oats, potatoes and some other things from the school. Councillor Louis McGahey and Oliver Daleary, two local Indians, according to the sworn statement of several boys, asked said boys to steal this stuff and take it over in the woods for them. Mr. McCookin and I drove over to see these men. They denied at first, then admitted the crime, came to the Agent's office and handed him $25.00 each in restitution. This I refused to accept, but agreed not to push the matter and give them another chance. Saturday afternoon I gave the boys a half holiday for baseball game. A number of them slipped off to the village and stole a quantity of dry goods and perfume from Mr. Brodie the storekeeper there. The ringleaders of this gang are Clive Hill (see official letter 133001/10 Jany. 8th, 1919) who has been a confirmed thief all along.

They are as follows:\n\nKelly 1\u00bd Ton Truck No. F. 116 (Reported in good condition.)\n\nKelly 1\u00bd Ton Truck No. F. 118 (Reported in good condition.)\n\nIf you are interested, arrange to have these trucks seen at the garage which is an annex to the Armories on University Drive, Toronto, Ont. It would be better to go at noon, so as to make sure of seeing them. Ask for the Sergeant Major in charge. If you could use one of these trucks and it will not require any serious expense to put it in shape, you had better wire your decision immediately after inspecting the article. The Department of Indian Affairs could then arrange for the transfer of the property through us to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHusell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. H.

Of these five come from the Muncey Reserve. The reason for so many from these, Mrs. Boyce thinks is that the Muncey Institute has two months holidays which is much more than the Mohawk has. Therefore, the boys think they should have as long as Muncey.\n\nGordon J.

I would be pleased if you would refresh my memory as to the arrangement mentioned above, and let me know the date that the pupils leave for their annual holiday and the time of their return.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

He has obtained an excellent mark in this subject.\n\nIt is not that he has been ill during the period of his studies, but rather that he has been very diligent in his studies.\n\nThe Board of Directors wishes to congratulate the students as well as the teacher on your sir, on the success attained.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether or not the pupils who passed the examinations are in attendance at high schools or collegiate institutes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I contracted this illness from a young Indian pupil in the regular pursuance of my duties.\nOn November 20, I was released from quarantine and came to my home here. On December 3, I sent in my resignation, which was accepted. At the same time, I forwarded a medical certificate to the effect that I would be unable to resume teaching until after the New Year.\n\nThe inspector of the district, Mr. J. H. Sexton, Stratford, called during my absence, but I learned from him that my work was very satisfactory.\n\nOn leaving the hospital on Nov. 20, the principal of the institution, Mr. S. R. McCutcheon, gave me a cheque for thirty dollars ($30.00) prior to that time had been paid in full until the end of October.\n\nAm I not entitled to full pay until December 3rd, the date of my resignation?\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred W.

During his very slight attack of diphtheria he was cared for by us, and a first class nurse provided. His work in the class room was not at all satisfactory, and the pupils begged of me to retain Mr. Poddle, who taught during his illness. We talked the matter over, and both decided that it was better to do so. I paid him in full until the day he left here. He expressed himself as not only satisfied, but grateful for treatment received.\n\nHe visited us on December 13th, and told me of his plans for the future. He again expressed himself as greatly pleased with his treatment here. I asked him specifically about salary and he said it was quite alright. He left here on that day in the car with Dr. Woods, and I venture the opinion that his letter to the Department was an attempt to get a little money to pay Dr. Woods for medical attention. We do not pay our officer's medical bills.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R. McVitty\nOttawa, October 7, 1924.\n\nTo: Rev. S. R. McVitty,\nLunney, Ont.\n\nRev. T.

Elgin Indian Residential School. I wish to inform you that on Tuesday, last, the Superintendent of Indian Education, from Ottawa, and the Public School Inspector for the district were at the Mt. Elgin Institute on other business and the Rev. Principal discussed with them your claim. It was decided that your daughter was not entitled to any further payment. In the first place, she reported to the Institute for duty in a weak physical condition. Further, it is extremely unlikely that any contact in the school was responsible for her attack of diphtheria.\n\nI might point out that, although the Mt. Elgin Institute is not governed in its conduct by the Ontario school laws, the management has been put to expense which would more than equal one month's salary. In addition to one-half the nurse's fees, $75.00, the school supplied board and lodging to the nurse and your daughter for three weeks - approximately $6.00 a week for each, or a total of $36.00. Further, there was a payment to your daughter of $10.00, which makes a total outlay on the part of the school management of $121.00.\n\nI wish also to add that your daughter, when leaving the Institute, expressed herself as quite satisfied with the arrangements made by the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nGeorge Ivory, Esq.,\nR. R. #2,\nBrechin, Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing the quarterly returns of the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School. I am pleased to note that there is a full attendance and that qualified instructors are engaged for the winter months.\n\nI regret to learn that the finances of the institution are causing you some concern and I note your request that the per capita grant be raised. You would be well advised to have the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals bring this to the attention of the Deputy Superintendent General, upon the occasion of his next visit to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

The main source of revenue from the farm has been the live stock. The markets have been such lately that nothing can be made in this line. The principal has had quite a large reserve saved in his bank account through years when it was possible to make some profits. This has become about exhausted and some further relief should be had.\n\nI would respectfully request the Department to raise the per capita grant from \u00a3125 to \u00a3150 per pupil.\n\nThis would enable the principal to carry on the excellent work he has accomplished there during the last sixteen years.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nOn January 31st, I wrote to the Secretary of the Department re the necessity of increasing the per capita grant to the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nA reference to this letter will give you the main reason we need the increase; other reasons might be given, such as the additional class-room teacher at a cost of nearly $1,000 a year. It is a question whether there is another school doing the same class of work on such a low per capita grant.\n\nYour favorable consideration to increasing this grant to $160 per pupil will be gratefully appreciated.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, File 468-1, part 2)\nOttawa, February 23, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo and am directed to acknowledge also your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to increasing the per capita grant in the case of the Mt. Kigin Institute. The whole question of grants is being given careful consideration at this time, as the present classifications and divisions are at this date no longer fair to certain residential schools. It is proposed to make a thorough study of the question and have the new schedules put into effect as from April 1, 1926.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\nMuncey, Ontario\n\nAt the present Per Capita Grant we have no choice but to either draw on capital Account and cripple our future, or else reduce the number of our staff and possibly employ cheaper and less efficient help. We would most deplore either alternative, so look to you with confidence for an increase in Per Capita Grant that will insure the continued success of our school.\n\nI am, dear Dr. Scott,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Another matter which might be considered is the fact that for several years we have permitted the Indian people the unrestricted use of our herd sires, the best we could buy, with the result that visitors to our United Indian fair are amazed at the quality of horses, dairy and beef cattle and swine at present found on these Reserve stations. And we are continuing a real service to them along these lines.\n\n[Signature]\nMount Elgin Indian Residential School\nMuncey, Ontario\n\nMarch 5th, 1926\n\nDuncan G. Scott Esq., LL.D.,\nActing Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;\n\nMr. Ferrier has been good enough to furnish me with a copy of his letter to the Department, also a personal one to you requesting an increase in Per Capita Grant to this school. There are certain additional facts, better known to me than anyone else, which we think you should have clearly before you when considering this matter.\n\n1. The fact that our school is always filled to capacity, without military canvass, is abundant proof that it is in great need.\n\n2. The record made by our pupils year after year is proof that they are capable, and that our teachers and instructors are efficient.\n\n3. The fact that we seldom ever have a truant or a complaint is proof that the Indian people appreciate what we are doing.\n\n4. This efficiency has been made possible by the fact that although our Per Capita Grant is very low, our Live Stock operations have been unusually successful, we have always been able to really augment our grant by our Live Stock profits.\n\n5. Our gains in Live Stock business have completely changed. And I venture the assertion that the great majority of Live Stock men are scarcely breaking even. We are more attentive to business than ever before, but the more business done the more losses, so much is on the wrong side. The price of cattle makes it impossible to produce beef or milk at a profit.\n\n6. Clothing, bread and other food we buy, etc., are abnormally high. With the result that we have to draw from our reserve fund about $350.00.\nMarch 11, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. McVitty:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with further reference to the request for an increased per capita grant in the case of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. I have noted with some concern that the financial condition of the institution is not as good as formerly.\n\nThe Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools has been informed that the whole question of grants is being given careful consideration at this time.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I wish to point out that no school should impair the efficiency of its staff. At nearly all Indian residential schools there are deficits from year to year. These deficits are cared for by the respective Church Missionary Societies.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Indian Res.

Briefly, approximately 200 children have been given the National Intelligence Test and the Pintner Non-Language Test. The Performance Test has been given to 39 pupils. I am hoping to test the majority of the pupils at the Mohawk Institute by means of the Performance Test. Mr. Rogers has very kindly assisted in numerous ways. The data are not yet in organized form so that even broad conclusions would be premature. No achievement tests have been given as yet.\n\nI would also like to test the pupils at the Mount Elgin Institute if arrangements can be made. The time that would be taken in giving the tests would be as follows: 1 hour for the Second, Third, and Fourth classes. (Time can be shortened by giving the tests to these classes simultaneously); 30 minutes for the classes below Second. The tests can easily be given some Saturday morning.\n\nI had the privilege of enjoying Mr. McVitty's\n\nIndian Affairs.

School - dated May 31st, June 1st, 1926.\n\nThe school is undermanned at present; there are 140 pupils in attendance with two teachers in charge. I would suggest that the number of qualified teachers on the staff be not less than 3. The discipline in this school is well nigh perfect, changing classes, pupils leaving or coming into school room or dining hall is done with military precision.\n\nThe organization is as good as can be expected under present conditions. The number of pupils in any class room at one time does not exceed the number required by the regulations of the Dept. of Education for Ontario. The division of subjects among the teachers is fair.\n\nThere have been too frequent changes of teachers of the intermediate and primary classes during the past year.\n\nThe present teachers are:\n\nFred J. Dodson - 47 - Permanent 2nd Ont.\nFern Harris - 21 - Interim 2nd Ont.\n\nThey have been in charge of the whole school since May 15th, 1926.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR SEXTON,\ndated December 19th, 1927, on the Mount\nElgin Indian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 7-0-6.\n\nFinally, I think that there are relatively too many pupils for each teacher. Two teachers cannot efficiently manage and teach 146 pupils. An assistant resident master is a necessity.\nOttawa, January 28, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Sexton recommends that a third teacher be engaged at the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School. As you have an enrolment of over 130 and the junior pupils are in school all day, I believe that serious consideration should be given to the public school officer's recommendation.

Our senior teacher has 47 pupils in the morning, with four classes; and about the same number in the afternoon with three classes. The junior teacher has about 45 pupils with three classes. A country teacher will often have as many pupils and about eight classes.\n\nClassroom work is an important part of our training, but not by any means the most important. Our experience indicates girls who have had a thorough training in domestic work have succeeded much better in future life than those who devoted most of their time in trying to secure high school entrance. In the case of the Indian \"a little learning is a dangerous thing.\"\n\nOur school is well organized and well manned. Pupils are not kept out of class room for any reason save sickness or they are well taught in the other departments.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR.

I note that, if she is placed in Mount Elgin, it will be necessary to provide supernumerary grant for her. In this connection, I may say that, in a letter dated September 16th last, the Reverend Principal requested that the pupilage at the Mount Elgin School be increased. He was requested to advise the Department regarding the length, width and height of each of the dormitories and was informed that, on receipt of this information, the Department would be in a position to decide if an increase in the pupilage could be allowed.\n\nThe Department would appreciate receiving the above information at an early date.

Indian children, while not inferior in mentality to white children, are particularly clever with their hands; if it could be arranged that instruction could be given them similar to that in Technical Schools, but not necessarily as comprehensive, I am satisfied the problem of Indian Education would be well on the way to a satisfactory solution. Only 3 senior IV pupils are in the classroom all day. Of the remaining 106 senior room pupils, 53 attend in the forenoon and 52 in the afternoon. Every possible care for the health and comfort of the Indian children in residence seems to have been taken by the principal and his assistants, as evidenced by their splendid physiques. Wholesome food, comfortable sleeping quarters and wise disciplinary measures have been contributory causes to these results and all reflecting great credit on the management. I would suggest that at least one instructor be added to the teaching staff. Two teachers cannot adequately deal with 140 pupils especially when so many require special attention. Many come here without a speaking knowledge of the English language.\nMay 6, 1929.\n\nDear Dr. Young:\n\nThe Department understands that Rev. Mr. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, is in rather poor health, and I write to urge your Society to seriously consider giving him an assistant. Mr. McVitty's boundless energy in the past has made it possible for him to conduct this important school without the services of an assistant principal. Most of these institutions have such an officer on the staff; and, in view of Mr. McVitty's poor health, I feel that an early appointment should be made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

This means that our school staff has to be increased, not only to do the work that older pupils would do, but to nurse and care for the little ones who cannot take care of themselves.

Oliver B. Strapp was appointed Assistant Principal at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. Mr. Strapp has rendered splendid service, and we believe the appointment is in every way justified.\n\nAs Mr. Strapp is occupying the living quarters in the institution, this has necessitated Rev. S. R. McVitty seeking a home elsewhere. This he has done, and is paying at least $50 per month for a house that he now occupies. It would seem reasonable that the Government should make provision for the erection of a Principal's Residence in close proximity to this School, and, until this has been done, it seems to us that the Department of Indian Affairs should provide the rental for Mr. McVitty's house, namely, $50 per month.\n\nWill be glad to have your mind in reference to this matter at your early convenience.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have had a good training in the simpler duties of house work, but have not had such technical training as would make it possible for them to secure and hold worth while positions as house keepers in good homes. We must look to the Department for help in giving them special training during the next year or two. In many cases you have assisted pupils in going to High School, that is not what these girls need. Help us bear the extra expense of setting up a real Domestic Science Department in our school, where these senior girls can get special training under an expert teacher, one whose duty it will be, to teach rather than to just get work done.\n\nI am enclosing an application from Miss Webster, the young lady who called at your office.

We sincerely hope that this nomination will be satisfactory to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty, the Principal of the School, is seriously ill, and it is felt that Mr. Strapp, who has been working under Mr. McVitty for four years, should be in a position to take over and carry the full responsibility if Mr. McVitty's illness should render it impossible for him to continue.\n\nIt is not our intention at the present time to make any change in the financial arrangements under which Mr. Strapp is working.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNB.MT\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6265, file 468-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 4, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, informing the Department that the Executive of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada have nominated the Reverend O. B. Strapp as assistant principal of the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I wish to say the Department regrets the serious illness of the Reverend S. B. McVitty, the principal. We will be pleased to approve of the arrangements made by the Executive of your Board in appointing the Reverend Mr. Strapp assistant principal. As he has had four years' experience at this school under the principalship of Mr. McVitty, he should be in a position to take full charge of the responsible duties at Mt. Elgin, should Mr. McVitty's illness render it impossible for him to continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nReverend Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJanuary 6th,\n1934.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am writing to inform you that the Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada is in receipt of the resignation of Rev. S. R. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, Ontario, to take effect June 30th, 1934.\n\nThis resignation will be presented to the Executive Committee of our Board on January 13th, when we anticipate that a resolution will be passed recommending its acceptance by the Department of Indian Affairs and nominating Rev. O. B. Strapp, Assistant Principal, as Principal-elect, to take over the school on the date of Mr. McVitty's retirement.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.117\nOttawa, January 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nA complaint has reached the Department, contained in a letter intended for publication in a Toronto newspaper, making certain charges against the conditions existing at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. I quote therefrom:\n\n\"Wouldn't the general public be surprised to know that these children, who work hard, have nothing softer than a box or table to rest on from the time they rise at 6:30 a.m., till they go to bed at night? (The beds must be kept neatly made up to impress visitors.) That they have not one home-like room for their use? That there is not one bath-tub for the use of the children? That skin diseases and sores are prevalent among the children? That, on a farm where a large dairy herd is kept, not one ear nor mouth average more than 2 lbs. of butter for the whole 160 children allowed daily? That, not once last year, did those 160 children receive one whole egg each? That, where sports should naturally flourish, the school will not provide even lacrosse sticks for the Indians' own games? Don't start thinking of depression! There wasn't enough the past summer to build stone pillars (to add to the appearance of the school) and to install new bath-tubs for the staff. And wouldn't the public be incensed to learn that some big boys who have worked at the school during the summer holidays never received their promised pay?\n\nThe children go to school half a day and work half a day, and are provided with food, shelter, and clothing. Their whole life, day in and day out, is spent under them; they are forced to work under direction which doesn't require, and indeed discourages, any individual acting or thinking on their part. Punishment goes to those who don't keep in line. Consequently, when they leave school, and this commanding hand is removed, what is the result? - The school is not proud of its graduates.\"\n\nI would request that you forward, at an early date, a report regarding each of the complaints, as mentioned above. It is especially requested that you will report concerning the lack of provision for medical care and the prevalence of skin diseases and sores and if the larger boys, who worked at the school during the summer, were paid for their services. I would advise that you consult the Assistant Principal, Rev. Mr. Strapp and forward a full report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHuncey, Ont.\n\nA. V. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\nSir;\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-0-1 of January 9th, with reference to Mount Elgin School and would advise that I visited this school on Jan 15th and consulted the Assistant Principal, Rev. Mr. Strapp and also had a look over the school proper and would desire to report on the separate complaints as follows,\n\n1. Re; Rest Room at the School.\n\nWhen the pupils are not at work or in the class room or at play they have access to their locker rooms which are in the basement of the school and are rooms 30' X 40' and have cement floors, with a row of locker boxes around the outside of the room which are 18\" high and outside of a small table in the girls part, they are barren of furniture. On account of the cement floor they were not very warm on the day of visit. Two other rooms are also available after supper time, being the prayer room and the reading room, there being school desks in the former and a long table with wooden benches in the latter, all seating being of wooden construction. The lawn and grounds are used by the pupils in warm weather to lounge about on. The pupils are not allowed in the dormitories only at bedtime or on account of illness.\n\n2. Re; Bath accommodation.\n\nAll pupils of the school are bathed on Saturday of each week and the laundry room is used. Twelve wooden tubs 18\" X 18\" by 20\" deep, three feet from the floor are used and are plenty small enough to bath children in, as well as being hard to keep in a sanitary condition. The laundry building in which the children bath is a very old structure and not in a good state of repair.\n\n3. Re; Skin diseases among pupils.\n\nOn the day of my visit there were 16 boys in bed with colds and sixteen girls and I examined their hands and faces and found...\ntwo boys and two girls with sores either on their hands or faces and had the assurance of the Assistant Principal and the nurse that there were no other cases in the school. These skin diseases were quite common for some years back and according to Mr. Strapp, the pupils brought a lot of it with them when they returned from their holidays and it was not until recent months that separate towels were provided twice weekly to the pupils on the request of the Med. Supt., and this has done a lot to curtail the spread of skin ailments, which is at a low mark at the present. It has apparently taken some considerable time for these skin diseases to clear up on some pupils, as some have large and numerous scars and this fact may have been due to neglect on the part of the school nurse, or some blood disorder in the pupil, or even from diet or other cause.\n\n4. Re: Pupils diet.\n\nA little butter is supplied each pupil at Supper, 3 times a week. No eggs have been supplied during the past year, in previous years one egg each was supplied each pupil at Easter time. Dr. McLeod informs me that Mr. McVitty advised him that the pupils were getting an abundance of butter and eggs.\n\nOn the day of my visit the following was the Menu:\n\nBreakfast, rolled oats; cold milk; 3 slices of bread for senior pupils and two for junior pupils; preserved fruit.\n\nDinner, Stew composed of beef, potatoes, carrots, onions & turnips; milk; rice for dessert; 2 end one slices of bread.\n\nSupper, Macaroni and tomatoes; any potatoes or porridge left over is given; milk; preserved fruit and bread the same as breakfast. Occasionally cold meat, pickles, ripe apples and drippings from fried meats are given at a meal. The plate the cook informs me that she has been at four Indian Residential schools and that Mount Elgin has better food and a larger assortment than the others she was at and the pupils all appear well nourished. The School has a variety of fresh fruit.\n\n5. Re: School sports.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Strapp informs me that the pupils have soft balls and foot balls, skating and sleigh-riding in season and they wander around the grounds and woods at the school at will. No lacrosse sticks are supplied as they are dangerous to the pupils without proper padded protection and would be a source of much ill feeling among the pupils.\n\n6. Re: Stone pillars.\n\nPillars were erected at the entrance to the school grounds in memory of pupils who died during the war and the cost to the school was in the vicinity of $150.00.\n7. Re: Staff bath-rooms.\n\nExcluding the Principal's quarters, there are three bath-rooms for the convenience of a staff of seven persons in the school proper.\n\n8. Re: Unpaid wages of pupils.\n\nIn the Summer of 1932, Carmen Sickles an older pupil who is at present in the school, had an agreement with Mr. McVitty to work at school during the holidays. Recently Mr. Jamieson, farm foreman informed Mr. Strapp that Sickles had not been paid his wages and Mr. Strapp investigated and took the matter up with Mr. McVitty and the boy did receive a cheque for $30.65 on the 11th of Jan., 1934. This boy was engaged during the Summer of Mr. Strapp and he was unaware of the non-payment of wages, and this is the only case that is known of.\n\n9. Re: Graduates of Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nThe pupils of this school come from many reserves and many classes of Indians and as Agent on two reserves I have seen many good pupils and may not be good. Of recent years I have seen many pupils return to their homes or the India reserve of this Agency who have not been a credit to any school and firstly this must be considered from the class of pupil that is admitted and secondly from lack of control on the part of the India parents after the pupils return to their homes on the reserve after being discharged.\n\nIn speaking to the Assistant Principal and going over the school with him, he brought to my attention several requirements which he maintains are badly needed, but as I had not been asked for recommendations by the Dept., I have not submitted these. Dr. Creed, however, brought to my notice that when he asked that fruit be supplied a sick Indian, the Principal would not allow it on account of the cost and the doctor also gave some reasons to which I shall refer. Health and sanitary conditions at school which he considers would be a benefit to the school. If you require these to be submitted, I would be pleased to send them forward on your request.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, January 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding your recent visit and inspection of the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School and reporting, under various headings, the general conditions found by you to exist at this school. I wish to thank you for your report.\n\nWith reference to skin diseases among the pupils, it is noted that two boys and two girls have shown evidence of these conditions; however, there were no other cases among the pupils. The medical officer and the nurse should see that the pupils receive the necessary treatment.\n\nRegarding the diet, it is considered that as there is a zinc farm, with a dairy herd, in connection with this school, the pupils should receive an ample supply of whole milk and also butter. The Department is not aware whether the school keeps hens; but, if so, it is thought that, in the case of those pupils who are not robust or otherwise unhealthy, eggs should be included in the diet.\n\nConcerning the complaint regarding unpaid wages to the pupils, it is noted that this matter has been given attention.\n\nIt is noted that the Assistant Principal and the Medical Officer brought to your attention a number of requirements for the school, which deal with health and sanitary conditions. I would request that you forward the recommendations of these officers in this connection and give as close attention as possible of the cost involved in carrying out same. When these reports are received, consideration will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D.

S. R. McVITTY.\n\nThe Secretary read a letter from Rev. S. R. McVitty, resigning from the principalship of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School as at June 30th, 1934.\n\nOn motion, IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED:\n\n1.- THAT this Executive of the Board of Home Missions has heard with profound regret that on account of advancing years and declining health Rev. S. R. McVitty has tendered his resignation as Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. In accepting this resignation, we desire to place on record our deep appreciation of the twenty-five years' service he has rendered the cause of Indian education. His knowledge of Indian life and character and devotion to the best interests of his pupils have enabled him to exert an abiding and creative influence on hundreds of Indian boys and girls. His executive ability and keen sense of financial values have combined to make the Mount Elgin Institute one of the most efficiently managed residential schools in Canada. We rejoice to assure him that he retires from the exciting duties which he has carried on with such conspicuous success for a quarter century enjoying the confidence of all those who have been associated with him;\n\n2.- THAT, as a mark of our appreciation, this Executive offers Mr. McVitty leave of absence from all responsibility, with full salary, until the end of the conference year;\n\n3.- THAT the Chairman of the Board, Dr. D. C. MacGregor, and the Superintendent of Indian Missions, Rev. Arthur Barner, be requested to visit Mr. McVitty and convey these resolutions to him;\n\n4.- THAT we nominate to the Department of Indian Affairs Rev. O. B. Strepp as Principal of Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 23rd,\n1934.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Principalship, Mount Elgin Residential School,\n\nThe Executive of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church on Thursday, January 16th, accepted the resignation of Rev. S. R. McVitty, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. A committee, consisting of the Chairman, Rev. D. C. MacGregor, D.D., and our Superintendent of Indian Missions, Rev. Arthur Barner, was appointed to wait on Mr. McVitty and convey to him the enclosed message of appreciation.\n\nThese two gentlemen met Mr. McVitty yesterday and spent a couple of hours with him, discussing the offer of the Executive that he should be given leave of absence from all responsibility, with full salary, until the completion of his twenty-fifth year of service, namely, June 30th, 1934.\n\nWe wish also to inform you that at the same meeting, Rev. O. B. Streep was nominated as successor to Mr. McVitty. We will be glad to receive your confirmation of this nomination at as early a date as possible.\n\nMr. Streep will be in the city on the 19th and 20th attending the Conference of Principals of Indian Residential Schools, when we hope to be able to discuss with him the question of having an inventory of the School's assets, an audit of the books, and the transfer of the accounts and authority.\n\nI am expecting to be in Ottawa on or about February 1st and will discuss these details with you then. It is, I think, quite within the realm of probability that the transfer to the new principal can be made by the middle of February.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nH.B.:IT\nJanuary 25, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. McVitty:\n\nThe Department is informed that the Executive of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church has accepted your resignation as Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, to take effect June 30th, next, with leave of absence until that date from further responsibility in connection with the work.\n\nI wish to express the Department's appreciation of the lengthy service you have rendered in the management of the school and in the education of our Indian wards. Your retirement from the exacting duties, which you have carried on with marked success during a quarter century, is regretted. I am sure the devotion given by you, during your incumbency as Principal, to the interests and welfare of the pupils who passed under your hand, will have a lasting benefit and influence on their lives. I extend to you the best wishes of the Department for the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. S. R. McVitty,\nPrincipal,\nMt.

S. R. McVitty as principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School and that he has been given leave of absence from all responsibility until the end of June, next.

A letter will be forwarded him, expressing the Department's appreciation of his services.\n\nThe nomination of Rev. O. B. Strapp, Assistant Principal, as Principal-elect, to succeed Rev.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nMount Elgin\nIndian Residential School\nMuncey, Ontario\n\nDear Sir\u2014During my serious illness I have written my resignation to the Home Mission Board of the United Church. At the time of writing, I had not the least knowledge of the fact that an ex-employee of the school had joined the forces a little previously, affecting the school and its management. Fortunately an experienced Editor seeing the real purpose of the letter sent a copy to our Mission Officer instead of publishing it.\n\nMissions Office received a reply from him that came to my knowledge shortly after third attended my resignation.\n\nOur Lord's day last, Rev. Cochrane and another visited the school and afterwards called on me at St. Thomas where I was spending a short leave of absence. He spent a short time talking and gave me an opportunity of stating very clearly how the first step for many years we have been unable to earn to give our children, our pupils, food, clothing, lodging, nursing, teachers, recreation, vocational training and religious instruction. Fully equal to what I believe has been enjoyed by the children of the great boarding and middle class while pupils of the Port. But, regret that anything less would be unworthy and anything more would be useless.\n\nIndian Affairs.

That is the course which we shall take of those who will necessarily have to supply the necessary additional funds to make it possible.\n\nNow that my work at the school is practically ended I fondly hope that my successors may find me what those who preceded me found me and that they may be able to carry on the good work which I have tried to accomplish and the Indians may be able to benefit from the foundation upon which I have laid a larger and better structure than yet has been.\n\nI most heartily thank the Department for its kindly consideration and unfailing courtesy during a fairly long period of service as Principal.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nS.R.

From time to time, you should make a careful study of conditions at this school and report to the Department any matters which you consider should receive our attention. Your inspection of the school should be thorough and complete and accurate information should be supplied the Department. Criticism should be constructive, as suggestions for improving the educational programme are welcomed. It is the Department's aim to keep up the attendance, improve the instruction and correlate school activities with home environment of its wards. To do this effectually requires the active cooperation of the Principal and yourself.\n\nI enclose copy of a letter being directed to the Principal, Rev. O. B.

In reply may I say that, as far as I am aware, the closest cooperation already exists between Mr. Agent Moore and myself.\n\nI am taking your letter under advisement with the Secretary of The United Church Home Mission Board and will reply in detail as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActg. Principal.\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 31st,\n1934.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp has called my attention to a letter received from you, under date of May 28th, as well as to a copy of a communication addressed to Mr. Moore, Indian Agent at Muncey, Ontario. In taking the matter up with you I am presuming that a similar letter has gone out to the Indian Agent who is in closest contact with each one of our residential schools and I am therefore anxious to secure a little elucidation of what is involved.\n\nWe have been making every effort for four years to direct through this office all the important correspondence with the Department of Indian Affairs concerning policy and problems in connection with residential schools. It is exceedingly difficult to secure uniformity and to make the decisions which we have to make concerning our schools fairly and impartially if the Principal of the school corresponds directly with the Department of Indian Affairs. The fact that I, as the Secretary responsible for Indian Missions, have the privilege of being in Ottawa frequently, has helped cut a good deal, although I would very much prefer to know beforehand concerning any negotiations which the Principal of a residential school desires to conduct with the Department.\n\nIf every approach concerning a residential school must be made in the future through the local Indian Agent, it would certainly complicate our problem in this office just at a time when we were beginning to get a system set up which was satisfactory to us - and, so far as we know, satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI can also see for most of our Principals difficulties of a different type in this regulation. For instance, in a school like Muncey or Coqualeetza, recruiting pupils from half a dozen or more agencies, it seems strange that the Principal should be required to conduct all his negotiations through the Agent who happens to be located closest to the school geographically.\n\nProbably your letter does not intend to imply that the Principal of the Muncey school, in dealing with problems, say, in Mr. McCormick's or Mr. Stone's territory, should address\nthese gentlemen or the Department of Indian Affairs through Mr. Moore.\n\nSo far as the Board of Home Missions is concerned, we welcome contacts with the schools under our direction by the Agents of the Department of Indian Affairs, whether local Agents, Medical Officers, or Inspectors. We believe that in a co-operative venture of this type we have everything to gain by consistent and careful inspection from the standpoint of the Department of Indian Affairs, and we have been fortunate in recent years in the harmony which has prevailed between the Indian Agents and Inspectors and the Principals of our Schools.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MLT\nJune 13th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to the communication recently addressed to the Reverend Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nMy intention in writing that letter was to convey to Reverend Mr. Strapp my desire that the Indian Agent be kept fully informed regarding all matters of importance affecting the school. The most effective way to do this is for the Principal to forward his communications to the Department through the office of the Indian Agent. I do not wish to offer any objection to your arranging to have the Principals of the schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada bring matters of policy to your attention with a view to your submitting them to the Department.\n\nIt was not intended that correspondence with outside Agents regarding pupils should be sent through Mr. Moore's office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

To be of real value to us and to the Department we feel that an inspection should be made by someone who is in close touch with the other schools (Residential) operated by the Churches, competent to advise the Principal upon matters of procedure, discipline and general administration if the need should arise, and able to make a comprehensive evaluation of the work being carried on in the various departments of school life.\n\nAssuring you of the heartiest cooperation of the staff and myself with the officials of your department,\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDr. Harold W.

Elgin Indian Residential School,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI would beg to advise you of the visit made to Mount Elgin Residential School by the Grand Jury of Middlesex County on the 11th day of March, 1936.\n\nWhen the assault charge against Leonard McGahey was before the Grand Jury and they returned a true bill, the jury did question the R.C.M.P., Police, Dr. McLeod and myself with regards this school and did at that time suggest that they might make a trip out here and inspect it.\n\nWhen they did come Dr. McLeod and myself were asked to accompany them which we did and the Reverend Principal Mr. Strapp did conduct them over the whole institution, with which they were much impressed. Complaints were made to the Jury about toilet and hospital facilities and this appears in the report of the Grand Jury which was published in the local papers of March 17th and which no doubt you are acquainted.\n\nThe Secretary of the Jury was asked to send me a copy of their report and it was my intention to send this forward to the Department and as I have not as yet received this report I considered it best that a report of the visit of this Jury be made to you without further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It's almost as good news when a woman almost marries her husband. Fiction writers have been around and bite a lot. They wrote the stories about the dog bites. The dog bites, apparently, is what has happened. Stringer and I were talking about this. We decided to call it a \"dog bite.\" We called it a \"dog bite\" in a column in the Buffalo Times. For years by Graham Hill and I have been writing columns for the Times. We called it a \"dog bite\" because we thought it was funny.\n\nChildren\n\nby Angelo Patri\n\nA GOOD TIME\n\nIn the old days, when men were men, they would go out and have a good time.

Recommendations that the Department of Indian Affairs be requested to make necessary improvements were contained in the grand jury's report presented to Justice Kingstone at the assizes Monday.

We would recommend that the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa be requested to supply this institution with adequate lavatory accommodation, also an emergency hospital, capable of taking care of both sexes, with accommodation for six or eight patients.

We were received by Governor Charles Mitchell and conducted through the Gaol where we found everything to be exceptionally clean, the walls, clothing and all equipment were free from vermin of any kind. The food was found to be fresh and of good quality.\n\nWe should recommend that a small drain be placed in the exercise yard to remove water that collects from the melting snow also that the windows in the Court House be tightened to prevent rattling.\n\nThe Court House Steam and return mains in the corridor that leads from the prisoners cells to the Court House requires immediate attention. The covering on the pipes is in bad need of repair and the return main has no covering whatever. The comfort of the Court House will be...\nmore than repaid in the spring and fall if these mains are properly covered and insulated. We would suggest that proper covering be 85% Magnesia sectional pipe covering, one inch thick. The total distance would be about twenty-five feet.\n\nWe found confined in the Gaol forty-six prisoners two of whom were females, and we received no complaints as to their treatment or food.\n\nGovernor Mitchell informed us that Divine Service was conducted every Sunday and appreciation is extended to those who carry on this excellent work.\n\nWe congratulate the Sheriff, Donald Graham, upon the efficiency of his work and office, and also the Governor, Charles Mitchell. Both officers are deserving of commendation.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, March the 11th, we visited the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School at the Muncey Reserve. This was the first visit by any Grand Jury to this Institution. This school, built many years ago, closed by reopened in 1867, occupies a tract of land consisting of 200 acres and with a further rental of 750 acres. We were introduced to the Principal, Rev. Mr. Strapp, by Dr. T.R. Nelson, Resident Physician and the Indian Agent, Mr. A.D. Moore. This school teaches Academic, Vocational and Dairy work. Their registration is 61 girls and 75 boys, aged from eleven to seventeen years. Much credit is due the Federal Government in maintaining an Institution of this nature. We would recommend that the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa be requested to supply this Institution with adequate inventory accommodation also an Emergency Hospital, capable of taking care of both sexes, with\naccommodation for six or eight patients. The heating system is at present inefficient, and could be improved at least thirty per cent in the installation of a vacuum pump or air eliminator on the return lines.\n\nOn Thursday, March the 12th, we visited the Middlesex House of Refuge at Stratford, and were conducted through the premises by the Superintendent, Mr. Alex. Anderson and his wife who is Matron. There are sixty-one men and twenty-three women a total of eighty-four aged persons being taken care of in this Institution. The main building is receiving interior decorations and floors are being replaced. All other buildings are very clean and in excellent condition.\n\nThe Stratford General Hospital was inspected and we found twenty-three patients receiving treatment, seven men, eleven women and six children. The Superintendent, Mrs. N. Malone R.N., conducted us through and explained fully the activities, and we found everything exceptionally clean. We believe that a sign should be placed at the intersection of the Highway and the Street leading to the Hospital, to note location in case of emergencies.\n\nThe McCormick Home for Aged People was visited where Miss S. J. Little, R.N., the Superintendent conducted us. Those in charge are endeavouring to make comfortable many who have arrived at the advanced time of life. Here we found spring cleaning in progress and everything in a most sanitary condition. At present there are 39 men and 50 women in the residence, some confined to their beds. One lady is 106 years old.\n\nOn Friday Morning, March the 13th, we visited Victoria Hospital on Ottawa Avenue, where Dr. L.C. Fallis, the Superintendent, conducted us through the Main Building.\nand the War Memorial Children Hospital. We found the main building crowded to capacity, more especially in the Women's Public Ward where every available space including the passage was occupied with beds. Immediate attention should be given to relieve this situation. The Hospital requires more room for the X-ray equipment, and much larger sections for the Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat and Maternity departments.\n\nThe manufacturing of Splints upon the premises deserves special mention and we are informed that Victoria Hospital is one of the very few carrying on this class of work.\n\nWe are pleased to see that a citizen of London was interested in the Children's section by placing therein a small but adequate swimming pool, which permits those requiring limb exercise to secure it while still patients.\n\nToo much credit cannot be given to those in charge for their excellent administration under the existing conditions.\n\nWe found all buildings exceptionally clean.\n\nThere are 354 resident patients of which 50 are children.\n\nFriday afternoon, we visited the Ontario Hospital. We met Dr. O. H. Stevenson who arranged for his assistant Dr. J. R. MacGeech to conduct us through this vast Institution where we found buildings crowded beyond capacity. There are 645 males and 823 females, a total of 1468 in residence as compared with 1565 last year.\n\nThe Dairy and Stock barns are very clean and well managed, but we notice the lack of toilet accommodation for those employed there.\nThe Recreation Building and the Vocational work greatly assist the convalescents in keeping themselves occupied while still patients.\n\nWe note the foundation of an additional building which, although immediately required, will not be completed, we are informed, until the Government has available funds.\n\nWe congratulate Dr. Stevenson and his staff upon the efficiency of this Institution.\n\nThe University of Western Ontario was visited on Saturday morning, March the 14th, and the Grand Jurors were impressed with the Arts, Science and the Lawson Memorial Library Buildings. Col. Walter James Brown, the Executive Secretary, and Prof. Fred Landon, Librarian, conducted us as we inspected the Class Rooms and the Museums. The buildings are located on a tract of land consisting of 260 acres and immediately to the north-west of the City Limits. The registration from the City of London is 479 students with an outside registration of 1094 making a total of 1573. The affiliated Colleges have a registration of 448, thus making a gross registration of 2021.\n\nIn the Summer School of 1935 there were 350 students registered, most of whom were teachers who were improving their academic standing and it is expected that the Summer School registration for 1936 will exceed 700.\n\nAll buildings are clean and well ventilated and are a credit to the Board of Governors and staff. Your Jurors were surprised to find no lockers for the students' wearing apparel, most of which was allowed to remain on racks in the corridors; they feel that some public spirited citizen should assist this Institution very much by installing these necessities.\nOn Saturday Afternoon we visited Westminster Hospital for returned and disabled soldiers numbering 576 resident patients. In the absence of Dr. Morrison, we were conducted through the buildings by Mr. D.J. McDonald, Chief Orderly Officer. It is gratifying to note how the Doctors and Nurses are endeavouring to alleviate the sufferings of these men who sacrificed all in the Great World War. We found the buildings clean and very neat and everything most orderly.\n\nThe question of dispensing with the Grand Jury, it is in our opinion very unwise to make any change in the Jury System at the present time. If the State is desirous of increasing National economy, we believe it might be advisable, if it be feasible, to adopt the British system of Parliamentary Representation.\n\nFinally, Your Lordship, may we be permitted to wish you many years of health to enable you to direct the destinies of those who may require your patience, diligence and sound judgment.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nA.

O. B. Strapp, for $5,342.75. In view of the fact that it is the custom to have these cheques drawn in favor of the Board of Home Missions, so that they could go through our books, I am returning the cheque with the hope that your Department will continue this procedure. You understand, I think, that we pay the Indian Residential Schools monthly out of Home Mission funds, as they need the money before the departmental cheque is issued.\n\nMy colleague, Dr. Dorey, reported to us, after a recent visit to Ottawa, that the per capita allowance to the Mount Elgin School had been increased to $160.00 retroactive to the last January. This cheque is on the old per capita basis of $150.00. If Dr. Dorey is wrong in his understanding, I shall be glad to know from you.

I have arranged to have the cheque drawn properly and forwarded to your office.\n\nI feel that Doctor Dorey must have misunderstood me. The per capita rate at the Mount Elgin Residential School has been increased to $160.00 in our current year's appropriation. This means that payment at this rate will be made from April 1, 1938.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R. B.

This was removed by me surgically in July, 1936.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 8th,\n1938.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Strapp, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, that Mr. John Kapayo, who for forty-five years has been mechanic at that institution, is now seriously ill. He has had several operations for cancer, and you will see by the enclosed communication from his doctor that he is not only incapacitated for work, but is not likely to live for more than a year or so.\n\nMr. Strapp feels that beyond paying Mr. Kapayo his full salary until the 31st August, there is not much more he can afford to do out of the revenue of the School. It seems to us that, under all the circumstances, the Department might very well consider granting Mr. Kapayo, in view of his long service, a pension on his retirement, amounting to at least one-half of his pay\u2014which has been $70.00 a month and a house.\n\nConfidentially, I may add that the situation is complicated by the fact that Mr. Kapayo claims that his illness is traceable to an injury which he received in the laundry of the School, through the carelessness of one of the first pupils, who let the door of the drying machine fall on his back some years ago.\n\nMr. Kapayo's relatives threaten suit, if something is not done to look after him now. I suppose if the suit were entered, it would be an attempt to recover damages from both the Department and the Church. Mr. Strapp is of the opinion that a moderate pension would satisfy all parties concerned. Will you be good enough to take this matter up and see if something cannot be done. I will be glad to hear from you after you and the other Department officials have been able to consider the question thoroughly.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. McLeod was called in and the complaint was put to tea for about a week under his care. I consulted the local attorney at London regarding the matter and was instructed to have the charges laid under Section 295 of the Code. On May 19th, 1939, I laid the charges and was sworn to hear the case by the Rev. O.B. STRAPP and the accused girls taken in by two women accompanied by Miss STANLEY a member of the Mt.

Sentence as suggested as stated above, both girls were returned to school by the principal. (See also F. 2035 rev. Lillian JACOB dated 20-5-39.) It is considered that the action taken in this case will have a deterrent effect on any other abused parties but other complaints are being dealt with and will be collected from time to time.

It appeared that the POWLESS girl received a severe beating at the hands of the two assailants. So much so in fact that Dr. McLeod was called in and confined the accused for about a week. He consulted the Crown Attorney at London regarding the matter and received instructions from him to lay the charge as above mentioned. On the afternoon of 19th May, when the incident was reported to London by the Rev. STRAPP and the two accused girls were taken to London by the writer, in company with Miss STANLEY a member of the Mt. Elgin staff. The charge was laid by Doreen POWLESS aged 16 yrs and the accused parties pleaded guilty. The above sentence was mentioned by the Court. (Please see also P. 242 re Ellen MILLY) It is considered that this action will have a decidedly good effect on not only the accused girls but others who attend the school. Police costs were collected from the accused and the fines will be paid.\n\nForwarded O.C. Sub. Div.: Forwarded O.C.

Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRE PER CAPITA GRANT\n\nMr. Strepp, the Principal of the Mount Elgin Residential School, writes concerning the reduction of the per capita grant to cover 92.24% of the authorized pupilage, suggesting that the School should reopen on September 28th instead of September 1st and that the grant for the September quarter be paid at the rate of 64 instead of 92 days, but that the March, June and December quarters be paid for at the full rate. This would mean that you would pay 92.24% of the aggregate pupil days in the year.\n\nI wonder whether it would be possible for you to look into this immediately and let us know whether, under the regulations which obtain, this could be done. Mr. Strepp is rather anxious to know as, if he can operate on the suggested basis, he can dispense with some of his staff for an additional month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOD:BJ\nJuly 25, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 20 with reference to the suggestion that you have received from the Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School in connection with the payment of the per capita allowance for the September quarter.\n\nIt is understood that all Indian residential schools that closed for summer holidays on July 1 will re-open on September 1 and consequently it is not possible to make an exception in the case of the Mount Elgin School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Roy,\nActing Officer-in-Charge,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Roy:\n\nI have recently noticed an excellent teacher in the nearby residential school. She is a teacher and very much interested in the school, so I thought it would be nice to get some information on her.\n\nI would appreciate it very much therefore, if you could send me any literature you may have concerning the duties etc., of the teachers in this school.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nW. Golding\nOttawa, September 10, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Golding:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3th instant, in which you seek information with respect to the appointment of teachers at the Mount Elgin Residential School, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Residential School is a government institution but is operated by the United Church of Canada. The principal and teachers at this school are appointed by the United Church and their salaries paid by the church authorities. You may be interested to learn that I met the principal of this school, the Reverend Mr. Strapp, at the Canadian National Exhibition and that he intimated to me during the course of our conversation that he might experience difficulty in securing fully qualified teachers this year. The duties at the school do not differ in any sense from the ordinary duties of a teacher in charge of an elementary public school.\n\nI feel confident that if the young lady on whose behalf you have written will communicate with Mr. Strapp, her application will be very sympathetically considered. In addition to this, it might be helpful if you yourself communicated with Mr. Strapp in respect to the girl's character, fitness for the position, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nW. H. Golding, Esq., M.P.,\nSeaforth, Ont.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nOctober 14th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Strapp, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, has advised this office that the services of a nightwatchman at the school will be necessary during the winter months.\n\nDuring the past several winters an Indian nightwatchman has been engaged for the period November 1st to April 30th and I would recommend Departmental approval of this expenditure which would amount to $240.00 for the six months' interval when a nightwatchman is employed.\n\nYour early reply would be greatly appreciated and if approval is given vouchers for the monthly salary of the nightwatchman would be submitted at the rate of $40.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Would you be good enough to furnish the following information:\n\nA complete statement of all the food supplied to the children over a given period of time, for example, if the period given were one week, we would require the number of pounds of potatoes and other vegetables, the number of gallons of milk, the number of pounds of meat, butter, etc.\n\nA statement of the menu for each meal for the same period, and the number of children participating of the food, with their ages.\n\nWe intend to have this scientifically reviewed by the research department of one of the universities, and be advised by them as to whether the children are getting all the nourishment necessary for their well-being.\n\nDoctor Moore and I will greatly appreciate your effort in obtaining as complete and accurate a statement as you are able to give.\n\nThe period of a week is suggested, but if you have figures obtainable for a longer period, it\n\nRev. G. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMunsey, Ont.\nwould not be necessary to break them down. I would suggest that you take the shortest period available, the minimum being one week.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSuperintendent\n| Item                        | Quantity | Approx.

Mr. Strapp feels that he has been paying some of the members of his staff too low wages; thus if he does not increase it, he will not be able to keep them. He asked me if the \"pensioning\" which has been placed on wages applied to residential schools. I told him that I did not think it did.

Tisdall, in which he states that milk is not upon the\ndietary schedule in effect at the Mount Elgin Institute.\nThis schedule, you may remember, was forwarded to the\nDepartment by you a few weeks ago. Dr. Tisdall in his\nletter states:\n\n\"Attached you will find two copies of the\nbreakdown of the weekly amount of food consumed on the\nbasis of protein, fat, carbohydrate, calories, minerals\nand vitamins per day.\n\n\"A rather surprising point is that these\nchildren apparently average 3\u00bd ounces of milk a day,\nwhich of course is excellent. When the diet is pulled\nto pieces, it is seen that the protein is adequate, with\napproximately half the protein obtained from animal\nsources, namely, milk and meat.\nThe calcium and vitamin D contents are\nprobably adequate although you take into consideration the\nfact that many of the children are no doubt quite young.\nThere would be something which could only be determined\nhowever if the exact ages of the children were known.\nThe amount of fat is adequate. Calcium is adequate.\nThe iron is adequate, although there is a surplus. The\nvitamin A is perhaps a little low. The B1 is a little\nlow, which however would be rectified if Canada Approved\nBread or whole wheat bread were used. The vitamin C is\nmarkedly low. On paper the 55 mgs. is not bad, but from\nour experience I am sure you would find that the\n55 mgs. coming from potatoes and vegetables is fully two-\nthirds of this \"ill balanced\" the smoking. Due to the\nlarge consumption of milk the riboflavin intake is\nadequate.\n\n\"Our suggestion would be to use more green\nleafy vegetables to supply more vitamin A, and either\nmore tomatoes, tomato juice or citrus fruits - to supply\nvitamin C.\"\n\nI am sending forward herewith two copies of\nthe breakdown referred to by Dr. Tisdall, for your\ninformation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend O. B. Straup,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMuncy, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 9, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDoctor McGill\n\nCatalog:\nResidential School\n\nThe residential school on this reserve, known as the Mount Algin Institute, is one of the oldest residential schools, if not the oldest, in the province of Ontario. It was built in the year 1849, probably by the Methodist Church of Canada, and officially opened in 1851. It is now the only residential school operated by the Government in cooperation with the United Church in the province of Ontario. An enrolment of 150 pupils is allowed at this school and per capita grant is at the rate of $160. The cost of operation per pupil, according to the last audit statement, is $241.66 per annum.\n\nThe classroom buildings, which are detached from the main building, are the original buildings erected almost a century ago. In addition to the regular classrooms, accommodation is provided on the second floor of this building for certain members of the teaching staff. These residential school buildings are on a mound and subject very much to erosion. This is particularly true of the classroom, one gable of which might collapse at any time. Mr. Dudley had this particular gable strengthened with four or five square timbers. This rendered the wall reasonably safe for a time, but the wall above and below these supports shows signs of bulging and disintegration. The main building was rebuilt in 1898, probably by the Methodist Church, with a contribution from the Government. The records here indicate that from 1898 to 1911 and 1912 \u00a321,000 of government funds have been spent on this school and \u00a311,600 from band funds. In 1912 and 1913 a new addition was built to the main building at a cost to the Government of \u00a317,260.00. This main building represents a style of architecture that has long since been abandoned. The ceilings are at least 12 feet high and the cost of heating from year to year must be enormous. However, the building is of brick construction and from the outside presents a somewhat imposing appearance, but inside it is one of the most dilapidated structures that I have ever inspected.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nAt the time of my visit the plumbing in the boys' wash-room was in a faulty state of repair, with the result that the wash bowl were full of filthy water and the floor of the wash-room in a filthy condition. The odors in the wash-room and indeed throughout the building were so offensive that I could scarcely endure them. Certain parts of this building are literally alive with cockroaches - this applies particularly to the kitchen. The treads I noticed on the stairway were literally worn away until they are no longer safe. If this were not a government-operated institution, I feel confident it would be closed by the municipal health authorities.\n\nHowever, when I later discussed the state of this school with Dr. Ochreane, he expressed the opinion that it was a model of sanitary perfection when compared with the United Church school at Round Lake, Saskatchewan. I must state, though, in fairness to all parties concerned, that this school reflects no credit on either the Department of the United Church of Canada. In my judgment, it should be immediately closed or rebuilt. Consider the principal, the Reverend Mr. Strapp; a good man and a man with a very practical turn of mind, he has experienced the utmost difficulty this year in securing pupils, particularly senior pupils. He had at the time of my visit 120 pupils on the roll and is worried almost to the point of collapse by the financial outlook for the school. The school, he assured me, simply cannot continue to operate with the present allowance. It would appear as Indians become economically better off they display a tendency to keep their children at home and send them to the day schools rather than to the residential school. This may be a rather encouraging tendency but is one that makes it exceedingly difficult for our schools to operate until certain adjustments have been effected. I estimate that it would require the sum of $200,000 to rebuild and furnish the Mount Algin School with accommodation for 150 to 175 pupils.\n\nIn contrast to the school building, the farm operated in connection with this school is a model of efficiency. Mr. Strapp has one of the best pure bred Holstein dairy herds in southwestern Ontario. He has in addition at this time 70 pigs of the bacon type, and has one of the best Yorkshire bears in the province. He also has a good poultry house, well stocked with poultry and his farm buildings are all that one might desire. I am disposed to think that we should cease to operate this residential school and that the place it occupies should be taken by a four-room classroom building, in which we would make provision for continuation classes and vocational instruction. This would enable us to take the\npupils from the day schools at Grades 7 and 8 and give them advanced courses in academic subjects in agriculture or auto mechanic, carpentry, etc., and the girls, courses in home-making, domestic science, dressmaking, etc. The principal of this school should, in addition to his duties at the school be made supervisor or inspector of all the schools on the reserve. This would enable us to have an almost ideal experimental educational unit. In view of the fact that this school has been operated for a century by the United Church, we might have to nominate as the principal of the school a United Church clergyman. Such a clergyman, if appointed, however, should be a fully qualified teacher with training in vocational subjects, and in agriculture. It has occurred to me that if the New England Company withdraw their support from the Bradford school and transfer the property to the Department, we might well consider the advisability of appointing a fully qualified teacher as principal of this United Church and Anglican children, particularly orphans, could be sent from the whole of southwestern Ontario.\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDeclare Hon.\nWorkers At\n\nMiddlesex Presbytery of United Church Adopts Resolution Urging Salary Level Be Raised\n\n\"When the United Church does justice to its missionary workers, then it will be a better church than it is now,\" Rev. Gladstone F. Wood, pastor of King Street United Church, declared at yesterday's session of the Middlesex Presbytery of Hobson United Church. Mr. Wood was speaking in a motion calling for an increase in the standard of salaries paid to workers in the home mission fields of the church.\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp, principal of the Bishop Strang Institute on the Eskimo Indian Reserve, said that missionaries working in the home missions, particularly among the Indians, were isolated from ordinary social contacts, and instead of being compensated for this were often the victims of misunderstanding. In a case in Middlesex Presbytery where a missionary started work on a reserve with a salary of $900, which after three years had been increased to the maximum of $1,250.\n\nWork in the Indian missions is always difficult, Mr. Strapp said. \"The missionary is met by the Indians with questions like 'What are you going to take from us now?'\" Mr. Strapp declared. \"This white man comes to the Indian with the Bible in one hand and a bundle of secondhand clothing in the other, and with him he brings also his material desires.\"\n\nAfter considerable discussion on the question, a motion was passed by unanimous vote of the general council of the church for immediate steps to raise the standard of salaries among missionary workers.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nMarch 20, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttached is a clipping from the London Free Press, a paper widely read by the Indians of this Agency. To my mind it is hardly the type of statement one would expect from a principal of an Indian Residential School, especially at this time, as he well knows that every effort is being put forth to encourage our people, by their own efforts, to make every possible use of the discarded clothing now being received.\n\nI am not interested in his Bible or Social Disease statements. If, after all these years as a Church minister, he has failed and can only offer a Bible in one hand and a Social Disease in the other, that is his affair. But I am particularly interested in his reference to second hand clothing. The last few weeks have not been easy and I have put forth every endeavour to organize and make it possible for our women to make use of the clothing being received and Mr. Strapp knows this. I am tempted to think that his remarks were aimed directly at this Office. Already one man, after looking over some remodelled garments said, \"Oh, they are alright for every day wear.\" I am sure this man had read Mr. Strapp's statement.\n\nTo me it is quite evident that Mr. Strapp has never co-operated with this Office and tolerated only on sufferance. However, I am not complaining; I am merely drawing your attention to a public statement made by a man whose every endeavour should be to co-operate and encourage rather than criticize the efforts of others.\n\nG.W. Down, INDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa, March 23, 1943.\n\nMr. G. V. Down, Indian Agent, Munsey, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of March 20 and also a clipping from the London Free Press, attached thereto.\n\nIt has occurred to me that you may have misinterpreted the remarks made by Mr. Strapp when he addressed the Middlesex Presbytery of the United Church of Canada. It has been the policy and practice of the United Church for a great many years to have Women's Missionary Societies collect, mend and remodel second hand clothing for distribution on Indian reserves. We are fully aware of this practice for the simple reason that requests reach us from time to time from United Church missionaries, asking permission to make a nominal charge for such clothing at certain agencies. While the need at the moment is in no sense urgent, the distribution of this clothing meant a great deal to the Welfare Division during the depression period.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that Mr. Strapp is not an employee of this Department, nor is he responsible to this Department for any statements he may care to make. My personal opinion is that you should not attach too much importance to statements such as this, made by missionaries and others, in respect to Indian administration. Incidentally, I may state that Mr. Strapp's statement appears to be very reasonable and moderate, compared to statements that reach the Department frequently from other provinces, particularly British Columbia.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRe Mohawk Institute\n\nI have read Mr. Hoey's report and that of Constable Needham. What has happened at this school confirms the wisdom of the decision reached some time ago that the institution should be closed. (See my memorandum of December 17th last).\n\nIt is to be regretted that we have not yet heard from the New England Company about the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. However, regardless of what use we may be able to make of that institution in the future it would seem quite clear that we are not justified in permitting the Mount Elgin Institution to be operated after the end of the present school year, not so much because of the recent happenings but because of the unsatisfactory condition of the buildings.\n\nIt is assumed that Mr. Hoey will keep closely in touch with Doctor Dorey and that he will discuss the matter with him again after the problem has been considered by his Home Mission Board.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nOttawa, May 22, 1915.\nOttawa, May 26, 1943.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe Director is in receipt of a memorandum from the Deputy Minister, dated May 22, 1943, in which Dr. Cassell discusses the subject matter of certain reports that have been sent concerning his observations at the Mount Elgin Institute. Dr. Cassell, in his memorandum states: \"It would seem quite clear that we are not justified in permitting the Mount Elgin Institute to be operated after the end of the present school year, not so much because of recent happenings, but because of the unsatisfactory condition of the school building.\"\n\nYou may remember that during the course of one of our discussions I intimated to you that we were communicating with the New England Company with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute. The full story was told by Mr. Smith, the Secretary of the Company, and in that latter offered to take over the property at Brantford and operate the school there as a departmental institution for the care and education of non-Catholic children in western Ontario. The matter has been referred back to this level, but it is almost certain likely that a reply will be received at an early date. My personal opinion is that the Mount Elgin Institute might very well be closed at the end of the present academic year, on the understanding that a secondary or continuation school and a teacher's residence would be built near you. At this time it could not be provided of vocational character and a certain amount of training provided on the school farm, which, in my judgment, should be retained. The Principal of the School should be a United Church clergyman with special pedagogical training. In addition to being principal of the school he should be superintendent of the still Indian day schools in the Caradoc agency. It is just possible that transportation would have to be provided along lines somewhat similar to the transportation now provided at the consolidated day school in the Cowichan agency. This is a matter which, I feel sure, you will want to discuss with the Home Mission Board and with the Minister personally. I am writing to you today, however, in the hope that the Mission Board or you personally will see your way clear to have a representative of your Church make a survey of conditions at the Caradoc Agency and submit a report on the program that might be carried forward at that agency. It might be possible for us to make arrangements whereby the public school inspector for the district might assist in this survey.\n\nI can appreciate very fully that the members of the Home Mission Board may not be favourably disposed to the closing of the residential school at Nunsing. However, I am personally disposed to think that some such action as\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n209 Queen St. West,\nToronto E., Ont.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nthis will have to be taken, either now or in the immediate future. The present building is in an insanitary and dilapidated condition and the classroom building is apt to collapse at any time. I have been assured that it would cost approximately $250,000.00 to build a fully fireproof residential school at this agency. I feel you will agree with me when I state that it will be exceedingly difficult for me to recommend such an expenditure, if funds were available, in view of the more urgent needs at Alberni, File Hills and Round Lake. However, this is a matter that we want to adjust in the closest possible cooperation with you and the members of your Board.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n\n299 Queen St. West\nToronto 1, Ontario\n\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMay 27th,\n1943.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Operation Mount Elgin Institute\nYour File 7-0-\n\nI have your letter of May 26th, and, after giving it some consideration, I am writing to let you have my own personal reaction. Naturally, such a drastic proposal as you outline will have to receive the consideration of the Executive of our Board. I do not remember that you had spoken to me about the approach which had been made to the New England Company with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute, but we did discuss the problem of education on the Caradoc Reserve. I shall be quite frank in my reaction.\n\nIn the first place, I do not think you intend the suggestion that the School at Munsey be closed on June 30th, 1943, to be taken seriously. To ask the Board of Home Missions to consent to this after the School has been in operation \"for these many years,\" when a notice is sent to us on May 26th - which is just one month and four days' notice - is a good deal more than I think you think we are likely to consider as within the realm of practical politics.\n\nI also note that your proposition involves closing the School now and leaving all these children who are at present in the School without any educational facilities, and that next year a secondary or continuation school and a teacher's residence would be built. I do not think that is feasible - and I do not think you do either.\n\nI should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the suggestion that the Mohawk Institute be operated on a departmental basis is so complete and radical a departure from the system which has hitherto obtained in the operation of residential schools, that I do not think it can be carried out without taking into account certain factors which involve the Churches. I do not know what the attitude of The Church of England would be, but I believe, however, that it is proposed to set up this institution as a residential school for non-Catholics. May I ask if it is seriously proposed that the non-Catholics in Ontario would be treated in one way and the Catholics and all the rest of the Dominion would be treated in another way? I do not think this is possible. Nor do I think that the United Church would look with any favor on the setting up of a residential school of the size of the Mohawk Institute, to be operated on a purely secular basis. I am not very strong on sectarianism, but I do feel that the religious side of the work of the Indian schools must be considered. However, the relation you have with the Mohawk Institute and with The Church of...\nEngland is not my business.\n\nI come next to a very serious feature of the proposition. According to the last Census, there are 5533 Indians in Ontario who are counted United Church. There are 9747 Church of England, and 9262 Roman Catholics. Your proposal, if it were carried through, would mean, so far as the United Church is concerned, that there would not be a single residential school in Ontario to which our children could be sent; but it would leave all the Roman Catholic schools, with a total pupilage of 705, in full operation. It would leave The Church of England schools, with a pupilage of 520 (I have eliminated the Mohawk Institute), also running. I do not think that this will commend itself to the judgment of the United Church.\n\nFurther - and in this I am only expressing my opinion - I do not know what the official attitude of the Executive of our Board will be - I think it is quite improbable that our Executive would look with equanimity on a proposal that would deprive the United Church of another residential school. I beg to point out that we gave up Coqualeetza. Ahousaht has been closed - Kitamaat has been closed - and whilst these latter two were not very large, yet the total pupilage in residential schools under the care of the United Church is a good deal less than it was some years ago. We shall await with a good deal of interest - and I was going to say expectation, although that is the wrong word - to hear of one single, solitary Roman Catholic School having been closed. We might as well face the fact that when the school was closed at Coqualeetza, and also the school at Ahousaht, the Indian people, whose children had been going to these schools, were approached by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, with a proposal that their children attend one of the Catholic schools. I know perfectly well that the law says that Catholic children will go to Catholic schools and Protestant children to Protestant schools; but there is absolutely nothing which says that a man may not change his church affiliation in order to get his children enrolled in the school which seems to him, for the time being at least, to offer the greater advantage. This has been done. You and I are powerless to do very much about it, because we believe in freedom. But I think these matters must be faced.\n\nHaving said all this, I fully realize that the Mount Elgin School is in a deplorable condition and that it has long outlived its usefulness; but I have not yet come to the place where I would ask the Executive of our Board to urge the expenditure of $200,000 of Government money to replace this old building. I realize that the situation at Mount Elgin is in a bad way, and, personally, I am quite prepared to co-operate with the Department in making the survey suggested; but we might as well face the fact that, so far as our Church is concerned, we are not going to be pushed around too far nor too fast in connection with these residential schools; and we shall expect the same policy to be followed on Reserves where the people are Roman Catholic as you are suggesting in the case of this Reserve, which is predominantly Protestant.\n\nFinally, may I say that it does not seem to us to be fair - and I do not think we can get away with it - to notify Mr. Strapp on the 27th May that his ten years' principalship will expire on June 30th. This is what the proposal to close the school would mean; because I do not think that either you or I can envisage Mr. Strapp as an educationist, doing the work which you suggest should be done on this particular Reserve. Some men have some gifts, and others have others - there is good Scripture for that - and, quite frankly, I do not think Mr. Strapp's gifts...\nlie in that direction.\n\nThe Secretaries of the Board of Home Missions would, I think, be prepared to continue to explore the possibility of radical changes in the educational set-up at Mount Elgin\u2014or anywhere else, but I think we should have time in which to do it, and the 30th June, which is the end of the academic year, is hardly time enough. With this end in view, I shall try to arrange for a survey of conditions in the Caradoc Agency, and to assist in submitting a report on the programme which might be carried forward in the Agency. This might be done during the coming summer, in co-operation with the public school inspector.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nMEMORANDUM: DOCTOR DOREY.\n\nRe: Operation Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute has at this date an authorized enrolment of 150 pupils, for which per capita grant at the rate of $160 is allowed. The actual enrolment is approximately 120 pupils, the number of these are school girls who have exceeded the age limit. The pupils are drawn from the following reserves: Waipole Island; Barna; Kettle Point; Oneida; Muncey; Caradoc; Cape Croker; Hagersville (New Credit); Moravian; Saugan; Christian Island; Six Nations; Gibson (Perry Sound); Caughnawaga.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that there is ample accommodation at the day schools on the reserves from which pupils are recruited and that the closing down of the Mt. Elgin Institute would cause little inconvenience in this respect, although transportation in one or two cases would no doubt have to be provided. It is interesting to note that a day school was closed at the Caradoc agency during the present academic year for the reason that the number of pupils available did not justify its operation. The teacher of the school was last term employed in the agency office where she now serves as clerk. It will be noted that 17 pupils are recruited from the Kettle Point agency and yet the attendance at this school has become so unsatisfactory and the number of pupils of school age reduced to such an extent that we are now considering the advisability of closing this school. These are matters that confront us, apart altogether from the insanitary condition of the building. From a sanitary standpoint the building has been condemned by the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, the Inspector for Ontario and a number of Indian agents at the Cowichan and other Indian agencies. The R.C.W.P. in the district have not advocated the closing of the building but have expressed the view that the institution, in their judgment, is no longer necessary.\n\nThe educational set-up suggested in my letter to you of May 28th is exactly the same set-up as we have now in operation at the Sts. Catherine (R.C.) School in the Cowichan Agency. This school was built in the year 1921-30. The set-up is exactly the same as the one approved by the Government for Eskasoni and for Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. A clergyman with pedagogical training will be in charge of these schools.\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, the St. George's School at Lytton and the Shubenacadie Residential School (R.C.) are, and always have been, departmentalized institutions. The St. George's School and the Mohawk Institute have never been operated at any time by the Anglican Church or by the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England. Should the Mohawk Institute be operated jointly, there would be no change whatever in the status of the school. The New England Company, in making their grant request that a regularly ordained Anglican clergyman be employed as principal.\n\nThere is of course a financial side to this question. I have no desire to emphasize this side unduly but I do feel that it is worthy of consideration, in view of the difficulty we have experienced in securing the funds necessary to...\nmaintain our Indian day and residential schools in a high state of efficiency. I have before me the last audit statement on the Mt. Elgin Institute. This statement is dated May 26, 1945. The Auditor, in this report, states:\n\n\"The cost per pupil per year shows an increase of $34.10 over the previous year. The increase is due to the reduction in the average attendance from 141.15 in 1941-42 to 127.70 in 1942-43. The total cost for the operation of the school for the period April 1, 1944 to March 31, 1945, amounted to $75,982.35.\" In this connection it is significant that the total welfare program on the Caradoc Reserve for the fiscal year, which includes the care of the aged; deserted wives; agricultural operations; drainage; house repair; construction of homes; the purchase of seed, farm machinery, etc., amounted to $10,827.84. In other words we are spending $200.61 annually for the general welfare of the Indian population and $200.61 on each pupil in attendance at the Institution, and this figure of course does not include other educational costs on the reserve. I am frankly of the opinion that these expenditures are out of balance. This was the opinion expressed somewhat bitterly by the agents at the conference already referred to.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that should you require additional information I shall be glad to supply it at any time.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, May 31, 1943.\n\nFor Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 27 and to thank you for the candid expression of opinion contained therein. I was particularly gratified to note your readiness to cooperate with the Department in having a thorough survey undertaken at the Caradoc agency with the object of working out an educational program designed to meet the needs of the Indian population.\n\nIn view of the fact that you are likely to discuss this matter with the members of your executive, I am attaching hereto a memorandum on the subject which, I trust, you will find helpful. I do not find admitting to you that the condition of the Mount Elgin Institute has given me a great many anxious hours of late. We have had two memoranda from the Minister's office within the last year, in both of which the opinion was expressed that the institution should be closed. You can easily imagine then the position I would be in, in the case of truancy or in case of fire or the collapse of the classroom building.\n\nI feel sure that you will recall to mind a discussion we had at the time of your visit on January 12. At that time we discussed the desirability of operating the Mohawk Institute as a departmental institution. I suggested at that time that the principal of the Alert Bay School might be a good man for the principalship. This discussion took place before the Minister wrote his letter to the New England Company.\n\nI do not suppose that the actual date of the closing should prove to be a serious matter. The Government having enunciated its policy, is not likely to be unreasonable either with respect to the closing date or the re-employment of the staff. However, these are all matters that might be discussed by you with the Director or with the Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\n280 Queen St. West, Toronto Ont.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFollowing receipt of your last letter and memorandum, we have had the opportunity of thinking more about this, and also of having a conversation with Mr. Strapp, the Principal; and as our Executive will not meet until June 21st, I thought I should write regarding certain matters which I think need a little further clarification.\n\nMay I say that it is our information that, whilst one school was closed on the Reserve, another room was opened in the basement of a church, and that this is in operation. Perhaps you would clarify that for us. Our information is that there are just as many rooms being operated today on the Reserve as there were. In that connection, may I point out something of which you are already aware\u2014that the policy of withholding from the public the information concerning school enrolment and a great many other details which were available some years ago is altogether to be deplored, and I hope that some way will be found to get this information available for free distribution. At the same time, I would like to make it quite clear that I have never yet asked for any information from your Department without its being forthcoming immediately\u2014and sometimes, I am sure, at great trouble to those who work in your Department. I do not know to whom we should make representation, but there is altogether too little information available in detailed form.\n\nI went over the Mount Elgin building a week ago, and whilst it is not in good repair, as I have already admitted, it is no different in construction from what it was fifty years ago, and the fire hazards which now obtain have been the same all through these years. In that connection, may I ask if it is to be assumed that the Mohawk Institute\u2014which dates from approximately the same period\u2014is to be considered so much superior to Mount Elgin that it is going to be continued? You have the advantage of having visited both\u2014I have never seen the Mohawk Institute and would not presume to pass any judgment on it\u2014but we should like to be sure that the basis on which the proposal is made that all the children go to the Mohawk Institute\u2014which is that the building there is much better\u2014is actually based on fact.\n\nThe difficulty at Mount Elgin is very largely with the basement. There is no question that the boys' playroom was wet and dirty when I was there a week ago. The water seeps in from the side walls, and the result is very bad. There is no doubt about that! But, in the meantime, I think that the situation could be remedied if one were to go to the expense of digging a trench all around the building down to the floor level of the basement\u2014which, by the way, would be some three...\nor four feet above the bottom of the foundation; clean off the wall, coat it with cement; paint it with asphalt; and then put weeping tile all around it. I think that would eliminate all the wetness in the basement; but, not being a builder, I can only venture the opinion of an amateur.\n\nAs I have already stated, we are ready to assist in a survey of the Reserve; but may I say that there must also be a survey of the Six Nations Reserve. From what little knowledge I have, I think it would be apparent to anyone that the place where there is least need of a residential school is the Six Nations Reserve; and, conversely, the place where a continuation school is most likely to be successful, on the basis suggested in your letter, is precisely the same point. From the little information I have been able to gather, I think that it is extremely unlikely that it would be possible to get a sufficient number of children of the secondary school grade to make worthwhile the operation of a school of that kind on the Caradoc Reserve, unless it were fitted up to provide accommodation for pupils from outside Reserves. This brings me to a suggestion which I have been making for a number of years\u2014seemingly without effect. It is that some competent educationist be asked to make a survey of the educational needs of all the Indians of Canada. Let him start, if you will, in Ontario; and then after he has done that, let him sit down for a day or two with representatives of the Department and of the Church and see whether a satisfactory solution cannot be arrived at.\n\nThe more I think of your proposition to place all the children of school age who need residential school care in one institution\u2014and that one under the direction of the Church of England,\u2014the less I think of it. We have already had experience in a number of cases of children of United Church parents being sent to Anglican schools. Whilst I have no fault to find with the religious and moral instruction which they are given, yet the fact remains that when they come back to the Reserve they consider themselves members of the Church of England, and when our missionary tries to interest them in church work, they reply that they are members of the Church of England\u2014and very often that is simply a cloak for non-attendance and indifference. That difficulty has arisen in a number of cases, and that, in spite of the finest co-operation between the two Churches where the local school is situated, I have no doubt that the Church of England missionaries on Reserves where the children attend United Church schools find that the same situation obtains.\n\nI know that you will think that I am raising a great many objections; but this is a pretty serious step to take and I want, so far as it is possible, to see how each step in the process will work out.\n\nI was quite interested in your description of the Mohawk Institute, the School at Lytton, and the Shubenacadie Residential School as being departmentally operated institutions. Are we to presume therefore that in these departmentally operated institutions\u2014such as the Mohawk Institute\u2014no one church is given any special privilege or right to give religious instruction? I am afraid that your argument will hardly hold water. And I am sorry that there are no Protestant Indian children in the Shubenacadie Residential School so that I might test out this question of departmentally operated institutions!\n\nI should like to have some further elucidation of the Auditor's report quoted on the second page of your memorandum. Here again, of course, we have no figures. The total amount which the Government paid to the Mount Elgin School for this period was $22,871.02, and the $37,000 includes the sum of $11,749.33, which Mr. Strapp has entered as \"value of produce raised and consumed.\" I suppose it is fair to include that as part of the cost per pupil, but, if this is done, then I think...\nit could be very materially reduced so as to make a much better showing.\n\nThere is no doubt that the total cost of the welfare programme on the Caradoc Reserve is high; but so long as the Government maintains the Reserve system, there is only one thing to be expected\u2014that it will decrease but rather increase. One cannot expect, on the one hand, to maintain a system, the operation of which saps all individual responsibility from the Indian, and, on the other hand, hope that the amount which will be required for the care of the aged, agricultural operations, drainage, etc., will decrease. That is simply impossible!\n\nI should be very glad if you would give further consideration to the matter of having a complete survey of educational needs in Ontario; and also if you could send me a full statement of the cost of operation of all residential schools for the fiscal year 1942-43. You have been good enough to send me these statements for the years in which they have not been printed in the Auditor General's Accounts. These include per capita grants, etc., and give the total for each school. If it is necessary to have them mimeographed, I should be glad to get a sufficient number of copies so that they could be sent to the representatives of all the Churches.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nOttawa, June 12, 1943.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 10, in which you seek additional information with respect to the marginally-noted subject.\n\nI am anxious to avoid in this correspondence, if I can, a discussion of government policy. Such discussion should really be carried on by the Minister or by the Deputy acting on his behalf. I am convinced that I should confine my attention to the task of supplying information and an interpretation of the educational policy followed by the Department, particularly in recent years.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Back Settlement School, in the Caradoc Agency, was totally destroyed by fire on April 30, 1943. Immediately following this fire, the Anglican Bishop placed the nearest Anglican church at our disposal, without cost, for educational purposes. A school has been conducted in the basement of that church during the present academic year. It has at this date a small enrollment, with an average attendance of 14. In my last letter to you, I referred to the closing of the Muncey School, which had at the time it was closed an average attendance of approximately 5.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, a report of this branch for the fiscal year 1942-43. The figures for the fiscal year 1943 have not been completed by the Treasury Branch but will be released in the course of a few weeks. I shall be glad to have Mr. Phelan prepare for you a statement somewhat similar to the statement prepared by him last year.\n\nI have never pretended at any time to pass judgment on the general condition of the Mt. Elgin Institute. I did state quite frankly, however, after my last visit, that in my judgment the building was in an insanitary condition. It has, however, been considerably improved around in recent years. These men point out that the buildings themselves are on a mound and consequently subject to erosion. When Mr. Dudley erected supports to protect the gable of the classroom building from collapse, he did so on the specific understanding that it should not be hazardous. He did the building collapse some time in the immediate future. It has always appeared to me that the building is somewhat deceptive in that the outside appearance is not wholly unattractive. I think it is only fair to you to add that a number of the agents at the recent convention held in\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nToronto stated quite emphatically that, in view of the inadequate condition of the building, they were not prepared to encourage Indian pupils to attend the institution.\n\nI note that the Mohawk Institute was reconstructed at a cost of approximately $50,000.00 in the years 1922-23 and 1923-24. In addition to this, the grant of $5,000.00 a year contributed to the Department for the operation of this school has been spent from year to year on general maintenance. The school should be borne in mind that children for the Mohawk Institute are recruited from Tyendinaga, Gibson, Caughnawaga, Sarnia, Moravian, Walpole Island and a number of outlying reserves. The pupils in attendance at this school from the Six Nations Reserve are, with one or two exceptions, orphaned or children from deserted homes. In this connection, I should mention that two years ago we made an arrangement whereby high school studies are provided at two or three of the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve. In addition to this, we have an arrangement with the Brantford Collegiate Board whereby the children who complete the high school course on the reserve with a creditable standing proceed with Grades 10, 11 and 12 at the Brantford Collegiate Institute. In my judgment, it would be very unwise and - if I may say so - pedagogically unsound to modify this program in any sense until it has been given a few years' trial. What's more, I find in Canada was a continuation school to which we could send pupils for training in agriculture, home economics, auto mechanics, handicrafts, etc. These children might remain at the Indian day schools until they were 18 or 13 years old and then proceed to the continuation school where they will be interested to learn that the number of pupils proceeding with high school studies on the Six Nations Reserve is equal to the number of white pupils proceeding with these studies in the adjoining communities.\n\nYou appear to have misunderstood my reference to the Shubenacadie Mohawk Institute and Lytton Schools as being departmentally operated. I can only repeat that statement, not as an expression of opinion but as a statement of fact. The Mohawk Institute and the school at Lytton are actually leased by this Department, on the understanding that they will be operated by the Department of Canada for the education and civilization of Indian children. They are leased on the understanding that a fully ordained Anglican clergyman will be employed as principal. The three schools, of course, are operated by the Department in conformity with subsection 2 of Section 10 of the Land Act, 1913, subsection (2). No Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices\". You state that you are sorry that there are no Protestant Indian children in the Shubenacadie Residential School so that you might test out the question of departmentally operated institutions. I simply cannot grasp the meaning of this reference.\n\nI was intentionally conservative when giving the expenditures involved in the operation of the Mount Elgin Institute. I simply submitted figures showing the actual disbursements. I did not include depreciation on buildings, farm machinery, etc., nor did I include inspection fees or the cost -\nthe cost of school supplies, desks, text books, maps, etc., which are supplied from year to year from a distinct and separate appropriation and which are not included in the regular auditor's reports.\n\nI should like you to read again the last paragraph of the memorandum sent forward by me in my letter of May 31. Why I was anxious to point out there was the wide discrepancy between welfare expenditures and the annual expenditures at the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nI shall be glad to send on the financial statement just as soon as we can secure the figures from the Treasury officials.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Dr. Dorey appears to be definitely of the opinion that it will not be possible or practical to close this school at the end of the present academic year, and in view of the fact that we have not yet received a definite decision from the New England Company, the officials of this Branch are disposed to agree with him.\n\nDr. Dorey, speaking for the Home Mission Board, is emphatic in expressing the opinion that a survey of the constituency and reserves now served by the school should be undertaken at once, by an experienced educationist, one thoroughly familiar with rural conditions and preferably one familiar with conditions on Indian reserves. He has assured us that the Home Mission Board would be glad to cooperate with us in carrying out this survey.

That my daughter Bumah French was in attendance at the said Mt.Elgin Institute.\n\n2. That during her stay in the said school she often complained of the food served to them, and was always hungry while in the school and often asked me to bring her something to eat.\n\n3. That during her stay in the school she had a very painful toe caused by an ingrown toe nail. She came home from the school at the summer holidays, but I thought she was given attention at the school and when the holidays were over, she went back to the school hoping to have the toe attended to. The year passed and when she came home at the next summer holidays, her toe was in a worse condition than the year before. I then took her to another Doctor who said she would have to rest before the toe could be operated on. Before this could be done the school authorities sent the Police to my house and insisted that my daughter return to the school. I did not want her to go because I felt that she would not be cared for; however, they promised to give her more careful treatment.\n\nWhen I went to the school with my said daughter, the principal, Mr. Strepp, was extremely rude to me. My daughter should have been given medical attention before she received the same, and suffered needlessly and longer than she should have. That as I believe that Mr. Strepp has not the interest of the children in mind, I am of the opinion that it would be very much better if he were removed from the school and a more sympathetic person in charge.\n\nSIGNED BEFORE ME at the town of Brothroy in the County of Middlesex, this 8th day of June, 1943.\n\nCharlotte French.\n\nA Commissioner etc.\n\nIndian Affairs.

That the food was of such a poor quality that she could not eat the same, and was always complaining of being hungry. The oatmeal and soya beans were not properly cooked, and the milk they had was often turning sour, and she was always begging me to bring bread or other food for her to eat.\n\n3. That while she was at the said School she got athlete's foot which she did not have before going to the said school, and which I have been unable to cure since she has come home.\n\n4. That the children were very severely strapped for very trifling offences, and my said daughter says that she has often seen other girls with swollen wrists after such a strapping.\n\n5. That the clothing supplied to my said daughter was not sufficient to keep her warm in cold weather, and that she was compelled to loan the good clothing which I had purchased for her for special occasions, to other students in the school, and it was often returned much the worse of wear after being loaned.\n\n6. That I believe it would be in the best interests of the pupils in the school if the principal Mr. Strapp were removed from the said Institution and another principal appointed, who would be interested in the welfare of the children in the school, as I feel Mr. Strapp has no interest in them.\n\nJUDGMENT BEFORE ME :\nAT THE TOWN OF STRATHROY :\nin the county of Middlesex,\nthis 7th day of June, 1948.\n\nMrs. Annie Deleary\n\nA Commissioner etc.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPROVINCE OF ONTARIO\nCOUNTY OF MIDDLESEX\n\nIN THE MATTER OF MT.ELGIN INSTITUTE\nAT THE MUNGEY INDIAN RESERVE\n\nTO WIT:\n\nI, Jessie Seneca, of the town of Strathroy in the County of Middlesex, married woman, (formerly of the Munsey Reserve)\n\nMAKE OATH AND SAY:\n\n1. That I am the mother of Lorraine Tooshkig who was formerly a student at the Mt.Elgin Institute, and she has informed me that the following conditions exist at the said School which is under the principalship of Mr.Strapp.\n\n2. That Mr.Strapp has two storerooms for food; one for himself and staff, and the other for the children of the school. Often the food is poor, the bread being stale and often mouldy, and the cereals, oatmeal and cornmeal often wormy, and the milk often sour. That my said daughter took her turn in the work of the kitchen and has seen these conditions, of which she has informed me. That my daughter was hungry all the time, because the food was so unpalatable.\n\n3. That when Miss Smith was at the Institution, who saw that the food was wholesome that was furnished to the children, when she was on kitchen duty.\n\n4. That when Mr.Strapp would punish the girls he would raise their skirts when whipping them. And that my said daughter Lorraine has a scar on her wrist which she received when punished by the said Strapp. And that after the girls had retired Mr.Strapp would go to their bedrooms with a flashlight and flash the light in the girls faces.\n\n5. That I understand there was a Miss Prentice teaching in the school who was very kind to the students, and for this reason she was dismissed by Mr.Strapp. And that I believe the school would be much more efficiently conducted if Mr.Strapp was removed from the principalship of the said Institute.\n\nAfter being read over and explained to the said Jessie Seneca, who seemed to understand the same perfectly, and who made her mark in my presence, she was sworn before me\n\nAt the town of Strathroy\nin the County of Middlesex;\nthis 20th day of May,\n1943.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI, Annie Waddilove, of the Muncey Reserve in the County of Middlesex, married woman,\n\nMAKE OATH AND SAY:\n\n1.

That the said Mildred Fisher complained of always being hungry as they never got sufficient to eat, and that the food was cooked so poorly that they could hardly eat what was often put before them, especially the oatmeal and soya beans. And that if they complained about the food they were strapped by the principal, Mr. Strapp.\n\n3. That the milk given the children to drink was often turning sour.\n\n4. That Mildred Fisher informs me that at one time he went to the toilet on the lower floor, and the one on the upper floor was not in working condition, and had to pass through a dormitory occupied by the girls, and that she saw one of the boy students of the school in this dormitory sitting on the side of the bed of one of the girls.\n\n5. That the said Mildred Fisher further informs me that she had to assist other girls in the school in making home brew, which was made in the kitchen of the said school, and the alcohol was taken from the school clinic.\n\n6. That the said Mildred Fisher informs me that the girls are severely whipped or strapped for very trivial offences, and they are warned by him that they must not talk about the conditions at the school when visiting their homes.\n\n7. That the said Mildred Fisher was lousy on several occasions while in the school, and she has athlete's foot which she got at the school and which I have been unable to cure since she came home.\n\n8. That I consider it would be in the best interests of the children who are in attendance at the Mt.

That when Alberta asked for a pair of running shoes which she needed very badly, and went up to a teacher, Miss Burnfield, in the said Institute, to get the running shoes, several other students went with Alberta, who got the shoes, and Miss Burnfield asked why all the girls came up. She was very cross, and Alberta had to leave her room, and as she did so, Miss Burnfield hit her with a clenched fist, leaving a black mark on the child's back.\n\n3. That Alberta informs me that the food is not palatable. The milk is often sour, and lately there has not been any variety in the vegetables.\n\n4. That when my husband and I visited Alberta at the said school, she informed me that afterwards she was called to the office of the principal, Mr.Strapp, who questioned her as to what she told her parents, and what they said to her.\n\n5.

I think that your suggestion of having the educationist set apart for the task accompanied by Mr. Arneil is a particularly good one. We shall be glad to have someone representing us go with these gentlemen. You will appreciate the fact that we all have certain duties to look after, but I can assure you that either one of the Secretaries or Mr. Joblin, our missionary on the Caradoc Reserve, will do this work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.D.MIT\nOttawa, July 25, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 16, in which you submit, on behalf of the Court of the New England Company, certain proposals with respect to the operation of the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nThese proposals appear on the whole to be reasonably satisfactory for the educational program we have in mind, and it would be appreciated if you could have a draft lease prepared and submitted to us for detailed examination.\n\nAs I intimated to you in my letter dated December 23, 1942, it is our intention to provide at the Mohawk Institute educational facilities for a group of non-Catholic pupils recruited from the Caradoc, Six Nations and New Credit Indian reserves. It is my understanding that we would, under the terms of the new agreement, be in a position to proceed with the employment of a fully qualified principal to take charge of the school, that the religious instruction for the Anglican pupils enrolled at the institution would be provided by a Church of England clergyman appointed by you for this purpose and that the salary of this clergyman would be borne by the New England Company. I note with interest that you would be willing to consider any scheme for giving small grants to deserving Indian pupils who might from time to time desire to proceed with high school studies. It has occurred to me that such scholarships, if made available by you, might very well be administered by the clergyman in charge of the Mohawk Chapel, the Indian Superintendent at the Six Nations Reserve and an educationist selected by and acceptable to both these gentlemen.\n\nArthur Cochrane, Esq.,\nGovernor,\nNew England Company,\n28 Bloomsbury Square,\nLondon, W.C., England.\nMay I suggest that consideration be given by your company to the desirability of including in the new lease a clause by which the lease could be terminated by either party after a period of six months' notice. I notice that there was no such clause in the lease that recently expired. In view of the location of the Mohawk Institute, however, which is, as you know, inside the boundaries of the city of Brantford, it seems to me desirable that a clause such as this should be included.\n\nIn your communication you refer to a nominal rent, on the understanding that this Department would become responsible for the purchase of equipment, maintenance, repairs, insurance, etc. I am taking it for granted that this nominal rent will not exceed the amount paid under the terms of the old lease.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nMemorandum to:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill\n\nRe Mohawk Institute\nYour file 540414\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 2nd instant, the Minister has now signed the draft letter which you prepared to Mr. Arthur Cochrane, Governor of the New England Company, and this is being forwarded.\n\nIt is still necessary to reach a decision as to whether the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School will be closed. The Deputy Minister would like to have a talk with you and Mr. Hoey just as soon as the latter returns from his holidays.\n\nYour file returned herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, July 26, 1943.\nOttawa, August 5, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nWe have, at the Caradoc Agency, Muncey, Ontario, a residential school, known as the Mount Elgin Institute. This school was established on the reserve about a century ago. Recent reports from our officials indicate that the building is at present in a somewhat dilapidated and insanitary condition. Despite this fact, however, it is not generally thought that we will be able to secure the funds for a new building at any time during the years immediately ahead of us. The suggestion has been made that it might be possible to close this school by making greater provision for the education of children at Indian day schools in the agency and that a number of orphan children now enrolled at the institution might be provided with accommodation at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ontario.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute is operated by the Department in co-operation with the United Church of Canada. The representatives of this Church feel that before a final decision is reached in respect to the residential school, a thorough survey of the constituency served by it should be made by a competent educationist. I have been wondering if it would be possible to secure the services of one of your public school inspectors for this task. It is our intention that the inspector undertaking the survey be accompanied by our inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario, Mr. W. S. Arneil, and by a representative of the United Church of Canada, probably a clergyman. I am disposed to think that the survey would require about two weeks of an inspector's time, and I would like it undertaken, if at all possible, early in September.\n\nI am of the opinion that any of your inspectors familiar with conditions in southwestern Ontario would be suitable for the work I have in mind. I note that Inspectors Smith, Young and Webster report on the work of our schools in this section of the province from time to time. It might be advisable, however, to select an inspector other than the man actually responsible for the inspection of the Institute.\n\nIt is my present intention to visit Toronto on Saturday August 26. Would it be possible to have an interview with you on the morning of that date, say 10 o'clock? We could discuss the matter more fully at that time and perhaps reach a decision with respect to the inspector that might undertake the work.\n\nI naturally hesitate to encroach on your time knowing how busily engaged you must be at this season of the year. If, however, you can grant me this interview, such action on your part will be deeply appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nV. K.

Greer, Chief Inspector of Public and Separate Schools, for the province of Ontario, to select an educationist, preferably a school inspector familiar with conditions in southwestern Ontario, to undertake an educational survey of the constituency now served by the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nI have intimated to Mr. Greer that it was my intention to visit Toronto on Saturday August 28 and that I would be glad to see him on the morning of that date at 10 o'clock. It is my hope that Mr. Greer may be in a position to let me have the name of the man selected by him at that time.\n\nMr. Arneil, who is at present engaged in an inspection of a number of agencies as far west as Port Arthur, will return to Toronto at that time and, in all probability, will accompany me to Mr. Greer's office. I would like to have an interview with you immediately following my talk with Mr. Greer. I have already completed arrangements whereby Mr. Arneil will accompany the man selected on this survey and it is my hope that you will be able to have a man representing the United Church take part in the survey. Mr. Arneil informs me that he will use his car and by so doing provide transportation for the other two members of the group. I am disposed to think that these men ought to be able to undertake and complete this work in about two weeks. I have no desire, of course, to hurry them in any way.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Dr. Dorey appears to be definitely of the opinion that it will not be possible or practical to close this school at the end of the present academic year, and in view of the fact that we have not yet received a definite decision from the New England Company, the officials of this Branch are disposed to agree with him.\n\nDr. Dorey, speaking for the Home Mission Board, is emphatic in expressing the opinion that a survey of the constituency and reserves now served by the school should be undertaken at once by an experienced successor to one thoroughly familiar with rural conditions and preferably one familiar with conditions on Indian reserves. He has assured us that the Home Mission Board would be glad to cooperate with us in carrying out this survey. Dr. Dorey is also of the opinion that in view of the fact that the Department, over a period of years, has allowed each of the churches to enroll at residential schools a certain number of pupils, it would not be fair to the churches of the United Church to close this school unless a corresponding reduction were made in the enrolment of pupils at schools operated by other church bodies. I have just learned that we have now received an acknowledgment of the Minister's letter from the New England Company. In this letter the Treasurer of the Company states:\n\n\"We are going very fully into the various points you mention regarding the institution and as soon as the Court has arrived at any decision on the matter I will communicate with you again\".\n\nI would appreciate an opportunity to discuss this matter with you personally, at an early date.\n\nH. W. McGill,\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 408-1, part 3)\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nWelfare & Training Service,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have sent a separate letter to your Minister about the general question of the future of the Mohawk Institute.\n\nIn this letter I am dealing with the question of the pensions to Miss Hardie and Mr. Snell which you raised in your letter to the Treasurer of December 24th, 1942.\n\nThe Court of the Company have considered the matter in the light of legal advice and a letter from the Charity Commissioners. They are advised that they are justified in continuing Miss Hardie's pension. They will be willing, therefore, to continue her existing pension of \u00a3150 per year for her lifetime.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Snell, however, the Company are advised that as he was appointed by the Canadian Government without reference to the Company, they would not be entitled to grant any pension to him. I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to concur in this part of your proposal.\n\nI should add that the proposal to pay Miss Hardie's pension is subject to the Department of Mines & Resources accepting the alternative propositions in regard to the future of the Mohawk Institute which I have set out in my letter to your Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) ARTHUR COCHRANE.\nGovernor\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\nThe Minister of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Minister:\n\nI fear that it has taken some time to reply to your letter of December 23rd 1942 about the future of the Mohawk Institute, but it was necessary for the New England Company to take legal advice, and to ascertain the views of the Charity Commission as to how far the proposition in your letter was consistent with the Company's Charter.\n\nThe Court of the Company are advised that they are not at liberty under their Charter to transfer the freehold of the Institute to your Department as you propose without consultation. On the other hand the Company would very wish to facilitate the general scheme which you have proposed. The Company must, however, stipulate that the teachings of the Church of England should continue to be available for those pupils whose parents desire it.\n\nWith the purpose in view of continuing the objects of the Company within the terms of their Charter the Company wish to suggest to you the following alternative arrangement:\n\nThe Company would be willing to grant a Lease of the Mohawk Institute, apart from the Mohawk Chapel, for a nominal rent, for a term of 21 years, your Department being responsible for maintenance and repairs and for the insurance of the property. The Company would retain the freehold of the Chapel and would be responsible for its upkeep.\n\nIn the altered circumstances the Company would not propose to maintain their annual grant of \u00a31000 beyond the end of the current year, but they would pay a salary to a Church of England clergyman nominated by the Bishop of the Diocese and appointed by the Company, to give religious instruction in the School and to serve the Chapel. The Company would wish to consider any scheme for giving small grants to deserving Indian pupils to enable them to continue their education on leaving the school.\n\nThe Company hope that these proposals will\n\np.t.o.\nbe acceptable to you and would be much obliged if you would cable giving your views in principle on their suggestions. If you concur generally the Company would then have a draft Lease prepared and sent to you for detailed examination.\n\nI am dealing in a separate letter with the question of the pensions for Miss Hardie and Mr. Snell, which was raised in a letter to the Treasurer of the Company from Mr. Phelan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) ARTHUR COCHRANE,\nGovernor,\nNEW ENGLAND COMPANY.\nOttawa, June 12, 1943.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 10, in which you seek additional information with respect to the marginally-noted subject.\n\nI am anxious to avoid in this correspondence, if I can, a discussion of government policy. Such discussion should really be carried on by the Minister or by the Deputy acting on his behalf. I am convinced that I should confine my attention to the task of supplying information and to an interpretation of the educational policy followed by the Department, particularly in recent years.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Back Settlement School, in the Caradoc Agency, was totally destroyed by fire on April 30, 1942. Immediately following this fire, the Anglican Bishop placed the nearest Anglican Church at our disposal, without cost, for educational purposes. A school has been conducted in the basement of the church during the present academic year. It has at this date a small enrolment of 20 with an average attendance of 14. In my last letter to you I referred to the closing of the Muncey School, which had at the time it was closed an average attendance of approximately 5.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, a report of this Branch for the fiscal year 1942. The figures for the fiscal year 1942 have not been completed by the Treasury Branch but will be released in the course of a few days. I shall be glad to have Mr. Phelan prepare for you a statement somewhat similar to the statement prepared by him last year.\n\nI have never pretended at any time to pass judgment on the general condition of the Mt. Elgin Institute. I did state quite frankly, however, after my last visit, that in my judgment the building was in an insanitary condition. It has, however, been condemned by our own architects in recent years. These men point out that the buildings themselves are on a mound and consequently subject to erosion. When Mr. Dudley erected supports to protect the table of the chapel from possible collapse, he did so on the specific understanding that he should not be held responsible, did the building collapse at any time in the immediate future. It has always appeared to me that the building is somewhat deceptive in that the outside appearance is not shown by unrestricted use. I think it is only fair to you to add that a number of the agents at the recent convention held in Toronto stated quite emphatically that, in view of the insanitary condition of the building, they were not prepared to encourage Indian pupils to attend the institution.\n\nI note that the Mohawk Institute was reconstructed at a cost of approximately $50,000.00 in the years 1922-23 and 1923-24. In addition to this, the grant of $5,000.00 a\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nyear contributed to the Department for the operation of this school has been spent from year to year on general maintenance and repairs. It should be borne in mind that children for the Mohawk Institute should be drawn from Tyendinaga, Gibson, Caughnawaga, Sarnia, Moraviantown, Walpole Island and a number of outlying reserves. The pupils in attendance at this school from the Six Nations Reserve are, with only two exceptions, orphans or children of deceased parents. In this connection I should point out that two years ago we made an arrangement whereby high school studies are provided at two or three of the Indian day schools on the Six Nations Reserve. In addition to this, we have an arrangement with the Brantford Collegiate Board, whereby the students who complete the Grade 12 course on the reserve with a creditable standing proceed with Grades 10, 11 and 12 at the Brantford Collegiate Institute. In my judgment, it would be very unwise and - if I may say so - pedagogically unsound to modify this program in any sense until it has been given a few years' trial. What we had in mind was Gradara, a continuation school to which we could send pupils for training in agriculture, home economics, auto mechanics, handicrafts, etc. These children might remain at the Indian day schools until they were 12 or 13 years old and then proceed to the continuation school. You will be interested to know that the number of pupils proceeding with high school studies at the Six Nations Reserve is equal to the number of white pupils proceeding with these studies in the adjoining communities.\n\nYou appear to have misunderstood my reference to the Shubenacadie, Mohawk Institute and Lytton Schools as being departmentally operated. I can only repeat that statement, not as an expression of opinion but as a statement of fact. The Mohawk Institute and the school at Lytton are actually leased by this Department, on the understanding that they will be operated by the Roman Catholic Church for the education and civilization of Indian children. They are leased on the understanding that a fully ordained Anglican clergyman will be employed as principal. The three schools, of course, are operated by the Department in conformity with subsection 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. This subsection reads: \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\" You state that you are sorry that there are no Protestant Indian children in the Shubenacadie Reserve. Schools that you might test out the question of departmentally operated institutions. I simply cannot grasp the meaning of this reference.\n\nI was intentionally conservative when giving the expenditures involved in the operation of the Mount Elgin Institute. I simply submitted figures showing the actual disbursements. I did not include depreciation on buildings, farm machinery, etc., nor did I include inspection fees or the cost of school supplies, desks, text books, maps, etc., which are supplied from year to year from a distinct and separate appropriation fund which are not included in the regular auditor's reports.\n\nI should like you to read again the last paragraph of the memorandum sent forward by me with my letter of May 31. What I was anxious to point out there was the wide discrepancy between welfare expenditures and the annual expenditures at the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nI shall be glad to send on the financial statement just as soon as we can secure the figures from the Treasury officials.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nOttawa, May 31, 1943.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 28th and to thank you for the candid expression of opinion contained therein. I was particularly gratified to note your anxiousness to co-operate with the Department in having a thorough survey undertaken at the Caradoc agency with the object of working out an educational program designed to meet the needs of the Indian population.\n\nIn view of the fact that you are likely to discuss this matter with the members of your executive, I am attaching hereto a memorandum on the subject which, I trust, you will find helpful. I do not mind submitting to you that the consideration of the Mount Elgin Institute has given me great many anxious hours of late. We have had two memoranda from the Minister's office within the last year, in both of which the opinion was expressed that the institution should be closed. You can easily imagine then the position I would be in, in the case of truancy or in case of fire or the collapse of the classroom building.\n\nI feel sure that you will recall to mind a discussion we had at the time of your visit on January 12th. At that time we discussed the desirability of operating the Mohawk Institute as a departmental institution, and suggested at the time that the principal of the Alert Bay School might be a good man for the principalship. This discussion took place before the Minister wrote his letter to the New England Company.\n\nI do not suppose that the actual date of the closing should prove to be a serious matter. The Government, having enunciated its policy, is not likely to be unreasonable either with respect to the closing date or the re-employment of the staff. However, these are all matters that might be discussed by you with the Director or with the Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n289 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR DOREY\n\nRe: Operation Mt. Elgin Institute\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute has at this date an authorized enrolment of 150 pupils, for which per capita grant at the rate of $2.00 is allowed. The actual enrolment last winter was 128 pupils, but 23 of these are senior girls who have exceeded the age limit. The pupils are drawn from the following reserves: Walpole Island 5; Sarnia 9; Kettle Point 17; Oneida 1; Muncey 1; Caradoc 52; Cape Croker 13; Hagersville 1 (New Credit); Moravian 2; Saugesen 4; Christian Island 7; Six Nations 9; Gibson (Parry Sound) 3; Caughnawaga 1.\n\nThe departmental records indicate that there is ample accommodation at the day schools on the reserves from which pupils are recruited and that the closing down of the Mt. Elgin Institute would cause little inconvenience in the reserves although transportation in one or two cases would no doubt have to be provided. It is interesting to note that a day school was closed at the Caradoc agency during the present academic year for the reason that the number of pupils available did not justify its operation. The teacher of this school was later transferred to the agency office where she now serves as clerk. It will be noted that 17 pupils are recruited from the Kettle Point agency and yet the attendance at this school has become so unsatisfactory and the number of pupils of school age reduced to such an extent that they are not considering the advisability of closing the school. These are facts that confront us, apart altogether from the insanitary condition of the building. From a sanitary standpoint the building has been condemned by the Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, the Inspector for Ontario and a number of Indian agents at the annual conference of Indian Affairs. The Rt. Rev. W. F. in the district has not advocated the closing of the building but have expressed the view that the institution, in their judgment, is no longer necessary.\n\nThe educational set-up suggested in my letter to you of May 26th is exactly the same set-up as we have now in operation at the Ste. Catherine (R.C.) School in the Cowichan Agency. This school was built in the year 1929-30. The set-up is exactly the same as the one approved by the Government for Eskasoni and for Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. A clergyman with pedagogical training will be in charge of these schools.\n\nThe Mohawk Institute, the St. George's School at Lytton and the Shubenacadie Residential School (R.C.) are, and always have been, departmentally operated institutions. The St. George's School and the Mohawk Institute have never been operated at any time by the Anglican Church or by the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Church of England. Should the Mohawk Institute be operated jointly, there would be no change whatever in the status of the school. The New England Company, in making their grant, request that a regularly ordained Anglican clergyman be employed as principal.\n\nThere is of course a financial side to this question. I have no desire to emphasize this side unduly.\nBOARD OF HOME MISSIONS\nThe United Church of Canada\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario\n\nJune 10th, 1943.\n\nAttention of Mr. F. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Operation Mount Elgin Institute\nYour File 7-0-1\n\nFollowing receipt of your last letter and memorandum, we have had the opportunity of thinking more about this, and also of having a conversation with Mr. Strapp, the Principal; and as our Executive will not meet until June 21st, I thought I should write regarding certain matters which I think need a little further clarification.\n\nMay I say that it is our information that, whilst one school was closed on the Reserve, another room was opened in the basement of a church, and that this is in operation. Perhaps you would clarify that for us. Our information is that there are just as many children attending school on the Reserve as there were. In that connection, may I point out something of which you are already aware - that the policy of withholding from the public the information concerning school enrolment and a great many other details which were available some years ago is altogether too deleterious. We hope that someone will be found to get this information available for free distribution. At the same time, I would like to make it quite clear that I have never yet asked for any information from your Department without its being forthcoming immediately - and sometimes, I am sure, at great trouble to those who work in your Department. I do not know to whom we should make representation, but there is altogether too little information available in detailed form.\n\nI went over the Mount Elgin building a week ago, and whilst it is not in good repair as has already admitted, it is no different in construction from what it was fifty years ago and the fire hazards which now obtain have been the same all through these years. In that connection, may I ask if it is to be assumed that the Mohawk Institute - which dates from approximately the same period - is to be considered so much superior to Mount Elgin that it is going to be continued? I have the advantage of having visited both - I have never seen the Mohawk Institute and would not presume to pass any judgment on it - but we should like to be sure that the basis on which the proposal is made that all the children go to the Mohawk Institute - which is that the building there is much better - is actually based on fact.\n\nThe difficulty at Mount Elgin is very largely with the basement. There is no question that the boys' playroom was wet and dirty when I was there a week ago. The\nwater seeps in from the side walls, and the result is very bad. There is no doubt about that! But, in the meantime, I think that the situation could be remedied if one were to go to the expense of digging a trench all around the building down to the floor level of the basement\u2014which, by the way, would be some three or four feet above the bottom of the foundation; clean off the walls, coat it with cement paint (or with asphalt), and then put waterproof tile all around it. I think that would eliminate all the wetness in the basement; but, not being a builder, I can only venture the opinion of an amateur.\n\nAs I have already stated, we are ready to assist in a survey of the Reserve; but may I say that there must also be a survey of the Six Nations Reserve. From what little knowledge I have, I believe it would be appropriate to arrange that the place where there is the greatest need of a residential school is the Six Nations Reserve; and, conversely, the place where a continuation school is most likely to be successful, on the basis suggested in your letter, is precisely the same point. From the little information I have been able to gather, I think that it is extremely unlikely that it would be possible to get a sufficient number of children of the secondary school grade to make worthwhile the operation of a school of this kind on the Caledon Reserve, unless it were fitted up to provide accommodation for pupils from outside Reserves. This brings me to a suggestion which I have been making for a number of years\u2014seemingly without effect. It is that some competent educationist be asked to make a survey of the educational needs of all the Indians of Canada. Let him start, if you will, in Ontario; and then after he has done that, let him sit down for a day or two with representatives of the Department and of the Church and see whether a satisfactory solution cannot be arrived at.\n\nThe more I think of your proposition to place all the children of school age who need residential school care in one institution\u2014and that one under the direction of the Church of England\u2014the less I like it. We have already had experience in a number of cases of children of United Church parents being sent to Anglican schools. Whilst I have no fault to find with the religious and moral instruction which they are given, yet the fact remains that when they come back to the Reserve they consider themselves members of the Church of England, and when our missionary tries to interest them in church work, they reply that they are members of the Church of England\u2014and very often that they are members of the Methodist Church and indifferent. That difficulty has arisen in a number of cases\u2014and that, in spite of the finest co-operation between the two Churches where the local school is situated. I have no doubt that the Church of England missionaries on Reserves where the children attend United Church schools find that the same situation obtains.\n\nI know that you will think that I am raising a great many objections; but this is a pretty serious step to take and I want, so far as it is possible, to see how each step in the process will work out.\n\nI was quite interested in your description of the Mohawk Institute, the School at Lytton, and the\n\np.t.o.\nBOARD OF HOME MISSIONS\nThe United Church of Canada\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ontario,\n\nMay 27th, 1943.\n\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute\nYour File 7 - O - I\n\nI have your letter of May 26th, and, after giving it some consideration, I am writing to let you have my own personal reaction. Naturally, such a drastic proposal as you outline will have to receive the consideration of the Executive of our Board. I do not remember that you had spoken to me about the approach which had been made to the New York Committee with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute, but we did discuss the problem of education on the Caradoc Reserve. I shall be quite frank in my reaction.\n\nIn the first place, I do not think you intend the suggestion that the School at Muncey be closed on June 30th, 1943, to be taken seriously. To ask the Board of Home Missions to consent to this after the School has been in operation for these many years, when a notice is sent to us on May 26th - that is, less than one month and four days' notice - is a good deal more than I think you think we are likely to consider as within the realm of practical politics.\n\nI also note that your proposition involves closing the School now and leaving all these children who are at present in the School without any educational facilities, and to next year a secondary or continuation school and a teacher's residence would be built. I do not think that is feasible - and I do not think you do either.\n\nI should also like to draw your attention to the fact that the suggestion that the Mohawk Institute be operated on a departmental basis is so complete and radical a departure from the system which has hitherto obtained in the operation of our schools, that I do not think it can be carried out without taking into account certain factors which involve the Churches. I do not know what the attitude of The Church of England would be. I note, however, that it is proposed to set up this institution as a residential school for non-Catholics. May I ask if it is seriously proposed that the non-Catholics in Ontario would be treated in any way and the Catholics and all the rest of the Dominion would be treated in another way? I do not think this is possible. Nor do I think that the Catholic Church would look with any favor on the setting up of a residential school of the size of the Mohawk Institute, to be operated on a purely secular basis. I am not very strong on sectarianism, but I do feel that the religious side of the work of the Indian schools must be considered. However, the relation you have with the Mohawk Institute and with The Church of England is not my business.\n\nI come next to a very serious feature of the proposition. According to the last Census, there are 5533\nIndians in Ontario who are counted United Church. There are 9747 Church of England, and 9862 Roman Catholics. Your proposal, if it were carried through, would mean, so far as the United Church is concerned, that we would have to close a single residential school in Ontario to which our children could be sent; but it would leave all the Roman Catholic schools, with a total pupilage of 705, in full operation.\n\nIt would leave The Church of England schools, with a pupilage of 520 (I have eliminated the Mohawk Institute), also running. I do not think that this will commend itself to the judgment of the United Church.\n\nFurther - and in this I am only expressing my opinion - I do not know what the official attitude of the Executive of our Board would be. It seems quite improbable that an Executive would look with equanimity on a proposal that would deprive the United Church of another residential school. I beg to point out that we gave up Coqualeetza. Ahousaht has been closed - Kitamaat has been closed - and whilst these latter two were not very large, yet the total pupilage of the residential schools of the United Church is a good deal less than it was some years ago. We shall await with a good deal of interest - and I was going to say expectation, although that is the wrong word - to hear of one single, solitary Roman Catholic School having been closed. We might as well face the fact that when the school was closed at Coqualeetza, and each year school at Ahousaht, the Indian people whose children had been going to these schools, were approached by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, with a proposal that their children attend one of the Catholic schools. I know perfectly well that the theory that Catholic children ought to go to Catholic schools, and Protestant children to Protestant schools; but there is absolutely nothing which says that a man may not change his church affiliation in order to get his children enrolled in the school which seems to him, for the time being at least, to offer the greater advantage. This has been done. You and I are powerless to do very much about it, because we believe in freedom. But I think these matters must be faced.\n\nHaving said all this, I fully realize that the Mount Elgin School is in a deplorable condition and that it has long outlived its usefulness; but I have always been to the plainsmen to appeal to the Executive of our Board to urge the expenditure of $200,000.00 of Government money to replace this old building. I realize that the situation at Mount Elgin is in a bad way, and, personally, I am quite prepared to co-operate with the Department in making the survey suggested; but we might as well face the fact that, so far as the Indians concerned, they are not going to be pushed around too far nor too fast in connection with these residential schools; and we shall expect the same policy to be followed on Reserves where the people are Roman Catholic as you are suggesting in the case of this Reserve, which is predominantly Protestant.\n\nFinally, may I say that it does not seem to us to be fair - and I do not think we can get away with it - to notify Mr. Strapp on the 27th May that his ten years' principalship is coming to an end, without saying why the proposal to close the school would mean; because I do not think that either you or I can envisage Mr. Strapp as an educationist, doing the work which you suggest should be done on this particular Reserve. Some men have some gifts,\n\np.t.o.\nOttawa, May 26, 1943.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nThe Director is in receipt of a memorandum from the Deputy Minister, dated May 22, 1943, in which Dr. Camsell discusses the subject matter of certain reports that have been sent forward to him on conditions at the Mount Elgin Institute. Dr. Camsell, in his memorandum, states: \"It would seem quite clear that we are not justified in permitting the Mount Elgin Institute to be operated after the end of the present school year, not so much because of recent happenings, but because of the unsatisfactory condition of the school building\".\n\nYou may remember that during the course of one of our discussions I intimated to you that we were communicating with the New England Company with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute. A few weeks ago the Minister wrote to the Secretary of the Company and in that letter offered to take over the property at Brantford and operate the school there as a departmental institution for the care and education of non-Catholic children in western Ontario. The Minister has not yet had a reply to this letter, but it is altogether likely that a reply will be received at an early date. My personal opinion is that the Mount Elgin Institute might very well be closed at the end of the present academic year, on the understanding that a secondary or continuation school and a teacher's residence would be built next year. At this school a course should be provided of a vocational character and a certain amount of training provided on the school farm, which, in my judgment, should be retained. The Principal of the School should be a United Church clergyman with special pedagogical training. In addition to being principal of the school, he should be Superintendent of the other Indian day schools in the Caradoc Agency. It is just possible that transportation would have to be provided along lines somewhat similar to the transportation now provided at the consolidated day school in the Cowichan agency. This is a matter which, I\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nfeel sure, you will want to discuss with the Home Mission Board and with the Minister, personally. I am writing to you at this time, however, in the hope that the Mission Board or you personally will see your way clear to have a representative of your Church make a survey of conditions at the Caradoc Agency and submit a report on the program that might be carried forward at the agency. It might be possible for us to make arrangements whereby the public school inspector for the district might assist in this survey.\n\nI can appreciate very fully that the members of the Home Mission Board may not be favourably disposed to the closing of the residential school at Muncey. However, I am personally disposed to think that some such action as this will have to be taken, either now or in the immediate future. The present building is in an insanitary and dilapidated condition and the classroom building is apt to collapse at any time. I have been assured that it would cost at least $200,000.00 to build a fully fireproof residential school at this agency. I feel you will agree with me when I state that it will be exceedingly difficult for me to recommend such an expenditure, if funds were available, in view of the more urgent needs at Alberni, File Hills and Round Lake. However, this is a matter that we want to adjust in the closest possible co-operation with you and the members of your Board.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

What has happened at this school confirms the wisdom of the decision reached some time ago that the institution should be closed. (See my memorandum of December 17th last).\n\nIt is to be regretted that we have not yet heard from the New England Company about the Mohawk Institute at Brantford. However, regardless of what use we may be able to make of that institution in the future it would seem quite clear that we are not justified in permitting the Mount Elgin Institution to be operated after the end of the present school year, not so much because of the recent happenings but because of the unsatisfactory condition of the buildings.\n\nIt is assumed that Mr. Hoey will keep closely in touch with Doctor Dorey and that he will discuss the matter with him again after the problem has been considered by his Home Mission Board.\n\nCharles Camsell,\nDeputy Minister.\n\nOttawa, May 22, 1943.\nEnrolment at Mount Elgin Residential School\n\nJune Quarter Return, 1943.\n\n| Agency                  | Enrolment |\n|-------------------------|-----------|\n| Caradoc Agency          | 55        |\n| Cape Croker Agency      | 12        |\n| Christian Island Agency | 7         |\n| Caughnawaga             | 1         |\n| New Credit              | 1         |\n| Moraviantown            | 2         |\n| Saugeen                 | 4         |\n| Sarnia                  | 23        |\n| Six Nations             | 11        |\n| Parry Sound             | 3         |\n| Walpole Island          | 5         |\nOttawa, August 23, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is anxious that you should undertake an educational survey of a number of Indian agencies from which pupils have been recruited in recent years for enrolment at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, Ontario.

We are attaching also copies of recent correspondence relating to the operation of the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nIt is our intention that you should investigate and report upon the educational facilities available for the instruction of Indian children on the reserves visited by you and the adequacy of these schools to provide a worthwhile educational course and one designed to meet the peculiar needs of Indian pupils.\n\nWe are anxious that you should report also on the number of Indian pupils on each reserve for whom, in your judgment, institutional care or residential school accommodation should be provided. We have in mind orphan children and children from disrupted homes.\n\nYou will note from the attached correspondence that a decision was reached by the Government a few months ago to close the Mount Elgin Institute at the end of the academic year 1943. In view of the representations made to the Department by representatives of the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada, it has been decided to continue the operation of this school during the present academic year. In view of this decision, we feel that a very thorough survey of the educational facilities at the Caradoc Agency should be undertaken and a definite recommendation made with respect to the future of the Mount Elgin Institute. If you are of the opinion that this school should be closed in the immediate future, what type of school should, in your judgment, be substituted? It would be appreciated also if you would report\nfully upon the adequacy or inadequacy of the accommodation available at the Mohawk Institute, Brantford, Ont., for non-Catholic orphan children and neglected children might be recruited from reserves in western Ontario, for whom educational facilities should be provided by Government.\n\nThe Minister of the Department is of the opinion that the educational courses provided for Indian pupils should become increasingly more practical and vocational in character. No doubt, you will keep this expressed opinion of the Minister in mind as you proceed with your survey. We should also add that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with an extensive building program in the immediate post-war period. This program will be undertaken to provide employment for men released from military service. As a department, we have been asked to provide a list of the school buildings, particularly Indian day school buildings, that in our judgment may be needed during the five year period immediately following the close of the war.\n\nYou will note in the correspondence a suggestion that the Caradoc Agency be organized as an educational unit with a full-time fully qualified superintendent in charge. You might express your opinion on this suggestion and its practical value from the standpoint of providing a more efficient educational set-up at the agency.\n\nWhere consolidated Indian day schools have been established in the Dominion, transportation facilities, usually motor buses, have been provided. It is just possible that you may deem it necessary to recommend that provision be made for somewhat similar facilities at a number of the reserves, particularly at the Caradoc agency.\n\nWhile these terms of reference are submitted for your guidance and in the hope that they will prove helpful, we want you to feel perfectly free to submit any recommendations or make any suggestions which in your judgment would strengthen and improve the educational facilities on the reserves visited by you.\n\nYou will -\nYou will be accompanied during the course of this survey by Mr. W.

I have also an appointment with Mr. W. S. Arnell, our Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, on that day.

E. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario, will begin a survey of the reserves from which pupils have been recruited for the Mount Elgin Institute in recent years. Mr. Young and Mr. Arneil will undertake first of all, a survey of the Caradoc agency, which is likely to take several days. After they complete this survey at Caradoc, it is altogether likely that they will proceed to the Six Nations reserve at Brantford.\n\nDr. Dorey informs me that he has made arrangements with you, whereby you will accompany Mr. Arneil and Inspector Young on this survey. Transportation will be provided by Mr. Arneil. It is my hope that the date suggested will prove convenient for you.

Mr. Young is reasonably familiar with the district and has on more than one occasion made an inspection of our school at Muncey and the day schools at the adjoining agencies. He informed us that he would find it impossible to undertake a survey at any time earlier than Tuesday, September 14, and it was agreed that the survey would be undertaken by Mr. Young, Mr. Arneil and Mr. Joblin at the Caradoc agency on that date. Mr. Arneil informs me that they will require several days to undertake and complete the survey at Caradoc and that it is altogether likely they will proceed from there to the Six Nations reserve and to an inspection of the Mohawk Institute at Brantford.\n\nMr. Arneil will be proceeding to the Six Nations reserve early next week and I have asked him to get in touch with you on his way through Toronto. I feel confident that both Mr. Young and Mr. Arneil will appreciate an opportunity of meeting you at an early date and I feel sure they would appreciate also having from you an expression of your views on an educational policy that might be adopted by the Department in this particular section of Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

The question in my mind at the present time is to what extent do you expect my report to cover the education of Indian children in Ontario.\n\nIn conversation with Dr. Greer, he expressed an opinion that you merely wished me to make a decision with respect to the Mt. Elgin Institute. Your letter of August 23rd seems to indicate that you expect my report to include other reserves besides the Caradoc agency and this idea seems to have been supported by our conversation in London.\n\nI shall be pleased to have you state more definitely what you really expect. I shall also be pleased to receive the pamphlets which you promised me regarding the education of Indians in Canada. You might also give Mr. Hoey a fairly definite statement of the work which you would like to have me do.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGORDON YOUNG, I.P.S.\nOttawa, September 7, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you seek additional information with respect to the educational survey of a number of agencies in western Ontario.\n\nIn response to your suggestion, I shall be glad to discuss with Mr. Arneil the work I have in mind and the particular agencies which in my judgment you should visit.\n\nThis educational survey centres around the future of the Mount Elgin Institute. The suggestion that such a survey should be undertaken was first made to me by Dr. Dorey, Associate Secretary of the Home Mission Board of the United Church. Dr. Dorey was of the opinion that this survey should be undertaken before a decision was reached to close the Mt. Elgin Institute. It is not my intention that you should undertake a survey of any Indian agencies other than those from which pupils have been recruited for enrolment at the Mount Elgin Institute in recent years. You will note, from a perusal of the correspondence, that I left with you, that the Government is of the opinion that the Mt. Elgin Institute should be closed and, as a matter of fact, a decision to close this school was reached some time ago. It is in operation this year, however, in response to a request received by the Department from the United Church, Dr. Dorey, representing the United Church, was opposed to the immediate closing of the school and was anxious to secure additional information with respect to the provision that should be made for the Indian pupils now receiving instruction at the Mt. Elgin Institute. I am personally of the opinion that it might be well for you to visit the Caradoc, Cape Croker, Barnia and Six Nations\n\nGordon Young, Esq.,\nInspector of Public Schools,\nStrathroy, Ont.\nAgencies. The number of pupils recruited from the other agencies is comparatively small and inasmuch as we are thoroughly familiar with educational facilities at these agencies, it is difficult for me to see how any good purpose would be served by having you visit them at this date. However, it is just possible that the United Church authorities may request you to visit one or two of the outlying agencies, and if they so desire, this Department would raise no serious objection. It was not our intention that you should report on the education of Indian children in the province of Ontario at this time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Mr. Young, although very busy at this particular season of the year, finally consented to undertake the educational survey, beginning at Muncey on Tuesday, September 14. Mr. Young is reasonably familiar with conditions on our reserves and has on more than one occasion inspected the residential school at Muncey and a number of our day schools. I feel confident that the survey will be well worth while and that the recommendations made by Mr. Young in due course will be very helpful.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for the co-operation extended by you to this Department in making these arrangements.

I was of the opinion then that these figures could easily be secured from the Indian agents during the course of your survey. The Principal of the Mohawk Institute, who visited Ottawa a few weeks ago, informed me that it might be necessary to construct an additional classroom at his residential school if the Mount Elgin Institute were closed.

Henry\nPrivate Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 7, in which you seek information with respect to the Mount Elgin Residential School and the treatment extended to pupils who may be enrolled at this institution from time to time.\n\nI may state that the Mount Elgin Institute is one of the oldest residential schools in Canada, having been established about a century ago. This school is operated and administered by the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada. The Principal and members of the staff are the employees of the Church and not of this Department. The Government, however, pays a per capita grant to this school. The school is inspected regularly by the Indian Agent, by the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario and by the Public School Inspectors, who are employees of the Provincial Government. The school is also inspected periodically by the Medical Health Officer and by representatives of this Department.\n\nIf you are anxious to secure specific information with respect to the courses of study provided, dormitory accommodation, food provided for the boys, or other such matters, I suggest that you write either to the Principal, Reverend O.B. Strapp, or to the Reverend George Dorey, Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, 999 Queen Street West, Toronto 2, Ontario. If you write to either of these parties I feel confident you will receive a prompt reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. R.W.

Macdonald\n\nSt. Thomas\n\nOct. 6/34\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI wrote you last January 12th and never received any answer. After writing and then not hearing from you at all, I thought it best to keep quiet and wait (would you be good enough to mail me a copy?) because I knew that I would not disturb you any more.\n\nHowever, my copy of your letter was returned to me after I had sealed it, so I believe you have received it.\n\nForgetting about a month later, I wrote again, but I want to call your attention to my request for an Indian agent's office. You may have heard of the Indians in the province of Saskatchewan who make beautiful work. It was very interesting to see children's dresses, bonnets, mittens, cloth bags, and patchwork. They made use of every bit of material, and even used the waste parts. The designs were very attractive, and I could not help but be impressed by their skill.\n\nThe Indians are very hardworking people, and I believe they should be encouraged to continue their work. The Indian agent should be able to assist them in finding markets for their goods.\n\nR. W. Macdonald\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 8, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. MacDonald:\n\nIn response to the request contained in your letter of February 6, I am sending forward herewith copy of your letter of January 12, 1944.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that I was deeply interested in your reference to the remodelled military clothing, to which your attention was directed by the Indian agent at the time of your visit to Muncey. You will be interested to learn that we have organized a large number of Homemakers' Clubs on Indian reserves throughout the Dominion and that the members of these clubs are at present engaged in the remodelling of this clothing, in the cultivation of gardens and in the canning and preserving of vegetables. The officials here are of the opinion that the work undertaken and accomplished by these women is one of the most encouraging features of our welfare program. No doubt, you learned, at the time of your visit to Muncey, that the women have only been organized for a comparatively brief period of time.\n\nAgain thanking you for your letter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

Elgin Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nIn response to your request, I am sending forward herewith a copy of a report, dated February 18, 1944, submitted to this Department by Inspector Gordon Young.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, February 24, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 18 and also a report of the educational survey on a number of Indian reserves in Western Ontario, sent forward therewith.\n\nIn response to your suggestion, I am today sending forward a copy of this report to Dr. Dorey. I should state also that Dr. Dorey visited the Department yesterday. However, I had not at that time made a study of the report and consequently I was not in a position to discuss your recommendations with him. It is just possible that I may have an opportunity to do so in the course of a couple of weeks.\n\nI will, in due course, submit the statement of your travelling expenses and your account for services to the Treasury Division and you can expect to hear from them in the course of a week or so.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to thank you very heartily for the work you have undertaken on behalf of this Department. I feel confident that the report embodies your best judgment on the matters under discussion. In view of existing conditions - the shortage of labour, shortage of building material - and the limited funds at our disposal for services other than war services, it is just possible that we may not be able to adopt your recommendations at any time in the immediate future. You can rest assured, however, that they will be given careful consideration.\n\nGordon Young, Esq., B.A.,\nInspector of Public Schools,\nStrathroy, Ont.\n\np.t.a\nconsideration and will, I feel sure, prove helpful to the officials of the Department when they undertake the task of working out a worthwhile educational program on a number of our reserves in Western Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nVII. THE SUMMER SCHOOL\n\nThis school will be organized to give graduates of Ontario Normal special preparation for teaching in Indian Schools by offering courses in the Special Subjects (Manual Work, Home Economics, Auxiliary Class Training, Kindergarten Primary, Music, etc.) and in Indian Service (Study of the life and customs of the Indians, Special Methods, etc.).\n\nCourses in Special Subjects may be taken by qualified officials in the Indian Affairs Branch assisted by leaders in the Ontario System. The Special Indian Service Courses would be in charge of officials who know the life, habits and customs of Indians.\n\nTeachers already in Indian Schools should attend this school and in this way qualify for better service.\n\nBy holding frequent discussion groups and conferences during the session of this school, these experienced teachers could help each other and the beginners to gain the objective of the school.\n\nAttendance can be made compulsory by the Indian Affairs Branch assuming the cost of living allowance and transportation to be paid partly at the time of the school and the remainder after a period of service or by giving attractive increases in salary to those who attend the summer school.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe are conscious that this report leaves many details to be considered, many definitions to be clarified, but we believe that our commission was to point the direction rather than chart the course in detail. In fact the detail of this report may exceed our commission.\n\nWe believe that our proposals are sound and their adoption will lead to the improvement of Indian Education on our reserves. Difficulties lie in the way of this adoption but we trust that they will not discourage those in authority from daring to make the attempt to carry out our suggestions.\nREPORT\n\nRE SURVEY OF INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nIN WESTERN ONTARIO\n\nBY\n\nGORDON YOUNG B.A.\n\nINSPECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nSTRATFORD ONT.\n\nPeriod of Survey and Preparation of Report\n\nSeptember 1943 \u2014 February 1944\n\nReport Submitted\n\nFebruary 16, 1944.\nSYNOPSIS OF\n\nREPORT RE SURVEY OF INDIAN EDUCATION ON RESERVES IN WESTERN ONTARIO\n\nIntroduction \u2014 Nature of Survey and Points Revealed ........ 1 - 3\n\nRecommending that Mount Elgin Residential School be closed; and that a Senior School be established in its stead, including suggestions as to course of study, conduct of school and building. ........ 4 - 7\n\nRecommending that a new plant to serve the purposes of this Senior School be erected. ........ 6 - 7\n\nRecommending that the Day School Programme be revised. ........ 7 - 8\n\nRecommendations Re Appointment of Teachers and Training of Teachers. ........ 8 - 9\n\nRecommending the Appointment of a Special Superintendent of Education for the Munsey and Omeida Reserves ........ 9 - 10\n\nRecommending a Summer School for Special Training of Teachers in Service and Teachers Entering Service in Indian Schools ........ 11\nREPORT RE SURVEY OF INDIAN EDUCATION ON RESERVES IN WESTERN ONTARIO\n\nThe Survey consisted of:\n\n(1) Visits to homes and schools on the Muncey, Oneida, Six Nations', Cape Crocker, Saugeen, Kettle Point, Sarnia and Walpole Island Reserves; (On these visits I was accompanied by some or all of: Mr. W.S. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies; Rev. R.M.M. Joblin, United Church Missionary at Muncey; and Rev. Geo. Dorsey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada).\n\n(2) Conferences with these three gentlemen and the inspectors named below.\n\nThe life-long experience of Mr. Joblin among Indians has been a valuable aid with certain phases of my work in this survey.\n\n(3) Conferences with teachers and agents on these reserves;\n\n(4) Visits to the Mohawk Institute and Mount Elgin Residential School;\n\n(5) Written reports from five public school inspectors who visit these reserves \u2014 Messrs. J.B. Webster, Brantford; J.M. Gane, Walkerton; Geo. A. Pearson, Chatham; H.B. Galpin, Sarnia; and D.G. Smith, London.\n\n(6) Examination of reports relating to enrolment, attendance and progress of pupils in the schools on these reserves;\n\n(7) Reading of reports of other surveys in Canada and United States.\n\nPoints Revealed by this Investigation\n\n(1) Indians who had attended Residential Schools appear to be very successful in later life although the younger Indians appear to drift back into old habits and customs for a time after graduation. They appear to find the progress of changing from a life where all features of it were ordered by the institution to one of absolute freedom on the reserves a very difficult adjustment and naturally so. It is not surprising if for a time they \"run wild\".\n\nThe older Indians who are so successful were usually individuals who entered the residential school about 12 or 13 years of age after having attended day schools near their homes. They also report that they were given opportunities of practising leadership among their fellow students and some opportunity of doing some advanced academic work in addition to good training in agricultural and vocational subjects. They prize the religious training received in those institutions. In their day at these schools the proportion of younger children was not so large as today.\nThere is a tendency today among many families to evade the responsibility of the training and raising the children by sending, or wishing to send, their children to the residential school.\n\nIndian Agents at several of the reserves believe that the orphans and children from broken homes can be accommodated in Indian homes on the reserve and can receive their elementary education at the local Day Schools. Other authorities intimate that Indians will readily adopt such children. Such adoption deserves careful supervision.\n\nYour committee believe that for children from Grades I to V or VI depending on the age of the children, a home atmosphere is superior to that of an institution for the natural development of the children, unless the home conditions are very adverse.\n\nThe education of Indian children requires teachers who understand these children, who have some knowledge of their background, who are sympathetic and who have sufficient training to enable them to adjust the curriculum and management of the school to the particular needs of the children. These teachers ought to be able to conduct elementary classes, at least, in Handwork, Home Economics, Agriculture, Art and Music. They require special K.F. Training and ability to overcome language difficulties.\n\nGenerally teachers in Indian Schools do not have these qualifications. Frequently they are selected without proper regard to qualifications and occasionally against the advice of the local inspector.\n\nSome of the Day Schools have a very ample supply of necessary teaching equipment and books for supplementary reading. Many have a very inadequate or unsuitable supply of these things. The buildings in some cases are out-of-date; others are above the average of our white elementary schools. In a general way the best service occurs where the Indian Agent and the local Inspector work in closest co-operation. The Agent has so many other details and interests to take his attention that we should not be surprised when he fails to give this matter the consideration it requires.\n\nAttendance at the Residential Schools is much better than at Day Schools. Attendance Officers with authority to enforce attendance are necessary.\n\nThe provincial course of study needs to be modified for Indian Schools. We believe that properly trained teachers with adequate supervision can make the necessary adjustments. Special attention to Arts and Crafts, Home Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture, Art and Music should be required.\n\nA Senior School or a Senior Room could provide these in more detail for senior pupils and at the same time provide training in leadership, religion, sports and more advanced academic subjects.\n\nThis would leave more opportunity to overcome the language difficulty and the retardation in the earlier grades.\nOur Residential Schools are planned as Vocational Schools. The enrolment indicates that they are being used in a large measure as orphanages or children's shelters, and in a certain measure, as reformatories. The large proportion of small children interferes with the other purpose of the school and the young children tend to be neglected for part of the day. Sending refractory children to the institution creates problems of discipline which definitely interfere with the good work which the school might do.\n\nThe younger children will receive more and better attention in a school planned for them. The school for older pupils could serve their needs more adequately if a sufficient number of them were present to carry out the plans of the school as they are intended to work. As it is today the pupils who are able to do the work on the farm and in the house are required to do more work than should be required. There is not sufficient emphasis on the training to be derived from this work and too much importance attached to the necessity of producing sufficient to keep the Institution running.\n\nThe education of the children is linked up with the progress in general on the reserve and thus many other factors on each reserve affect the efficiency of the work of the schools. Where parents are able to work at home on the reserve, the attendance at school is not subject to the same interruption as in cases where the parents have to leave the reserve for certain periods in order to earn a living.\n\nThe progress of the people and their outlook on the future has an important effect on their attitude toward the school. The response of the children to any educational plans for their improvement is affected favourably or adversely in an important measure by this attitude of the folks at home. Every improvement in the life of the adults will lead to better results in our schools. In this field the Indian Agents generally give good service. Their main efforts appear to be spent in plans for the improvement of living and working conditions among their charges. This work has an important bearing on education; as these conditions improve, the parents will give increased sympathy and moral support to the work of the schools, creating a more receptive attitude among the pupils. It may be possible to develop a co-ordination of the work of the Agent and the teacher so that each will aid the other in the main objective\u2014to develop good citizens of Canada among our Indian people.\nI. MOUNT ELGIN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n(1) The enrolment is too small for continued operation under present plans.\n   (a) The per capita payment is insufficient to maintain the school;\n   (b) This forces too much labour on the pupils (profit rather than educational policy becomes the object of this work);\n   (c) This condition is aggravated by the presence of so many younger children.\n   (d) The staff has been reduced; school hours are reduced; and the work increased for all.\n\nIt is but fair to note that these conditions have been aggravated by the present general prosperity due to war conditions when older pupils find jobs so easily. We doubt that these conditions will be permanently as bad as they are now, but we do believe that they will continue to affect the efficiency and usefulness of the school.\n\n(e) The enrolment has been reduced also by the policy of sending only pupils from broken or disrupted homes; at least one Agent is so unsatisfied with this Institute that he has favoured others in competition for pupils; some pupils have been sent to the school for reformatory treatment - this has not enhanced the reputation of the school and has increased the severity of the discipline - discouraging the better type of prospect. Other Institutes have been able to secure pupils who under other circumstances should have gone to Mount Elgin. Possibly the main cause of the lower proportion of older pupils is the present opportunities for their employment.\n\n(2) The main building can be used temporarily for the purposes indicated below, but this should be considered as temporary measure until war restrictions will permit the construction of a modern fire-proof building planned to serve these purposes. The old school building should be abandoned and removed immediately.\n\n(3) Agents on the other reserves intimate that orphans and children from disrupted homes can be accommodated in other homes on the reserve. The adoption of these children should not be left entirely to the Agent for he as a rule, is not qualified to make such an important decision alone.\n\nWe recommend that the missionary to whose church the child and family are affiliated be required to report on the suitability of the home for such adoption and that the Agent be required to give a satisfactory explanation of every case in which he does not concur with the report.\n\n(4) This leaves the orphans and children from disrupted homes at the Caradoc Agency whom we believe might be accommodated at the Mohawk Residential School if a similar policy were impossible on these reserves.\n\n(5) We recommend that MOUNT ELGIN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL be closed.\nand that in its stead there be established a SENIOR SCHOOL as described below.\n\nII. SENIOR SCHOOL\n\n(1) The Senior School should be a \"Day\" School with some Residential Accommodation.\n\n(2) The School will serve pupils of 12-13 years of age and older. At present this means that instruction should begin as low as Grade VI and continue to Grade X. With improved educational facilities on the Reserves, it may not be necessary to offer a Grade lower than Grade VII. For the remainder of this report the use of \"VI or VII\" and \"VII or VII\" implies that at present the lower grade is recommended but that we hope for the time when the higher grade may be used.\n\n(3) This school will accommodate Grades VI or VII to X from Caradoc Agency as Day Pupils and from outside Agencies as Residential Pupils. Residential Privileges may be open to the Caradoc pupils. Transportation for pupils from the outside fringes of the Reserves may be necessary but the proportion is so small and scattered that residence may be preferred.\n\n(4) Pupils from Grades I to V or VI on the reserves of Caradoc should attend the local elementary Day School.\n\n(5) Course of Study - Senior School:\n\nThe Courses or Studies for Grades VI or VII to X of the Province of Ontario modified specific needs of Indian pupils and including a large proportion of Vocational Training \u2014\n\nFor Boys: Agriculture, General Shop, Motor Mechanics;\n\nFor Girls: Home Economics, Home Nursing, Sewing (Dressmaking as well as mending), Gardening and care of Poultry;\n\nin addition to a good general training in English, Mathematics, Health Practices, Science as related to our everyday experiences, Social Studies (including Indian Life and History), Art, Music, Physical Training and Recreation.\n\nThe practice in Agriculture, Gardening, Poultry Management, Home Economics, Sewing, etc., may be provided by participation in work on the farm and in residence school dormitories. The emphasis shall be placed on the training to be derived rather than profits from the work. Merely routine tasks may be accomplished much more economical by the uses of experienced help and labour saving machinery. Acquaintance with the operation of labour saving machinery on the farm may open opportunities for employment in after life. A similar statement is true with respect to the work...\nin the residence. At the same time it should not be forgotten that the majority of the girls eventually return to homes on the reserve for which much of such training is entirely unsuitable. The Home Economics should include training for the management of a small house with few conveniences, for the improved solution of problems connected with typical homes on the reserve. To train girls to be good house-maids in well-equipped houses ensures employment on graduation but may be a handicap in a short time when the girls return to establish homes of their own on the reserve. For this reason we recommend that the management of the humble home be given more ample attention than in the past. This led us to recommend training in Gardening and Care of Poultry for girls.\n\nIndian Life and History is not included in Social Studies to revive old Indian Customs or to foster separations but to aid in the development of self respect in the Indian children. Pride in the achievements and deeds of valour by our ancestors arouses a pride in ourselves which is favourable to our best development.\n\nFor pupils having the necessary academic ability and ambition, special provision for qualifying for entrance to the higher grades to local High Schools should be available.\n\n(6) The development of responsibility in the Senior pupils can be obtained or at least encouraged by giving them responsibilities to discharge in connection with work and supervision of younger pupils and as leaders in social and religious activities and in games and recreative activities.\n\n(7) Day pupils as well as residential pupils will be required to work on the farm on Saturdays and holidays as needed. This work has a double purpose - part of the training and part of the price of the opportunity of attending.\n\n(8) The Transition Period\n\nThe main building (now used for dormitories, offices, staff residence, etc.) may be used temporarily until war-time restrictions are relaxed and the construction of a modern plant undertaken. This old building is very unsuitable -- The dining-hall, kitchen, bathing facilities and dairy are in the basement which is dark, dingy and difficult to keep in a sanitary condition. Its construction constitutes a grave fire-risk. The dormitories are bare and lack adequate sanitary conveniences.\n\nThe building has ample space for starting the Senior School but will require extensive alterations to make it even partially suitable.\n\nThe new building should be fire proof with modern classrooms properly lighted and ventilated; a combination assembly hall and gymnasium; residence for staff and students; common room and library; vocational rooms for boys and girls; kitchen and dining-room; laundry; dairy.\n\nWe believe that in planning such a building the experience of the Canadian Indian Affairs Branch, the Indian Office in the\nUnited States and the Ontario Department of Education will indicate whether all or part of these facilities or additional facilities are essential.\n\nWe think that the day of large barrack-like dormitories is past; that these should be planned to give students some privacy and opportunity to be responsible for a space which is more personal; rooms shared by not more than two with storage facilities for personal belongings should be provided for the pupils of the upper grades at least. Bathing and sanitary facilities should be convenient.\n\nWe note that some American Indian residences are more of the cottage type with groups having some semblance of family life under supervision of a member of the staff. Let us investigate the possibility of adopting such a feature in this new school.\n\nMay we also urge that the beauty of certain architecture be considered in the construction of this building?\n\nIII. DAY SCHOOLS\n\nWe recommend that the Day Schools now in use near Indian homes be devoted to the instruction of children from Grades I to V or VI.\n\nWhile some of your buildings are very suitable for this purpose, others are entirely \"out of line\" with modern requirements for elementary education. A special survey of these may result in building schools more suitable.\n\nThese schools should have a definite programme aimed at overcoming the retardation which at present exists in Grades I to III.\n\n(a) The language difficulty can be partially overcome by the use of \"Experience Reading\" used extensively in Bi-Lingual Schools.\n\n(b) More regular attendance to be enforced \u2014 a bright interesting programme in which pupils succeed will improve this defect.\n\n(c) Objective methods of teaching used more extensively will lead to better success and greater interest.\n\n(d) These schools must have an ample supply of materials for objective teaching and for experience reading. Good readers for the purpose may not be as readily available as we who teach white children imagine.\n\n(e) There should be much hand work of a simple nature. As the abilities of the children develop more complex work may be undertaken. Some Indian children are quite adept at an early age.\n\n(f) The Day School Course of Study Grades I to V or VI may be a modification of the provincial course of study. The latter should be accepted as a guide only not as a requirement. It has to\nbe modified to suit the particular needs of individual pupils and localities. Teachers for Indian Schools should be trained to recognize the need for these modifications and to make such adjustments as are necessary. Below we suggest a plan for this training.\n\nFor Grades VI or VII to X a senior room or senior school is preferred. This may not always be possible, and the senior classes may have to be included with the juniors. Where possible we recommend that the Senior Room or School emphasize training in Crafts (Art), Manual Training, or simple shop activities, Home Nursing, Gardening and Agriculture, Music. The options will be determined very largely by the community.\n\nIf the Junior School has accomplished the conquest of retardation, the Senior Room or School will be able to carry most Indian children to Grades IX or X and accomplish much more than is possible at present.\n\nSome of the very capable pupils may make definite preparation for Senior Grades in neighbouring High Schools, but only very capable pupils should be granted this opportunity.\n\nSchool Attendance Officers who will enforce regular attendance are necessary. Attendance has deteriorated since these officers were released from duty recently.\n\nAn alternative plan which is preferred if the Indians adopt it is: Form a Parent-Teacher's or Home and School association in connection with each school. This association voluntarily assumes responsibility for enforcing attendance by creating a strong local public opinion favourable to regular attendance and by interviewing and persuading parents to send children to school regularly. This association may also report to the Agent cases where privation is the cause of absence or, better still, assume responsibility for relieving such privation.\n\nIV. APPOINTMENT OF TEACHERS\n\nAppointment of teachers to be made by the Department on advice, recommendation or approval of local inspector or educational superintendent -- to be free from political influence entirely.\n\nV.\n\n(a) Should be graduates of Normal Schools who are further prepared by\n(1) The training received by teachers of Auxiliary classes.\n(2) The training received by teachers of Kindergarten Primary Classes.\n(3) And one of Home Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture or Music. (In normal peace time all of these courses are offered by Summer Schools in Ontario)\n(4) Special training respecting Indian life, Indian outlook and objectives. (The plan for this training is outlined below)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 466-1, part 3)\n(b) Should have adequate salaries with superannuation - Salaries should be at least as high as teachers of white schools. (In normal peace time the salaries have met this requirement)\n\nThe superannuation can be arranged in one of two plans: (1) That the Dominion pay the Province the contribution just as Boards in Ontario do now and our Ontario Indian teachers be given the same status in the Ontario fund as the Ontario teachers. This may require a special agreement between the Province and the Dominion with respect to the contribution made from Provincial Funds. (2) That these teachers be admitted to the Dominion Civil Service Superannuation Fund and an agreement between the Dominion and the Province respecting the transfer of teachers from Ontario schools to Indian Schools and vice versa be made.\n\n(c) Should have special training prior to entering Indian Schools. The summer school suggested below would serve this purpose. The teachers taking this course and agreeing to serve a definite period in Indian Schools would receive a living allowance, free tuition and transportation to the school.\n\n(d) Residential teachers are preferred. They can assist as community leaders or directors of community activities carried by the Indians themselves.\n\nVI. GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION\n\nWe recommend the training and appointment of a general superintendent of education for the Namaoy and Onela Reserves. Our ideal in this respect would be a young missionary of the United Church who has knowledge of and experience among Indians, interested in and sympathetic with their problems and difficulties and who is equipped with good academic training and religious leadership.\n\nSuch a man could be given professional training by a course of at least six months duration at the College of Education, Department of Education and Special Classes at Toronto.\n\nAt the College of Education he would be directed to reading related to the work required of him; supervision, administration, etc. He would attend lectures on special methods in subjects -- particularly public school subjects.\n\nHe would have frequent consultations with professors on matters relating to the work to be done.\n\nAt the Department of Education he would have consultations with leaders there -- particularly the inspectors of the auxiliary branch. Methods, organization and administration would be subjects of these consultations.\n\nAt Special Classes -- Auxiliary, Manual Training, Home Economics, Kindergarten Primary -- Visits and observations followed by\ndiscussions with teachers and principals. Similar visits to the Normal School and observation of teacher training and practice teaching.\n\nThis man should be trained at the expense of the Indian Affairs Branch, either by paying him an adequate salary while thus engaged or by assuming the cost of training (tuition if any; living allowance and transportation). An alternative to this plan is to accept a qualified educational leader and train him with respect to special Indian problems.\n\nThe former plan is preferred because such leader can play an important part in the social, religious and community life of the reserves as well as in the more strictly educational field.\n\nA third plan has been suggested: That for the reserves of South Western Ontario [Cape Croker to Six Nations] one Ontario Inspector of Public Schools have the supervision of elementary and Senior School education on these reserves and this inspector be assigned a special study of Indian Education to prepare him to perform the educational duties suggested below for the superintendent.\n\nYour committee favours the plan mentioned first above, but recognizes that it may be the more difficult to adopt.\n\nDuties of this Superintendent\n\n[1] To supervise the work of the teachers in the Day Schools directing them in the adaptation of the school programme to the needs of the pupils, in the selection of methods, in the organization of the school and assisting them in this work. Our present system of supervision by provincial inspectors of public schools does not give the inspector adequate opportunity to help his teachers.\n\n[2] To assist teachers in organizing and directing special activities in the Day Schools - Handwork, Home Economics, Agriculture, Music, etc.; and\n\n[3] To co-operate with the Indian Agent and churches and other organizations in the promotion of social and religious activities on the reserve.\n\n[4] To organize and direct a Summer School for the special training of teachers of schools for Indians for the following year;\n\n[5] To advise, recommend or approve all applications for the positions of teachers on the Muncey and Omeida Reserves before acceptance.\n\n[6] To organise and supervise the establishment and management of the Senior School at Mount Elgin. While he determines, directs and supervises the educational policy and programme of the school, the principal of the school will assume the responsibility of carrying out this policy and programme.\n\nDuring the period of transition, the educational problems on the Muncey and Omeida Reserves, the establishment of the Senior School and Summer School will employ the full time of this official. Eventually he would be free to extend his supervision to such other reserves as the Indian Affairs Branch may deem advisable.\nVII. THE SUMMER SCHOOL\n\nThis school will be organized to give graduates of Ontario Normal special preparation for teaching in Indian Schools by offering courses in the Special Subjects (Manual Work, Home Economics, Auxiliary Class Training, Kindergarten Primary, Music, etc.) and in Indian Service (Study of the life and customs of the Indians, Special Methods, etc.).\n\nCourses in Special Subjects may be taken by qualified officials in the Indian Affairs Branch assisted by leaders in the Ontario System. The Special Indian Service Courses would be in charge of officials who know the life, habits and customs of Indians.\n\nTeachers already in Indian Schools should attend this school and in this way qualify for better service.\n\nBy holding frequent discussion groups and conferences during the session of this school, these experienced teachers could help each other and the beginners to gain the objective of the school.\n\nAttendance can be made compulsory by the Indian Affairs Branch assuming the cost of living allowance and transportation to be paid partly at the time of the school and the remainder after a period of service or by giving attractive increases in salary to those who attend the summer school.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe are conscious that this report leaves many details to be considered, many definitions to be clarified, but we believe that our commission was to point the direction rather than chart the course in detail. In fact the detail of this report may exceed our commission.\n\nWe believe that our proposals are sound and their adoption will lead to the improvement of Indian Education on our reserves. Difficulties lie in the way of this adoption but we trust that they will not discourage those in authority from daring to make the attempt to carry out our suggestions.\nHon. Mr. H. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent, Welfare & Training Service\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDowth Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nEnclosed are (1) my report; (2) my account for travelling expenses; and my account for services.\n\nMy report has been delayed to permit me to continue my regular duties without serious interruption in the fall; but the recent delays from November until now have been due to other causes. I wished to give Dr. Dorey, Mr. Cochrane and Mr. Joblin ample opportunity to consider and discuss my proposals. It was not always convenient to meet with these men and the result has been delay.\n\nI believe that Dr. Cochrane expected me to meet Dr. Corey again before submitting this report to you. Two extra copies are enclosed and one may be sent directly to Dr. Corey at once if you so decide.\n\nThe final draft of this report was discussed with Mr. Joblin and he agreed with it in principle throughout. Certain sections need further clarification, but the general plan suits him. This final draft includes changes in the order of the sections and some minor revisions suggested by our meeting in January and Dr. Corey's special criticism sent to me recently. Dr. Corey will be in Ottawa around the 22nd of this month and it is possible that you may be able to arrange a meeting with him.\n\nMy account for travelling expenses includes items for Mr. Joblin as well as myself. At first I started to list these separately by marking them J and Y, but since the items were identical...\nHon. Mr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nI combined them, marking them JAY. This makes the combined item exceed $1.00. No voucher was obtained because the separate parts of the item were each less than $1.00; Mr. Joblin was visiting in Woodstock when we went to Toronto and I paid his railway fare from Woodstock to Toronto and return. He stayed with friends so had no expense while there.\n\nThe account for services includes the actual time spent on this work and does not include considerable time spent in an attempt to prepare myself for at least a small part of the qualifications which you seemed to think that I possess. The total of the travelling expense account has been added to this for the convenience of your office. When my typist worked entirely on this work, an account of her time was kept separate from her regular account and that has also been added to my bill. I trust that this has your approval.\n\nWhile I still doubt the value of my services to you, I hope that it does not disappoint you. It has been an enlightening experience for me and one which I have enjoyed. Should I be able to assist you in any way in the future, feel free to make the request, and be assured that the courteous, gracious cooperation received from Mr. Arnell and yourself is appreciated very much.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSW/TT\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a note of urgency because we are likely to send forward the name of Mr. Strapp to you for appointment to Brandon. He is going out to see the School. He has told us that he thinks well of the proposition. If that goes through, I do not see how, in the light of the Report, you can very well expect us to make a nomination for Mount Elgin. On the other hand, we cannot very well look forward with any degree of satisfaction or calmness of mind to seeing another Residential School operated by The United Church of Canada closed.\n\nWe shall be very glad to have your reaction to this situation as soon as possible.\n\nI think I told you that Mr. Joblin was coming to the University to take a special course and I do not think he would be available for Muncey.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 29, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th instant, in which you seek information with respect to the future of the marginally-noted residential school.\n\nI can readily understand your anxiousness to secure a definite decision from the Department, particularly in view of the fact that Mr. Strapp is likely to accept the principalship at Brandon.\n\nMr. Young's report of February 18, 1944, was sent forward to the office of the Minister without comment. The Chief Executive Assistant, in a memorandum dated May 15, 1944, states\u2014\n\n\"It would seem that little, if any, progress can be made in implementing Mr. Young's recommendations until after the war, when conditions relating to the construction of new buildings and the securing of staff are less difficult. While the decision to close this residential school is not changed, it would appear that we may keep it open for a year or two. In the meantime such repairs as are absolutely necessary should be made.\"\n\nYou are aware that the policy followed by the Government, with respect to the education of Indians during the last 10 or 15 year period, has been one of economy and retrenchment. Nine residential schools have been totally destroyed by fire since I entered the Department in 1938. In addition to this, four Indian day schools, including the large senior day school at\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West, TORONTO 2, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

While we have built a number of Indian day schools, the majority of these have been replacements. When I inform you that our Indian school population is increasing at the rate of 300 pupils per annum\u2014which fact should compel us to construct at least five Indian day schools and one residential school annually\u2014you can readily realize just how acute and how urgent the need for additional educational facilities has become. In certain cases, notably Alberni and File Hills, not to mention Round Lake, the need for new buildings is extremely urgent.\n\nIf I could persuade myself that the Mount Elgin Institute could be repaired and made reasonably satisfactory from the standpoint of sanitation, I would recommend that it be operated for, say, a five year period, or in other words, until either this government or succeeding governments had an opportunity to catch up with our building program.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that Mr. Phelan has recently made a thorough inspection of the schools on the Six Nations Reserve. At the time of this inspection, he had an opportunity to discuss educational matters with the Inspector for the district, Mr. Webster. Mr. Webster is strongly of the opinion that high school instruction should be provided, not on the reserve, but at Brantford, and the reasons submitted by him for the adoption of this policy are, to me at least, very convincing. If we had the funds necessary to rebuild at Muncey, I am not at all sure that a sufficient number of senior pupils, to justify the operation of the school, would attend. \"We have 6,000 Indians at Six Nations, and yet our enrolment of high school students at Brantford seldom exceeds 50. We have at this date less than 80 pupils in the whole of the Dominion engaged in high school studies at departmental expense. A committee of the House of Commons before which I appeared a few days ago were very much opposed to any attempts on the part of the Department to keep Indians segregated on reserves. Indians, in the judgment of the members of the committee, should be encouraged to attend white schools and white vocational schools. This may indicate to some extent and in a small way the policy that governments may adopt in the future.\n\nI was sorry indeed to learn that Mr. Joblin\nwas leaving the reserve. Mr. Arnell, who has just returned from there, spoke very highly of his work and his interest in the advancement of the Indian population. We certainly need such leaders on our reserves. However, nothing that I have said will be of much help either to you or to the members of your Board. It has occurred to me that we might save a great deal of unnecessary correspondence if you could see your way clear to visit Ottawa at an early date. I have a feeling that the future of the Mount Elgin Institute is a matter that the Minister himself should decide.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nthe school should be closed and day school accommodation provided for the children of school age on the reserve;\n\nThat consideration be given to the desirability of working out a program whereby joint use might be made of the outbuildings,- barns, machine shed, forge, etc., at the school.\n\nIt may be somewhat difficult to reach full agreement with respect to this program, but an attempt should be made to do so. Such an arrangement was of course impossible while Mr. Strapp was Principal of the School and Mr. Down in charge of the agency.\n\nMr. Young in his report, you may remember, expressed the opinion that a residential school for senior pupils should be established on this reserve, with dormitory accommodation for a number of pupils from other reserves, who might be enrolled at the school. The officials of the Welfare and Training Division do not look upon this proposal as at all practicable. It would be exceedingly difficult to justify the erection of a so-called senior school while a large number of elementary pupils are still without educational facilities. In this connection it is interesting to note that the recently appointed public school inspector at Brantford, Mr. Webster, has expressed the opinion that pupils who have completed their elementary courses and have passed their Entrance Examinations at the Six Nations Reserve, or indeed on other reserves similarly situated in Ontario, should proceed with their high school studies, not at an Indian school, but at adjoining white schools. Mr. Webster is definitely of the opinion that these Indian pupils should not be denied an opportunity of associating with white children during their formative years, and that the cost of this policy, if followed, would in the end be substantially less than the cost of establishing senior schools. In addition to this, our building program is, as you are fully aware, far behind. Schools such as Caughnawaga, File Hills, Alberni, Rock Settlement, Round Lake, Aubenaside and Eskasoni should in all fairness be rebuilt before consideration is given to the claims of a senior school.\nat Caradoc. It would, I feel, be very helpful to both\nthe officials of the department and to the United\nChurch authorities if a definite decision could be\nreached at the time of Dr. Dorsey's visit.\n\nDirector.\nDown, is proving most successful and has now developed to a point where a barn is essential.\n\n\"I deferred writing this memorandum last spring because of the possibility of our utilizing the spacious outbuildings at the Mt. Elgin Institute; but, regardless of the future use of the school buildings, it is now, in my opinion, imperative that we have a barn and a piece of land at the agency buildings.\n\n\"It transpires that a barn, well suited for our purpose, was purchased by the Department of Pensions and National Health, with farm lands for the extension of Westminster Hospital, London, Ont., and that the building is now surplus to their requirements. There is a large frame barn with shingle roof; the main barn is 36 x 60, with an end addition 36 x 60. The frame is sound and the sheeting good. It is conveniently located for removal to this reserve and can be economically razed and rebuilt on a new foundation.\"\n\n\"While the Mount Elgin Institute is, in the judgment of our officials, an acute fire hazard, the barns or outbuildings attached to this school are in many respects the best set of buildings in southwestern Ontario. They would, if brought under departmental control, make an ideal set of buildings for the promotion of an agricultural program on the reserve. The demand for a new set of buildings close to the agency office, however, has become very persistent. These buildings, Mr. Arneil and the Agent assure us, are necessary for the housing of goats during the winter months, for the processing of willow, for the storage of farm machinery, for the storage of hay and the baling and storage of straw. It would, in my judgment, be very unfortunate, however, and very costly to construct new buildings, with all that such construction involves\u2014the drilling of a well, the construction of approaches, etc., if there is even a remote possibility of utilizing the school buildings at any time in the immediate future. Dr. Dorsey is, I understand, anxious to discuss the future of the school with the Minister and is likely to do so toward the end of this week. In view of this fact, may I submit, for your consideration, the following proposals:\n\n1. That permission be granted to the United Church to operate the school for a period not exceeding four years, at the end of which period\nOttawa, January 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed communication has been transferred from the Natural Resources Branch, Department of the Interior, to this Department. The writer, Fred J. Dodson, is the assistant principal of the Young Men's Indian Residential School, Muncey, Ont. This school is administered under the control of this Department.\n\nYou will note, from Mr. Dodson's letter, that he requests films showing the various manufacture of Canadian industries. It may be that you have what he requires. I should be pleased if you would communicate direct with Mr. Dodson and inform him of the films available for loaning purposes, stating the costs involved for transportation charges, etc. Anything you can do to meet Mr. Dodson's wishes in regard to the moving pictures he requires will be appreciated. We are informing him that his letter has been referred to you for attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. C. Mulley Esq.,\nGovernment Motion Picture Bureau,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 7, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Operation of Mount Elgin Institute,\nCaradoc Agency, Ontario.\n\nThis Branch is in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Dr. Dorey, dated June 5, 1944, in which Dr. Dorey nominates the Reverend O. B. Strapp, who has been Principal of the Mt. Elgin Institute for a number of years, for the principalship of the Brandon Residential School. In this letter Dr. Dorey points out that the transfer of Mr. Strapp to Brandon, if approved, will compel both the United Church and the Government to review again the status of the Mount Elgin Institute and the desirability of keeping this school in operation. Dr. Dorey, in his communication, states:\n\n\"I do not see how, in the light of the Young report, you can very well expect us to submit a nomination for Mount Elgin. On the other hand, we cannot very well look forward with any degree of satisfaction or calmness of mind to seeing another residential school operated by the United Church of Canada closed.\"\n\nThere are, in my judgment, a number of reasons why a definite decision should be reached with respect to the future of the Mount Elgin School. The operation of this school is inseparably bound up with our welfare program on the reserve, particularly our agricultural program. Inspector Arnell, in a memorandum to me dated May 16, states:\n\n\"You will recall that for some three years it has been strongly recommended, by the Indian Agent and myself, that we procure an agency barn for the Caradoc Reserve. The agricultural program, under Mr.\nMEMORANDUM RE MOUNT ELGIN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nJune 12th/44\n\nI had an opportunity of discussing the whole situation with Dr. Cassell, Mr. Hoey and Mr. Jackson on Friday, June 8th. As a result, I think the following is clear:\n\n1.- The Department intends to implement the Report of the Commission, - certainly in so far as the closing of Mount Elgin as a residential school and the establishment of a Senior School are concerned.\n\n2.- This means the building of proper classroom accommodation, but, due to lack of materials, it is impossible to say when this will be done.\n\n3.- This also means the building of a residence, - perhaps not so large as the present one.\n\nI must say that it is my judgment that these two things do not necessarily hang together; that is to say, it is absolutely essential that a new classroom be built as soon as possible, but the present building would be suitable, temporarily.\n\nI pass on my judgment as follows:\n\n1st. There would be a smaller number of pupils to be accommodated, and the pupils would be older.\n\n2nd. There would be no very small children, and consequently the present fire hazard would be to some extent, at least, mitigated.\n\n3rd. The only reason that I have for even suggesting that the present building should continue is that, to my mind, the first thing the Department must face is the replacement of buildings that have been burned; and the next thing is the very much needed extension of buildings. These will certainly take all the money that the House of Commons is likely to vote for some years - even after the war.\n\n4th. It seems obvious that if the whole School were closed now, it would throw altogether too heavy a burden on the present accommodation and a lot of children would be left without schooling at all.\n\n5th. On the basis of the above, it is agreed that we should continue to operate as at present, with the definite understanding that whoever the new man is who is nominated to the Department, he will distinctly understand that it is for a limited period, on the present basis. What the period may be is difficult to foretell - Mr. Jackson thought two years, Dr. Cassell, Mr. Hoey and I thought it would be longer. I should have no hesitation in saying to a possible appointee that it would be four years before anything would be done.\n\n6th. In the meantime, it is imperative that there be a clear formulation of the steps which must be undertaken in working out the policy. It cannot be put into effect all at once; indeed it would be very much better if the changes could be made gradually. In any case, the Indians should be advised of what is proposed.\n\nI should, therefore, think that there should be next Fall a conference between Mr. Hoey, the representatives of the Church, and possibly Inspector Young, to discuss the Report and see what is the next step.\n\nGeo. Dorsey\nAttention of Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nJune 13th,\n1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe - Mount Elgin Residential School\n\nI am enclosing for your perusal a memorandum which I made about my visit to your office in connection with the Mount Elgin School. On thinking the matter over, it has occurred to me that, even though the School continues to operate as at present, the whole matter of future policy must be gone into as soon as possible. A considerable part of the proposals contained in Mr. Young's report has nothing to do with a new residential building. As a matter of fact, a very modest expenditure on the old building would make it suitable to house the few pupils that you think will need accommodation; but, of course, the classroom will have to be built. In any case, my suggestion is that this fall, as soon as the new man has had a chance to familiarize himself with the situation, we go into the whole matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, June 16, 1944.\n\nRe: Operation Mt. Elgin Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 13 and also copy of a memorandum prepared by you, immediately following your interview with Dr. Cansell, sent forward therewith.\n\nI must express regret that we were unable, at our conference with the Deputy Minister, to reach a more definite decision on the status and future of the Mount Elgin Institute. I want to state quite definitely that this school has given me a great deal of worry and anxiety, and as intimated to you at the time of your visit, the reports on file by officers of this Branch and by public school inspectors, in respect to the general condition of the buildings, fire hazard, etc., are, to say the least, very disturbing.\n\nThe condition of this building is due almost wholly to the limited funds at the disposal of the officials of this Branch for the repair and upkeep of residential schools during the last 15 year period. It appears to me to be somewhat difficult, even with the assistance of Inspector Young, to work out an educational program at this school, unless we have definite information with respect to the amount of money that is likely to be placed at our disposal for the construction and upkeep of Indian day schools during the next 10 or 15 year period. What I am afraid of, in the case of Mount Elgin, is that it may be kept open and in operation in its present dilapidated condition almost indefinitely. It is my ambition, however, to do everything humanly possible.\n\nRev.

I would like to work out, with Inspector Arneil, the Indian Agent and the newly appointed Principal, an arrangement with respect to the operation of the school farm and the use of certain farm buildings. I would also like to investigate for myself the suitability of the old building, or part of the old building, for dormitory accommodation, should the money be available to proceed with the construction of an up-to-date, well equipped classroom building. Should the limited time at my disposal enable me to undertake this trip, I shall be glad to call upon you at Toronto and discuss the whole matter with you at that time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

S.H. Soper, M.A. Mr. Soper is now a minister at Parry Sound, but he has had considerable experience in the mission field in West China. On that field he was in charge of a large school for boys, which has many of the same characteristics as our Indian schools in Canada. The training followed agricultural lines, and in this Mr. Soper was quite successful. He graduated from the University of Toronto in 1912, but later took his M.A. in Rural Sociology.\n\nIt is our considered judgment that Mr. Soper can do a very fine piece of work, not only in carrying on the work of the School, but in making possible co-operation between various persons who are interested in the programme of Indian education. It may be of particular interest to you that one of his projects in West China had to do with the introduction of a special breed of goats to provide milk for the Chinese children. He ought to feel at home on the Munsey Reserve.\n\nWe shall be glad to have your confirmation of this nomination.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLP\nOttawa, June 19, 1944.\n\nRe: Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 16, in which you nominate the Reverend S.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nREPORT ON SURVEY OF INDIAN EDUCATION ON RESERVES IN WESTERN ONTARIO\n\nThe Survey consisted of:\n\n1. Visits to schools and homes on the Muncey, Oneida, Six Nations, Cape Crocker, Sangen, Kettle Point, Sarnia and Walpole Island Reserves;\n2. Conferences with teachers and agents on these reserves;\n3. Visits to the Mohawk Institute and Mount Elgin Residential Schools;\n4. Written reports from five public school inspectors who visit these reserves \u2014 Messrs. J.G. Webster, Brantford; J.M. Gane, Walkerton; Geo. A. Pearson, Chatham; H.B. Galpin, Sarnia; and D.C. Smith, London.\n5. Examination of reports relating to enrolment, attendance and progress of pupils in the schools on these reserves;\n6. Reading of reports of other surveys in Canada and United States.\n\nPoints Revealed by this Investigation\n\n1. Indians who had attended Residential Schools appear to be very successful in later life although the younger Indians appear to drift back into old habits and customs for a time after graduation. They appear to find the progress of changing from a life where all features of it were ordered by the institution to one of absolute freedom on the reserve a very difficult adjustment and naturally so. It is not surprising if for a time they \"run wild\".\n\n   The older Indians who are so successful were usually individuals who entered the residential school about 12 or 15 years of age after having attended Day Schools near their homes. They also report that they were given opportunities of practising leadership among their fellow students and some opportunity of doing some advanced academic work in addition to good training in agricultural and vocational subjects. They prize the religious training received in these institutions. In their day at these schools the proportion of younger children was not so large as today.\n\n2. There is a tendency today among many families to evade the responsibility of the training and raising the children by sending, or wishing to send, their children to the residential school.\n\n3. Indian Agents at several of the reserves believe that the orphans and children from broken homes can be accommodated in Indian homes on the reserve and can receive their elementary education at the local Day Schools.\n\n4. Your committee believe that for children from Grades I to V or VI depending on the age of the children, a home atmosphere is superior to that of an institution for the natural development of the children, unless the home conditions are very adverse.\n\n5. The education of Indian children requires teachers who understand these children, who have some knowledge of their back ground, who are sympathetic and who have sufficient training to enable them to adjust the curriculum and management of the school to the particular needs.\nof the children. These teachers ought to be able to conduct elementary classes, at least, in Handwork, Home Economics, Agriculture, Art and Music. They require special K.P. Training and ability to overcome language difficulties.\n\n(6) Generally teachers in Indian schools do not have these qualifications. Frequently they are selected without proper regard to qualifications and occasionally against the advice of the local inspector.\n\n(7) Some of the Day Schools have a very ample supply of necessary teaching equipment and books for supplementary reading. Many have a very inadequate or unsuitable supply of these things. In a general way the best service occurs where the Indian Agent and the local inspector work in closest co-operation. The Agent has so many other details and interests to take his attention that we should not be surprised when he fails to give this matter the consideration it requires.\n\n(8) Attendance at the Residential Schools is much better than at Day Schools. Attendance Officers with authority to enforce attendance are necessary.\n\n(9) The provincial course of study needs to be modified for Indian schools. We believe that properly trained teachers with adequate supervision can make the necessary adjustments. Especial attention to Art and Crafts, Home Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture, Art and Music should be required.\n\n(10) A Senior School or Senior Room could provide these in more detail for senior pupils and at the same time provide training in leadership, religion, sports and more advanced academic subjects.\n\n(11) This would leave more opportunity to overcome the language difficulty and the retardation in the earlier grades.\n\n(12) Our Residential Schools are planned as Vocational Schools. The enrolment indicates that they are being used in a large measure as orphanages or children's shelters. The large proportion of small children interferes with the other purpose of the school and the young children tend to be neglected for part of the day. The younger children receive more and better attention in a school planned for them. The school for older pupils could serve their needs more adequately if a sufficient number of them were present to carry out the plans of the school as they are intended to work. As it is today the pupils who are able to do the work on the farm and in the house are required to do more work than should be required. There is not sufficient emphasis on the necessity of producing sufficient to keep the institution running.\n\n(13) The education of the children is linked up with the progress in general on the reserve and has many other factors on each reserve affect the efficiency of the work of the schools. Where parents are able to work at home on the reserve, the attendance at school is not subject to the same interruption as in the cases where the parents have to leave the reserve for certain periods in order to earn a living.\n\nThe progress of the people and their outlook on the future has an important effect on their attitude toward the school.\nThe response of the children to any educational plans for their improvement is affected favourably or adversely in an important measure by this attitude of the folks at home. Every improvement in the life of the adults will lead to better results in our schools. In this field the Indian Agents generally give good service. Their main efforts appear to be spent in plans for the improvement of living and working conditions among their charges. This work has an important bearing on education; as these conditions improve, the parents will give increasing sympathy and moral support to the work of the schools, creating a more receptive attitude among the pupils. It may be possible to develop a co-ordination of the work of the Agent and the teacher so that each will aid the other in the main objective \u2014 to develop good citizens of Canada among our Indian people.\nMunsee and Oneida Reserves (Cont.)\n\nII. Mount Elgin Residential School\n\n(1) The enrolment is too small for continued operation under present plans.\n\n(a) The per capita payment is insufficient to maintain the school;\n(b) This forces too much labour on the pupils (profit rather than educational policy becomes the object of this work);\n(c) This condition is aggravated by the presence of so many younger children;\n(d) The staff has been reduced; school hours are reduced; and the staff increased for all.\n\nIt is but fair to note that these conditions have been aggravated by the present general prosperity due to war conditions when older pupils find jobs so easily. We doubt that these conditions will be permanently as bad as they are now, but we do believe that they will continue to affect the efficiency and usefulness of the school.\n\n(e) The enrolment has been reduced also by the policy of sending only pupils from broken or disrupted homes.\n\n(2) The main building is still serviceable and can be modernized for the use indicated below. The old school building possibly should be abandoned and removed.\n\n(3) Eventually a new modern class-room building as suggested below should be provided.\n\n(4) Agents on other reserves intimate that orphans and children from disrupted homes can be taken care of in other homes on the reserve. This leaves a small number from the Caradoc Agency who could be accommodated at Mohawk Residential School.\n\n(5) We recommend that Mount Elgin Residential School be closed as such and used as indicated below.\n\nIII. Senior School\n\n(1) We recommend that a Senior School partly Residential and partly Day be established at Mount Elgin.\n\n(2) This school will accommodate Grades VI and VII to X from Caradoc Agency as Day Pupils and from outside agencies as Residential Pupils. Residential privileges may be open to Caradoc pupils.\n\n(3) Pupils from Grades I to V or VI on these reserves to attend day school.\n\n(4) Course of Study \u2014 Grade VI or VII to X \u2014 Courses of Ontario modified so as to include much vocational training\u2014\n\nBoys: Agriculture, General Shop, Motor Mechanics.\nGirls: Home Economics, Home Nursing, Sewing (Dress-making as well as mending), Gardening and care of Poultry.\n\nIn addition to a good general training in English, Mathematics, Health Practices, Science of ordinary living, Social Studies (including Indian Life and History) Art, Music, Physical\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nMuncey and Oneida Reserves (Cont.)\n\nIII. Senior Rooms (Cont.)\n\nTraining and Recreation.\n\nFor pupils having the necessary academic ability and ambition, special provision for qualifying for entrance to the higher grades in local High Schools should be available.\n\nThe practice in Agriculture, Gardening, Poultry Management, Home Economics, Sewing etc., may be provided by participation in the work on the farm, and in the residence school dormitories. Emphasis to be placed on the training rather than the profits from the work.\n\n(5) The development of responsibility in the Senior pupils can be obtained or at least encouraged by giving them responsibilities to discharge in connection with work and supervision of younger pupils and as leaders in social and religious activities and in games and recreative activities.\n\n(6) Day pupils as well as residential pupils will be required to work on the farm on Saturdays and holidays as needed. This work has a double purpose \u2014 part of the training and part of the prize of the opportunity of attending.\n\n(7) The Present Plant at Mount Elgin\u2014\n\n(a) The main building (now used for dormitories, office etc.) can be used temporarily for these purposes until such time as a modern class-room building can be provided. Part of the present staff can be utilized. The provision of the new class-room building should be made at the earliest opportunity as this suggestion in this section is made only for the purpose of continuing service while the change is being made or until war restrictions are removed.\n\n(b) We believe that the present dormitory space is ample for future needs for an indefinite period, but that it should be remodelled for the use of Senior pupils by making the following changes:\n\n(1) Divide the space into rooms for two pupils with storage accommodations for personal belongings. This can be done without altering the present position of the windows.\n\n(2) Part of the area can be fitted up to serve as a wash-room and lavatory with modern sanitary and bathing facilities.\n\n(3) There is also sufficient space for a Common Room on this floor.\n\n(4) Rooms for academic and special classes can be provided in this building with very little changing.\n\n(5) We think that the dining-room might be on the main floor when the modern class-room building is provided.\n\n(6) The laundry may also be placed in this building.\nIV. A Voluntary Enrolment\n\nYour committee look for a change of atmosphere about the whole institution. We hope for the day when Indian parents and pupils will desire to attend such a senior school and count it a privilege to be admitted \u2014 one which can be held only by proper conduct and steady progress and application to studies. Instead of having to bring pupils back after they have run away from the institution, the principal may discharge those who refuse to conform to proper school practice. This will be the worst punishment that can be applied to the students of the future.\n\nWe realize that this vision involves great and important changes, but do not consider the ideal impossible of attainment. We further believe that the adoption of this report in its entirety will lead to a new day in Indian Education not only on the Munsey and Oneida Reserves but throughout Ontario Reserves and possibly all over Canada. We realize that we have merely indicated the way and that others will develop and improve the ideas suggested far beyond either our conception or our ability to conceive means of improving the schools devoted to Indian Education.\n\nWe trust that the difficulties lying in the way of the adoption may not discourage those in authority from daring to make the attempt to carry out our suggestions.\nSuggested by Messrs. Joblin and Young\n\nGeneral.\n\nI. Teachers\n\n(a) Should be graduates of Normal Schools who are further prepared by:\n\n(1) The training received by teachers of Auxiliary classes.\n(2) The training received by teachers of Kindergarten Primary Classes.\n(3) And one of Home Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture or Music.\n   (In normal peace time all of these courses are offered by Summer Schools in Ontario.)\n(4) Special training respecting Indian life, Indian outlook and objectives. (The plan for this training is outlined below)\n\n(b) Should have adequate salaries with superannuation \u2014 Salaries should be at least as high as teachers of white schools.\n   (In normal peace time the salaries have met this requirement)\nThe superannuation can be arranged in one of two plans: (1) That the Dominion pay the provinces the contribution just as boards in Ontario do now and our Ontario Indian teachers be given the same status in the Ontario fund as the Ontario Teachers. This may require a special agreement between the province and the Dominion with respect to the contribution made from Provincial Funds. (2) That these teachers be admitted to the Dominion Civil Service Superannuation system, an agreement between the Dominion and the Province respecting the transfer of teachers from Ontario schools to Indian schools and vice versa be made.\n\n(c) Should have special training prior to entering Indian Schools. The summer school suggested below would serve this purpose. The teachers taking this course and agreeing to serve a definite period in Indian Schools would receive a living allowance, free tuition and transportation to the school.\n\n(d) Residential teachers are preferred. They can assist as community leaders or directors of community activities carried by the Indians themselves.\n\nII. Course of Study\n\nThe provincial course of study should be accepted as a guide. It has to be modified to suit the peculiar needs of individual pupils and localities. Teachers trained as suggested would be capable of making the necessary adjustments. It should include Indian Life and History in the Social Studies.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nGeneral (Continued)\n\nIII. Day Schools\n\nDay schools near Indian homes to care for children from Grades I to V or VI.\n\nThese schools should have a definite programme aimed at overcoming the retardation which at present exists in Grades I to III.\n\n(a) The language difficulty can be partially overcome by the use of \"Experience Reading\" used extensively in Bi-Lingual Schools.\n\n(b) Regular attendance to be enforced\u2014a bright interesting programme in which pupils succeed will improve this defect.\n\n(c) Objective methods of teaching used more extensively will lead to better success and greater interest.\n\n(d) These schools may have an ample supply of materials for objective teaching and for experience reading. Good readers for the purpose may not be as readily available as we who teach white children imagine.\n\n(e) There should be much hand work of a simple nature. As the abilities of the children develop more complex work may be undertaken. Some Indian children are quite adept at an early age.\n\nFor Grades VI or VII to X a senior room or senior school is preferred. This may not always be possible, and the senior classes may have to be included with the juniors. Where possible we recommend that the senior Room or School emphasize training in Crafts (Art, Manual Training), or simple shop activities, Home Nursing, Gardening and Agriculture, Music. The options will be determined very largely by the community.\n\nIf the Junior School has accomplished the conquest of retardation, the Senior Room or School will be able to carry most Indian Children to Grades IX or X and accomplish much more than is possible at present.\n\nSome of the very capable pupils may make definite preparation for Senior Grades in neighbouring High Schools, but only very capable pupils should be granted this opportunity.\n\nIV. Appointment of Teachers\n\nAppointment of teachers to be made by the Department on advice, recommendation or approval of local inspector or educational superintendent\u2014to be free from political influence entirely.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nMuskeg and Oneida Reserves\n\nI. General Superintendent of Education.\n\nWe recommend the training and appointment of a general superintendent of education for these reserves.\n\n(a) He should be a man with knowledge and experience among Indians, interested in and sympathetic with their problems and difficulties; with good academic training and religious leadership.\n\n(b) Train this man (if necessary) by giving him six months at the College of Education, Department of Education and Special Classes at Toronto.\n\nAt the College of Education he would be directed to reading related to the work required of him: supervision, administration, etc. He would attend lectures on special methods in subjects \u2014 particularly public school subjects. He would have frequent consultations with professors on matters relating to the work to be done.\n\nAt the Department of Education he would have consultations with inspectors of auxiliary branch. Methods, organization and administration would be subjects of these consultations.\n\nAt Special Classes \u2014 Auxiliary, Manual Training, Home Economics, Kindergarten Training. Visits and observations followed by discussions with teachers and principals. Similar visits to the Normal School and observation of teacher training and practice teaching.\n\n(c) Either pay this man an adequate salary; or assume the cost of training; during the training period. (Cost of training to include tuition, if any; living allowance and transportation). Pay him an adequate salary when he begins his duties.\n\n(4) Duties of this Superintendent.\n\n(1) To supervise the work of the teachers \u2014 directing them in the adaptation of the school programme to the needs of the pupils; in the selection of methods; in the organization of the school and assisting them in this work.\n\n(2) To organize and direct special activities in the schools \u2014 Bandwork, Home Economics, Agriculture, Music etc., and assist teachers to do this.\n\n(3) To supervise and organize social and religious activities in the reserve among adults in co-operation with the Indian Agent and the churches.\n\n(4) To organize and direct a Summer School for special training of teachers of schools for Indians for the following year. Teachers from other reserves to be sent to this summer school.\n\n(5) To advise, recommend or approve all applications for teachers of Indian Schools on these reserves before acceptance.\n\n(6) To organize and supervise the establishment and management of a Senior School.\nMr. W. S. Arneil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nIn reply to your letter of December 28, I may state that I called Dr. Dorey this morning and he has suggested that we meet him at his office on Friday, January 14, 1944. Rev. Mr. Joblin is ill with a cold today and I could not reach him by telephone but I understand that that day will suit him also. Dr. Dorey wants us to have lunch with him and Dr. Cochrane. I told him that we could arrange that when we reached his office.\n\nI expect to go to Toronto on Thursday evening and meet Dr. Greer in the morning before I go to Dr. Dorey's office. Possibly I shall arrange to stop at the Park Plaza hotel also. In any event I shall arrange for hotel accommodations for Mr. Joblin and myself.\n\nOur train arrives in Toronto about 11 p.m. so if you wish to get in touch with me before we go to Dr. Dorey's office, leave word with the secretary at Dr. Greer's office.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season, and with kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Public Schools.\nMr. W. S. Arnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Arnell,\n\nIn your recent letter you mentioned that we might be meeting with Dr. Dorey in Toronto early in January. May I suggest that the following dates be avoided? January 1 to 8 and also January 11. In the first period annually I meet the secretaries of the various school boards who bring their annual statements and claims for grants to my office or to central points in the county. On January 11 all the teachers are coming to Strathroy for an X-ray examination for tuberculosis. We are also holding a book display and having a dinner to which our Assistant Chief Inspector, Dr. J. D. Campbell, has been invited.\n\nI can be in Toronto on January 14th or any day after that as you and Dr. Dorey may agree. I hope that you may set the date very soon so that other arrangements may be made here.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Dr. Dorey for his information.\n\nWishing both of you a Happy New Year, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Public Schools.\nOttawa, December 28, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of December 6, re our meeting in Dr. Dorey's office in Toronto.\n\nIf you care to set a date as early in January as convenient to Mr. Joblin and yourself, and notify me by letter or wire stating the date of meeting, I will gladly comply. May I suggest that you phone Dr. Dorey to ensure that he will be in town for the proposed meeting?\n\nWhen in Toronto I usually stay at the Park Plaza Hotel. It is necessary to make a reservation for a room there giving a few days notice. I will look after my own reservation, and would appreciate your making the necessary accommodation arrangements for Mr. Joblin and yourself.\n\nWishing you the compliments of the season, and with kindest personal regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nOTTAWA,\nDecember 6, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nI duly received your letter of November 28th, and also your previous letter, which was kindly answered by Mr. Hoey during my absence from Ottawa. An arrangement was recently reached by Mr. Hoey and Dr. Dorey for a meeting in Dr. Dorey's office in Toronto early in January and I will be available to attend at any date set.\n\nIt would not appear necessary at the present time to come to Ottawa or, in fact, necessary to present your report personally, although perhaps a visit at a later date may be desired. The department's wish is, of course, to obtain a totally unbiased report on whether or not, in the best interests of the Indian population of South Western Ontario, the continuance of the Mount Elgin residential School is justified. The government feels this residential school has outlived its usefulness and it is now desired, if such is the case, to ascertain what type of education should replace this residential school and in your report a too comprehensive view of the subject is not expected.\n\nI am looking forward to meeting Mr. Joblin and yourself again. I will communicate with you later regarding the meeting date.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGordon Young, Esq.,\nSchool Inspector,\nStrathroy, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Arnell,\n\nWhen I wrote to you about three weeks ago, I had intended going to Toronto to meet Dr. Greer and discussing the problem of Indian Education with him. About the same time as I received the letter from Mr. Hoey, I received one from Dr. Dorey which indicated that he wanted to present a brief to the commission and discuss the brief with the commission. That meant that he expected that I should be accompanied by Rev. Mr. Joblin and that you should be there. In the meantime I have been proceeding with my own work after Mr. Joblin and I spent one day together at Muncey.\n\nI should like to have your advice before proceeding further. Am I authorized to take Mr. Joblin with me and pay his expenses? Can you meet us in Toronto soon and when? Any day in December will suit me except the 3rd and the 17th. All other engagements for the month are of such character that they can be set aside without any difficulty and on short notice.\n\nI have a general plan in mind for the solution of the problem but the details will be modified, no doubt, when the question is reviewed by Dr. Greer, Dr. Dorey and yourself. It may have too many impractical features. Both Mr. Joblin and I agree on it but he thinks that it is altogether too much to expect. That may be so but it was not the impression which your conversations left with me.\n\nThe general outlines of a report have been drafted but until I know the extent of detail which you wish to have included in it, I am too lazy to write it in full. Anyway it should not be completed until after I go to Toronto. I imagine that your Department would want me to go to Ottawa when it was presented for adoption but that may not be necessary. I may add, in conclusion, that this survey has been a pleasant and profitable experience for me and well worth any inconvenience it has caused this fall.\n\nTrusting that I may hear from you at an early date, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nStrathroy, Ontario,\nNovember 8th, 1943.\n\nM.

Qualification and Training of Teachers\n\n1. Brant - Teachers on Six Nations Reserve trained at Normal School. All hold First or Second Class Certificates - generally well qualified. Additional training in particular school; leadership like Manual Arts, special Summer Course, Art, Manual Training, First Aid Training, etc.\n\n2. East Middlesex - recommends special training for work with Indians. Summer school preferred. Correspondence courses would help. (Indian education, the objectives, social position and future of Indians). Suggest that the Government pay tuition and living costs for teachers of Indians taking provincial courses. Teachers should be trained in Indian schools for at least three years. Training should be held at one point under direction of experienced leaders among Indians. Suggest that K. P., Choral work and Manual Arts be the special courses.\n\n3. Lambton - Special training - Auxiliary Classes, K. P. and Manual Arts.\n\n4. Kent - The job requires the full time of the teacher. Does not favour special Summer Course for Indians and teachers.\n\n5. Bruce - Special Certificate - Art, Music, Home Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture. Underlined preferred. Special Summer Course - Special methods for teaching Indian Children.\n\nB. Employment and Remuneration\n\n1. Brant - Make position attractive enough to draw those who may make it their life's work. Pay teacher's cost of special training. The residence desirable - particularly when hiring a married man - desirable arrangement. Remuneration graded - increases available as experience demonstrates worth. Maximum to be attraction. Agent and Inspector co-operate in hiring teachers. System works in Brant.\n\n2. East Middlesex - recommends the plan used in Brant. Favours better salaries, living accommodations, superannuation, etc.\n\n3. Lambton - recommends same. Indian teachers should be paid $200 to $300 per year more than teachers of white schools in same locality. Increase should be based on Inspector's report.\n\n4. Kent - Objects to reduction of 1/10 by closing schools for one month - calls better pay. Dominion Government should consider them as Civil Servants and allow them to participate in Dominion Superannuation. Does not favour admitting them to provincial superannuation scheme.\n\n5. Bruce - Bruce citizens should be on plan. Should be one. Estimate - 21,000 rising by $100 to $1,500. Objects to present method of luring teachers. Inspectors recommendation should be observed and considered.\n\nC. Courses of Study\n\n1. Brant - Modify Provincial Course. Emphasize Arts and Crafts - have Economics, Manual Training, Agriculture. Social Studies - emphasis on Historical Background of Indian People.\n\n2. East Middlesex - No special suggestions but apparently has similar views.\n\n3. Lambton - Specified fundamentals in English, Arithmetic, Science, Geography and History of Canada and Britain. Arithmetic to be taught by extensive use of concrete material and practical applications of this subject. English of business and everyday life in community. 1/3 to time to be devoted to craft work - home economics and manual training.\n\n4. Upper Grand - Science should become Agriculture. Garden at every school planted and supervised with active co-operation of Agent. Agent should provide necessary supplies and become responsible for the appearance of the school grounds.\n\n5. Kent - Not satisfied with use of provincial course. It should be modified to meet their needs.\n\n6. Bruce - Similar to Brant.\nDe Institutional Training\n\n1. Brant - Impressed by work at Mohawk Institute. Likes the arrangement except for the lower grades. Proposes that half day system (half day school - half day work on farm) be deferred to Grade V.\n\n2. Kent Middlesex - No remarks.\n\n3. Lambton - No knowledge.\n\n4. Kent - No experience with Institution directly. Pupils return to reserves after leaving former mode of life. Suggests that graduates of institutions be encouraged live as self-supporting citizens and succeed away from the reserves. Appears to favour encouraging Indians to a definite movement from reserves to an independent successful life among whites. Believes that, given a fair chance, the Indian can take his rightful place as a citizen of our country.\n\n5. Bruce - Likes the practical courses given in institutions. No experience beyond a visit.\n\nE. On a Central School\n\n1. Brant - Not favourable - believes Grade IX at Day Schools merely wanted to prevent pupils from attending institutions. Favours a bus service to Brantford Collegiate for Grade IX and for such promising pupils as may be able to profit from more extended secondary school training to provide trained Indians as leaders, teachers, nurses, etc.\n\n2. Kent Middlesex - No comment.\n\n3. Lambton - No comment respecting central schools. Favours the continuing of secondary education at local High School or Collegiate Institute. Suggests that Department of Indian Affairs pay fees and collect the same from the parents.\n\nIf Department pays fees, it should guide the student in selecting his secondary school course.\n\n4. Kent - Favours a central school for senior pupils.\n\n1. It would give Day School teachers more time with juniors and thus overcome some of the retardation in the primary classes.\n\n2. A larger number of students could succeed.\n\n3. The cost of transportation or residence might be too heavy as to hinder the adoption of such a plan.\n\n5. Bruce - Such a plan is highly desirable where the population of the reserve warrants its adoption.\n\nF. General Remarks\n\n1. Brant - 1. Recommends addition of some effective means of enforcing more regular school attendance.\n\n2. Favors employment of the joint function. An inspector surgeon (traveling with school, etc.)\n\n3. Primary or Lower Grade teachers should be assigned to old reserves.\n\n2. Kent Middlesex - All graduates 1 and 2 given by Bruce. Adds that a large part should be adopted and trained with special training.\n\n3. Lambton - Suggests that the inspectors should be assisted by one of the following:\n\n1. By the local sanitary and hospital.\n\n2. By the local physician.\n\nThe Indian Agent may be another competent man interested in the welfare of the reserve. If such an individual exists, he should receive proper attention under present system. Reeves Nos. 1 and 3 of Report very definitely.\n\n4. Kent - Highest on Nos. 1 of Report.\n\n5. Bruce - No remark made here because of separation.\n\n6. Brant -\n\n1. Would need sufficient teachers in Indian schools nationally and provincially.\n\n2. One annual inspection not satisfactory. Inspectors at least two and their inspectors be persons to be most familiar to local superintendents.\n\n3. Inspectors in reserve districts so located that other equipment should receive attention and action.\nMinsey, Ont.,\nSept. 2, 1946.\n\nRev. R. B.

Until we convince the agents that we are what we are\u2014that is a Residential School\u2014we will not have the registration we need. I have visited Walpole Island and Kettle Point Agents the Walpole Island and Moravian Town agents as well as the local agent and find that the same idea persists that a child can be sent here only if from a broken home. If we could convince them that by sending pupils in need of vocational training they would help us to get more vocational training for all we might get somewhere, both Ottawa and the Agents will have to change their ideas of the Residential Schools before we will be able to do the work we can do to advantage.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Signed) S.

You will note that he is finding it difficult to persuade the Agents to send children for vocational training. I have told Mr. Soper that I do not think that Ottawa needs to change its idea of the residential school, as I think your policy is to have children go to residential schools\u2014not only from broken homes and so on\u2014but also for vocational training. I shall be glad if you will look into the matter and see if there is anything that can be done to further the registration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nOttawa, September 11, 1944.\n\nRe: Enrolment, Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and also copy of a letter received by Dr. Cochrane from the Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute, sent forward therewith.\n\nThe records here indicate that a number of our residential schools throughout the Dominion are experiencing difficulty this year in securing the number of pupils for which per capita grants are allowed by the Department. This difficulty can be attributed, in part at least, to prevailing economic conditions. At the time of my visit to Brantford a few weeks ago, I was informed that Indians were earning $10.00 a day in the tobacco fields and that a great many teen-age boys were engaged in this work.\n\nIn addition to existing economic conditions, there appears to be on the part of certain Indian agents in southwestern Ontario a deep-seated prejudice against residential schools in general and the Mount Elgin Institute in particular. This opposition or prejudice was very much in evidence at the conference of agents held by Inspector Arneil in Toronto early in 1943. As a matter of actual fact, I was the only one at that conference who spoke at all in favour of the courses provided at our residential schools. I did my best, in my own peculiar and awkward way, to remind the Indian agents that we had twelve million dollars invested in residential school buildings and that in this critical period it was their duty and responsibility to see that these institutions...\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W., Toronto 2 B, Ont.\nwere placed in a position where they could function effectively. I reminded them of the attempts we were making to promote vocational instruction at these schools and reminded them that, for the time being at least, it was almost impossible to secure day school teachers. It so happens that the agent at Sarnia and the agent at Walpole Island are both ex-Indian day school teachers and both appear to be strong supporters of the day school system. Neither you nor I have any particular objection to this, but I think in the case of Muncey they should look matters square in the face and act accordingly.\n\nJust what steps I can take to remedy this condition, I am not in a position to outline at the moment. I doubt very much the effectiveness of a formal letter. Inspector Arnell, with whom I have discussed the matter and who is particularly anxious that the new principal should be given a good chance, is at present absent at James Bay and will not return for a couple of weeks. When he does return, I shall discuss with him ways and means of securing the co-operation of certain agents in the enrolment of pupils, and it is just possible he may visit the district at that time. It is unnecessary to add that in view of the decision reached in respect to the operation of this school, at the office of the Deputy Minister a few weeks ago, it is the definite responsibility of this Department to do everything possible to co-operate with Mr. Soper in the operation and maintenance of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nMUNCEY, ONTARIO\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nMr. H. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nSince receiving your communication of August 12th, 1943-80 I have tried to locate your communications of Jan 29th, Feb 24th and May 8th 1943 re badges. I am interested in this matter and would like to have copies of these communications at your convenience. I have several boys who did splendid service here during the summer who may qualify.\n\nYou will be interested to know that with the help of one sixteen year old boy and seven 9, 10 and 11 years we have taken in the harvest, 150 tons of hay, 500 bushel of oats, 350 bushel of wheat, 700 bushel of barley, at the same time they have cared for the herd of 55 Holstein and forty hogs. We have taken off three hundred pounds of honey and more to come. We have put up nearly 1000 half gallon jars of tomatoes. It has been hard work, we are temporarily under staff.\n\nJust now we have in residence 65 students. From all the Reserves served by this school ONE NEW STUDENT has been admitted so far, a seven year old girl from the Oka Band sent in by Fr. Brisbois. I am told that there are a number of students who would like to come if permission were granted.\n\nMay I bring to your attention the fact that in my plans for vocational training I must have a larger enrollment of senior pupils. The grant from our department must be supplemented by very large income from the farm. I cannot afford to pay for extra help the work can only be done by boys and girls from 14 years and up. I have tried three pupils of that age on my own premises and do not wish in any case to leave them here and come to Residential School, but if all the Agents were to be convinced that by sending in here a larger enrollment of students that all students could then get the training in art, music, machineshop, poultry, bee keeping, animal husbandry and a host of other things then it might be that we could carry out our program. As long as the Agents regard this school as a Children's Aid Shelter only we will never be able to do the work we have in mind. Then again it follows that we cannot finance the school at all on less than one hundred and twenty students, nor can it be financed if we have one hundred and twenty-six to eleven years old. We must have more students and we must have more twelve to seventeen year old students. We can only have these students if the Agents are convinced that we are in dead earnest about vocational education.\n\nI have done everything possible in my power to co-operate. The proof that my efforts to co-operate are appreciated in the recommendation of more students.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have arranged with Mr Long, our Farm Manager, to allow the Welfare Department of the Caradoc Agency to take over the building known as the Brooder House for the steaming of Willow Wends. This meant that Mr. Long has had to go to considerable trouble and some expense to fit up a Brooder House in our own Chicken House. However, we are more than glad to cooperate as we are assured that when this project is in operation our students will get the benefit of the training in raising Willow Furniture. Here again it follows that if there is training to be obtained there must be students to take the training. Just now we have not enough senior students to do the house keeping for the great institution. We have a graduate Dietitian just out from Toronto University but she is so pressed with the actual work that very little time is left for teaching. We number only seven to seventeen year old girls and the girls in our school have been trained to share well enough to carry on with our present system. The half way system, using a large staff and our only efficient in an institution of this size on a minimum of one housekeeper only is a failure.\n\nI regret to have taken so much of your time in giving you my rather unofficial findings. I see that even if we here a longer time I may see things from a different standpoint, in the meantime we will do all we can to make this an efficient and happy home for the little folk entrusted to us.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I must state frankly, however, that I am not at all sure that we can do much to increase the enrolment at residential schools anywhere in the Dominion while war and other industries are prepared to pay teen-age boys and girls, including Indians, the high wages they appear to be paying at the moment.\n\nThe opinions you express with respect to vocational instruction, the desirability of having a greater number of senior pupils enrolled, etc., etc., are all in accord with my own views, and these views I have expressed on more than one occasion when speaking before groups of Indian agents.\n\nInspector Arneil is at present engaged in an inspection of the James Bay area. It is my intention, just as soon as Mr. Arneil returns from this trip, to discuss with him the problems enumerated in your letter. It is my hope also that Mr. Arneil will be able to discuss with a number of Indian agents, particularly the agents in southwestern Ontario, the worthwhile courses of vocational study that you are seeking to promote at the Institute. Until he can do so, may I state that having\n\nReverend S. H.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nOttawa:\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nMay I thank you for your prompt and careful attention to my letter of Sept 16th as indicated in your reply of the 19th.\n\nMay I suggest that while it is true that during the War Emergency bigger boys and girls will be needed in War Industry there must be a large number of younger children who might benefit by the training this school can give. As things now are the school must face an increasing deficit. We must properly provide for the students we have; this will entail heavy per capita expenditure. When the enrollment increases we will be carrying a heavy indebtedness. This will prevent the provision of the equipment needed for their efficient work and will even leave us understaffed until the farm can earn a deficit of six to ten thousand dollars. Even a small enrollment of thirty more junior students would help tide over the present emergency.\n\nWe have just completed the cleaning and emptying of the Latrines. This is a job that is increasingly difficult, simply because it is no more the common procedure. The girl's latrine is 90 yards from the dormitory; the boy's latrine is 220 yards from the dormitory. We must try to visualize just what that will mean in the matter of health of small children in winter weather. There is one bowl and two urinals for 40 boys and two bowls for fifty girls. This whole matter may have to be held in abeyance for the duration but should be on the immediate post War program.\n\nI shall be interested to receive the Badge Charts and will take the matter up with the staff at the very first convenient occasion.\n\nThanking you for your kind interest,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\nMemorandum:\n\nI inspected the Mount Elgin Residential School on the morning of October 13. Accompanied by the new Principal Mr. Soper, I visited all parts of the main building and the outbuildings. You are well aware of the condition of this building, but I can definitely state that it was in as good condition as possible under the circumstances.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at this school is 150, but up to the date of my visit only 86 pupils had been secured. I brought this matter to the attention of Inspector Amosell and when he visits reserves in Western Ontario he is going to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining if there are any other children requiring institutional care.\n\nI am submitting a special memorandum regarding the laundry pump and the report received from the Hydro Electric Power Commission regarding the wiring.\n\nIt will interest you to know that the school has 55 head of cattle, of which 30 are milking. They also have 43 pigs and 11 horses. It is almost impossible to sell the latter animals at the present time.\n\nWhen the electrical repairs are being made I directed the Principal to remove the locks from seven windows. These particular windows lead to the fire escapes and should be kept unlocked at all times.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOctober 25th 1944,\n\nMr. R.A.

Elgin Residential School, was run over by the School's truck.\n\nIt appears that the truck had been down to the village, and on the return trip the above-named pupil ran behind and either slipped, or fell, and the rear wheel passed over his leg causing a double fracture. Other pupils were around who picked the boy up and carried him into the School. Immediate emergency treatment was given and the lad's parents notified. Dr. Washburn was called and he placed the leg in a plaster bandage, after which arrangements were made for his removal to Victoria Hospital for X-Ray and necessary treatment. Owing to snow-blocked roads the removal was somewhat delayed. He was taken out on a westbound freight to the village of Melbourne and transferred to an ambulance for travel to the hospital.\n\nThere is no blame attached to anyone; all concerned feel that it was a regrettable, unfortunate accident. Mr. Soper assures me that it is a rule of the School that no student should run after, or climb on, a moving truck or car.

Sofer\nExcerpt from \"London Free Press\"\n\n\"Mohawk Institute Changes Discussed\n\nCertain proposals to reorganize the school and change its character from a religious foundation to an exclusively educational one have been made. Through the help of the bishops throughout Canada the Indian Department has stated that it is prepared to continue its annual capital grant to the school as soon as new arrangements are made with the New England Company, if the M.S.C.C. of the Diocese of Huron will become responsible for its administration. It is expected that this question will be settled on May 22, Archbishop Seamer stated. Then an agreement with the New England Company, whose interests in the school are material, will be sought.\n\nA delegation from the Indian Department at Ottawa and the United Church of Canada visited the school with a view of considering changes by which the pupils of the United School at Mount Elgin might be transferred to the Mohawk Institute. It was proposed that the head of the institution should be primarily an educationalist and one with special equipment in agriculture. Provision was to be made for the religious needs of the children through the appointment of chaplains. This aspect of the proposal has been dropped.\"\nJune 1st,\n1945.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Mount Elgin Residential School\n\nI visited the School last week-end and went into certain aspects of its operation with the Principal. The Auditor has just completed his visit and I hope that the report which he has to make will be in the hands of the Department very soon.\n\nThe financial situation - that is so far as cash transactions are concerned - is getting worse. The overdraft has increased. The actual situation of the School, having regard to its liabilities and assets, is undetermined, as we have not tried to estimate either the extent of the assets nor whether they have increased during the year. In any case, this would only be of value if we were going to close the school and thus have to know whether we had sufficient assets to meet our liabilities.\n\nWe must face the situation for the coming year, because it seems obvious that there will be increased difficulty in keeping up the pupilage, and we certainly cannot continue to operate at the present rate. I have made a very hasty comparison between the Receipts and Expenditures for the period, May 1st, 1943, to April 30th, 1944 - for which there is the last audited statement - and the year April 1st, 1944, to March 31st, 1945, which is the last fiscal year for which you will have a report. I find that the School has been operated with very little, if any, increase in expenditure, but there has been a drop in receipts of over $3,000, in the per capita payments. These figures are by no means audited, but they do, I think, show the situation.\n\nTo make matters worse, there recently appeared in the London Free Press a somewhat lengthy statement by the Archbishop of Huron in his address to the Synod of the Diocese of Huron. In this statement the Archbishop said that a crisis had arisen in the history of the Mohawk Institute. I am attaching to this letter a copy of the two main paragraphs in the Archbishop's statement. Our people have been stirred up by the fact that the Archbishop said that changes had been considered by which the pupilage of Mount Elgin School would be transferred to the Mohawk Institute. From the statement, I gather that the Anglicans are going to operate the School. Whilst I am in no position to speak for The United Church of Canada as a whole, it is my considered judgment that one residential school for the Protestant Indians of Southern Ontario is quite sufficient; but I am equally sure that it should not be operated either by the United Church or the Church of England, if we are to have any sort of good understanding. I expect to be in Ottawa next Thursday and will be glad to have the opportunity of going into the matter with you.\n\nP.S.\nOur Executive will meet on June 29th, and I must at that time bring the matter of the continued operation of the Mount Elgin School, under the present circumstances, before the meeting. I should be glad to have the opinion of the Department to assist us in coming to a conclusion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMD.MLT\nIndian Affairs.

I felt then that the enrolment necessary at this school and at the Mohawk Institute could only be assured by the exercise of compulsion, and I could not convince myself then that children in attendance at school under compulsion could profit in any satisfactory sense from the instruction provided. There is, as you say, room for only one Protestant school in Southwestern Ontario.\n\nThe M.S.C.C., at their last meeting, decided that the new lease sent forward to the New England Company for execution is acceptable to them. Immediately following this decision, however, the Bishop of Huron informed me by wire that he had made an offer to the New England Company, offering to operate the Mohawk Institute provided the Government continued to pay the regular per capita grant. This attitude on the part of the Bishop creates a somewhat unusual and somewhat embarrassing problem for all of us. I am writing at this time in the hope that you might find it convenient to discuss the matter with Canon Dixon prior to your visit to Ottawa on Thursday next. If you could see your way clear to do this, such action on your part will be greatly appreciated by me personally.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, East,\nTORONTO, Ontario,\n\nIndian Affairs.

It took considerable time to correct all the errors and to balance each month. However, I was able to arrive at the true balance at April 30th and to give the Principal a new start from May 1st. I pointed out to the Principal the errors he had made and showed him a simple method of balancing the cash book at the close of each month. He dislikes figures and according to him he finds it a real task in his attempt to keep books.\n\nThe books and records were recorded up to April 30th, 1945, but the synoptic cash book was out of balance and poorly kept.\n\nThe school is in a poor financial condition. The net deficit for the year was $3,729.45.\n\nThe Principal has arranged, through the Secretary of the United Church Mission Board, Toronto, to carry an overdraft with the Bank of Montreal, St. Thomas, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 1, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the Indians on the Muncey Reserve.\n\nI visited this reserve last week and believe that at the present time the Indians are reasonably prosperous and the majority of them are enjoying good health.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute at Muncey, Ont., is operated as an Indian Residential School, under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. James Anthony,\nExeter, Ont.\nJanuary 23rd,\n1946.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Mount Elgin Residential School\n\nI regret to say that, due to a variety of causes, I have omitted writing you about the Mount Elgin School until it is almost too late. Our Executive will meet on Friday, and I want to place before it the matter of the future of the School, based on your letter of October 22nd, and also the memorandum which I received, dated November 14th. As I see it, our Executive would like to know:\n\n1. Whether the Department would like to carry through in principle the recommendations of the Special Report made by Inspector Young and submitted February 18th, 1944. These are in general:\n\n(a) The discontinuance of the Mount Elgin School as a residential school as at present carried on.\n\n(b) The taking care of the educational needs of the Indian people by the establishment of a Senior School on the Muncey Reserve, with a set-up as outlined in the Report mentioned above, with such modifications as the present situation may require.\n\n(c) The taking care of the children that cannot, for various reasons be accommodated in day schools in a way that would be satisfactory to the Church authorities.\n\nI have in mind that there are on the Caradoc Reserve some children who would find it very difficult to get to school and for whom transportation should be provided; and that in attendance at the Mount Elgin School there are children whose parents are dead or who come from broken homes. In our conversations at various times, it has been suggested that these would be taken care of either by adoption or by being taken into an already existing school, such as the Mohawk Institute. I might point out that this would probably entail careful supervision, either through the Children's Aid Society or through the appointment of an officer of the Department who would act towards these\n\np.t.o.\nchildren as an officer of the Children's Aid Society would in other parts of the Province.\n\nYou will realize that our Executive must make a definite decision, because, if the School is to be discontinued as at present carried on, we ought to give notice to all concerned at the present time and make provision for the staff.\n\nIf the School is to be carried on for another period of twelve months after June 30th, I feel sure that our Executive would like to know, so that it can deal with certain financial matters which have arisen.\n\nI shall be glad if you will give consideration to this and let me have an answer, if possible, by air mail, special delivery, in time for our Executive, which will meet on Friday.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCD.MLT\nAIR MAIL\nSPECIAL DELIVERY\n\nOttawa, January 24, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nRe: Mount Elgin Residential School,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 23rd, in which you seek information with respect to the administration of the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nIn view of the fact that your letter has just come to my desk, it is possible this reply may not reach you in time for the meeting of your Executive.\n\nIt is our intention to discontinue the operation of the school as a residential school on or about June 30th. Provision has been made in the estimates now under consideration for the construction of a four-room Indian day school, to be erected on a site not yet definitely selected. Provision will be made for the transportation by bus of pupils living beyond walking distance of the school. It is our intention to make provision for orphan pupils either by adoption on the reserve or by enrolment at the Mohawk Institute or by the utilization of both these agencies. No definite decision has yet been reached with respect to the future of the Mohawk Institute. The representative of the New England Company has found it impossible to secure transportation facilities to this country and has asked the Government to defer its decision until his arrival. I am still confident that an arrangement satisfactory to all parties concerned will be worked out at Brantford.\n\nThe decision reached with respect to the establishment of the consolidated school at Caradoc was based to some extent on the assumption that a fully qualified educationist would be nominated by you to act as principal of the\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBecause of the closing of the Mt. Elgin Residential School and the lack of information concerning the plans for the future, there are many questions in your minds. It will be the chief purpose of this News Sheet to answer those questions as soon as answers are available for them. Your Director of Education, Rev. E.E.M. Joblin, is particularly anxious that you should have a part in developing and carrying out any plans for the education of your young people. This means that you should have all possible information from time to time. At the earliest possible date, a public meeting will be arranged for the discussion of these matters. In the meantime, the News Sheet will try to fill the gap.\n\nWith respect to the Day Schools which have been in operation, the teachers of last year have all been engaged for the coming term, and it is assumed that school will open in September as usual. The next date will be announced later.\n\nFor the new school, the excavating has been completed and we are assured that the new building will be ready for use some time in the fall. The Director has recommended that the senior pupils begin their terms at the proper time and carry on in the classrooms of the old building until the new school is ready. This has not yet been confirmed by the School and Training Division, however. Transportation has been promised for those who need it.\n\nVery little definite information can yet be given, but it is hoped that the new school will be reasonable at least for pupils from Grade VII to X. It is quite important therefore that the Director be notified of those pupils who want to attend the school for the work of Grade IX or X. Those who failed in a grade will be able, we hope, to take the subjects they need to complete the grade in addition to each work of the next grade as they are able to do. Pupils who have been out of school and are interested in returning for either academic or practical training, should see Mr. Joblin. One of the main guiding principles of the new system is that the school programme should be adjusted to the needs of the pupils. You can help us to determine those needs. The Director will welcome your suggestions and opinions as to the educational needs of our young people.\n\nIt is expected that Mr. Lloyd Johnson will be continued as teacher in the Senior School. Other teachers will be secured depending on the enrolment and type of work to be taken.\n\nIncidentally, Rev. Joblin and I would like to thank you for the warm welcome we received from so many of you since returning to Muncey. We look forward to many pleasant associations with you in the life of the Church, School and Community. I have set up an office in the old school building where you may find me from 9 a.m. to noon from Monday to Friday at least until Sept 1st. Office hours will doubtless have to be altered after the two weeks.\n\nRev. E.E.M. Joblin, M.A., B.D.,\nDirector of Education;\nOttawa, August 15, 1946.\n\nMr. O.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nTeacher Training Course for Indian School Teachers\n\nThe Department hereby authorizes the organization of a short teacher training course as discussed at our meeting of August 13th. Therefore, you can inform the teachers concerned that they will be required to attend these courses during the period September 3rd or 4th to 6th (as can be decided by Reverend Mr. Joblin and yourself).\n\nThe official opening of all the schools in your agency will, therefore, be September 9th.\n\nBernard F.

Beatty,\nDirector of the Education Division of the United States\nIndian Service. I hope that you will find the material of\nuse in the course which you are conducting for the Indian\nteachers of Caradoc Agency.\n\nI intend to use much of this material for our\nproposed Indian School Bulletin. We have received permission\nto use this material for our Canadian Indian education.\n\nUnfortunately, we only have two copies of this book\navailable at present. Therefore, would you please return it\nto me when you have finished, as I intend to send it to our\nInspector of Indian schools in British Columbia. However, if\nyou like this book, submit the usual requisition form for it\nand I will have one purchased and sent to you.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 26 October 1946.\n\nDear Miss Inwards:\n\nI have received your letter of Oct. 22nd and I am enclosing one of our regular application forms for completion by you.\n\nWould you be interested in a position as teacher of the new continuation school we are building on the Cariboo Agency at Muncey, Ontario, (near London). The new building will not be ready for occupancy until the spring. However, in the meantime, we are opening the school within the next few days in the former Mount Sinai Residential School which is right beside the new school.\n\nWe expect to have some 70 students in grades 7, 8, 9, and possibly 10. There would be one other full-time teacher besides yourself and the principal who will teach part-time. There are living quarters in the school building and possibly you could arrange to board with the principal.\n\nThis is a day school and the Principal is the Rev. R.F. Joblin, M.A., who was formerly the United Church minister on the Reserve. There is also an Anglican Church nearby and the minister is a great friend of Mr. Joblin's.\n\nWe can offer you a starting salary of either $31.00 a teaching month or $37.00 a teaching month depending upon your actual experience.\n\nHoping to hear from you further in this regard,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nMiss Mary K.

Investigation is continuing in this regard. S.U.I.\n\nTORONTO (A.G. Marsom) Supt.,\n15-11-48 WB. Comig. \"O\" Div'n.\nOn this date Mr. G.J. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont., contacted the writer and stated that some of the buildings at the above school had been broken into during the previous night and a quantity of goods were missing. He asked that this detachment make an investigation regarding the matter.\n\nA patrol was made to the school by S/Cst. Minham and the writer and it was learned that a battery from a tractor had been taken. This tractor was in a locked garage and lock had been forced. Also missing from this garage was a five gal. can of gasoline. There was also a farm wagon in the implement shed and the two back wheels and tires of this wagon had been taken. These tires and wheels were practically new. The tires were Firestone Rib Implement tires - 6.00 x 16. The implement shed was not locked. From the blacksmith shop there was a small tool box full of tools missing and a cupboard containing an assortment of tools had been broken into and a number of tools were missing. This cupboard was locked and the lock had been prior off. The door of the blacksmith shop was broken on the morning of the 5-11-46 but it was not known whether it had been definitely broken on the night of the 4-11-46. The lock bore no signs of being tampered with and it is thought possible that it might have been closed but had not caught. All the locks on the doors and cupboard were ordinary padlocks.\n\nIt is not definitely known what tools are missing other than that it is believed they are mostly wrenches. These tools belong to Mr. Bush, farm instructor and he is away at the present time.\n\nA close examination was made for finger prints or foot prints and nothing was found. There were some tire marks at the far end of the yard and it is believed that they may be the marks of the car that was used by the person or persons who committed the thefts. However, they were of very little value.\n\nExtensive inquiries have been made both on and off the Reserve regarding this theft but to date no information has been obtained that would indicate who the guilty person or persons are, nor where the goods are. It is thought that it is all probably that some of the Indians from the local Reserves are responsible for this theft and that they will have cached the goods in bush or some out of the way spot. Searches of likely places have been made but nothing has been gained.\n\nInquiries are continuing in this matter and a further report will be submitted to meet the aforementioned diary date.\n\nS/Cst.,\nD.O. 19-12-46.\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\n46 D-652-6-E 38\n\nOTTAWA, November 20, 1946\n\nTo: The Director, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nReport dated 8/11/46 from Muncey, Ont.,\nforwarded for your information, re B.E. & Theft from Mount Elgin Residential School, Muncey, Ont.\n\nEnc.\n\nDirector, Criminal Investigation.\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fulton about the other articles found in the car he stated that he\nhad found part of an ear ring in the Ford and on examination it was found\nto be the missing broken part of the case found in the Chevrolet. Also\nthe tire chains found in the Chevrolet belonged to the Ford recovered by\nCst. Fulton and Cst. Chipley.\n\n6. It was then decided to pick up RILEY and GROSSHECK for questioning.\nAccordingly they were both located at the home of RILEY but denied\nany knowledge regarding the theft of the two cars. A search was made of\nRILEY'S home and the out buildings and fields and a large quantity of\nstolen goods were found. These goods consisted mostly of cigarettes and\ntobacco, toys, tools, flashlights and approximately eight bicycles. Also\nfound were two pairs of ear rings which were the same as those found in\nDownie's car. Also recovered was the .22 rifle which was used in the hold\nup at Stratford. A brother of Lyte RILEY, Samuel, was placed under arrest\nby Cst. Fulton as he had a small quantity of cigarettes and tobacco and some\nwatch bands on his person.\n\n7. A search was also made of GROSSHECK'S home but nothing was found\nin the way of stolen goods. Cst. Chipley found a pair of trousers belonging\nto GROSSHECK and which appear to have blood stains on them. It is believed\nthat these were the trousers he was wearing the day of the hold up at\nStratford.\n\n8. Both these boys, RILEY is 16 years of age and GROSSHECK is 18,\nwere questioned at some length regarding the stolen goods and a number of\nthefts in the district and also several car thefts but both denied any\nknowledge of any of them. RILEY claimed that he found all the goods in\nthe rush on the afternoon of the 7-13-46 and that was all he would say.\n\n9. On 9-13-46 all three boys appeared in County Court, London, on\na charge of vagrancy and were remanded until 17-13-46 at which time it is\nexpected they will be charged with the hold up at Stratford and several\nthefts.\n\n10. In the P.M. of the 9-13-46 a further search was made of the\npremises of RILEY and GROSSHECK and the surrounding bush and fields and a\nfurther quantity of goods were found. This search was conducted by Csts.\nFulton, Corridors, Chipley and Brooks, O.P.J., assisted by members of this\ndetachment. A quantity of tools, car heaters, horns, tires and wheels from\nstolen cars, etc., were found.\n\n11. Although none of the goods stolen from the above school have\nbeen found there appears to be little doubt that these two boys are the\nonly responsible.

Searches of the bush were made in an effort to locate the car but was nothing found.\n\nOn 2-13-46 information was received from Cst. Carmichael O.P.P., that a 1940 Plymouth coach was abandoned on No. 2 highway and that stolen license plates were on this car. In company with Cst. Carmichael a patrol was made and the car located. Inquiries revealed that this car had been stolen at Courtland, Ont. near Delhi, Ont. A search of the vicinity was made and a number of articles were found hidden in the ditch. There were a number of jacks, wrenches and a number of records together with an old phonograph. Also found was a five gallon can of gasoline together with a funnel. A check revealed that this can and funnel were the ones missing from the school. Inquiries failed to reveal any information regarding who the person or persons might be that abandoned the car.\n\nOn the 7-15-46 information was received from Cst. Fulton, O.P.P., Strathroy, regarding a stolen 1933 Ford V8 and he asked that members of this detachment be on the look out for this car in case it turned up in the district. Cst. Fulton advised that two men had held up the owner of the car earlier in the day and robbed him of five dollars and had beaten him. They were carrying a .22 rifle and had clubbed him with this together with a cane and a piece of heavy stick. They had also taken a small mantel radio from his house.\n\nIn the fall of the 8-13-46 one Cecil Cadiz (Indian) drove a 1946 Chevrolet to the detachment and stated that he and two companions had found this car hidden in heavy brush while out hunting. Inquiries were made regarding this car and it was learned that it had been stolen near Tillsonburg during the early AM of 6-12-46 and that it belonged to one Eddie Downie, R.R. #1, Nodaway, Ont. In the car were found two tires, 1 Goodyear tire, 6.00 X 16, Ser. No. 64J9833, 1 Seiberling tire, 6.00 X 16, Ser. No. 6704795 and 1 Seiberling tube, 6.00 X 16. One set of tire chains were also found. There was also a number of wrenches and a tire wrench and jack. On closer examination four pairs of cheap car rims were found and there was one of these broken. On making further inquiries regarding this car it was learned that a 1935 Ford V8 had been seen on the Reserve about 8:00 AM this date and although it was not definite it was believed that one Lyle Riley and Hubert Greenock (Indians) were in the car. Cst. Fulton was immediately notified and he, together with Csts. Shipley and Carmichael patrolled to Nodaway. Cst. Fulton stated that they had recovered the 1933 Ford V8 near Homoka about 11:00 AM this date. On examining the two rear tires on Downie's car Cst. Fulton stated that tire marks near where the Ford had been abandoned were visible.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO. 46 D 652-6 E 38\n\nOTTAWA, Dec. 23, 1946.\n\nTO The Director, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources OTTAWA.\n\nReport dated Muncey, Dec. 11th,\nforwarded for your information, re: B.E. & Theft From Mount Elgin\nResidential School, Muncey, Ont., being further to ours of the\n20th ultimo.\n\nEnc Director, Criminal Investigation.\n\nper\n1.

Cuthbert,\n\nDepartmental letter.\n\nFormer Mount Elgin Indian Residential School building -\n\nThe attached files concern the main building formerly occupied by students attending the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nIn 1896, when this building was erected, various Indian bands that were served by the school contributed $19,000.00 from their funds towards the capital expenses. Since that time, the Department has expended from parliamentary appropriation for buildings and improvements a sum in excess of $130,000.00.\n\nIn 1915 fire destroyed some of the outbuildings and pursuant to the collection of insurance $7,400.00 was repaid to the band funds leaving an equity of only $11,600.00.\n\nThis school building was condemned two years ago and is no longer in use by the Department or by the Indians. We have erected a new day school a short distance away and intend opening this school during the summer of 1948. We are still continuing to use the separate classroom block of the old school.\n\nIt has been recommended that this old main building (not the separate classroom block) be declared surplus and turned over to our Assets Corporation as surplus government property. The point at issue is whether we have the authority to do this, in view of the Indians' equity in these buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

That a single administrative unit for the purposes of education be made of the five reserves included in the survey (Kettle Point, Sarnia, Wabigoon, Muncey), and that a Superintendent of Schools be appointed for this area.\n\n2. That day schools be developed as community service centres; that those of the first four reserves be two-room schools. That the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School be such be discontinued, and a Senior School or Junior High School be built on the property at Muncey.\n\n3. That the teachers for these schools be carefully selected from among the best in the Province on the basis of their personal qualifications, training and previous successful experience. To make this possible, other provisions must be made:\n   (a) Inducements. Salaries must at least equal those of the town schools of Ontario and provide an increase for satisfactory service; there must be membership in a Pension Plan, either in the Civil Service or Teachers' and Inspectors' Superannuation Fund of Ontario; living and teaching conditions must be made attractive.\n   (b) In-service training must be made obligatory, including regular Summer School Courses in Kindergarten-Primary, Auxiliary classes, Educational Psychology and related subjects; a Summer School for teachers of Indian schools should be held the first week in September, as well as monthly meetings of teachers for study and fellowship. Supervision should be more thorough, helpful and encouraging.\n4. That the methods of the Activity Programme be thoroughly studied and applied, and that materials and equipment be adjusted to facilitate this type of classroom procedure. That assistance be given those teachers who will use to advantage the Audio-Visual Aids now available.\n\n5. That the Curriculum of the Province be accepted, with adaptations made by the teacher on the basis of pupil needs. Grades I to VI should be of a general and basic character, with emphasis on the mastery of spoken English and Reading. Grades VII to IX should be provided in the two-room schools, with opportunity for High School Entrance, but emphasis on the Optional Subjects for those who will go no further. At Muncey, the day schools should include only Grades I to VI, pupils to be admitted to the Senior School at twelve years of age or after completion of Grade VI. The Senior School should specialize in Grades VII to X, both academic and vocational, but to include classes for Grades I to VI. Classification of senior pupils should be by their year in the school rather than by grade. There should be development of the courses, Home Economics, Commercial, Agriculture, Building Trades, Motor Mechanics and other practical work as the demand arises. Pupils should have the opportunity of part-time work and educational training from 16 to 18 years of age. The possibilities of apprenticeship in the building trades should be investigated. Social and recreational activities should be encouraged, and the leadership available when needed.\n\n6. That a programme of Educational and Vocational Guidance and placement be developed and directed by the Superintendent of Schools with the co-operation of the teachers. That this programme includes responsibility for pre-school children and graduates, as well as those of school age.\n\n7. That a serious consideration be given to making the advantages of the Senior School available to pupils of reserves other than Muncey, by the provision of residential accommodation of a kind suitable to teen-age young people.\nThat the Senior School be free of denominational bias; the United Church of Canada, while retaining its voice in the broader policies of the school, may surrender some of its prerogatives in the interests of the total good of the Indian people.\nSuperintendent of Schools:\n\nSuch an administrative unit implies the appointment of a Superintendent of Schools for the area, who would have responsibility for the education of the people of these reserves, through the day schools, the Senior School at Munsey, their attendance at High or Vocational Schools and Community and Adult Education. He would have the responsibility for the selection or approval of the teachers, the supervision of their work, the direction of their in-service training, and would co-operate with the agents and the Department in the improvement of their working conditions. With respect to the pupils, he would operate a follow-through and follow-up programme of Educational and Vocational Guidance and placement, the use of cumulative records and testing - the responsibility for adapting the educational facilities to the individual's needs. He would encourage such activities as would secure the understanding co-operation of parents and the community in the work of the schools, through some form of Home and School Clubs, community responsibility for school grounds, and possibly the formation of a school board.\n\nThe duties of a school board might have to be largely advisory in nature, but it could be given at least one responsibility, the regular attendance of the pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Jublin's\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 9/46\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR.

(RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HONEY,\n\nInspector Arnell and I visited the Caradoc Agency on May 22 and 23, in connection with the proposed erection of a new four-room day school, to replace the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nThere are two sites available - one in the village of Rodney and the other on the property formerly occupied by the Mount Elgin Residential School. We favour the latter site because there is an excellent location available and, in addition, we have an opportunity for teaching agricultural subjects to the pupils.\n\nThe only difficulty with this site is that the road from Rodney to the new site is reported to be in very bad condition at certain periods of the year. The road is one mile long and it may be expensive to put it in condition to be used at all periods of the year. However, this work will be necessary, as we expect to be driving the children to the new school and, consequently, a year around road will be required.\n\nWe interviewed Mr. T. A. Caldwell, District Engineer, Ontario Highways Department, London, with a view to obtaining some assistance from the Provincial Government. Mr. Caldwell promised to inspect the road and let us have an estimate of what it would cost to put it into proper condition. When visiting Mr. Caldwell, we also met Mr. Marshall, Chief Engineer of the Highways Department, and the latter instructed Mr. Caldwell to forward a report indicating the amount which might be saved regarding what portion of the cost could be met by the Ontario Highways.\n\nWith reference to the erection of the new school, Inspector Arnell obtained the following information:\n\n(a) Foundation - Graham and Graham, London, Ontario, are prepared to shovel out the excavation in three days' time. They will require 2 weeks' notice before we desire to have the work completed.\n\n(b) Building Foreman - Charles Lidy, builder, Rodney, Ont., is available. He has an excellent reputation as a builder and his services can be secured within the next two weeks. He has built many houses and one church at Rodney. He can read blue prints and take full charge. Indian helpers, many of whom are competent carpenters, are available, as well as other Indian labour.\n\n(c) Material - This can likely be secured within two months' time. It may be necessary to apply to the Timber Controller for priority. Arrangements were made with a qualified man to prepare a list of the materials and forward this to the Department by June 1.\n\nIn view of the above information, secured by Mr.\nArnall, I would appreciate it if we could receive permission to proceed. The sooner we start purchasing the material, the sooner we can commence building.\n\nI might also mention that both Indian Agent Down and the newly appointed farm instructor have had considerable experience in erecting buildings and will be in a position to supervise the erection of the school and keep the Department fully informed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGORDON YOUNG\nINSPECTOR\nINSPECTORATE OF WEST MIDDLESEX\n\nJUL 29 1946\n\nSTRATHROY,\nONTARIO\n27 July, 1946.\n\nHon. Mr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Traders' Service,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn order to ascertain what plans with respect to the education of Indians on the reserves of the Caradoc Agency had been made, I called on Rev. Mr. Joblin recently.\n\nWhile I found the old buildings more or less discarded and vacant, the only signs of a new building were, (1) a hole in the ground and (2) a pile of new siding clocks. It is very evident that a new building will not be ready for September.\n\nMay I therefore suggest that Mr. Down, your agent, (or, better still, Rev. Mr. Joblin) be authorized to proceed immediately to arrange temporary classrooms in the old buildings to be used only until the new rooms are ready?\n\nYou will appreciate the immediate necessity of organizing a staff, arranging equipment and even lining up pupils for this school. Courses of study have to be planned and the supplies purchased.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from Mr. Joblin any news he may need, but I do urge that he be directed to see me on the opening of school in September and be authorized to take the necessary steps. He should be told what measures your department has to pursue.\n\nCertainly the matters mentioned above should have been given consideration, and the very ill-advised delay of the following were determined:\n\n1. The times to be used by this school;\n2. The likely enrolment;\n3. The number of instructors to be employed;\n4. The courses to be offered;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n5. The accommodations of the new building.\n6. Who shall select the staff.\n\nMr. Joblin would like to use the first week of September as a special training period for the teachers not only at this school but on the reserves.\n\nSince attendance is usually low in this area, the difficulties and possibilities will be lessened by having a larger school. It is worth a trial.\n\nP.S. I am sure you will agree with me that Mr. Joblin is a man of great ability and integrity. I have no doubt that he will make a very valuable contribution to the reserve schools.\n\nHe assured that once we know what is expected of us, Mr. Joblin and I shall work in the closest collaboration possible. His appointment as Superintendent of education on these reserves leads me to hope for the adoption of a very progressive educational policy.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Public Schools.\nOttawa, August 5, 1946.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Munsey, Ontario.\n\nEducational Plans for a New Caradoc Day School.\n\nI have received a letter from Mr. Gordon Young, Inspector of Schools, Strathroy, Ontario, dealing with the above matter. As I discussed with you the other day over the telephone I will come down to Munsey to further discuss our education policy for your agency.\n\nMr. Arnell and myself will meet you at the agency house at two o'clock on August 13th at a preliminary discussion. We will then proceed to a further meeting with Reverend Mr. Joblin at the Residential School at four o'clock of the same day. To this latter meeting I have invited Mr. Young.\n\nI would like to propose as a tentative agenda that we could discuss the following points at both meetings:\n\n1. Temporary use of Residential School classrooms.\n2. The grades to be served at the new school.\n3. The curriculum to be offered at the new school.\n4. The teaching staff; appointment, number and qualifications.\n5. Transportation requirements.\n6. Teacher training.\n\nWould you please inform the Reverend Mr. Joblin of this meeting and the proposed agenda. I would also like to have your comments on these proposals.\nI will welcome this opportunity of visiting your Reserve and seeing the various Welfare projects about which I have heard so much from both Mr. Phelan and Mr. Arneil.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 5, 1946.\n\nMr. Gordon Young,\nInspector of Schools,\nStratford, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nI have received your letter of July 27th in which you raise several problems with respect to educational plans for the Indians on the reserves of the Caradoc Agency. I have discussed this matter with Mr. Hoey and suggested to him that a meeting should be held in the near future to discuss these various points. He has concurred in this regard. Therefore, I have today written to Mr. Don and informed him that I wish to meet both himself and the Reverend Mr. Joblin at the old Residential School at four o'clock on Tuesday August 13th. I will have with me Mr. Arneil and I am hoping that you will find it convenient to attend this meeting.\n\nA tentative agenda for this meeting would be as follows:\n\n1. Temporary use of Residential School classrooms.\n2. The grades to be served by the new school.\n3. The curriculum to be offered at the new school.\n4. The teaching staff; appointment, number and qualifications.\n5. Transportation requirements.\n6. Teacher training.\n\nI hope that the above proposal will meet with your approval and that you will be able to attend this meeting. I might add that I have read with a great deal of interest all the reports of the educational survey which you undertook in this respect and I am very anxious to further discuss our educational plans with you.\n\nBernard F. Neffy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 4, 1946.\n\nHereunder are the letters which I have written to Mr. Young and to Mr. Down further to our conversation of August 2nd.\n\nI have discussed this matter thoroughly with Mr. Arneil and Mr. Phelan. We have worked out the following program for the visit of Mr. Arneil and myself:\n\nMonday August 12 - Visit officials of the Department of Education at the Parliament Buildings in Toronto.\n\nTuesday \" 13 - 2 O'Clock - Preliminary meeting of Mr. Arneil Mr. Down and myself.\n\n\" \" \" 4 O'Clock - Further meeting with Reverend Mr. Joblin and Mr. Young.\n\nWednesday \" 14 - Visit to Lieutenant Colonel Randle - Six Nations Reserve and return to Toronto.\n\nThursday \" 15 - Return to Ottawa at 8 A.M.\n\nBernard J. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSCHOOL NEWS\n\nA WEEKLY NEWS SHEET FOR THE CHIPPEWA, MUNCEY AND ONEIDA RESERVES AT MUNCEY, ONT.\n\nSATURDAY, JULY 27\n\nBecause of the closing of the Mt. Elgin Residential School and the lack of information concerning the plans for the future, there are many questions in your minds. It will be the chief purpose of this News Sheet to answer those questions as soon as there are answers available for them. Your Director of Education, Rev. E.E.M. Joblin, is particularly anxious that you should have a part in developing and carrying out any plans for the education of your young people. This means that you should have all possible information from time to time. At the earliest possible date, a public meeting will be arranged for the discussion of these matters. In the meantime, the News Sheet will try to fill the gap.\n\nWith respect to the new Schools which have been in operation, the teachers of last year have all been engaged for the coming term, and it is assured that school will open in September as usual. The exact date will be announced later.\n\nFor the new school, the excavating has been completed and we are assured that the new building will ready for use some time in the fall. The Director has recommended that the senior pupils begin their term at the proper time and carry on in the classrooms of the old building until the new school is ready. This has not yet been confirmed by the Welfare and Training Division, however. Transportation has been promised for those who need it.\n\nVery little definite information can yet be given, but it is hoped that the new school will be responsible at least for pupils from Grade VII to X. It is quite important therefore that the Director be notified of those pupils who want to attend the school for the work of Grade IX or X. Those who failed in a grade will be able, we hope, to take the subjects they need to complete the grade in addition to such work of the next grade as they are able to do. Pupils who have been out of school and are interested in returning for either academic or practical training, should see Mr. Joblin. One of the main guiding principles of the new system is that the school programme should be adjusted to the needs of the pupils. You can help us to determine those needs. The Director will welcome your suggestions and opinions as to the educational needs of our young people.\n\nIt is expected that Mr. Floyd Johnson will be continued as teacher in the Senior School. Other teachers will be secured, depending on the enrolment and type of work to be taken.\n\nIn closing, Mrs. Joblin and I would like to thank you for the warm welcome we have received from so many of you since returning to Muncey. We look forward to many pleasant associations with you in the life of the Church, School and Community. I have set up an office in the old school building where you may find me from 9 a.m. to noon from Monday to Friday, at least until Sept 1st. Office hours will doubtless have to be altered after the term begins.\n\nRev. E.E.M. Joblin, M.A., B.D.,\nDirector of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nWelfare and Training Division,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYou will appreciate the shortness of the time now before the opening of the school term, and the need for some clarification of my plans and responsibilities. I trust you will be able to give me an early answer to the following questions and authority to act on several suggestions herein made.\n\n1. I am most anxious to initiate our Teacher Training programme this year by holding a class from Sept. 4th to 6th inclusive during regular school hours. This implies that the schools would not open until the 9th Monday, but since so many Indians are away, there are few pupils in attendance during the first week, I should like your approval of this plan, so that I can engage the visiting speakers and arrange the programme. I see no reason for waiting a full year to inaugurate this plan, which has already been approved in principle.\n\n2. In view of the obvious delay in the new building, we ought to plan to start school promptly in the classrooms of the old school building, which should cause no difficulties. It would entail the provision of a cleaning woman for two or three days prior to the meetings of the teachers.\n\n3. It has been impossible as yet to discover in detail the number of pupils for the Senior School, but it is evident that there will be a good class for Grade IX. At the present it appears that we should include Grade VI in this School, to relieve the load in the other schools and enable the teachers to overcome the lag in the lower grades. In the main I prefer to think in terms of an age entrance of about twelve years, so as to provide Auxiliary class work for those of that age, whether they have reached Grade VI or not.\n\n4. The attendance of these pupils at the Senior school will be largely dependent upon the provision of bus service, ready to begin promptly on Sept. 9th. There is no time for delay in this regard.\n5. It is evident that we will need another teacher in addition to Mr. Johnson, who will be responsible this year for the shop work with the boys in addition to the studies in the senior grades. We can do part of the Grade IX work, but there should be a lady teacher as well to take the remainder of the Grade IX work together with the Home Economics work. It is altogether likely that a third teacher will be needed for the lower grades, but this can be determined later when a survey has been completed. As yet I have no information whatever as to who will secure teachers or what salary they will receive.\n\n6. This raises the question of living accommodations for the teachers. The second apartment is now occupied by Mr. Bush, who works on the farm for the Agency. He will not be finished till Sept. 30, if then. Is he to be permitted to remain, thus preventing our engaging a married teacher, or providing boarding accommodations for the teachers? Surely Mrs. Joblin is not to be expected to board two or three teachers!\n\n7. Parents are asking also whether text books will be provided in Grade IX. It would seem reasonable to me that this be done, but that they be expected to supply their own work books, pencils etc.\n\nUntil I receive clear answers to these questions or am authorized to proceed on my own judgment as expressed in my thesis (the contents of which are known at least to Mr. Hoey), I shall be flying blind. This is not a pleasant experience, and may prove disastrous to the whole venture. If we are to \"take off\" at the proper time, the visibility should not remain at zero much longer.\n\nWould you be good enough also to direct me as to whom I should address in such letters on policy, and the proper procedure to follow? Thank you for your indulgence thus far. All the above matters have been condensed, perhaps at the risk of being incomplete, or omitting important details.\n\nHoping for an early reply, I am,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nE.E.M. Joblin.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of the first news letter, which explains itself. The results in increased of the people have already justified the effort.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It was, therefore, with pleasure that I received your telephone message, followed by your letter, under date of August 1st, requesting a meeting and outlining the preliminary important points for discussion. The proposed agenda is as follows:\n\n1. Temporary Use of Residential School Classrooms\n2. The Grades to be Served at the New School\n3. The Curriculum to be Offered at the New School\n4. The Teaching Staff; Appointment, Number and Qualifications\n5. Transportation Requirements\n6. Teacher Training\n\nBefore proceeding I should like to point out that, contrary to some beliefs, the closing of the Mt. Elgin Residential School has not and will not create any problem in our six Indian Day Schools such as accommodation, classroom teaching and general school routine; or the necessity of breaking up classes. I feel that any temporary arrangement, under present conditions, would react unfavourably toward the new school. I simply record this fact and would like the point kept in mind and placed in the record; also the fact that I have not at any time favoured the location of the new school.\n\nPOINT 1\n\nTemporary Use of Residential School Classrooms\n\nIt has been rumored, and I am sorry to say from official quarters, that the Mt. Elgin Residential School old classrooms are to be used for temporary purposes in teaching the higher grades at present attending our regular Indian Day Schools. Owing to the fact that we have not yet any pupils in sight, and the general courses have not been arranged; also, the facts that heating facilities are poor, that we are not overcrowded and that it is only three weeks...\nbefore the fall term commences I see little reason and no advantage in disturbing our existing Indian Day Schools. Such a proposition would undoubtedly meet with opposition and create more problems for the Indian Agent. There is another fact which seems to have been overlooked. Many of these children of the higher grades do not return to their homes, on the Reserve, until late in the fall and even as late as December. Their parents are working in the tobacco fields or canning factories, and the children either help or go to school in the white sections. My final recommendation at this time is that we have no use for the Residential School classrooms; and until we have something definite and beneficial in the way of education in an up-to-date manner to attract and not dishearten the pupils. Under present day conditions of short supply the new school should be well on its way toward the end of 1946, and with the minor finishing touches it should be ready for a grand opening early in 1947. In the meantime every effort should be made to plan suitable courses, secure the number of likely pupils to attend and decide the teacher requirement.\n\nPOINT 2\n\nThe Grades to be Served at the New School\n\nGrades to be served can only be determined by a knowledge of the type of school under discussion. Is it to be primary? part primary and part secondary? or secondary? Personally I think it should be mainly centred around normal grades, including Day School work, improvement and properly staffed, are efficient and able to care for all grades requiring primary academic courses. If we decide that this school is to be part primary and part secondary then there will be later difficulties to overcome which I will not discuss. Being what we are, a governmental institution, personalities, ambitions and achievements are based on grades. If we decide that this new school is to be secondary (in the main) then it calls for particular curriculum rather than the secondary curriculum. I.Q.'s are based on capabilities along the narrow channels of academic education, and entirely lose sight of brilliant possibilities along other lines. Therefore courses should be set to meet the requirement, rather than the requirement set to meet the courses. The usual requirement for University Entrance should, of course, have its place but in setting up a general Course of Studies to meet the Indian requirement the following should receive consideration:\n\n1. Health Education\n2. Machine Shop Work\n3. Wood Working\n4. Motor Mechanics\n5. Home Economics\n6. Office Practice\nPOINT 3\n\nThe Curriculum to be Offered at the New School\n\nThe curriculum followed in all schools is usually based on provincial requirement. It may, however, be varied to suit the local requirement and I think we should follow the line most suitable and acceptable to our Indian pupils except perhaps for a student who wishes to lead up and down for University education. He or she should then receive the very necessary assimilation requirement; by this I mean a preparatory course leading the way to immediate adjustment. This type, of course, could better be taken care of in the white High Schools.\n\nPOINT 4\n\nThe Teaching Staff: Appointment, Number and Qualifications\n\nThis point is tied in closely with point No. 2. It is usual for Secondary School teachers to hold special teaching qualifications on perhaps two or more subjects with a principal capable of teaching all academic grades; but if we are to introduce special courses then teachers with special qualifications should be selected. The number of teachers required will depend upon the subjects taught. In a school of this type teachers should be selected and appointed strictly on the basis of qualification to teach the required subject; and they should be hired on the basis of every other Civil Servant, namely a probation period. The appointment of teachers should be under the direct control of the Department; and any deviation of control to persons or group of persons or associations would definitely be avoided. It is essential when introducing new methods of education that the Department exercise its authority and accept its responsibilities. This applies not only to education but all administrative agencies. Dual control and dual authority lead only to misunderstandings, inefficiencies and a temptation to dodge onus of responsibility.\n\nPOINT 5\n\nTransportation Requirements\n\nUnder present road conditions leading to the new school, and the general reserve conditions in particular, transportation will always create a major problem and must, of necessity, stay on main roads. No person could with any measure of assurance guarantee that students would be comfortably transported. However, since we are introducing a type of consolidated school, and since the Reserves are separated by the Thames River, also the fact that the trip covering each Reserve will take\napproximately one hour with no waiting, two buses of the station wagon type, should be provided. These buses will be required to travel the main roads and pick up the students at the intersections.\n\nPOINT 6\n\nTeacher Training\n\nThis is an interesting point and one which should be given deep thought. When one speaks of \"Teacher Training\" I go back into my own school days, and I am a class of student teachers who have graduated from Secondary Schools who are not in a position to finance a University education. I think they referred to them as \"pupil teachers\". They were students who had chosen the teaching profession as a career. I think their term was two years, and they would be placed over the Secondary School curriculum with actual teaching periods under the direct supervision of the principal or a qualified teacher. In this way the pupil teacher became very efficient and upon graduation was able to walk into any classroom with confidence and dignity. Could not such a system be arranged in connection with the new schools so that it could develop into a nucleus for supplying Indian teachers for Indian Day Schools throughout Western Ontario. This system could broaden itself out to other types of teaching such as Health, Home Economics, Mechanics etc. The thought of \"pupil teachers\" might be kept in mind.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn submitting this memorandum I would ask you to keep in mind that I am particularly interested in the welfare of this new school and anything I may have said is constructive suggestion, and I am sure that the officials will accept it accordingly. In a few years I shall have passed from the service of Indian Affairs. If I am able to leave a thought that will grow and build and contribute in some small measure to the uplift and education of our Indian people, I am satisfied.\n\nGeo. W.

At 2 o'clock we had a long discussion with Mr. George Down. I attach a copy of the memorandum which he handed to Mr. Arneil and myself and which formed the basis of our discussion (Appendix A attached).\n\nAt 4 o'clock we held a second meeting with the Reverend E.E. Joblin and Provincial Inspectors of Schools Young and Smith. At this meeting the following decisions were reached:\n\n1. That it would be impractical to rely on the opening of the new school until next Spring. This opening might be delayed even longer, as it depends entirely on the material situation.\n\n2. The following difficulties present themselves to the operation of the present buildings as a temporary school:\n   (a) The road from the crossroads to the school is nine tenths of a mile long and is very narrow. There is money available for the widening of this road, but the reconstruction will have to be delayed until a steel culvert is obtained. This piping has been ordered but will likely not be available for at least three months.\n   (b) Several modifications will have to be made in the present heating system. Material shortages may hamper these alterations.\n   (c) It is impossible to obtain snow equipment for clearing the roads. A Provincial School Consolidation is also being carried out and it will be almost impossible to borrow any of the local equipment for our use.\n   (d) It is apparently impossible to have a bus contract let for the transportation of the children to the school. It will also be difficult to buy a large school bus. I am now investigating the possibilities of buying two converted Army Personnel Carriers for use as small buses.\n\n3.

These will have a capacity of 12 pupils each and due to their high chassis, 4-wheel drive and truck engine should be able to overcome both difficulties (2 + e and 2 - e).\n\n(b) That necessary steps be taken to overcome the heating problem as mentioned in 2 (b) above.\n\n(c) That this school be opened as soon as the buses are obtainable.

Murray,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\nAssuming that we shall be having school here this year, and for most if not all of the school year, it will be essential that we be given complete control of the Manual Training shop again, and that the tools either be returned or replaced. On this point Mr. Phelan can tell you of the present arrangement. The power tools are still the property of the Church, and Dr. Dorsey has permitted me to say that these will be sold to the Department only on condition that they be for school use. The shop is or was well equipped and will see us through the year for the boys' work. For the girls, it should be possible to have the use of part of one of the three rooms here, where sewing and dressmaking at least could be done.\n\nMr. Johnson has not yet had any word of his appointment, and since he has had many excellent offers of other work, it is due only to his keen interest in our work that he is still waiting. I respectfully submit that in view of his many capacities he should be offered net less than $1000 with his room, without board. He has been a successful teacher of Indian pupils for some years, can do the work we want in mechanics, radio, general shop, and the senior grades in the classroom. I have been promised a confirmation of his appointment now for nearly three months. There is plenty for him to do here in the event that the classroom did not open for two weeks after the regular time. He could do the plumbing required here, and set the manual training shop in order. I trust you can give me definite word soon, as it would be a distinct loss to us if he should accept some other work.\n\nCould you give some thought also to the present method of recommending children to other schools, either Indian Residential or white secondary? The Agent continues to assume this responsibility entirely. It would seem to me that eventually it should at least require my approval. I trust that Mr. Arnell's expression of policy, namely that the pupils here are not going to be herded off to other schools, is the true one, and that any recommendations which may be coming in will be scrutinized carefully.\n\nThere are other matters, but I have already trespassed on your time. If my remarks have appeared too effusive, or impatient, forgive me. You may realize that I have invested a great deal in this project, I believe in it, and I believe the Department wants to see it put into operation. It would be a great tragedy if one man were permitted to prevent it. His power to do this ought not to be underestimated.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nE.K.M. Joblin\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nAugust 19, 1946,\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nYour meeting with us last week left us with a variety of feelings. First, one of considerable encouragement by reason of the experience and vision which you bring to the work, and a feeling of greater hopefulness for a constructive forward-moving policy for our work. But in addition to this we all understand me when I admit a feeling of disappointment and even disgust at the extent to which our Agent appeared to succeed in his attempts to block the whole enterprise. I sincerely hope that his analysis of the situation will not be accepted as final.\n\nI appreciate your sending me a copy of \"Education for Action\", but I already had a copy, and in view of the scarcity, am sending it back immediately. It should be available to us. I was able to secure other materials of the U.S. Office as well, such as their Manual for the Indian School Service, and their Bibliography.\n\nPlans are under way for our teacher-training course on Sept. 4 to 6. I believe it would be of very great value to all of us if you could yourself attend at least one day of the three. If doing this, could we secure Mr. Doucet? I would appreciate it if you could let me know for which day one of you could be present. It would also be worthwhile if you could send us a sample set of the new series of texts which you mentioned.\n\nSome instructions would also be welcome as to the making out of requisitions for materials, including books for classroom use, for library use, and also supplies for athletics and recreation. For example, I should like to secure a Volley Ball and net ($15) for use here. I have the usual forms; shall I send them in through the Agent as the teachers have done, and does this method include all types of requirements? Is it your intention to supply the text books for Grade IX? With respect to materials available from the Vocational Guidance Centre in Toronto, for work in Vocational Guidance and my cumulative records of the pupils, will I be authorized to secure them, after submitting a list of requirements, and submit the bill to the Agent, or will these be secured direct from Ottawa?\n\nIndian Affairs.

B.F. Neary, and attended by Mr. Down, Mr. Arnell, and the two school inspectors, Mr. J.G. Smith and Mr. Pearson Young. One matter of educational policy was readily agreed upon. Entrance to the Senior School will be at the age of twelve years or thereabouts, so that those who for any reason are retarded or behind in their grade will have extra help and a chance to do the practical type of study in shop work and home economics. This type of help for retarded pupils is known as Auxiliary Class work and may include pupils from Grade II up. By grades, the Senior School will probably include those from Grade II, and also (for a time) such other pupils enough for it. It was agreed also that the curriculum should be that of the Province of Quebec with such adaptations as are found to be necessary but the academic subjects should receive credit for advanced work in other High or Vocational schools if they have the ability and desire to continue. For the larger number, it was decided, work will be placed on the more practical courses of instruction such as Shop Work, Motor Mechanics and Agriculture for the boys, and Home Economics, including Dressmaking, Cooking, Home Planning, etc., for girls. Beauty culture and stenography may have to be added later. It should be repeated that the nature of the curriculum will be to meet to a great extent upon the interests and needs of the pupils, and will not be laid down in advance.\n\nCol. Neary said that he had extensive plans for the training of teachers, which will be carried out during our plan for a brief period of three months after the opening of the school term. This means that the six teachers who now serve will open on September 1st, instead of August 15th. It will be expected to be looking the latter part of the school term, except for those who will be devoted to the study and observation of the year's work, its objectives and methods, and to observe the pupils. This will prove of great value for the work of the coming year.\n\nIt was felt that the scarcity of building materials is only delaying the completion of the new school, but it is hoped that the new classes will be able to carry on in the old building. The addition of the rooms has the effect of transportation and facilities. There is still some doubt as to whether bus service can be provided in the fall, although the idea is being worked out. Even with all its difficulties, however, it could not be expected to operate so long under the present conditions of the new type of schooling.\n\nE.J. Martin.\nOttawa, August 28, 1946.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am at present preparing a long progress report, outlining the general situation at your school. This letter will be signed by the Director and will answer most of the questions which you raised in your letter of August 19.\n\nI have arranged for Mr. Doucet to be present at your training course for the afternoon of September 6. I will try to arrange for a sample set of our new textbooks, but unfortunately some of them are in short supply.\n\nYou can prepare requisitions immediately for the following items:\n\n(a) Volley ball and net.\n(b) Grade 9 textbooks as listed in the bulletin of authorized texts for the Province of Ontario, 1946-47.\n(c) Vocational guidance materials as available from the Vocational Guidance Centre in Toronto.\n\nI will have Mr. Doucet discuss the matter of tools for manual training with you.

I had a brief vacation and have just returned.\n\nOne of the vehicles discussed was delivered to Strathroy on Tuesday. Our dealer cannot give me the name of any firm except General Motors who is handling these vehicles. This vehicle will be taken for a public school route as I told you. The local dealer is undertaking to make the necessary changes and states that he will service the vehicle for us as required.\n\nAnother vehicle for High School routes was delivered to our Parkhill dealer. Unfortunately the engine is damaged so we are not taking it.\n\nI have called Mr. Down and requested him to examine our vehicle, ascertain specific terms of contract with our dealer and any other information which he deems necessary. He will do this at once and write directly to you giving you more specific reports.\n\nOur local dealer states that only General Motor Dealers are offering these to the public. He is very sure that this is the only channel through which they may be secured. Can your department have access to officials of the War Assets Corporation for more definite information? Or are Government branches like some good people who do not let the left hand know what the right hand does?\n\nYou have my best wishes even though I can do so little to fulfil them in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGORDON YOUNG\nINSPECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nIndian Affairs.

We, at this plant, are not doing any work on the Personnel Carriers in the way of adapting them to carrying school children. We have a few of them here that we are revamping for the Canadian Red Cross, but we are installing in them an insulated compartment for handling Plasma.\n\nThe Personnel Carrier as we understand, is already fitted with seats, and if required for use along the lines suggested in your letter, we doubt if it would be necessary to do much to the bodies to handle school children. We believe they were intended to handle as many as 12 passengers, when first designed for the army. You could have this confirmed if you are able to contact Mr. C. K. Brock who used to be in the Design and Engineering section of the Department of Munitions and Supply. We believe he is now attached to the Department of National Defence in one of the National Defence Buildings, and he could give you full specifications regarding these Personnel Carriers, and most certainly could advise you if they would be suitable for transporting children as referred to in your letter.\n\nWe are sorry that we cannot be of any further assistance to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nV.O.

Temporary Use of Old Residential School\n\n(a) It is now evident that shortage of materials will delay opening of the new school until next spring.\n\n(b) Therefore it has been decided to use temporarily the buildings of the old residential school.\n\n(c) The two main difficulties in beginning the consolidated school system are:\n\n1. Heating the old buildings,\n2. Transportation.\n\n(d) Heating Difficulties\n\nThere are two alternatives already proposed for overcoming this problem. Everyone concerned is hereby directed to make every effort to overcome this difficulty and to solve it in a practical manner. Mr. Louise will visit this school on September 6 to ascertain the progress made in this regard and to assist in making satisfactory arrangements.\n\n(e) Transportation\n\nAs soon as the steel culvert arrives the short road leading into the school is to be widened and made more passable for the school buses.\n\n....... The real\nThe real delay now in the opening of the school will be the provision of school buses. In order to overcome the road and snow difficulties, it has been decided to obtain two M.U.F.'s (Army Personnel Carriers). These are four wheel drive vehicles with a very high chassis and with careful drivers should be able to provide transportation for 24 children for practically the entire winter.\n\nFour separate ways are now being explored in an effort to obtain these vehicles, namely, Van Amstel Corporation, General Motors Company, Wilson Bodies Company and Arundell Bodies Company.\n\nII Opening of School\n\nThis should take place about October 1 using the old buildings. Every attempt will be made to overcome the main difficulty now outstanding, namely, the provision of school buses, by that date. It is emphasized that the opening is entirely contingent upon the provision of these buses.\n\nIII Division of Responsibility\n\n(a) All matters of school administration will be referred to the Department through the Indian Agent.\n\n(b) All matters relating to teaching procedures and curriculum adoptions can be referred directly to the Department.\n\nIV Pupils\n\n(a) This school will be operated in its first year for Grade 9 and 10 pupils and for those pupils requiring auxiliary training.\n\n(b) When the school is functioning efficiently, consideration will then be given to operating it as a junior-senior high school, which will mean that it will be responsible for educating children from Grade VII upwards.\n\n(c) A careful study of attendance at the present six day schools...\nschools will be made to ascertain the number that will be available to attend the consolidated school.\n\nI Teachers\n\n(a) The number appointed will be dependent upon the average attendance.\n\nII Teacher Training\n\n(a) A brief training course will be conducted from September 4 - 6.\n\n(b) The day schools on the reserve will open on September 9.\n\n(c) Mr. Doucet will attend this training course on the afternoon of September 6.\n\nIII Summary\n\nThe Department has decided that it is better to begin this school on a small scale and in the old buildings rather than to wait for an indefinite period until the new school is ready. The opening date is now entirely contingent upon the provision of the two small buses.\n\nDirector.\n\nCopy sent to Dr. Dorey and to Mr. Joblin\nMuncey, Ontario,\nAugust 28, 1946.\n\nI have your letter of August 16, and your suggestion that the main building of the Mt. Elgin Residential School be fitted up as temporary classrooms and residence, has been discussed with the Rev. Mr. Joblin.\n\nIn this connection we both readily, and hastily, agreed that the proposition would be impracticable; and would involve major difficulties which we could not hope to overcome in the near future. We therefore felt that no point would be gained by going into detail.\n\n2. This brings us back to the original proposition of the old building. In this I have not been idle, and I submit the following:\n\nMy first job was to locate the main water supply from the springs to the main building, and then trace it on to the old building, including classrooms and apartments above. This I have done; and it would appear that our problem is to cut the main feed line, remove the pump and the present tank from the main building and install it in the basement of the old classroom building. The major part of this alteration is a digging proposition as the pressure tank is underground; and my information is that it would be cheaper to lift this tank and reinstall it, also move the pump rather than attempt to insulate the present set up which could not be accomplished with any measure of satisfaction.\n\nI have had a plumber look the situation over and, while he is not prepared to give an estimated contract price, he is prepared to undertake the job on a labour, plus cost, basis. He estimates the job would take four or five days after the uncovering of the pressure tank, a trench dug connecting the two buildings and all disconnections made. For this work he would need three of his own men, 9 hours a day at $1.00 per hour. Basing it on the 5-day period this would amount to approximately $135.00; in addition, four Indian labourers, 5 hours a day at 60\u00a2 per hour, approximate cost $96.00. This amount, totalling $231.00 might be estimated at $250.00 plus cost of materials such as extra pipes and fittings.\n\nThe over-all approximate cost would perhaps be less than $400.00. If you decide to have the change made please advise at an early date as the\nplumber concerned is very busy and cannot guarantee his offer to do the work if we do not accept him in the very near future.\n\n3. I have been in touch with Mr. Gordon Young, Inspector of Public Schools, and at your and his suggestion I have inspected the vehicle mentioned for pupil transportation. I understand that he is writing you on this matter and, from my telephone conversation with him, he is not particularly impressed; neither am I. The vehicle is what is known, in Army circles, as a Personnel Carrier; and I understand it is being released to Chevrolet Dealers, and not direct to the General Motors Corporation. The information, therefore, given me by the prospective purchaser is not definite enough to assure one of repair parts. It is a right-hand, four-wheel drive with an auxiliary crank-case controlling the drive which is not standard; and is not mentioned by the dealer unless questions are asked. The engine, radiator and headlights, however, are standard. Wheels are 16\" with 16-925 tires. Extra tires of this size will be somewhat difficult to obtain.\n\nThere are five doors, and some type of running board would have to be installed to help the children in climbing aboard. The interior is arranged to seat five persons, but with some changes would accommodate perhaps ten children. The vehicles are second hand with, in many cases, several thousand miles registered. As I said before, I am not in possession of any vehicle except the Ford for local transportation. I do, however, realize the difficulties in obtaining the regular station wagon or the small type of school bus; and if you have decided that school must open on the suggested temporary basis immediately rather than wait for the new school, perhaps there is no alternative. But I must ask you to please keep in mind that I do not and cannot, under present conditions, especially through the late fall, winter and spring months, assume responsibility in matters of transportation. This must be entirely the responsibility of local school officials.\n\nI have gone into this matter in detail in order to present to you a picture of the situation, and what I have accomplished since your recent visit to this Agency.\n\nI am leaving for my vacation on the third of September running through to September 14th. I am, however, leaving everything in order for the workmen, and all concerned, to carry on during my absence.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\n\nIndian Affairs.

E.S.B. JOSLIN, M.A., B.D.\n\nSeptember 27, 1946.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nIn the hope that some new word would be forthcoming as a result of Mr. Doucet's visit three weeks ago, I have refrained from writing you concerning our situation here. No such word has arrived; we are now but four days from the last of October, and the opening of school is scarcely more of a possibility now than it was at the time of your visit. Surely it is not too much to expect that some immediate action be taken to assure the opening of our Senior School.\n\nIn your Progress and Policy Report of August 29, the case was clearly set forth, but a very serious change of policy was declared as to the pupils to be admitted here.\n\n\"This school will be operated in its first year for Grade II and X pupils and for those pupils requiring auxiliary training.\"\n\n\"When the school is functioning efficiently, consideration will then be given to operating it as a junior-senior high school, which will mean that it will be responsible for educating children from Grade VII upwards.\"\n\n\"A careful study of attendance at the present six day schools will be made to ascertain the number that will be available to attend the consolidated school.\"\n\nI submit that the above policy would be totally inadequate to the need and would have serious results in the loss of confidence of the people, and of the United Church. Your Department can ill afford any such consequences. At our first meeting, the principle of an age entrance of twelve years, to take care of retarded pupils as well as Grades VII to X, was accepted, and the people have been looking forward to the possibilities in this plan with considerable interest. The delay has already begun to make itself felt. Senior boys and girls in surprising numbers are waiting for the opening; their work in the tobacco is about over, further delay will result in a period of demoralizing idleness.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe figures submitted by me at our first meeting were based upon a thorough house-to-house survey which provided names and ages of pupils. Yet the Progress Report speaks of a careful study of attendance was made to ascertain these facts. Were my figures taken to be fictitious? A survey of attendance will not provide the required facts. Our concern is with the children in the area of school age, a larger number than have hitherto appeared on the rolls of the schools. A few of the senior pupils are attending the other schools, but even without them, there are enough pupils to constitute a good class (around thirty, with the exception of River Settlement, which has, as yet, but 19).\n\nMy survey listed 156 pupils under 12 years, 86 over twelve. This was in August, and does not represent the total. Of the older pupils, a few have since gone to Residential schools. But other pupils, not listed, have signified their intention of returning from Detroit and other places, in order to attend the new school.\n\nIt is a simple statement of fact, and no boast, that there is no other person who knows the educational needs of this place better than I or who can do as much to meet that need. Yet my hands have been effectively tied, and my judgement set aside. I can scarcely be expected to remain silent, faced with the urgent need of my children on the one hand, and the inexorable, as it seems to me, delay of the only persons who can give us the green light. Mr. Down, probably for good reasons, will take no action without direct instruction from Ottawa. I beg of you, send the needed directions immediately.\n\nEven such details as cleaning the classrooms here, and the girls' outside toilet, setting up the water pump in this building, not to say the installation of the radiators in our apartment. The appointment of a second or even a third teacher is also awaiting your decision. I am not free to advertise or even get a line on such prospects by the ordinary means. Perhaps I am unduly concerned on this point, but it is the 27th of September, and teachers are hard to secure.\n\nThe two vehicles arrived, the ambulance most satisfactory, the lorry capable of handling all the Onaidas, but in need of alterations. The Agent has no mechanics at present; to send it out to a garage might involve weeks of delay; why not let the senior boys and Mr. Johnston work on it as a project in mechanics? This would at least permit us to use it in the meantime. These two vehicles could handle the pupils for this year, even when admitted for Grades VII to X.\n\nAt the risk of wearing your patience thin, I have felt it necessary to set forth these facts again. I have always found facts very effective weapons; can it be that a new defense has been perfected? You will have an opportunity, I believe, to set me right on Oct. 11, but I sincerely hope that before that time I shall have been pacified by the opening of our school for Grades VII to X plus auxiliary pupils, as recommended in the Young report, and as expected by the people and Church.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nIndian Affairs. (FG JO, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nOttawa, 3 October 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nYour letter of Sept. 27th has been received and has been very carefully considered.\n\nThe ambulance to which you refer is intended for transportation of children to the new school. The lorry was purchased from the same Firm but is being paid from a different appropriation and is intended for Agency work under the direction of Inspector Arnell. This vehicle is for use on Agency roads over Southern Ontario and to help build the new road to your school. We are attempting to locate a smaller vehicle for use as a school bus.\n\nIt has been decided to appoint Mr. Johnston as assistant teacher at a salary of $137.00 a teaching month effective from the date on which the new school opens. Indian Agent Down is being written regarding the cleaning of the classrooms and toilet and installing the water pump and radiators.\n\nIt is now understood that you are not prepared to teach in this school but are only willing to act in a supervisory capacity. Can you please confirm this fact as it means that we will now have to start a search for another teacher.\n\nI will discuss the other matters with Mr. Down and yourself at the Teachers' Convention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. E.E.M. Joblin, M.A., B.D.,\nThe Mount Elgin Indian School,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 3 October, 1946.\n\nMr. C.W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to official letter of August 29th you should have the classroom accommodation in the old residential school thoroughly cleaned.\n\nI presume that you have already carried out instructions contained in official letter of September 9th. The plumber told Mr. Houset that he would be willing to do the work about the middle of October. The radiators required in Mr. Joblin's apartment should be installed as soon as possible.\n\nTransportation\n\nThis problem has now been practically solved by the purchase of an Army ambulance. You should take the necessary steps to have this modified for use as a school bus. You are authorized to purchase a license for this vehicle. We will write you later this week regarding the employment of Mr. Lurch. We are attempting to locate a smaller vehicle for an extra bus but it may not be possible to obtain this in the immediate future.\n\nTeachers\n\nThe Department approves the appointment of Mr. W.C. Johnston as teacher at this school. In view of your remarks in your letter of September 25th that this teacher will be required to do both academic and manual training teaching, it has been decided to pay him at the rate of $137.00 a teaching month effective from the date on which the school opens.\nThe lorry which has been purchased is for use on Agency Reserves in Southern Ontario. You will receive further instructions regarding it from Inspector Arnell. The cost of this vehicle was not paid from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nConclusions\n\nYou are to make every effort to have this school opened as soon as possible using the one bus for transportation.\n\nCol. Neary will visit your Agency on October 11th to attend the Teachers' Convention and will be able to discuss this matter further with you. He will write to you separately regarding the Convention.\nOttawa, October 15, 1946.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMunsey, Ontario.\n\nThis letter will confirm the verbal arrangements that were made with you by Colonel Neary on his recent visit to the Caradoc Agency.\n\n1. **PUPILS**\n\n   Authority is given to have pupils of Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10 attend the temporary day school being established at the former Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\n2. **TRANSPORTATION**\n\n   The Supervising Principal, the Reverend E.E.M. Joblin, will be responsible for the following:\n\n   (a) Arranging of school bus routes.\n   (b) Arranging of schedule for school bus.\n   (c) Maintaining of discipline in school bus.\n   (d) General administration in connection with the use by his pupils of the school bus.\n\n   The maintenance and repair of this bus will of course be your responsibility.\n\n3. **Heating Difficulties**\n\n   You are authorized to make the necessary expenditures to have proper heating facilities provided in the old school block, as discussed with Colonel Neary.\n\n........... 4. PROVISION\n4. **PROVISION OF A THIRD TEACHER**\n\nYou are authorized to advertise for another teacher for this school. I enclose a copy of our usual application form. You should have the most suitable candidates complete this form and forward them to the Department for final selection. It would be appreciated if you would check with the Supervising Principal as to the qualifications which he requires in such a teacher. When submitting a voucher for this expenditure, you should include a copy of the newspaper in which the advertisement appeared. This is required as it is necessary to forward the account to the King's Printer for taxing before payment can be made.\n\n5. **TRAVELLING ALLOWANCE**\n\nAuthorization is given for the submission by the Principal of travelling allowance claims at the usual rate of nine cents (9\u00a2) per mile.\n\n6. **REQUISITIONS FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES**\n\nWould you please have requisitions completed and forwarded to the Department as soon as possible for the supplies required at this school.\n\nActing Director.\nOttawa, October 17, 1946.\n\nMr. G. H. Down, Indian Agent,\nMumee, Ontario.\n\nFurther to our 7-9-1 (#T) of October 15, the salary which will be paid to the third teacher at the temporary Day School being established at the former Mount Elgin Residential School will depend upon her qualifications. It is not the policy of the Department to pay either the travelling expenses or the board expenses of its teachers. These must be met by the teacher out of the salary granted.\n\nHowever, we do provide in certain instances living quarters for our teachers.

(RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nMuncey - Ontario\n\nOctober 21, 1946.\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I have listed the pupils of the senior grades or ages, on the enclosed sheets, so that you could see at a glance the situation here. It is obvious that there are more pupils than can be admitted this year. I take it that those would be left in their local schools first, who are in Grade VI and making normal progress, provided that their school can give them adequate instruction. This would apply to about nine, if necessary, in all schools but Oneida No's 1 and 2, which are so taxed for space as to necessitate our taking all those 12 years or over.\n\nPermit me to recommend, and ask you to confirm at an early date, that we begin school on Nov. 1st., regardless of any uncompleted preparations. This is a Friday, but it would give us a day to enroll and classify the pupils and Saturday to plan our work. This might mean that Mr. Johnston and I would have to manage alone until the second teacher arrives. Therefore I suggest that we open on Nov. 1st., with Grades VII, VIII, IX and X, without fail. As soon as the second teacher arrives, we would then include as many of those who are eligible as we felt we could provide for. It is fairly obvious that it will be necessary for me to supplement the classes with work of the other teachers to some extent, if they are to provide any instruction in non-academic subjects.\n\nI am not too hopeful of securing a teacher immediately. Even though I presented an Ad to Mr. Down on the next morning, Sat., Oct. 12, it appeared for the first time on Sat., Oct. 19, with most of the items which might be inducements deleted. However, we may receive applications, which must then be sent an application form to be filled out, and returned, which must then be considered and sent to Ottawa before an appointment can be made. With little delays of a day or two here and there, this can extend for quite some time. Had it been possible to offer the apartment, or even light-housekeeping rooms as I had proposed in the Ad., you can see how much more attractive the offer would have been in these times.\n\nOn the positive side, Mr. Down has had the classrooms cleaned up this week, and we intend ciling the floor next week. Nothing has been done, however, to the water system or heating plant. I trust that there will be no delay in completing the appointment of the bus driver, and in clearing the way for the work on the bus. The truc\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nwhich was bought from the Mt. Elgin School is here idle, and there is a tarpaulin for it. Could it not be used as an extra bus temporarily? And if necessary, why could not I take it out for one side of the river until a driver was found? There are all manner of means open to us, and the pupils are keen to get started. I consider it imperative that no further delay be allowed for any reason or excuse whatever. Furthermore, I believe that this is your expressed purpose. I should be most grateful if you would write me to confirm this position.\n\nWe have had no clear answer concerning the manual training shop. It would help materially to have a statement concerning it; failing this it will be necessary for me to assume that with the opening of classes we shall have the use of it, as we were assured by Mr. Doucet, and by Mr. Phelan.\n\nYour visit convinced me further, that you and the other officials all want this school to get under way. I have always believed it. It has been most trying, therefore, to have the work delayed so long, when in my honest opinion it was not necessary. Unless I receive definite instructions to the contrary then, I intend to call for the opening of school for Grades VII to X on Nov. 1st, whatever hardship it may entail for pupils or staff.\n\nWith respect to the second teacher, it may be necessary to take someone without the desired qualifications re Home Economics, for this year. I would judge this to be preferable to waiting until a fully-qualified teacher can be found. Since the pupils are three months behind, it will be necessary to emphasize their academic work, except in the case of those unable to do it. I trust that when an application does come in, it will be dealt with immediately, because there will be a large number of pupils still waiting to begin the year's work.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted by\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.E.M. Jobin, Supervising-Principal.\nOttawa, October 29, 1946.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my telegram of October 28, this is to inform you that you can now proceed with having the seats placed in your school bus.\n\nWe have received a letter from Miss Mary Inwards, B.A., B. Ed., of Toronto, offering her services as teacher in one of our Indian schools in Ontario. We have written to her, describing the work at your school and are now awaiting a reply from her. She has had some experience in the Anglican Residential School at Moose Factory and a change in plans has again made her available for Indian work. I expect to write you further in this regard. Will it now be possible to open this school in the near future? I was hoping that it could be opened early in November.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 29, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have delayed answering your letter of October 21 while we made enquiries as to the authorization necessary for the purchase of your bus. Fortunately, the Minister has returned from Western Canada and I have been informed that the necessary documents have now been signed and passed to the Treasury Board for payment. I have wired to Mr. Down to have the required seats set up in the bus as soon as possible and have requested that the school open at the earliest possible date.\n\nIn the meantime we have also been endeavouring to obtain the services of a teacher for you. We have written to Miss Inwards, B.A., B.Ed., of Toronto, who has had experience teaching Indians at the Moose Factory Anglican Residential School. As soon as I receive a reply from her I will be writing to you further. You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to have your second teacher for you if one can be secured.\n\nAs you are probably aware, it is not the policy of the Department to pay the board expenses of its teachers. This is a regulation of long standing. Mr. Donnet has just returned from a visit to Quebec and I will have him write you immediately concerning the manual training shop.\n\nThe difficulty concerning the operation of your truck as a school bus is the authorization required for the employment of the extra driver necessary for this vehicle. However, once your school is started, we would welcome a\n\nRev. E.E.M.

I would like to send you a short statement on our policy regarding Indian Veterans if you would be interested in publishing such material.\n\nI expect to be writing you further within the next few days in connection with the other points which you have raised in your letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

However, I have completed the application form for your file, and will write Dyna Leith in the year re the possibility of an appointment in 1947.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMary K.

I am informing the Indian Agent at Munsey and the Principal of the School that you will not be available until then. When I hear further from them I will write you again concerning this Caradoc School.\n\nAs there are other schools in Ontario which will probably be available after Christmas, therefore, could you give me definite assurance that we can count on your services for either the Caradoc School or another school after Christmas or is there a likelihood that your present teaching job will continue after the new year?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Unfortunately my letter arrived too late and she had just accepted an appointment at a school in the Province of Quebec. However, her teaching duties there will last only until Christmas and she may be available in the new year.\n\nIn the meantime I have written Mr. Down recommending that we accept the services of any teacher who is now available, with the possibility of accepting the services of Miss Inwards at a later date.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend E.E.M. Joblin, M.A., B.D.,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaradoc Indian Day School,\nMuncy, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 1, 1946.\n\nMr. C. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuskogee, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of similar file of October 29, I have just received an answer to my letter to Miss Inwards. Unfortunately, my letter arrived too late and she had just accepted an appointment at a school in Quebec. However, this teaching position will last only until Christmas and she may be available after that date.\n\nI would not recommend that you delay in securing this extra teacher, as it would seem evident that one is required in order to open your school.

Heaslip as teacher at the new day school in the Caradoc Agency.\n\nSalary will be allowed her at the rate of $152.00 a teaching month. Enclosed are the usual forms which she should complete and return.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNovember 2, 1946.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nYou will recall that I wrote two weeks ago to say that I intended to begin classes on Nov. 1st, in fairness to the senior students who were missing their work. This we did, yesterday, with 30 present in the four grades, and with six more at least who will be here next week, except in the case of two who are sick. Since the order had not come through for the driver of the truck, I undertook to drive it myself, not entirely with Mr. Down's concurrence, though he put no obstacle in my way. I intimated that while you had not actually given me permission to do so, yet you had not forbidden it either. May I say that the bus works well, and if it were at all possible to procure another such vehicle it would answer very nicely.\n\nWe are fortunate that the pupils have remained interested this long, and I am confident that any further delay would prove merely the loss of quite a number of them. You will know that Mr. Johnston will have a heavy load until the other teacher arrives, which will be in the near future I hope. It will be necessary for me to help him in some subjects.\n\nI appreciate your sending the telegram re the truck repair, since it enabled us to have it done for yesterday, and made me feel that you doing everything possible to help us get started. We have a fine group of students and look forward to a very fruitful year. The actual beginning has done much to bolster the people's faith in our project, in which they show a keen interest.\n\nMay I ask your approval of the following suggestions?\n\nAs soon as Mr. Burch is free to drive the bus (when his appointment has been approved by the Treasury), that I be permitted, as per my earlier suggestion, to take the Lt. Elgin truck, for the pupils on the Chippewa side. This in order to have them all arrive for nine o'clock. At present it will be necessary for the bus to make two trips, as you suggested.\nUpon the arrival of the second teacher, I earnestly hope I may be permitted to admit certain other pupils not yet in Grade VII, namely those who are to be regarded as Auxiliary pupils, and those from Oneida #2 and #3 schools who are 12 years of age or more, since these two schools are overcrowded, and some of them have been asked to remain at home pending entrance to this school.\n\nBy reference to the list of students I sent to you, you will see that this will mean about ten in Grade VII, five in Grade V, three in Grade IV, two in Grade II, and one in Grade I, a total of 21 pupils out of the 37 who are listed as below Grade VII. Dr. Down's present instructions prevent the admission of any but Grades VII to X. The addition of these pupils will still leave our group of a size to be handled by the two teachers and will round out the complete programme for this year for which the new school was intended.\n\nFor information, the Oneida trip totals 13 miles; on the Chippewa side I intend to pick up pupils at three strategic points only, letting them walk some distances because of the bad cross-roads. This will involve a round trip of about 11 miles. This seems to me a very reasonable undertaking for so worthwhile a project.\n\nYou will of course note that Mr. Johnston began work on Nov. 1st., so that arrangements should be made for his cheque to be paid when the time comes.\n\nI feel quite hopeful of a good year's work and a valuable start on the new programme. Your suggestion re Miss Inwards sounds splendid, and I hope she can be induced to come.\n\nWe should be glad to have your article for publication in WAMPUM. May I add also that your Bulletin will fill a long-felt need, and is a fine piece of work. There may be times, when the deadline looms on the horizon, that you will wonder why you started it, but somehow it will be done.

Keary,\n\nYou will be interested to know of the progress of our Senior School. I should make it brief. Our enrollment began with 30 on Friday, and has been consistently 36 this week. There are two others sick, which will make 38 in Grades 7-10, with a possibility of several others after Christmas.\n\nI am pleased to report that I had to drive the bus only two days; Mr. Burch has been on the job and running on schedule. One thing still bothers me, however, several pupils who return on the second bus have some distance to walk on muddy roads and do not get home till six o'clock, after dark. For this reason it would seem wise, if at all possible, for us to provide some other means for these late pupils to get home earlier by the use of a second bus (or the truck I have mentioned), or by paying the mileage on a car for these few. The present arrangement could hold in the morning, if we could supplement it at night, we might gain 15 minutes by sending the first load out at 3:45.\n\nThe present schedule is as follows:\n\n8:00 - 8:45 Oneida round trip, 13 miles.\n8:45 - 9:30 Chippewa round trip, 16 miles.\n9:45 - 10:45 Oneida trip.\n4:45 - 5:30 Chippewa trip.\n\nI appreciate your promptness in hiring Mrs. Leslie when Mr. Down telephoned. We are indeed fortunate in securing her for our High School work; she is well qualified and has a pleasing personality. I am hoping to hear from you with respect to admitting a number of other pupils, particularly those who are older than the rest, but are still left among the smaller pupils. In admitting them, I should have to be governed largely by the ability of the three of us to take care of them here, after consultation with the two teachers.\n\nI believe we can feel encouraged by the response of the pupils and their conduct and interest in their work.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have been very busy here, opening other new schools, and have had many visitors who are all anxious for the establishment of schools in hitherto neglected areas.\n\nWould you please discuss with Mr. Down your proposal concerning the use of the school truck or another school bus. I had hoped to be able to secure another vehicle for you but so far have only succeeded in locating a stake body Dodge truck\u2014which would of course not have been suitable. However, when we do manage to locate another vehicle, I think we can give favourable consideration to your proposal concerning the auxiliary pupils. I hope Mr. Desot or Mr. Clarke will have an opportunity of visiting your school system in the near future and of deciding this problem with you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

William Floyd Johnston, effective Nov. 1, 1946 at a salary of $137.00 a teaching month.\n\n2. Mrs. Jutta Marie Hoslip, effective Nov. 1, 1946 at a salary of $152.00 a teaching month.\n\nWe enclose T.D. 1 Form for each of the above. The Staff questionnaires will reach you shortly.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nI wish to draw your attention to the fuel requirement for the Caradoc Indian Continuation School and Mr. Joblin's apartment; also janitor for the school. You will appreciate the fact that I have not yet officially been advised of Mr. Joblin's appointment, neither do I know what arrangements were made with him. He advises that house, fuel and light were mentioned. I have therefore authorized, until definite instructions are received, two tons of coal for his apartment and given him a full load of coke from our Day School supplies for the furnace, which must be replaced.\n\nIn discussing the requirements with Mr. Joblin and inspecting the basement, I noticed a heavy supply of blower coal. I asked him whether it could not be used. He said the furnace was broken but that he had ordered the part and if it arrived in time, the blower coal could be used. I am now awaiting news of the part he mentioned. In the meantime, every endeavour is being made to keep the classrooms and apartment warm and comfortable.\n\nWith regard to the janitor, we are going to have some difficulty and until we can determine the duties involved and the salary offered...\nthere will be some inconveniences.\n\nI would also draw your attention to paper towels and toilet tissue. These articles are necessary in the school and I have again depleted primary school supply stocks to supply the Continuation School and I am ordering a supply of both articles accordingly. I trust that my action in this matter is in order without having first submitted the request for your consideration.\n\nIt will interest you to learn that the school, to date, is progressing favourably and everything possible is being done for the comfort of the pupils and teachers. The new school, owing to joists for the upper structure not being available, is at a standstill. I have submitted, under separate cover, the difficulties encountered with the building which are traced and attributed directly to Officials of the Engineering and Surveying Branch, of the Department of Mines & Resources.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nMUNCEY - ONTARIO\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOntario.\n\nDear Col. Murray,\n\nIn view of the approaching meeting in Toronto, it would seem worthwhile to submit a further progress report on our Senior School here. Since the actual opening of school, our relationship with Mr. Brown has steadily improved and a number of details have been attended to. He will have reported that the water system has been set up in this building during the past week, and it seems likely that the plumbers will return tomorrow to complete our appointment this week. We are negotiating for the necessary parts for the stove, which will be put in order as soon as these can be had; this is both more convenient and will take care of the quantity of coal already here.\n\nThe school bus, with Mr. Burch driving, has been doing splendid service; he is an excellent man. However, it is being overworked, since there are 31 Oneidas for their loads. It seems a pity that Mr. Doucet's original plan to use the lorry was set aside, since it would have taken care of the Oneida crowd plus others who should be attending. In considering another vehicle, we must think of coming years as well as this, and the Oneidas will require either a large vehicle such as sits idle here, or two similar to the one we now use. When Mr. Doucet decided on the lorry, it was with a view to limiting the number of drivers to two. Everyone at this end approves of the remodelling of the lorry, except Mr. Brown, who would prefer something more attractive. Mr. Burch, who knows the vehicles, has expressed the opinion that the lorry could have been made suitable for our needs. For the present, we have been able to send a few pupils home with the new trailer, and I have given up the idea of a second temporary truck. When a second one is secured, it will need to be large enough for future needs.\n\nAs to the pupils attending, the enclosed table gives the data. I submit that 96% attendance for a new school is a good start and justifies our making a beginning. While we haven't a high enough record to prove that any doubts of the pupils' interest were groundless. On November 19, I admitted eleven pupils who were not yet in Grade VII, and have been holding classes with them myself in our third room. This was again an arbitrary action on my part, but to have left them out would have been a breach of faith on our part. Seven of these came from Omeida #5, and were not attending school because of lack of room there. Two were from Omeida #2, admitted because of their size and years (one girl 14 yrs., Grade II); the remaining two from Bear Creek, older girls in Grade VI.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWithout admitting any others from the Chippewa schools, there remain at least six who should be admitted, five of them from Oneida, to relieve the teacher, who has forty and more still. They have not been permitted to come, because I felt incapable of giving them adequate help. Would you give some consideration to the possibility of providing a third teacher after Christmas for this Junior Room, in order to give these auxiliary and semi-auxiliary pupils a better chance of catching up? We have the third room, which we are already using for the eleven and for such classes with the senior grades as I take.\n\nIf this could be done, I would suggest that Mrs. Harry Lockwood at Delaware, who taught for five or six years among our Indians here with success, would consider helping us out for the half-year. I have discussed the matter with her in connection with our former need of a teacher, and I believe she would accept the position at least temporarily. Miss Comfort, at the Indian office, drives from Delaware every morning, and would simplify the matter of transportation I believe.\n\nI realize that you were not contemplating a third teacher this year, but this was because it was thought that this year was but a temporary matter. To add a third teacher would be to operate the school this year in accordance with our plans for the school, or almost so, without waiting for the completion of a new building. It is, in my judgment, advisable to do so, and I trust that you will give it every consideration.\n\nMrs. Healip has proven quite an asset, and has taken a real interest in the pupils. Mr. Johnston has been working many long hours in order to have everything at its best. It has been an exceedingly busy month for all of us, but the school is well launched. May I add that a third teacher would mean a great deal in giving Mr. Johnston an opportunity to do more of the practical work which we believe to be so valuable. In addition it would enable me to spend more time in the other schools.\n\nThanking you for your assistance and co-operation, I am,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nOn Friday, December 6th, I spent a day at Mount Elgin. As you will readily understand this visit was not one of formal inspection though I had some opportunity of observing the work being done.\n\nThe staff had had some opportunity of finding where they were, so the courses were discussed and suggestions made.\n\nThe enrolment is: Grade 10 - 4; Grade 9 - 7; Grade 8 - 13; Grade 7 - 12; and lower grades - 12. The work of Grades 9 and 10 will be handled capably by Mrs. Jette Hyslop who is highly qualified and has had good experience. Grade 7 and 8 are largely in the charge of Mr. Johnson who is keenly interested in the welfare of Indian children. Mr. Joblin was looking after the retarded children.\n\nYou are likely aware that he has taken this latter group into the school to relieve the congestion in one of the Onelas Day Schools. With more adequate transportation facilities, the number of these older retarded pupils could be increased. If Mr. Joblin is to keep close supervision of the Day Schools, a teacher of this group should be provided in the New Year. Mr. Joblin has a lady in mind - Ms. Lockwood. She was successful in Indian Schools at an earlier period. I suggest that her engagement be considered favourably.\n\nWhile difficulties have prevented plans from following original intentions, the atmosphere and spirit of the school even as it is indicates that we are on the right track. The whole student body was alert, attentive and eager. Progress has been slow but is evident. I suggested to Mrs. Hyslop that Grades 9 and 10 be combined in Science as they are in Health, Geography and History, Art and part of the English taking Grade 10 course. Next year both grades will follow the Grade 9 course.\nA similar plan may be adopted in Grades 7 and 8. We follow these plans in the white schools.\n\nThese suggestions may annoy you as the order for texts will be changed to some extent but I imagine they understand.\n\nMr. Joblin and Mr. Johnson are the janitors so far. I presume that this is a detail which will be amended at an early date.\n\nOne bus is making two trips daily. With another vehicle the attendance can be increased and the present enrolment served more satisfactorily. You appear to have a very capable operator of the vehicle now in use.\n\nI visited the River Settlement and Pack Settlement schools earlier. The day I planned to visit the Bear Creek School, teacher and pupils had gone on a hike. I hope to call on them before Christmas.\n\nA new spirit of expectancy pervades these schools. Teachers are aroused and pupils are on the alert. It is too early for appraisal of results, but the situation is the most hopeful in my eight years of contact with the Indian children. At Mount Elgin unusually regular attendance has occurred\u2014not perfect but close to it.\n\nSupply of blank Forms I. A. 401 is depleted. My formal report will be submitted at the close of this term. You may be pleased to forward a supply of these forms prior to that time.\n\nAs discussed with you this fall, I hope to visit the Grade 8 several times during the winter in the hope that next June we have a record at the Entrance Examination superior to that made in past years. You will understand that only mileage will be charged for the extra visits.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGORDON YOUNG\nINSPECTOR OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS\nWEST MIDDLESEX.\n**MONTHLY REPORT ...

Neary:\n\nThe attached Monthly Report is submitted for your perusal, and I wish to draw your attention to the underlined; also the grades listed.\n\nPersonally I am not concerned as to what grades attend the school, or what your future plans are, but I am thinking perhaps I misunderstood your verbal statement and maybe misinterpreted your letter of October 15, 1946 all of which quite definitely intimated that Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10 would be admitted to the New School this year. It is also recalled that all matters of school administration were to remain the prerogative of the Indian Office. I also recall a telephone conversation when you stated:\n\n\"I do not ever intend to correspond direct with the new Principal but he will, when the occasion arises, receive a copy of my letter to you.\"\n\nYou were so specific and so emphatic that I cannot think that you have changed your mind. As I said before I am not concerned with what grades attend the school but I am concerned for my administration and the close co-operation I have always enjoyed with my teachers. After receiving your instructions I advised all teachers that Grades 7, 8, 9 and 10 would be permitted for this year at least to attend the new school and all grades below would continue in their usual classrooms.\n\nIn view of what has happened I find it somewhat confusing, if a little embarrassing, when the question asked is:\n\n\"Do Mr. Joblin's instructions supersede the Indian Office?\"\n\nIt has been my pleasure to give and receive very close co-operation and amicable relationships among our\nteachers; and the fact that I have been able to hold five teachers throughout the past four difficult years, also the fact that I have had an ex-Indian Day School teacher in my Office for the past four years is, I think, sufficient to warrant my statement.\n\nI do not determine policy, I merely administer it; and am one of those whose policy is, \"Come what may! Loyalty, Discipline and Efficiency.\" If you agree that Mr. Joblin's instructions to the various teachers supersede the Indian Office you will please advise, and I will advise all concerned accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nOttawa, December 14, 1946.\n\nMr. G. J. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nReference your letter 125-12 of December 9:\n\nThere has been no authority given by the Department for the attendance of any children at the Mount Elgin Indian Day School other than those of Grades 7, 8 and 9.\n\nOur letter of similar file dated October 15 clearly lays down our policy with regard to those pupils who were to attend this school. You were quite right in advising your teachers as you did concerning the attendance at this school. This is one of the points which I had hoped to have Mr. Doucet's visit straighten out, and I can quite realize your embarrassment over what has happened. You can rest assured that I will discuss this matter very fully with you at the Agents' meeting in Toronto next week.\n\nBernard F.

I know that it is not the fault of Indian Affairs Officials, but the fact remains that the expenditure was authorized and this is the fourth notice requesting payment.\n\nI would be greatly appreciated and remove my embarrassment if the Treasury Office could be advised of this unsatisfactory condition. The same thing applies to the London Free Press of London, Ontario. Both accounts are outstanding since October, 1946.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Geo. W.

This permission has been graciously given to me by the author in this issue.)\nIt was in the days of \"Vineland\", a thousand years ago, when Christianity was young in Europe, that Vikings in romantic ships came up out of the far Laurentian Sea into the River of the Iroquois and even unto the Bay of Quinte.\n\nSeveral ships remained on the Quinte for a season or two at Kay-Say-Ronth-You (meaning Thunder and Lightning) and the White Folk told the Indians about Jesus and a beautiful story of the starry night when Christ was born.\n\nKay-Say-Ronth-You was an Iroquois place, for the Bay of Quinte was considered a part of the great Iroquoian Sea now called Lake Ontario. Wealth of wild life, safe waters and seclusion made the Iroquois jealous of this beautiful bay of peace and plenty, but there was no war in the land; and inasmuch as rumours of big white men among the stars had spread, Indian fashion, on the wings of God's imagination, strange messengers tramped on the Quinte trail. Curiosity brought Algonquins from afar to see these Vikings and their ships like swans that swam with the wind of the wind - white swans from another world! Great, white swans, and under the spell of Nino Manitou, The Good, bearing, as they did, rose-white people with raiment fair to see!\n\nThere came a young Algonquin Chieftain, whose brow was noble, whose heart was clean, and whose look was the look of the rising sun - piercing as a sword! He sat apart, alone, and heard no word of Jesus until, one day, he couldn't help watching and hearing a charming white maiden telling some children a dream-like story in her own tongue, and shyly looking his way, knowing that he was listening. It was about a Manitou child whom the Lord of Heaven had sent to earth. His eyes were filled with wonder, she all the more lovelier, listening with encouragement in his heart. His voice was lost upon her, and her lovely voice was as the sweetest sound of any bluebirds in migration.\n\nThen he knew this maiden; he loved this Viking girl with a fervent love, passion of divine purity and visited her many times by night and by day, he named her Inakona - \"I am the light\" - meaning, You inspire me to good actions.\"\n\nHe was so captivated, heart and soul, when he transposed for her the children's tale of the birth of Jesus, retelling it himself to the children in poetical signs and symbols of the new man's way. His magnetic power made her afraid, but his wild radiance persuaded her - and she loved him. On the spur of the moment he told her that his name was Inakona - \"My voice is her light.\"\nAll the raucous crows laugh,\n\"Caw,caw,caw,caw;\"\nAll the noisy boys laugh,\n\"Haw,haw,haw,haw;\"\nGloomy owls at night laugh,\n\"Ko,O - O,ko,o!\"\nBig, fat, jolly men laugh,\n\"Ho,ho,ho,ho!\"\nUt maidens laugh so merrily,\nVerily, verily, verily,\nHm,ha,ha,ha,merrily,\nLike a bluebird song.\nBut maidens laugh so merrily,\nVerily, verily, verily,\nHa, ha, ha, ha, merrily,\nLike a bluebird song.\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha, verily,\nLike a bluebird song,\nHa, ha, ha, ha, merrily,\nLike a bluebird song...\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hal\n\nWhen she ran, her laughter fading away with her, he stood looking over the water, unseeing, entranced.\n\nThus things went. Even the tang of early autumn seemed to get its joyous song from Inashia and its urge from Inakona, inspiration of the morning! Hills of maple all on fire! But nature spoke differently to Inashia's father, leader of the White Folk; he saw warning in the Moon of Falling Leaves.\n\nSoon thereafter, and with promises to come back, perchance the following year - the Vikings descended to the sea.\n\nNo one had seen the weeping Inashia, save a wordless Inakona. Baffled by the White Man's way, he gave his anguish quiet, Indian-wise; and the bluebirds murmured autumn, winnowed parting to the water. \"Inashia! Inashia!\n'I'll return, oh, Inakona!\n\nOnly the timeless headdress heard and white eyes solo to their sighing threnody of love.\n\nLong was the lingering of Inakona where he had watched the Vikings vanish. It was with soul-searching reluctance, therefore, that he departed to measure the trail to his own far people, and keep his heart's impulsive promise to carry to them the story of 'The Star of Bethlehem' in the Indian manner of his own interpretation.\n\nIn a corner of the Moon of Falling Leaves found pensive cadence in the softly falling feet of this young Chieftain, as he passed and passed the spruce and cedar scented trail.\n\nOne day, from a hilltop lying balmy in the sun, the Red Man saw a wisp of blue-gray smoke; he was home! Soon that fire's home aroma blessed him with home's age-old blessings: familiar faces, thoughts and things.\nSo, in the light of the evening fire, in the centre of his village, in the custom of his people, and after telling of his travels among the Iroquois, Inakon let fall upon Algonquin ears the story of a Moon of Beebon's Mighty Star.\n\nGwengowea, virgin maid of the Algonquins, dreamed that she had been the bride of the Thunderbird, the winged Spirit of Light from the clouds, and that she would bring forth a child\u2014a Manitou of Peace unto all men. Her people were at war with the Iroquois, and she was afraid.\n\nIt was winter\u2014the Moon of Beebon\u2014and spring would be fearsome. Gwengowea must seek safety in a far land of peace, dangerous though the journey would be. She would go on snowshoes, alone and unseen\u2014but how? Her name gave her the answer: Gwengowea, \"The Little Owl!\" Usually the Tucker Owl is gray, but once she had seen pure white one, an albino. Ah! The pure-white owl! She would dress in white fur\u2014pass unseen in the snow. So, she did.\n\nOne afternoon, as the shadows of waning day deepened to morn blue, and the sun was no longer warm to her back, she came upon a great, snow-covered spruce tree\u2014her shelter for the night; and there, on a snowy bough before her, silent and motionless sat an albino squirrel, white as down-down snow, its red eyes reflecting the setting sun with unearthly fire\u2014and gazing strangely into hers!\n\nHer heart was troubled, for the ghost squirrel held a wild-rose in its tangle of thorns, red like fire\u2014not the snow! Something would happen. Something must come\u2014surely, something beautiful\u2014but what? The weirdness of the sight! The thought of thorn! The red of rose twice\u2014very bright in moonlight unclouded burning red! She could not understand. What did they mean? She slept and dreamed of wonder at the lin.\n\nAt long thereafter, Gwengowea entered a friendly village, for it was near her time. Their longhouse was already too filled for comfort, but she was permitted to rest in a stable lodge with some captive deer in whose big, soft eyes there twinkled the light of a Magic Star, shining through a large smoke-hole in the roof, and illumining the interior. Thus, in this place, warmed by the bodies of the gentle deer of the forest, the child of peace was born to man-most-wild.\n\nInakon knew the potency of fitting pause, so, Inakon slept in the fitful night\u2014thinking...\nIn the shadowy stillness, there in his thoughts for the brevity and beauty of Indian expression, he was himself a thing of strength and beauty, like them in their midst. Indians didn't bother much about details; they pictured only powerful essentials. Consequently, when Inashia had translated for him, he had said at times:\n\n\"Starry Light Anang Wabanong - The Manitou Star in the Sky\"\n\nNow, in this silence, out of his mind's song for lost peoples, he chanted \"Three Mighty Hunters fishing in pool in the Ice,\" while he softly wrote down:\n\nThree Mighty Hunters, on the ice,\nFished through the night, alone,\nAnd there appeared a strange device,\nA star that brightly shone,\nSerene and cool\nUpon their pool,\nOne star - and one alone!\nOne star reflected in the hole,\nThat gave its darksome deep a soul!\n\nUpon the starlit, tranquil night,\nA Spirit voice then rang,\n\"Your mocasins shall trail the light\nOf Manitou Among,\nOf Mino Wabanong - the Star!\nAnong! Anong! Anong!\"\nOh, Anangoka - Starry Night!\nAnong! O, Wabanong!\n\nAfter another long, weary silence, during which the truck circled slowly, the Indians, all of them, knew that he were thing most, some felt as if he had vanished or called them beyond reach.\n\nIt was not until late, trailing Anang Wabanong, found the little ones, the young ones, owea strangely expecting them at this hour, according to native custom. Nor did they yield to curiosity or knowledge of their elders.\nChief Thlonoty went to all store corn\u2014oil for flour; Chief Pekolok went to get virgin copper to show for fuel, the most precious thing he had, and which he had got at great price, in trading with remote tribes north of the greatest of fresh water, inland seas; for food and fuel these tokens were, they were matched and given meaning by the present of Chief Our Voice, who brought the sign of light, a fire-bow and its kindling arrow, to loose the sun within the lodge, make free wood's blessed power\u2014all of them symbols of life and peace among men.\n\n\"Ah! I am a Wino banong!\" sang Inakon\u00e9 in conclusion.\n\nThus the story finish, the people were moved with beauty unutterable, and over hills went the story. And from far came the voice so heard in all winter, in and again, came the people. All the hills and hills were telling.\n\nAnd so the story goes on, and on, and on, but yet there they stand, within the vision of setting suns, beyond the sea, beyond the land, beyond the thunder of the sea, beyond the wind, beyond the white man's lands\u2014but the story goes on, and on, and on.\n\nOnly we come here, and wander at convents! Convents! In the land of the Will of the Lord\u2014she was nun! In token of which she did not go further, but would to go into Vineland, a land of the old, old order, where beauty is possible\u2014where there is such as has been known, and be known shall return, or, shall it be said, this is not true\u2014at the new.\n\nAnd so the story goes on, and on, and on.\n\nThe River of the Iroquois Flows to its Viking Sea, And on a height Algonquin stands And views it silently, Then down the widening waves bespeak Ah! where they pass\u2014oh, wistfully!\u2014 To murmur at a maiden's feet, Ah, sweet and endlessly!\nThe silence of its winding flow,\nToo deep for sound, so far below,\nThe Chieftain sees and blesses,\n\"O Timeless Iroquoian Stream,\nRoll down to your Laurentian Dream,\nThat far and Viking Sea\nYour urge caresses - oh,\nIn your mighty, moving passion,\nNow enfold love's mystic mission -\nGo!\"\n\n\"Go find the maiden on the strand,\nShe'll touch you with her eager hand,\nShe'll hear your voice and understand\n'Ah, yes,' I know! I know!\n\n\"Ah, 'll write a name upon the sand,\nAnd, lappingly, you'll kiss her hand,\nThen smooth again will be the strand,\nAnd sighing, mention me;\nThe maiden's murmur then will sigh,\n'I know! - 'Tis he! 'Tis he!'\"\nInkona carried little, golden cross, made of pine twigs bound with golden hair. The child, on his favorite tall ridge, he set the cross on a flat rock stone, then faced the setting sun, to sing his evening psalm.\n\nA storm was rolling up out of the East, blue-black storm all overcast its purple haze\u2014so faintly distant rumble yet, so ominous it seemed to settle it, animating by the unearthly low of deep-throated defiance which it hurled forward into the flushing face of setting sun. Imballed, he stood and watched that woeless yield of hue, and as he calmly wondered at its form some lonely, feeling bird came with him\u2014therefore unfurled\u2014into the covert of each corner that sinister sky, there dwelt, with him at shadowing, tender twin of keen swans! In silence\u2014wild rose\u2014white pine in first glowering fall.\n\nSeven white swans, sunset-rose in hue; slowly, in perfect rhythm, flying like a line of living song, they twirled their measured melody like silence lost in space. It was enough.\n\nThen mutter rolled the sky with sullen night! He turned, before too late, and faced the setting sun to sing his evening psalm:\n\n\"O, Power to make me clean!\nO Mano-Tanahla!\nInkonon! Menitou!\nGod, show me how to go!\"\n\nThunder rumbled! The Thunder spoke! The Lightning flashed! But there was no reply!\n\nThe child had found him. It had found also, in little pine-twig cross, the soul's outline on the rock where it had lain.\n\nDay, you, Inkonon-Maitou! I heard the song in the soul of Inkonon. Inkonon! God and His Cross, in the rock eternal, burned forevermore.\nThe GLOBE AND MAIL\n\nToronto, Ont.\n\n\"Teacher\" wanted.\n\n1 insertion $1.86 3 Consecutive Ins. $5.17\n\n6 Consecutive Ins. cost $9.54\n\nDUPLICATE\n\nExaminers and Recorded...

Unfortunately, Mr. Joblin did not tell me of the lower grade children being already admitted to the school until after it was an accomplished fact.\n\nHowever, we are endeavouring to obtain another bus for the school and the situation at the over-crowded day schools can then be eased somewhat. As soon as this bus becomes available we can consider your recommendation concerning the provision of another teacher. Mr. Joblin had also mentioned to me the name of Mrs. Lockwood. We have written to Mr. Down concerning the employment of a janitor at this school.\n\nI sincerely appreciate your interest in this little school system and you can rest assured that your recommendations are read with care and that we will do everything possible to carry them out.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

It will be placed on file for future reference.\n\nYou infer that Ottawa has failed to make something clear. I do not think so, but rather think that you have failed to realize the responsibilities attached to your appointment. As the senior official at this Agency, and my direct responsibility to Ottawa in all matters of administration whether it be Schools, Lands, Trusts or any matters pertaining to Indian Welfare, I think you will agree that it is my right, as incumbent, to know what is happening. I therefore feel that if you would come to this office, which common courtesy demands, rather than assume your present attitude of complete indifference, and the aggrieved person, your imaginary grievances would disappear. If, also, you would show a spirit of cooperation, as intimated in the last paragraph of one of your letters, I am sure that you would receive from the entire staff of my office 100% co-operation in return. However, I am not disturbed and I do not wish to enter into any acrimonious correspondence.\n\nWith regard to the janitor and supplies necessary for the cleaning of the School it will be in order, as it always has been, for the teacher or the janitor to purchase cleaning supplies; but it is necessary to obtain an\nMt. Elgin Indian Day School,\nFebruary 17, 1947.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is perhaps needful that I acknowledge the appointment of Mrs. Henry and Arnold as caretakers of the School. This is highly satisfactory, and I look forward to their assistance. They commenced their duties last Monday, February 10. I believe it is usual for the caretakers of the schools to make their cleaning needs known to you yourselves. This will be assumed, unless I hear to the contrary.\n\n(Signed) E.E.M. Joblin\nFebruary 17, 1947\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe teachers of Oneida schools No's. 2 and 3 have expressed the wish to have their manual training equipment returned from No. 1 school, so that their older boys might occasionally do some of this work. I believe the understanding was, when they were pooled a few years ago, that when the time came to work separately again, they should be divided as equitably as possible between the three schools.\n\nMay I suggest therefore, that this be done soon, since there is some urgency about spending their grant for this work, and until they receive them, it is impossible to know just what they may need. You will find enclosed a list of the tools which were there last Thursday, omitting a few insignificant items.\n\nThe long bench came from Oneida #3, and will presumably go back. The other two were in the school. The new one which the boys made, was intended for #2, but inasmuch as it was removed, I sent one over from here last fall, and this should take care of their needs.\n\nIt should have been possible for me to attend to this matter, but since you do not share my views as to my work, I am referring it to you rather than involve the teachers in any unpleasantness. Since there seems to be so great a difference between our interpretation of my responsibilities here, I am convinced that Ottawa has somehow failed to make it clear. Until this has been done there seems little hope of our reaching a working understanding such as, believe me, I am most anxious to reach.\n\n(Signed) E.E.M.

Perry:\n\nI attach, hereto, copies of correspondence recently received from Mr. Joblin; also a copy of my reply.\n\nApparently Mr. Joblin intends to take things as difficult as possible. It is noted that he infers that there is something in connection with his duties which Ottawa, meaning I presume the Department, has failed to reveal. He also attempts, in a clumsy way, to cover up his discourtey and lack of co-operation. Knowing the Caradoc Agency and the adjacent area as I do, past and present, I am not concerned and have become hardened to the petty viciousness; but it now appears that a determined effort is being made to discredit not only this Office, but the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nQuite recently an old church record was dug up, approximately one hundred years old, dealing with the lands of the Mt. Elgin Residential School and we are accused of using lands which we have no right to. I am convinced that such snags being injected into our efforts are the result of vindictiveness and perhaps resentment of recent happenings to the Mt. Elgin Residential School. I am also convinced that not an Indian, now living at this Agency, knew of this document until a few weeks ago. They are now presenting it in the form of a treaty, but really it is an\nagreement signed by the old Methodist Missionaries and certain chiefs of the Band. Again I am not concerned but it is very embarrassing to be continually gibed and called a usurper, especially when the balls are being shaped for throwing. I do not wish to embarrass you but I do regret that during the Agent's Conference in the city of Toronto, we missed the opportunity of discussing many disturbing problems which have injected themselves from certain quarters into this already turbulent Agency.\n\nIt may be necessary, before we can commence Spring operations on the Mt. Elgin Lands, for me to request a personal discussion and it is hoped if this is made possible, that we may freely discuss annoyances from this quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

NEARY,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\n(Ottawa), Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nDuring the past months I have tried to spare you the annoyance of complaints but it has become imperative now that you be furnished with some facts which may assist you in reaching a fair conclusion concerning the reports you have had of us. There are issues involved which are too serious to be ignored any longer if the ultimate success of the work is to be made possible.\n\nThe causes of misunderstanding between us and the Agent fall into two main classes. First, those due to our widely divergent views as to my position as Supervisor of Education. In this matter I am of the opinion that the fault must lie with Ottawa rather than with either of us, since Mr. Doucet evidently shared Mr. Down's opinion.\n\nSecond, those matters in which he did have instructions but which he has failed to put into effect, and which bear on the question of co-operation.\n\nIt has been made quite clear at this end that my position is nothing more than Principal of Mt. Elgin Day School. In support of this statement I offer the following facts:\n\nI learned at our meeting in January that Dr. Moore visited our reserve last fall and called on two schools, yet no mention of the fact was made to me.\n\nWhen it was necessary last fall to advertise for a teacher to replace Mr. George on Onda #3, it was done, the teacher engaged, and I received no intimation of it, though I should have been satisfied if I had been notified.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Doucet's inspection visit in January, the other teachers received letters some two weeks in advance, while I had no word till a few days before, in the form of a late postscript. While Mr. Doucet was inspecting the work I believe for four days, Monday to Thursday, I neither knew who was here, nor saw him until 10:15 A.M. on Thursday, and practically no opportunity to discuss our needs or present our side of the picture.\nIn connection with his visit, I had arranged for the teachers to meet at one of the schools at 4 p.m. Thursday, so that they might discuss the health posters, and perhaps give the visitor a chance to meet with us. Without consulting me, or notifying me of the change, the meeting was changed to 2 p.m., and to the Agent's office. I learned of it only when the two men called at the school that day. I cannot believe that a man in Mr. Doucet's position would make so many errors if he had thought of me as being in charge of education. I did not raise the issue, but it is one which must be clarified.\n\nAt that teachers' meeting, I suggested that we might have all the pupils assemble here and display their posters on February 7th, from 3 to 4 p.m. Mr. Doucet approved; I was into the office at least twice concerning it, and invited Mr. Down to attend, and to act as judge for the posters. He did his work as a judge well and appreciated it. The pupils had a fine time visiting us; the senior pupils served lunch and presented a little programme; they presented extra prizes for the best posters. It was such an occasion as I am sure you would heartily approve. Yet as a result of it, the teachers received the most perplexing letters from the office in which Mr. Down implied that no one had any right to arrange such a gathering or to let the teachers attend, but himself. Because of this attitude, the teachers have been kept in a state of uncertainty, and since this letter was sent, I have felt it necessary to absent myself from the other schools lest I \"put the teachers on the spot\". Until the teachers are clearly informed as to my responsibility, how can I carry out any programme in connection with these schools?\n\nI was engaged by Mr. Hoey as Supervisor of Education as outlined in Mr. Young's report, and it was on this understanding the Church consented to the closing of the Residential School. I felt that you had accepted this too, but somehow the matter has not yet filtered down to those further down the list. My position is intolerable, and if allowed to continue would be a serious breach of faith with the Church and the people. If this position and the work of education is to be made dependent upon the whim of the Agent, it is doomed to failure. Let not my silence heretofore be taken for acquiescence. This matter is fundamental to the whole plan, and the future of the work as well as the future position of the person in charge is at stake. There can be no compromise. Speaking for myself, I could not continue to work for a Department in whom I had lost confidence. I have steadfastly believed that Mr. Hoey and later yourself intended to make of this project one of the best efforts yet made on behalf of the Indians. If I were forced to believe that Mr. Down's treatment of us this year were a true representation of the Department's will you would very soon have my resignation. Since I look upon you as my superior officer, I have not written of these matters to Mr. Hoey, but would hope that you would consider them of sufficient importance to discuss with him. However, I feel responsible also to Dr. Dorey, who will receive a copy of this letter.\nIn the second category, there are matters for which it is impossible to blame anyone but Mr. Down. We are not inclined to criticize him for our having no road and no telephone, since this is a part of the price of a new road. Since the new year the road has been passable for less than two weeks early in March, and will probably be closed for at least two weeks yet. The telephone is not yet replaced; that unpaid balance which the two offices could not straighten out, I have paid so that nothing could prevent our getting service again.\n\nOn July 3rd last, Mr. Down was instructed by Mr. Arneil in my hearing, to have the furnace put in order with the stoker, and to set up radiators in our apartment, to heat from the same system as the classrooms. These instructions were repeated at different times when some of you men were here. Not neither has yet been done, and I have carried coal up 25 steps for two stoves, and stoked an old furnace with stoker coal, making trips every hour and half from 6:30 a.m. till 11 p.m. I was allowed to do this for over three months without Mr. Down securing a caretaker. After Mr. Down's visit, he told me to find someone to do the work and tender an offer. This was done and immediately approved by you, so that they took over on Feb. 10th or the three months I had done all the work of the school, including daily sweeping and dusting. When it was evident that nothing was being done with the furnace, we began to write about it and learned that there were no parts available and patterns would have to be made for ourselves. This Mr. Johnston did, working late for weeks and completing them in time for the official visit in January. We offered them to Mr. Down, who did not take them. Instead he thought he could secure the parts. Nothing more has been heard of the matter, the parts are still lying here. The work involved in keeping heat up with stoker coal in this way has been beyond a joke; it is still necessary for me to attend to it night and morning, since the caretakers cannot stay around all the time. Our apartment is far from warm in cold weather even with two stoves. All this because of two relatively small tasks which could have been done last summer.\n\nAfter some correspondence during the winter regarding cups for the pupils, I suggested that a pair of fountains or \"bubblers\" over the basins in the two classrooms would be most sanitary and inexpensive. Mr. Monet approved this in January; our pupils are still drinking out of two granite cups, which has had some share in causing the spread of colds and leading to several absenteeism this month. They are available, yet two months have passed without results. To date we have 74 rolls of toilet tissue and 24 packages of towels, which is at best about an 8 weeks' supply. I leave you to decide whether such matters are due to incompetence or wilful neglect.\n\nMr. Down complains of my not going into the office. I have been in a good many times; sometimes well received, but frequently to receive a lecture which becomes tiresome. Two weeks ago, at his suggestion, and after his assurance of \"lady courtesy,\" I wrote saying I would call on a certain afternoon at 6 o'clock, and leaving time for him to let me know if this were undesirable. I went and waited, but he neither appeared or left any explanation.\nIt should not be surprising that I have been in no hurry to make another attempt. I intend to do much of my work with the office by correspondence; it is less wasteful of time and much more pleasant. On the other hand he has, so far as I know, forwarded our requisitions promptly, and attended to our fuel supply.\n\nAnother matter which will cause confusion sooner or later, is his persistent attempts to change the name of the school to \"Caradoc Continuation School.\" It was my hope to keep the link with the past hundred years by simply changing the name to Mt. Elgin Indian Day School. This has apparently been accepted by your office in my correspondence, in our supplies and in the making out of our cheques. Yet from this office, the former name is used. It is scarcely necessary for me to point out that our school is not a Continuation school at all, but is in a class by itself, and is in my opinion something better than any other existing type of school system, for this situation. There is no point in my arguing this matter with Mr. Down, but if misunderstanding is to be avoided between the many offices concerned, this should be cleared up, one way or the other. When it has been settled, then it might be possible for us to have some new letterhead paper and envelopes.\n\nThere could be more, but your patience may be exhausted. As concerns next year's work here, it seems to me that I should have an opportunity of seeing you soon after the Easter holiday and at a time when we would not be too rushed. If you were unable to come to Muncey, then I ought to go to Ottawa. There should be a clear ruling as to what students are to be admitted another year, and something needs to be done to secure another teacher, if the need of one is admitted, so that an attempt might be made to find the one we need before June, when most of them have to submit their resignations where they are now employed.\n\nIf we are able to get out, I hope to attend some of the sessions of the O.E.A. in Toronto during the holiday week. Believe me, I should welcome an opportunity to discuss these controversial issues with you, and my correspondence is open to your inspection at any time.\n\nI reiterate my faith in the value of the system of education proposed for our Reserves, and my confidence that eventually it will become a reality.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS.R.M.

Neary,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Col. Neary,\n\nI am writing first, that I returned to my work with a new feeling of confidence and a greater optimism for the success of our venture. A visit to Ottawa left me with no doubt of the government's support and their understanding of the situation here.\n\nMy immediate concern is to make sure of the best available teachers for next year, and not to leave it too late. Hence this letter.\n\n1. Our teacher at No. 2 Oneida is resigning in June. We have received a letter from Miss Jackson, who is in Ottawa and would like to teach here. I visited her when I was in the city and would like to recommend her for No. 2, when you receive Mrs. Heldsworth's resignation. She has agreed to call on you so that you can examine her qualifications and experience yourself. She has had experience which seems to require her for what we need; she will also take part in the life of the community. Moreover, she expressed her willingness to attend the Course in Toronto this summer. If she can be secured for this school, I think it should take care of our key schools on the reserves for next year.\n\n2. Mrs. Neslips, our High School teacher, is willing to remain, in view of the probable increase in salary suggested by the schedule. In this regard I am enclosing a list of her study courses, which, in addition to her 20 years' experience, will, I hope, entitle her to the maximum salary for Grade IV teachers. She is not only willing but eager to carry our three Grade XI pupils on next year. Some early indication of your interpretation of her salary for next year would be greatly appreciated I am sure.\nMr. Johnston, as I suggested, is willing to serve on half-time, principally for shop work, but helping in mathematics. I feel inclined to try this arrangement and would ask you to engage him on half-time for the full school year. However, I should like to make a reservation that, in the event that our needs should be greater than I anticipate, he could be engaged full-time for the winter months from Nov. 1st to May 1st. This would be satisfactory with him and might prove to be necessary.\n\nFor our second full-time teacher, I have an excellent prospect in Mrs. Marjorie Docker, at present principal of the Bridges Continuation School, formerly a teacher on our Reserve, and one of the most successful teachers we know. She is keenly interested in the Indian people and in our experiment here. She has a very fine personality and a very successful way of working with young people. She has the care of three boys of her own, but often gives help in the home. She is only able to interpret her leaving her present position, however, because Bridges is likely in the next few years to be closed to utilize in a larger school area.\n\nMrs. Docker is receiving $1900. Would it be possible for you to evaluate her experience and training by the enclosed sheet, and give me an early reply as to what we could offer her? If I interpret the schedule correctly, it seems to me that she would qualify for the maximum for Grade III teachers, namely $1980. If I could offer her this in addition to the apartment and fuel, I could persuade her to come to Lumsden. She would be able to take care of Grades 7 and 8 and assist in high school work as well. She can travel very little, so I am sure her science work and in fact all work which we might require. Her work in cooking and sewing would be a valuable asset, but her greatest contribution would be in her own personality and influence.\n\nOur inspector Mr. Young would be very kindly of her I know, as I have heard his opinion before. It would indeed be a day of a new day in Indian Education if we could engage such a person, competing with salary schedules of other schools.\n\nThe need for haste in this matter is due to the fact that if she cannot be secured, I need time left to go after Mr. Cowan, or whom I spoke, prior to the end of the month, or some other person.\n\nMr. Lineau would suggest that I attend the course in Toronto, in auxiliary classes, since much of this responsibility could be left with me next year. Am I to understand that I could have permission to do this, in view of the fact that I am employed on a twelve-month basis? It would seem to be a more immediately useful course than for me to take the normal course. I had intended enrolling at Columbia, but I've decided that for this year I should take advantage of the course you are sponsoring in Toronto.\n\nThis had better suffice for now, writing you soon to see how an earlier letter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nOttawa, May 14, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 12 and will take up the points that you have raised.\n\n1. We will accept Miss McLean for Oneida No. 2 on your recommendation. She was supposed to go to Walpole Island for us last winter but changed her mind suddenly.\n\n2. Mrs. Healip is entitled to 5 years' credit for her experience in provincial schools (see general regulation No. 3 on page 4). We will also credit her with one year in an Indian school. This would give her a salary for a Grade 4 teacher in the seventh year, namely, \u00a31,660.\n\n3. We will pay Mr. Johnston one-half of the salary which he would be entitled to on the scale. I will expect to hear further from you as to whether this arrangement should be satisfactory.\n\n4. Mrs. Docker sounds a most excellent teacher. Unfortunately, we could not meet her salary on the present scale. We would give her five years' credit for provincial teaching plus three years for her Indian school teaching. This would entitle her to a salary of \u00a31,740 (9th year on the Grade 3 teacher's scale). I sincerely regret this because she sounds just the type of person we are anxious to have in our schools.\n\nWe were not able to allow full experience in provincial schools because the various provincial\n\n..... salary\nsalary scales only give partial credit in a similar manner for teaching done in another province. In fact most of them only allow three years' credit for such experience.\n\n5. I certainly feel that you would be well advised to attend the Auxiliary Course in Toronto. If you will write a formal letter through the Indian agent concerning this, I will see that you are given the necessary approval. I have also taken up the question of your salary and you should receive an amount based on the rate of $2,400.00 a year as of June 1st. You might drop me a line after you have received your salary cheque at the end of June.\n\nI hope that I have answered all the questions which you have raised. I especially regret our inability to offer Mrs. Docker a better salary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard D. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend E.R.M. Joblin, M.A., B.D.,\nMount Elgin Indian Day School,\nMunciey, Ontario.\nCol. Heary,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Heary,\n\nI am making an application for the course in welfare classes, Course A. However, I cannot meet their entrance requirements and do not know whether they will admit me. I have tried to be willing to take the work without receiving a certificate. Inspector Young has written a letter also, urging them to permit me to enroll, so please let me know if you would help.\n\nAfter hearing your favorable reaction to Mrs. Locker's qualifications, I tried again to secure her in spite of the lower salary. She has resigned at T. Rydges and her application to Mr. Down is in the mail this morning. She was offered another job, raising her salary \u00a3100, but in spite of this I decided to come to Muncey. This was only possible because of the apartment here, which I assured her would be heated, as is the case with other teachers. I earnestly hope that nothing will prevent your accepting her now, inasmuch as I have let her resign her position at T. Rydges. No better person for the work could be secured in this town; I am confident.\n\nMany thanks for your care of me in increasing my salary before Sept. 1st. I realize this goes too far for you, but do not feel justified in refusing. Indeed, I am content on this point, and am only too glad that together we can accomplish something worthwhile here.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RC 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nOttawa, May 31, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have today been interviewed by Mrs. Grace Anderson, who holds a high school teacher's certificate for the Province of Ontario. She is 41 years of age and is married to a retired Civil Servant who is 70 years of age.\n\nI mentioned to her the possible vacancies in the Caradoc Agency. As I am unaware of your proposals for filling these vacancies, I have requested that she write to you concerning them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard T. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend R.E.M. Joblin,\nPrincipal,\nMount Elgin Indian Day School,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\nJune 10, 1947.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nDept. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nYou will have received by this time, the resignation of our High School teacher, Mrs. Leslie. In offer of considerably more money, together with the atrocious road conditions this year, are largely to blame. This is a loss to us, especially since we had hoped, at your suggestion, to carry a few pupils on into Grade XI. Her resignation makes the appointment of Mrs. Docker all the more urgent, since she can take Grades IX and X, and we have good prospects for a teacher for Grades VII and VIII.\n\nThe salary schedule, while excellent in many respects, still does not permit us to compete with other salaries at the present time. This is going to make it very difficult to secure the type of teachers we want, although it would seem that we have good hopes for this year. The maximum of five years experience in provincial schools is perhaps the greatest handicap. However, you are aware of all these facts. Fr. Down will be sending in applications for two other teachers, and has asked me to append a note concerning them.\n\nMrs. Anderson's inquiry was encouraging until your mention of her husband, which complicated matters. With Mrs. Docker in the other apartment, as I trust she will be, there is not sufficient accommodation for another married couple. I have therefore written her to this effect.\n\nIn early confirmation of Mrs. Docker's appointment would greatly appreciated. Along with this, some directions for having the apartment cleared out for July 1st, - the furniture of Mr. J.C. Bush has been in it since last September, because of their difficulty in getting possession of their dwelling in Brantford.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nOttawa, June 13, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. McCubbin:\n\nI have referred Mrs. Docker's letter to the Indian Affairs branch. Mrs. Docker's salary for the 1947-48 school term has been set at $1,740.00. She will also receive free house, fuel and light.\n\nThe Indian school teachers' salary schedule gives credit for five years' experience only in provincial schools. This is a standard practice in provincial salary schedules. In fact, most provinces grant only three years' credit for previous experience in other provinces. As Mrs. Docker has three years' previous experience in Indian schools, this gives her a total credit of 5 plus 3 = 8 years on the schedule.\n\nIf, Mrs. Docker held a high school teacher's certificate she would receive $1,980.00 on the teachers' salary schedule.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.J. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nRobert McCubbin, Esq., L.L.B.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, July 5, 1947.\n\nDear Mrs. Walker:\n\nI have received your letter of July 4 with completed application form. I have forwarded it to Mr. G. S. Down, Indian Agent, Nuneys, Ont., with the request that either he or the Principal, Mr. Joblin, write directly to you concerning accommodation, etc. If you wish further details, his address is as stated above.\n\nIf you are prepared to accept this school, we can offer you a beginning salary of $1,800.00 for the 1947-48 academic year and a classification as a Grade IV Indian school teacher. This salary would be increased by $60.00 annual increments to $2,440.00 and from there to $2,230.00 in increments spaced every five years. Your beginning classification would be as a temporary Civil Servant of the Dominion Government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHereward J. Neary,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Alice S.

Down, Indian Agent,\nMunro, Ontario.\n\nFurther to my letter of yesterday, please find attached another application received from a teacher with high school experience. Mrs. Walker is 39 years of age and a widow with two pre-school children. She has requested a position where there is living accommodation for herself and children.\n\nI am writing to her, to inform her of the fact that I am forwarding her application to you. I would suggest that either Mr. Joblin or yourself write directly to Mrs. Walker for further information.\n\nI am attaching all the correspondence which we have received from Mrs. Walker. With her degrees and teaching experience, she would be entitled to a beginning salary of $1,800.00 for the 1947-48 academic year with a classification as a Grade IV Indian school teacher.\n\nIncl.\n\nBernard F.

How many teachers do you wish to place? You mentioned a married lady first etc., then three children of school age and later advise that the wash apartment was to be made ready. Is it your intention that these children should attend the Indian school? Mr. Johnson I have recently been told, although not officially, has some arrangement as a part time teacher and he also rents a room, fuel and light. Is this correct? If so, as far as I am aware, it leaves one unfurnished room available.\n\nWith regard to applications, until I know what you have in mind such as a teaching staff, I do not know what you want me to do. Anything I might be able to add could only be based on the information given in the applications.\n\nYour correspondence of July 4th refers to W.S. Tigges of Ottawa and his personal qualifications, professional qualifications and teaching experience certainly qualify him for the position as teacher; in passing, I would say principal. I do not know what your letter of June 30th to him contained other than that you must have advised him that the salary is set at $1,600.00. You do not mention \"plus\".\n\nWith regard to his questions:\n\n1. No. There is not a High School around Mt. Elgin.\n2. No. There are not living quarters available connected with the school; neither in the immediate vicinity.\n\nYour correspondence of July 5th, which refers to Mrs. Alice E. Walker, is somewhat different as your letter to her of July 5th is a commitment of employment:\n\"If you are prepared to accept this school, we can offer you a beginning salary of $1,800.00 for the 1947-48 academic year and a classification as a Grade IV Indian school teacher.\"\n\nFrom this it would appear that if she accepts you have no choice but to hire; but let us refer to her letter to you of July 4th:\n\n\"You will find my application form enclosed herewith. I shall be indeed interested in a continuation school position in the Mt. Elgin school, particularly if there is accommodation for my sons and housekeeper.\"\n\nIn this connection we may as well be frank. There is positively no accommodation available that I know of for such a family and as busy as I am with all the various building projects and problems, I would not even venture a suggestion or promise anything in the way of securing such accommodation in the immediate vicinity.\n\nMr. Joblin is at present in Toronto taking a course. I therefore cannot discuss the matter with him, and suggest that he write to Mrs. Walker. Nothing do I feel that I should write to her concerning accommodation. I have told you the facts. It would therefore be greatly appreciated if you would pass them on to Mrs. Walker in your own words.\n\nIn conclusion may I say that her qualifications would also qualify her for principalship; and if the requirement is for two extra teachers in addition to the Principal, Mrs. Docker and Mr. Johnson, and you agree that they are necessary, then both applicants are fully qualified and should receive favourable consideration.\n\nGeo.

It would be quite a load off my mind if some suitable person could be secured soon. Certainly I should prefer an capable of doing the high school work and would be glad to have you engage one of them. Other factors being equal, the living accommodations will be a deciding factor. There is no room left available in the present building, but we make a break will be provided this year. If Mr. Brown was willing to \"watch\" it, or board in the village, he might fill the bill.\n\nMrs. Howard appears well qualified, but her young children constitute a problem. I wish you would inquire whether your Board could get the use, if needed, of the furnished, heated apartment under Administration, which is being paid for by the medical service fund. I hold it for the future use of nurses. If your various branches could come to some agreement, this would provide a convenient temporary living quarters until a residence is built.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI do not intend to ask my wife to provide board for teachers this year; it is beyond her strength. I believe a single person could either board in someone's home or rent a room in the school. If the music apartment could be secured, even a person like Mrs. Walker might be able to manage. One other consideration should be mentioned\u2014in view of the fact that our constituency is entirely Protestant, I should think it wise to engage a Protestant teacher, though I am not inclined to make any other denominational distinction.\n\nWith the above facts in mind, I will be glad to have you engage the first suitable person who is willing to work under these conditions. I have no prospect in view, and think it wise to give you a free hand in the matter because of the scarcity of teachers and the passage of time. I appreciate your courtesy in keeping me informed, and am quite willing to write any such person about the work if they are desired.\n\nOur course in Toronto will prove most helpful to me next year.

We are having a great deal of difficulty in appointing a teacher to replace Mrs. Healip. Unfortunately, Dr. Falconer is out of town and I cannot make any definite arrangements with respect to the heated apartment under Lockwood's store, as mentioned in your letter. I doubt very much if they will make it available as they have hopes of obtaining the services of a nurse for Caradoc. I agree entirely that your wife should not be called upon to board these teachers.\n\nBoth Mrs. Walker and Mr. Tigges have children of pre-school and school age. It would seem that we will have to get a young, single male or female teacher who can be boarded in the village.\n\nYour staff for 1947-48, we hope, will consist of the following:\n\n(a) Principal,\n(b) High school teacher - yet to be appointed,\n(c) Senior elementary teacher - Mrs. Doeker,\n(d) Manual training instructor.\n\nI would like confirmation of your plans for Mr. Johnson.

At the moment we have not been able to fill this position by a regular appointment but have been fortunate in obtaining the services of the wife of the doctor who is employed full-time at Muncey. The duration of the services of Mrs. Wiebe are quite indefinite and we might be required to replace her by some means at a very short notice. While Mrs. Wiebe serves as nurse for the reserve we do not have immediate requirement for all of the accommodation referred to above. It would seem only proper that this shall be made available on a temporary basis for such other urgent requirement as may exist.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nIn reply to your recent letter re our staff at Mt. Elgin for this term, the plan you suggest is as I hoped. Mrs. Docker will take Grades VII and VIII if we secure a High School teacher. Failing this, she would do the High School work, which she has been doing at Mt. Bridges, if we found it possible to get a teacher for Grades VII and VIII. Mr. Johnston is prepared to serve on a half time basis as proposed, which will give us the time needed for the boys in General Shop work. I had hoped that either Mrs. Lockwood or Mrs. Johnston from Delaware would have helped us, but before leaving, Mr. Down assured me that they would not consider the senior school, but only wished to take Oneida No.'s 2 and 3 if any.\n\nMr. Down seemed to think he had prospects for the teachers needed for the other schools, and in view of my absence for most of the summer, I left these matters pretty much in his hands. Rumour has it that Miss McLean is going to Walpole Island, although I was counting on her for Oneida No. 2. I am in hopes that by the time I get back to Muncey, around August 9, you and Mr. Down will have succeeded in finding the teachers we need. If not, it will be necessary for me to get busy on the problem as well.\n\nI hope that there will be a second bus of some kind for the opening of school; the small bus could not possibly carry the Oneidas next year.\n\nWhat is your opinion about taking the first few days again for teacher training, as we did last year? If this were to be done, we should soon be making some plans for teachers. In view of the late return of many families to the reserve, I feel that two or three days can be spent very profitably with the teachers in this way. However, this matter will depend upon official approval, so that I await word from you before acting upon it.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would you please forward Mr. Johnston's application for classification on the teachers' salary schedule (as attached to the April issue of the Bulletin) so that we can set his salary for the next academic year.\n\nMiss McMeans is taking over the principalship at Walpole Island. We are having considerable difficulty in filling the other two positions, as, unfortunately, Mrs. Johnston has no teaching certificate and we can offer her only a low beginning salary.\n\nOur Purchasing Agent has had great difficulty in locating a bus and Mr. Down has even checked the old street busses of the London Electric Railway to see if they would be suitable. However, they have a very high mileage on them and would be a great risk.\n\nI would prefer to put on a good Teachers' Convention for the school teachers of southern Ontario this year rather than to have your Short Course of last year. We are trying to run our schools exactly the same as the provincial schools and as they concentrate on covering refresher teaching methods in their conventions, it is felt that we should do the same.

I understand that Mr. Johnston is also gainfully employed in the city of London. Is it therefore your intention, as in the past, to supply house, fuel and light? Since he is to be a part time employee and travels to and from London every day could not his rooms be made available for a permanent academic teacher for the lower grades at the Continuation School? Of course I do not know what the arrangement is but it is intimated, by an exchange of correspondence between your Office and the medical service, that you are, as I have been for several years, searching teacher accommodation possibilities. I knew of the Lockwood apartment; I also recognized the uncertainty of the medical personnel requirement which decided any question I may have had in that direction.\n\nIn addition to rooms in the old building above the Mt. Elgin School classrooms there is also, as you know, a teacher's residence situated on the Oneida Reserve with accommodation for two but I have never been able to interest a teacher in the proposition, especially female. It is lonesome and there is no sanitary accommodation. Even water has to be carried quite a distance and the lighting is by kerosene lamp. There is no transportation service which means that a teacher would have to own an automobile and there\nis no garage. On the other side, the place is clean it being interior decorated in 1946. At present it needs exterior decorating.\n\nWhen making teacher appointments we are concerned primarily with securing teachers and miss the point that she or he has the right to expect something a little better than what is at present offered in the way of accommodation. If you have any teacher prospects for appointment at the Caradoc Agency it would be appreciated if you would please point out accommodation difficulties.

It is suggested that your advertisement could read somewhat as follows:\n\n\"Teachers required for ..... one-room day schools in Caradoc Indian Agency.

Of course, I assure you it was a full-time job, but most valuable to me for the past nine years.\n\nOn the other side of the account, I received at the end of June an extra cheque (gross $40) with salary deductions taken out, which is a bit puzzling. Perhaps the new salary was made retroactive for June so that even this would not explain it, since the June cheque, with an increase of $10 in the gross amount, was actually only $40 more, and deductions were not made on the $40 at that time.\n\nIn view of the short time before our school is becoming somewhat concerned about our records. The accompanying advertisement has been in the London Free Press for three days, since Saturday last. With a larger enrollment this year, the one small bus cannot possibly carry the students who will need a ride home or vehicle to go home. Others to bring a child to the city this fall to be done in less than three weeks. The road is still closed, or else has not been completed. I should like another teacher, the water fountain has not been repaired. However, we are to be patient.\n\nI have applied for a teacher, but am not at all certain how I could get it. I wrote to Mr. Smith, but he said that he could not help me. I have heard nothing further, and this year I expect our school will be closed. We need to close immediately for the lesson completion.

Preston, M.D.,\nAssistant Secretary,\nIndian Health Services.\nDear Doctor Vlebo,\n\nFor some considerable time this Service has retained the use of accommodation over Lockwood's Store at Hansey, part for a medical office and part for a nurse's apartment. The nurse's apartment has not been occupied by this Service for sometime and we have been approached by Welfare and Training Division of Indian Affairs Branch with a view to obtaining the use of this nurse's accommodation for a teacher presently being appointed to Hansey. I believe the teacher's name is Mrs. Harkledge.\n\nIt was made clear to Welfare & Training Division that this accommodation was vacant because we were fortunate in having Mrs. Vlebo as agency nurse at the present time, but that this arrangement was at Mrs. Vlebo's pleasure and should she choose to cease this employment it would be necessary for us to obtain the services of another nurse who would undoubtedly require the accommodation over Lockwood's Store, and hence any occupancy by a teacher would have to be on the distinct understanding that the premises should be vacated on reasonably short order if they were required by Indian Health Services.\n\nIt is desired to make available to Welfare and Training Division the accommodation held for an Indian Health Services nurse on the understanding that the above noted provision is in effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

I have advised her accordingly, also Mrs. Bateman as to salary adjustment. The teacher staff for 1947 is as follows:\n\nNo. 1 Oneida Day School - teacher, Miss Morris\nNo. 2 Oneida Day School - teacher, Mrs. Freida Johnstone\nNo. 3 Oneida Day School - teacher, Mrs. Lillian Lockwood\nBack Settlement School - teacher, Mrs. Gertrude Bateman\nRiver Settlement School - teacher, Mr. Jack Reid\nBear Creek School - teacher, Miss Annett\n\nIt is expected that Miss Annett, who previously taught at Oneida No. 3, will transfer to Bear Creek School. If not, other arrangements will have to be made but you may be assured that the school will not remain without a teacher for any length of time. This completes the school teaching problems of the Caradoc Agency.\n\nGeo. W.

Grey,\n\nI would appreciate an early reply to two matters.\n\nFirstly, I have the opportunity of joining with three neighboring continuation schools in their plans to open a new school next Tuesday, etc., and am seeking your cooperation in this activity. Our school is not in the position to undertake such a project at present, but we would be interested in any assistance you could give us in this regard.\n\nSecondly, I have been informed by Mr. Smith, another school principal, that he is willing to join in a proposal to build a new school building on his land. This proposal is still in its early stages, and I would appreciate your advice on this matter.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the proposal for your consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nI have visited all schools on the Manosey Reserve once this Fall, and my reports are being forwarded on the regular forms through my superintendent's office to your Branch.\n\nYou may be interested in the comments given below. Some of these matters should have early attention; others are just for your early information.\n\nI. Mount Misin School\n\n(a) It is a pleasure to see that the new building is now enclosed and to note that we may expect to use it next year.\n\n(b) I find that Mr. Joblin has to tend to the furnace; the boys who do this in the daytime are on the bus and so he is compelled to be night-fire-man. You have placed a stoker in the building, but, for some unaccountable reason, it has never been put into service. If it were installed, Mr. Joblin would be relieved of this needless addition to his work.\n\n(c) In my reports I commend Mr. Joblin for the splendid work he is doing among the pupils below Grade 7. He has re-established one in Grade 7 and has four others well on the way. His training this summer is bearing good fruit.\n\n(d) This work ties him to the school and prevents any service to the day schools. Mr. Johnston will be available for full time duty from now until the Skyways Theatre reopens next Spring. If he were engaged to work under Mr. Joblin's direction for three months following Christmas,\nJoblin could:\n\n(1) Complete compilation of cumulative records of pupils on the reserves and at this school;\n\n(2) Supervise the educational programme of the day schools;\n\n(3) Conduct tests in the schools. May I recommend that this be done?\n\n(e) Mrs. Docker is putting new life into the work of Grades 7 and 8 and you will be pleased with the performance of pupils from these grades.\n\n(f) Miss Hartledge is scholarly and well trained. No doubt she is a splendid teacher. With a group of students academically inclined she would be unusually good. For pupils not so interested but more inclined to physical and practical affairs, she is not so helpful. The slower pupils have just quit school. The brighter pupils make good progress. She hardly fits into the programme of a school which must emphasize vocational as well as academic aspects of the curriculum.\n\n(g) Mr. Johnston is almost the exact opposite. He is weak in academic work, but, does well in the Shop and on the Play Ground.\n\n(h) You personally assure our heartiest commendations for your interest in the school. You have spared no effort in giving the teachers good references, good equipment and giving the pupils most satisfactory supplies.\n\n(i) The old bus is still running. We hope that the new one soon relieves it.\n\nII THE DAY SCHOOLS\n\n(a) Mrs. Bateman continues her excellent service. Miss Annett shows promise and is doing a fairly good job. Mr. Reid, as I have reported, surprised me at first. He did better than I expected. He disappoints me now by showing no further improvement.\n\n(b) Mrs. Bateman reports that she needs:\n\n(1) More workbooks for Grade 3 Readers.\n(2) A Health Book for Grades 5 and 6.\n\nIt appears that she received the Health Book for Grades 1 to 4 and 7 and 8.\n\n(c) At Bear Creek School the enrolment has increased beyond the seating accommodations, so limited seats and desks are in use. These are not suitable.\n\nSuch an increase, also, means a shortage of books, and, pupils' supplies.\n\nThese matters should have immediate attention, and, Miss Annett was advised to repeat her requests to Mr. Down until she received them.\n\nThe fences at this school should be repaired.\nMy visit to River Settlement followed several days after Halloween. It appears that the evil spirits went on a rampage that night. The damage had not been repaired. The register of the school was gone. No doubt Mr. Down and Mr. Reid are proceeding to remedy this situation. In fact I thought that they had had time to have that completed before I arrived.\n\nA copy of this letter will be included with the reports on each teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGordon Young\n\nY/H\nDecember 16, 1947.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nMay I offer somewhat belated congratulations on your new position. It should prove of great value to our work in education to have you giving your full time to it.\n\nFor the present, I shall limit my letter to one matter. Would it be possible for us to engage Mr. Johnston for full time after Christmas, for three months, or even for two months? My thought is that he could take my room in the mornings and set me free to visit the other schools, and to do some testing and setting up of records for all our pupils. In consultation with Miss Delaporte last summer, we agreed on some tests which, over a period of time, would provide a good deal of information concerning the pupils. For example, the Otis Quick Scoring test for the smaller grades. There are also some children who should be given the individual intelligence tests. I bought quite a number of tests myself with this kind of thing in mind, but have no time to use them.\n\nFurthermore, it would give me an opportunity of finding whether such an arrangement would work out satisfactorily for next year. Namely, using Mr. Johnston in the junior room for the mornings, and for shop work in the afternoons. I should like to look forward to having half of each day free for the work of the other schools and for interview work with the seniors, and for testing and keeping of records. If this is a possibility for another year, a trial for a few months might be worthwhile. At present, I am in my classroom from 8.00 until 5.30, when the last bus leaves, and take only 15 minutes for lunch. With the evenings taken for community activities, there is little time for some of these other types of work. It will be a big relief to Mrs. Docker and myself, if and when a second bus is in use, and will let the pupils get home in better time. I suppose it is not possible, but if it were, I should like to recommend a bonus of some kind for Mrs. Docker, who gives an extra hour each night after four o'clock, to the late group. No such thing is in her mind; she is not one to measure the work she does.\n\nI should like to wish you and yours the very best of the Christmas season, and a satisfying New Year.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\n\nIn reply to your letter regarding Mr. Johnston, I would say that, following Col. Randall's suggestion, we started using him full time early in the month. During the short time he was not in the classrooms, he has been putting in extra time in maintenance work and many long hours during the holidays and after in making a skating rink. I should be glad if you could adjust his salary for the full month, therefore, and have the extra amount sent through or added to his February cheque.\n\nWe are grateful for the kindness and the promptness with which Col. Randall secured a driver. It has made a great difference to both staff and pupils. The roads are still heavy just now, but school has continued without interruption and a fair attendance. Our rink has been a lot of work but is the source of a great deal of healthful exercise and recreation for both pupils and the whole community. Our school is gradually coming to its proper position as a community centre and an institution dedicated to the service of the people generally.\n\nThe office will have written you I believe, concerning a former pupil of the residential school, one Walter Raymond Minham, who has been working his way through the Basil Technical School in London, with some assistance from your department. He is in his Grade X and doing good work; having won a scholarship last year. Having no home here, and no family taking any responsibility for him, he is finding it difficult to finance his course. He has done many types of work and seems in every way a most deserving student. May I just add a word to the recommendation from the office, if there has been one, that if there is any means by which you could secure some additional help for Raymond, I feel it would well deserved. His address is 349 Maitland St., London.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nE.E.M. Joblin.\nOttawa, February 16, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have for answer your letter of February 2nd concerning Mr. Johnston. I have, therefore, requested our Treasury office to pay him at the full rate of $150.00 a teaching month from January 1 to March 31. I will leave it to you to advise me concerning Mr. Johnston's plans as from April 1, 1948.\n\nI have referred that section of your letter dealing with Victor Winham to Major Clark and I will advise you later as to what action we have taken.\n\nI was very pleased to hear that your new bus is making a great difference to the staff and to the pupils alike. I hope that progress continues and that your school retains its proper position in the community.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSept. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. E.E.M.

Letters do have a way of going astray sometimes, and I am sorry if this has happened to mine. You will find enclosed the copy from my files, of my reply.\n\nCol. Randall has assisted us in securing the parts needed for the stoker, for which we have waited so long. Mr. Johnston expects to be able to attach it in the near future.\n\nBy Easter I hope to have some very interesting test results for you. With careful interpretation, they should provide some help in evolving the most effective curriculum and methods for our schools. I am hoping that some time in the spring, when I have my data prepared, it will be possible for us to get together for a discussion on next year's program. If there is any likelihood of your being down this way, I should appreciate it if you could let me know a short time in advance.\n\nI trust that the work is shaping up to your liking in your new position. It is surely a man-sized job but one which you seem quite capable of handling.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nE.E.M.

Neary,\n\nThank you for your letter of direction concerning beginners after Easter. It will simplify the matter considerably.\n\nIs there any chance of your being in Toronto during Easter week for the O.E.A.? There are several matters which I should like very much to discuss with you if I could meet you there. The type of course to be offered in our secondary school is of first importance. I should like also to lay before you the arguments for including River Settlement pupils in our central school next year. Also the matter of personnel in a few instances. If I can look forward to seeing you then, I could leave these matters until then. Otherwise I should have to prepare a careful written statement for your consideration.\n\nWe must prepare our new requisitions immediately. There were two or three items on last year's lists which have not been authorized, at least for local purchase. We wondered whether you could let us know whether they were on order or whether we should put them on our new requisition. In Mr. Johnston's list, the most important were, a Drill Press with motor, and a set of taps and dies. You may remember that Mr. Down had the drill press, and was willing for us to have it back, but held it until he could secure another in its place. Since we had not yet been able to obtain it, and have been without for two terms, we included it on the list. We should have a drill press for next term, how it is provided concerns us little, except as to whether we should again include it in our requisition. Mr. Down is still away of course, and is unable to deal with the matter. Other items, such as stencils and ink, can be put in the new requisition, and are no problem.\n\nMr. Johnston's cheque for January and February has come through. I cannot say for certain whether we could obtain his services for the last quarter or not. He would be available for April at least, and if he could be continued full time for another month, it would certainly be a great help to me. I am completing my testing, but have undertaken to secure a full record of each pupil's school attendance, which is proving to be a big task.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 24, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have delayed answering yours of March 15 until I was certain of being able to attend the O.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSCHOOL NEWS\n\nA WEEKLY NEWS SHEET FOR THE CHIPPEWA, MUNGEY AND ONEIDA RESERVES.\n\nMay 29\n\nFor many of the pupils, the important events of this week have been several ball games. The weather at last permitted us to get started. On Tuesday Oneida #1 came to Oneida #3 and defeated them by 14-7 in a good game of ball. On Wednesday River Settlement came to Mt. Elgin and defeated the junior room by about 15-4. On Thursday Rock Settlement played a return game against River Settlement, but were unable to make much headway against the cup-holders; however, the pupils take their defeats in a fine spirit, and will some day make good ball players. The girls' team from Delaware Continuation School came back for a return game here on Thursday at 3:45 and were once more defeated by a good margin. Both teams worked hard and turned in some good ball along with some errors. We hope to get back to Delaware on Tuesday next.\n\nWeather permitting, Oneida #1 plays at Oneida #3 at noon on Tuesday.\n\nMany of our pupils took part in the Field Day held at the Oneida New Hall last Monday. Such events are fine opportunities for our people to get together for a good time. The Society sponsoring the day were most generous in their treatment of their guests, serving free ice cream, oranges and lunches. Ball games between the schools proved interesting, while the young people organized several games of their own. Our students here are planning a Field Day for the end of the term, the date will be made known as soon as possible.\n\nOur schools are to be honoured by a visit on Monday from two representatives from the Royal Commission on Education for the Province of Ontario. They will be accompanied by our two inspectors, Mr. Young and Mr. Smith. Their visit may prove of real importance in the years to come, and we are anxious that they receive a good impression of us. All we ask is that our pupils try to be at school and not stay away because of their visits. The time of year has come when the older pupils find it difficult to remain in school, tempted as they are by the appeal of the out-of-doors and by the attraction of big wages. Yet how wasteful it is to invest eight or nine months in attending school only to drop out without completing the year! Something like letting an insurance policy lapse after paying several years' premiums. The responsibility of self-discipline is proving to be pretty difficult for a few, but if they will persevere, they will have won a moral victory which will build character and be of great value for the rest of their lives. There is very little compulsion being used, but the experience of years has convinced adults that children need to attend school until at least 16 years of age. Of course, many people think parents and other adults don't know what they are talking about, but they do, at least some of the time. Young people sometimes think it shows their independence to disregard the judgements of their elders, when in reality it usually reveals a lack of judgment in themselves. Go to school while you may, the day will come when you will wish you had done so, and you will be trying to tell your children to do what you had not the will-power to do when you were young.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJune 5, 1948.\n\nATTENTION COL. NEARY\n\nSome few weeks ago you advised that a Committee of a Royal Commission would visit the Indian Schools in the London and Brantford areas. I was looking forward to this visit and had arranged a trip of the most interesting points in connection with our schools, particularly the new school which is rapidly approaching completion. It appears, however, that the Committee arrived in the County of Middlesex and the Indian Reserves on May 31st but the first intimation I had of its visit was a notation in the Monthly School Report.\n\nPersonally I am not particularly concerned but I did want them to see everything we are doing or attempting to do for our Indian people, particularly the new school which, I understand, was not even viewed from the outside. I also feel that the Superintendent's Office should have received some measure of courtesy. I had hoped to submit a report on this interesting visit but procedures sometimes shatter our good intentions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. T. Down,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJune 9, 1948.\n\nPersonal\n\nDear Mr. N\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA few nights ago Mrs. Hartledge came to my home particularly disturbed over an exhibition put on in front of the school before the students of Mt. Elgin.\n\nThe enclosed confidential letter is self-explanatory and as this is not the first time, as Mrs. Hartledge advises, that Mr. Johnson has left himself open to the criticism of the students she thought I should take some action. However since, as you are aware, I am on my way out I do not wish to become involved and I told her I would pass the matter on to you. She was very much upset and complained bitterly of the lack of discipline and teacher knowledge and suggested that she and Mrs. Docker were, with their teacher knowledge and experience, being used by others to further their advantage.\n\nWithout committing myself I suggested that she make application for transfer. This apparently did not meet with her approval and she said, \"Where?\" I said I did not know but perhaps West, perhaps Edmonton if she would like it. At this she became emotionally disturbed and said, \"Never, it was through the University at Edmonton that my transfer East was made possible and there are many other difficulties involved.\" She has great faith in you and seems to think that you will see her through her difficulties and that she will continue to teach at Caradoc. Personally, as I have said before, I do not wish to become involved but\nwhatever happens to Mrs. Hartledge some statements must be made: She is an excellent teacher. She is liked by her students. She is punctual, conscientious and above all loyal to the Indian Affairs Branch; and the essence of loyalty to the Government of Canada. Perhaps these are the qualifications that lead us to refer to some people as \"queer\".\n\nIn any case this is not an official letter and I would ask you to treat it as such. It is written for your information that you might be careful of the transfer. I think she has unhappy family memories of Edmonton.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nGeo. W. Down.\n\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nGWD/BC\n\nEncl\nJune 14, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Down:\n\nI have for answer your personal letter of June 9 and appreciate the information contained therein. I have already written to Mrs. Hartledge concerning a transfer to the Edmonton Hospital School. She had written to me with regard to summer employment previously. As you know, these hospital schools are conducted for the 12 month year and therefore the teachers are employed on a 12 month basis (less the usual 18 days Civil Service holidays).\n\nThis is not the first time that we have received reports concerning Mr. Johnston and I am going to arrange to see Mr. Joblin during the summer holidays and to discuss this matter frankly with him.\n\nI appreciate your comments in regard to the unhappy family memories at Edmonton on the part of Mrs. Hartledge, and as this matter of a transfer has been left entirely up to her, I feel you will probably be consulted concerning her decision. You can rest assured that your letter will not be treated as an official communication.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMr. G. W. Down,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nBFN/PM\nMt. Elgin Indian Day School,\nWinooski, Ontario.\nMay 25, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary, B.A.,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nInspector Young has been here on his visit and we have discussed our needs for next year, particularly as to staff. No doubt you will hear from him directly, but I wanted to remind you of them and to send along the enclosed application.\n\nI earnestly hope you have been able to provide for a change in our High School teacher, and that you will be able soon to let me know of it so that I may take some steps to secure another. Mrs. Smith, unable to wait longer, has accepted another position. I know of a teacher still available, but can do nothing until Mrs. Hartledge has been provided for, or at least knows about the change. If it proves to be impossible to secure a H.S. teacher, Mr. Young agrees that we should have Mrs. Docker take this work, and find a really good teacher for Grades VII and VIII. Indeed, we went so far as propose to Mrs. Bateman, at Back Settlement that she take this room, and not attempt to get a H.S. Teacher. She prefers to remain where she is, largely because of her family and transportation.\n\nAs to River Settlement, which I proposed to bring to our new school, I trust there is no reason to prevent this. You made mention of the possibility of sending us a teacher from the Brantford Reserve. I approve the principle of hiring an Indian youth, and am sending an application from the only one from our reserve to have qualified for this work. Mrs. Schuyler is the daughter of one of our finest families, and her teaching has not been seriously criticised. While at Kettle Point she may have given some cause for concern in the manner of private life, but I feel that she should be given a chance here, in the school under my immediate direction. If we are to encourage any students to continue their training, it seems to me we must be willing to use those who have done so. To give Mrs. Schuyler the opportunity here would give proof of our intentions for others. I would therefore request that you give serious consideration to appointing her to teach my Division III (pupils from River Settlement plus retarded pupils; the latter to receive extra help from me). If possible, I should like to provide for her use of the teachers' residence on the Oneida reserve, which has been vacant for some years. She has four children, and could be of much-needed help to her parents, by having her mother care for them during the day. Her husband is a day labourer and is home only on week-ends. An early confirmation of this plan for River Settlement and the appointment of Mrs. Schuyler would be greatly appreciated.\nWe hope that somehow we can give Myrtle Minham her Grade XII next year, which will be possible only in view of the small number of pupils in the High School grades. If there is any opportunity, it would be desirable for the three of us, yourself, Mr. Young and myself, to discuss at some length the courses to be offered in future years, how far we can attempt to carry them in academic courses, and what practical courses to provide. There will not be many for some years who will want an academic course, and as you suggested, these might be sent to town. For next year, however, we are hoping to provide for Myrtle, possibly two in XI, four or five in X, and four or five in IX. These will again be 35 or more in 7 and 8. If River Settlement is brought in there will be about 30-35 in Division III. I could easily use better than half my time as a helper-teacher for these various groups, and the remainder in the other schools. I am hoping that this program will be possible this coming year.\n\nWe are to have a visit from two members of the Royal Commission on Education in Ontario, next Monday, accompanied by our two inspectors. One of them is the secretary, Dr. Jackson, with whom I did my work in Toronto.\n\nIt has been a good year in many ways, though our attendance has been badly hit by sickness, with mumps, measles and whooping cough taking their toll. For another year too, there needs to be a clearer understanding about what can be done about absenteeism. Several have been allowed to absent themselves with the result that others have come to think that we can do nothing about it.\n\nThis has already been a lengthy letter for a busy man to read, and I must leave other matters for another time. I remain,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nE.E.M. Joblin,\nsupervising-principal.\nHuncey, Ontario,\nJune 14, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary, B.A.,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nSince writing you recently, a somewhat disturbing fact has come to light. It seems that Mr. Johnston has not received cheques for April or May. This is disturbing if it is due to any misunderstanding between us. His full time work from January to March was to be extra, not to take the place of these three months; that is to say, he has continued on half-time as before, doing the shop work and mathematics in X and XI. If the matter has been merely some oversight in the Treasury Dept., I am sure you can straighten it out. If you understood that he would work full time for three months in place of half time these three months, it will be rather awkward. I hope you will be able to trace the matter and perhaps have the three cheques forthcoming by the end of the month.\n\nWith reference to the application of Mrs. Schuyler, I believe I neglected to say that Inspector Young was in full agreement with the proposition. She is a good teacher and I hope you will find it possible to give her a reply concerning her appointment soon, lest she accept another position. Teachers are very scarce around here, and are being offered large salaries. Mr. Reid is not planning to remain, and is putting in applications for other schools. I passed on to him your offer of placing him in one of your outlying schools, but at present he has delusions of grandeur, and fancies himself a principal somewhere.\n\nMrs. Hartledge tells me she was speaking to you recently. Apparently you were able to satisfy her somehow. I keep persuading myself that the matter is merely being deferred in order to allow her to finish the term without disturbance. It is with great difficulty that I have kept the seniors here until the end of the term. Moreover, our Entrance class has dwindled from 13 to 5. Several have just left, but three have decided to repeat their year, being fairly certain of failure.\n\nI am having some difficulty persuading the Department of Education to admit me to their summer Normal School session. It seems that only those intending to teach in provincial schools are really eligible. However, I may yet succeed. If this fails, I shall probably take the second year of the Auxiliary Classes course.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nE.W.M. Joblin, Supervising-Principal.\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have for answer your recent letters concerning the situation at River Settlement and at Mount Elgin. I have been out of town inspecting schools during the last month and I am afraid that my personal correspondence has rather lagged.\n\nYour recommendation with regard to River Settlement has been concurred in by Mr. Matters and I have just written to him about transferring the children to Mount Elgin. I have also written to him with regard to Mrs. Schuyler. Her behavior at Kettle Point was a matter of some concern and I hope that there has been no recent criticism of her at Caradoc. I have also mentioned the matter of the residence on the Oneida Reserve.\n\nI am still corresponding with Mrs. Hartledge concerning her transfer. I do not as yet know the outcome of my proposals as I understand from the Indian Health Services that the apartment at Muncey will no longer be available for a teacher.\n\nI hope that you have succeeded with your representations to the Department of Education and that you are able this summer to work on your Summer School Course. We have sent you a large number of Canadian Legion library books for use at your school. I know that some of these will not be suitable but I will leave the matter in your capable hands and let you decide which you think will be acceptable.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard T. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. E.E.M. Joblin,\nSupervising Principal,\nMt. Elgin Day School,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\nJuly 8, 1948.\n\nMr. F. Matters,\nOffice of Indian Superintendent,\nMunsey, Ontario.\n\nThe Department is prepared to accept your recommendation with regard to the closing of the River Settlement Indian Day School and the transfer of the pupils to the new Mount Elgin School.\n\nOur records show that there were some 21 children in attendance at this school during the months of April and May. It is presumed that you will have some good use to which you can recommend that we put the River Settlement school building. We have found in the past that an abandoned school soon becomes a matter for vandalism. We would prefer that an old couple live in it, if possible, and act as caretakers. However, your knowledge of local conditions will enable you to make a recommendation regarding this matter.\n\nWe have received from Mr. Joblin, Supervising Principal, an application for employment at the Mount Elgin School as completed by Mrs. Virginia Schuyler (nee Jamieson). I return herewith Mrs. Schuyler's first class teaching certificate and Strathcona Trust physical training certificate with School Inspector's references.\n\nMrs. Schuyler formerly taught at the Little Point Indian School and while her teaching was quite satisfactory, her personal conduct was subject to some criticism. Before\nproceeding with her appointment, I would suggest that you make some enquiries regarding her recent behavior.\n\nMr. Jobin also recommended that Mrs. Schuyler be given the use of the teacher's residence on the Osnida Reserve, vacant for some years. You will be able to make a recommendation concerning this matter also.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n7-9 14 Bloor Street West, Toronto,\nJuly 24, 1948.\n\nCol. B.O. Neary,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nI was pleased to hear from you and to learn of your approval of the plan for River Settlement school and its acceptance, and interpreted it, if Mrs. Shingle as teacher for them.\n\nThe most pressing matter now is the transfer of Mrs. Shingle, and the securing of a replacement. You are of course aware that few teachers are free to resign their positions at this late date, so that there are few to choose from. However, there is a young man here taking the course (completing it), who could round out our staff splendidly if you were able to give us some definite reply by return mail.\n\nMr. Morris Carson, a graduate of O.A.C. at Guelph, and with 35 years teaching experience, was completing his work for his certificate, so I should think, in his early thirties. He is a leader among the students, with a fine personality, and several years' experience in World War II. Having been Docker (now in training) could divide the work of the grades from top up, and he could be invaluable in setting up our programme in agriculture. He could occupy the room in our present building, lately used by Mr. Reid. It is our good fortune that he has not accepted a position as yet, but will have to do so in the near future. He has consented to wait for another\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6205, file 468-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI feel sure that Mr. Matson has by now added his judgment to the case for Mrs. Hurlbut's removal and I am hoping that something has been done to this. With the shortage of teachers, even the present teachers have not been well assigned yet. I would feel quite elated if you could make it possible for me to engage Mrs. Connon very soon. If you can do this, could you send an application form with your reply?\n\nWith respect to Miss Morris (Anida*1) of whom I spoke at Easter time, Mr. Matson was going to make some mention of her position. I was to furnish some evidence of lack of success, and this in quite plain interest, and participation in common causes. Her pupils were regularly compared for grades VII and she has lost the confidence of both parents and pupils. The pupils just aren't developing or learning the work of the middle grades. Personally, I could not recommend her any longer, for anything but a primary room, and that with some urgency.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the results given to all candidates for Grade 7. Her pupils are Nos. 4, 5, 6, No. 5 had been on Grade 7 with her. She has pushed them on regardless of ability. Other pupils whom we have had from her have been very weak as well. They have been forced to take this means of checking up on the standards of various schools. On the whole they are doing good work. Some of my own pupils showed up poorly, but had been trying to do more than one grade, and were not able to make it. They covered a lot of ground for pupils with low I.Q.'s. I have had a stream of complaints from the parents concerning Miss Morris, all in essential agreement, and they would be greatly encouraged if a change could be brought about. I am enclosing, as you suggested, a list of possible substitutes.\n\nI think I should leave other matters until I can have the use of the typewriter.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However in general observation from the remarks passed by people who have known her for some time the reports are all adverse, and I would not feel justified in recommending her employment unless Mr. Joblin has some very sound reason for suggesting it. As he is away at Summer School I have not had the opportunity of discussing the matter with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. Matters,\nRegional Supervisor.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nJuly 30, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nCaradoc Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 24th.\n\nMr. Matters returned from Caradoc yesterday and visited me here. He shares our concern over the appointment of Mrs. Schuyler. He regrets not having had an opportunity of discussing her appointment with you. He does not feel justified in recommending her employment unless you have some very sound reason for doing so.\n\nWe have been doing everything possible to arrange a suitable transfer for Mrs. Hartledge but have not been able to do so. You are aware, of course, that the Indian Health Services will be using her apartment for other purposes during the next academic year. When this fact was brought to her attention, she made arrangements to secure accommodation in Delaware (at no cost of course to the Department). It is her intention to travel back and forth every day.\n\nWe feel that her residence off the reserve will do much to alleviate the tension which exists between other members of the staff and Mrs. Hartledge.\n\nI still have a slim hope that she might accept the position which I have offered her in the Brandon Hospital School. However, now that she has secured accommodation in Delaware, I feel that she intends to return to Mount Elgin. Her qualifications and experience with inspectors reports are such that we are in a difficult position with regard to forcing to change her status.\n\nI was delighted to hear the details of Mr. Conron. Attached is an application form for completion by him. Does he hold an Agricultural Specialists Certificate? If so he could be classified as a Grade 4 teacher and of course, would\nreceive a considerably higher salary. If he were appointed this would leave your staff as it was last year with the addition of Mr. Conron in place of Mrs. Schuyler.\n\nI realize that this is not the way in which you had planned it, but at present I can see no alternative.\n\nI will write you later concerning Miss Morris, but in the meantime, I wish to advise you concerning Mrs. Schuyler, Mrs. Hartledge and our hopes for hiring Mr. Conron.\n\nWould you please put your telephone number to the address of your reply so that I can call you by long distance if necessary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary, D.A.,\nDirector of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nMr. Conron finally decided in favour of a commercial job of some kind, and left me no time to recruit at the school. I was very sorry to lose him. Since coming home I have been trying to find a teacher for the junior room, and have enclosed an application from Mrs. Ireland, who lives in Delaware and could come in with some of the other teachers. She is not interested in teaching very long, which is just as well for us, but because of circumstances at home is grateful for a chance to teach this year. Her husband had a serious accident on the hydro line and has to remain at home, so that she is free to get away. She has two children of her own and seems capable. While she may not be what we would want as a permanent member of the staff, I feel she would see us through the year, and relieve us of the need for any living quarters for her. I suggested that she would probably qualify for $1740, that is, the sixth year of Grade II. She had two full years at Normal (her name before marriage was Marjorie Walker), and her Inspector Mr. Smith, who inspects our Oneida Schools. In view of the great scarcity of teachers, it would be a relief to know that our staff was complete, in the near future.\n\nSince we are likely to have all four years of High School, it will be necessary to use Mrs. Docker in some of that work, and indeed I should like to have Mrs. Hartledge divide the work with her. For example, Mrs. Hartledge to take Social Studies in both rooms, in exchange for Science and Agriculture. Mrs. Docker will need to help with mathematics perhaps, and Home Economics. In view of these facts, I should like you to consider placing Mrs. Docker as a Grade IV Teacher. She is qualified as Principal of a Grade II Continuation School, has certificates in Agriculture and Art, and will undoubtedly take quite a large share of the responsibility. I have asked her to send her Certificates so that you may decide for yourself. She can take Grades 7 and 8 in the subjects which require Departmental examinations in Grade 8, and still take her 50% with the High School work.\n\nCould you send us three new registers? We have been using old registers found around the school, after removing the used pages.\n\nWould you be willing to consider permitting us to close our schools on one Friday per month at 3 O'clock in order to have a meeting of the teachers from 3 to 5? With so many teachers driving in, it seemed almost impossible last year to get together in the evenings.\n\nIndian Affairs. (Ref. No., Volume 6205, file 406-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOur supplies are pouring in steadily. Many thanks too for the extra supply from the Legion; some of them are on the college level, but will add to our library for later use, when we hope that adults will make use of it, perhaps when an evening is given to night school or other activities.\n\nThe summer session of the Normal School proved to be strenuous but worthwhile, and left me three weeks end a half in which to prepare for the new term. With the new dispensation at the office, the people are coming up with many constructive suggestions for community projects of which you have doubtless heard. I believe our work here has a bright future and I rejoice I can, at least for the present, be a part of it.\n\nI shall not take more of your time now; other matters can wait.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nE.E.M. Joblin,\nSupervising-Principal.\nAugust 30, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have for answer your letter of August 17 and I was very sorry to hear that you were unable to complete arrangements for the hiring of Mr. Conron.\n\nI have the application form as submitted by Mrs. Marjorie Ireland. I note that she has a second class teaching certificate with 13 years of experience. In view of this fact, she would be entitled to classification as a Grade 2 at a salary of $1,740.00 an academic year. As you have already advised her of this fact, it is presumed that she is willing to accept the position and I have accordingly forwarded the Income Tax and other forms necessary to Mr. Matters.\n\nWith regard to your recommendation concerning Mrs. Docker, please note that she would be required to hold a University degree before she would be entitled to this classification. The regulation, as on page 5 of the June issue of the Bulletin, reads that a teacher, to be classified as a Grade 4, must hold a high school teaching certificate or a specialist certificate. Does Mrs. Docker actually hold a certificate as principal of a Grade B continuation school? I would like to have you discuss this situation with Inspector Young and I would like to have a letter from him as to whether he considers her experience equivalent to a high school teacher's certificate. If so, we could consider classifying her as a Grade 4 teacher.\n\nWe will forward you the three registers, as requested. Authority is also granted to close your school on\n\nReverend P.M.H. Joblin,\nSupervising Principal,\nMt. Elgin Indian Day School,\nMunsey, Ont.\none Friday per month at 3 P.M., in order to have a meeting of the teachers.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Matters, accordingly.\n\nI was very pleased to note that your supplies are arriving steadily and hope that the Legion books will be helpful in adult education projects. I was pleased to note that you enjoyed your session at Normal School and hope that you are feeling refreshed for the opening of the school term.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard V. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nP.S. - I have just received a letter from Mrs. Docker and I note that she does hold a certificate and is qualified to act as a principal of a Grade B continuation school.

I am gratified that her qualifications are sufficient to put her in Grade IV and also that Mr. Young added his recommendation for her to take the High School work when this can be arranged.\n\nI am sorry, however, that she cannot this year be classified as a Grade IV teacher, since she will not be teaching 50% of her time in High School subjects. She is taking Mathematics and Science, but these total seven hours. Our hope that she might qualify was based on another interpretation, namely, that she could count those subjects even in Grades 7 and 8, for which she had certificates. It was a try at least, since both her work has been pretty hard and wanted her to get all that she was entitled to. However, we have now fixed her standing for the time when she can take over that work with the revised schedule; her income will be fairly good, and I think she will not resent the decision.\n\nMajor Clark will give you a report on the new building. Our enrolment here is going to be higher than I anticipated, after settlement has turned out in force and the room which Mrs. Ireland is teaching, with some help from me, will probably have about 30 pupils. Mrs. Docker's room will also have 37 or 38 if they all get back. I am hoping for 14 in the High School, 5, 2, 1 and 1. For another year, when we should have our new school equipped, we will need to clarify the courses we intend to offer, such as Vocational classes rather than the General Course, and whether we should go beyond Grade X. We are attempting far too much at present, in our desire to see Myrtle through her Middle School. I am not encouraging our Grade X to count on going further here next year. They could get on the bus for Strathroy, which comes to within a mile of Muncey.\n\nYou will probably be getting word of our Convention, which meets at Barrie on Friday, October 6th, I believe. I may see you then, when I can give you more details. There is still no cheque for July or August, though I expect it daily, since Mr. Matters wrote concerning it.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Mrs. Ireland is on the job.

I have had an opportunity of discussing the new building with Major Clark and I was pleased to note your high enrolment. In view of the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee concerning the attendance of Indian children at provincial schools, I feel that you are taking a correct attitude in encouraging your grade 10 to attend Strathroy High School next year.\n\nI was pleased to note that you are again holding your Convention but it may be impossible for me to attend this year. Mr. Phelan and I are leaving for Manitoba at the end of September, to attend the Canadian Education Association conference, and I doubt very much if we will be back by October 8.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Neary, B.A.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nAll our schools are supplied with teachers, all of whom began their work promptly on September 7th. I hope the necessary forms have gone through so that the new members of our staff, Mrs. Ireland and Mrs. Schuyler will not have to wait too long for their first cheques. Mrs. Docker's standing has been made clear, and your own statement concerning her salary for this year noted. This puts her at $204 per month, which agrees with my reading of the new schedule. However, this new rate was probably not decided upon soon enough for her September cheque to be made up that way, since her gross cheque was for $174. I know that you will arrange to have this deficiency attended to as soon as possible.\n\nWe had a very good convention at Sarnia, but were sorry you were unable to be with us. However Mr. Doucet represented the Department quite capably. We have had our school fair, at which we had a big parade of all our schools, all using the same outfits. On Friday we join in with neighbouring Continuation schools in the annual Track and Field Meet at Mt. Brydges.\n\nIt promises to be a very strenuous year for all of us here, both because of the number enrolled and the number of grades we trying to cover. We are trying to see Myrtle Ninham through her nursing course, since she could not have picked it up at another school without losing a year. I obtained permission for her to substitute Geography for Mathematics in XI and XII, so that she has a chance. She did not receive instruction in Grade XI last year in many subjects, being grouped in with Grade X. Mrs. Hartledge led her to believe that she had finished her Middle School, and had her apply for entrance to a hospital. Now one person can be so wrong about so many things is beyond me. We are losing a number of pupils again this year because of her, which is a serious blow to our new venture.\n\nThe demolition of the old school is almost completed. The new building is not yet finished, though the plasterers started today on the outside walls. We are looking forward to having our new superintendent soon so that there will be someone here to keep things moving along.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nE.E.M. Jobin, Supervising-Principal.\nOctober 29, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nI have received your letter of October 12, which arrived some time ago. Unfortunately, I have found a great many problems to be settled since my return from Western Canada. One of the most serious of course is that of school supplies, and we are doing everything possible to get the Stationery Branch to expedite delivery at once.\n\nI hope that Mrs. Ireland has received her cheque by now. We did not receive the necessary documentation with regard to Mrs. Schuyler until recently. I understand her cheques will be going out in the near future. I presume that Mrs. Docker has received an adjustment cheque by now. The change-over to the fortnightly pay system has caused delays at Central Pay Office.\n\nI was very pleased to note the success of your Convention at Sarnia and hope that you will be able to hold it in your new school next year.\n\nI am pleased to note that a new Superintendent has been appointed at Caradoc and know that you will give him every support in all matters pertaining to education on the reserve. I have several other matters which I would like to discuss with you but doubt if I can get down to Munsey until after Christmas. We have a large building program still on hand and there are numerous problems arising every day in this connection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Sipherd, whose address is 111 Elworthy Avenue, London, Ontario.\n\nI thought it would be useful to have the address of the Marionette Association, and it is just possible Mr. Joblin may be sufficiently interested to have some of his people make a small beginning in the construction of puppets.\n\nKathleen Macdonald\nIn Charge,\nHandicraft Section.\nOttawa November 13, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Joblin:\n\nA short time ago I was invited to attend a workshop discussion and demonstration of puppetry at the National Museum. Members of the May Court Club of London were brought to Ottawa by the Museum to give the demonstration in question. I was amazed by what can be accomplished with ordinary materials, and impressed by the fact that marionettes and puppets are being so successfully used in schools and sanatoria.\n\nIt was brought out that working with puppets and marionettes not only gives children self-confidence, but encourages them to use their hands constructively, improves their use of the English language, and teaches them to put their ideas together in an interesting fashion when working out little plays.\n\nMrs. L.W. Sipherd, whose address is 111 Elworthy Avenue, London (telephone Metcalf 9993M) seems to be the moving spirit in the May Court Club Marionette Group. Two other members of the group who are particularly interested are Mrs. Wilson, and Mrs. Sim. Mrs. Sim, I believe, is instructing out at the Sanatorium.\n\nI mentioned the possibilities of this work to Colonel Neary, and he was already much interested and is pleased to have me write you in this connection.\n\nThe May Court Club group are putting on three \"Little Theatre\" performances of marionette shows for children\u2014one before Christmas, one on February 14,\n\nRev. Mr. Joblin,\nMuncey,\nOntario.\nDear Mrs. Sipherd:\n\nI want to thank you for the pleasure you gave many of us when you and the group with you gave such an interesting demonstration and talk on the art of puppetry in Ottawa recently.\n\nI have written Rev. Mr. Joblin at Muncey---the Indian Agency about twenty miles from London---and have suggested that he should get in touch with you. In view of the fact that my letter to him would be rather \"out of the blue\" on the subject of marionettes, he may not at this time go further than to endeavour to see the Christmas performance of the marionettes. However, I have been talking with Colonel B.F. Neary, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, and find him to be already interested in the question of using marionettes as part of a recreational programme in Indian schools.\n\nIt appears to be likely that a Supervisor of physical and recreational activities will be appointed in the near future, and it would help us if you can let me have the address of the Marionette Association which you mentioned. Unfortunately I did not make a note of this address, and I feel sure it will be necessary to take a membership in the Association in order to secure necessary information regarding the construction and operation of the marionettes.\n\nWith best wishes, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKm\nIn Charge,\nHandicraft Section.\n\nMrs. L.

As I know you are always interested in anything which might help the Indians\u2014whether adults or children\u2014I thought I would tell you about this marionette project, in the hope that you may wish to get in touch with Mrs. Sipherd.\n\nI must admit that I went to the Museum discussion group without expecting to become greatly interested, but ended up by being fascinated by the possibilities. For example, Mrs. Sim told us of using puppetry in connection with history classes in which the children made marionettes dressed in the costumes of the various countries, and ended the season by a \"Trip Around the World\". The children had prepared little plays, one for each country, bringing in outstanding historical points.\n\nThere is a Marionette Association, and I believe the membership is $1.00. This Association provides information as to materials, methods of construction, etc.\n\nWith best wishes to you and Mrs. Joblin,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn Charge,\nHandicraft section.\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\nSEE CURRENT VOLUME\n\nVol 2.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gen. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nAfter unavoidable delay our fourth plan for the remodeling of the Old building and the erection of a Recreation Hall for the girls is completed and we think it just the thing to make this whole establishment an Ideal Institution.\n\nWe propose to do this work in the most economical way possible. First by doing all the work that we can with our Institution force. Second by using all the old material possible. The part of the old building we take down will supply brick, stone and other material for the new hall.\n\nWhat we want from the Department is first permission to go on with this work. Second money to pay for new material and such work as we cannot do, as bricklaying, plastering, plumbing and cost of Architect for plans and an occasional visit during construction.\n\nOne of the heaviest items of expense will be the engine, boiler...\ndining to be located in basement of old building and from that as a centre to heat old building also Recreation Hall and Laundry and to generate electricity for lighting new building which is already wired.\n\nYou will see by the plans forwarded to you today that the basement of old building will furnish storage for fruit and roots with a room for engine, boiler &c. That the first flat will give splendid hospital accommodation for boys on one side and girls on the other with an entrance to each and one to office in the centre. This flat also furnishes a home for a cook with a family in the South end and in the North end a home equally good for a man to act as engineer, fireman and watchman.\n\nWhile the second flat will provide for a Kindergarten school room in one end and Music Hall in the other.\n\nThe Recreation Hall for the girls as per plan looks like a residence purposely. It will be located about 60 ft. from south end of New building with a covered walk. A granite-topped floor in first floor flat with closets and dry earth division, a small stove for extreme weather. There will be an approach from the rear for daily renewal of dry earth &c.\n\nThe second flat to be a gymnasium.\n\nThe probable cost for new material including work we cannot see engine, boiler &c. will be according to our estimates slightly in excess of $4,500.\nIf a grant for this work could be secured in the Supplementary Estimates we would like to go on with the improvements forthwith. Should there be any difficulty in getting the full amount of grant wanted this year and it should be thought best to divide the matter by a grant of $2500 this year and the balance next. In that case we could go on with the improvements in part.\n\nYour chief Inspector Wardsworth, after a careful examination of all parts of this structure with regard to beauty of outward appearance, complete adaptation in all its parts for the work to be accomplished, stated that it is in advance of any building in the Dominion for the Indian work. He also added that the lowness of the cost was the most agreeable surprise of all. He was good enough to say that he did not think that the Department could do better than to allow us to make any distribution of the old building; that we in our judgment thought best in the interest of the work.\n\nIf you will give us your full weight of influence in securing this grant so as to make this an Ideal Institution at the lowest point of cost we will greatly appreciate your continued kindness.\n\nWe are still hoping for a visit from you. I am\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. We are heating our building for just about $1.25 per day.

W.W. Shepherd,\nthe Principal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute,\nhas requested the Department to obtain an appropriation\nof at least $4500 to meet the cost of new material,\nheating apparatus and labor which cannot be done by the\nstaff at the institution, in connection with an addition\nwhich will complete and perfect the buildings of the\ninstitute.\n\nThis school is conducted under the auspices\nof the Methodist Church. It receives an annual grant of\n$60 for 100 pupils, and is one of the oldest and most\nefficient schools in the Province of Ontario. The\nlarge main building was completed last fall. It cost\nover $22,000 and is a substantial structure, fitted with\nall modern improvements and considered one of the best\nbuildings for the purpose in the country. Towards the\ncost of this building the Indian Bands interested con-\ntributed $18,000, and the House at its last Session\ngranted $2500 to provide for heating apparatus and slate\nroof.\n\nThe\nThe undersigned does not think it would be proper to levy upon the capital of the Indian Bands any further contribution towards this school, at present. It is no doubt necessary and in the interest of the institution to tear down the old buildings and erect more modern structures, which will provide a recreation hall and hospital and additional school room.\n\nThe Principal has submitted plans for these additions, which appear to have been carefully drawn, and which will undoubtedly do, with certain slight changes. The undersigned begs to submit the application of Mr. Shepherd for the Superintendent General's consideration, in order that if he so desires an amount to be inserted in the estimates to cover the necessary outlay.\n\nDeputy Subt.

(PG 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nWithin the past two years the Principal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute has submitted to the Department certain proposals for remodelling and utilizing the chief part of the old building for Institute purposes, and also for the erection of a recreation hall for the girls, which is very much needed; a similar building for the boys was erected several years ago. I have just received from the Principal an outline plan of the proposed reconstruction, also sketch of foundation and principal floor of recreation hall. I assume that these plans have been previously before the Department as the Departmental stamp is upon them, but assume that some modifications have since been introduced, and I again forward them for the Department's inspection. As I understand it the proposition of the Principal is that the Department provide for the necessary material, and such part of the work as cannot be done by the force at the Institute, such as plastering and plumbing, and that the rest of the work will be done by the Institute free of charge. I sincerely hope that the proposal will be favorably entertained by the Superintendent General, and that provision will be made at the ensuing session for a grant toward the accomplishment of the work. If the general proposal is sanctioned by the Department, I think it might be practicable to spread the cost over two or possibly three years.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nOn the 3rd inst., I wrote the Department respecting the re-modelling of the old building at Mulvey, and certain other matters, but neglected to enclose an estimate of material required and approximate cost, which has been supplied by the Principal, Rev W.W. Shepherd. In sending this estimate Mr Shepherd writes as follows:\n\n\"We find it difficult to give estimates as we hope to use all the old material available, and to do all the work that our Institution force can do free of charge, simply asking the Department for an amount to pay for the necessary new material, and such work as we cannot do with our Institution staff. I have with the help of the foreman prepared a memorandum, I enclose herewith, of the different parts of the work, which if placed before an Architect will show that our estimate is about 50% of what the work would cost otherwise.\"\n\nIt will be seen from the enclosed estimate that Mr Shepherd also contemplates repairs to one of the barns. Referring to this he writes as follows:\n\n\"It is also imperative as regards economy to repair and improve our oldest barn, the foundation of which is largely decayed. Our proposition is to put a concrete foundation and a brick wall 9 feet high under it, thus providing for a long felt want in better cow-stabling accommodation. It might be thought that we should give further details of this work, but...\"\nyou will see how exceedingly hard it is to do so owing to\nusing of old material and the employment of our own staff.\"\n\nCommending the matter to the favorable consideration of\nthe Superintendent General,\n\nI am,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nThe Honorable the\nSuperintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMO\n\nThe Secretary\n\nCivil engineers have not been furnished with the plans and bills of quantities &c., the proposed work & building at the Mount Elgin Institute are therefore impossible to make an approximate estimate of cost.\n\nThe following is a very rough estimate:\n\nComplete - not yet done $520.00\nPit & cement ball 1600.00\nPav. 1000.00\nEng. (not) done yet $3200.00\n\nTotal $10,000.00\n\nThe Principal of the school Mr. Thompson, states he has other work to be done but has asked that some of the Institute should be put in order promptly and asked that the Board supply the necessary money for the new material required, perhaps under the which he estimated would come to a little more than $1000. He also thinks he can manage with $1000.\n\nIf a better estimate is required, Mr. Thompson might be requested to furnish it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Sutherland, regarding the application for a grant for constructing the building of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute. The application was originally made on the 27th June last by the Principal of the school, the Rev. W. W. Shepherd, and at that time the cost of the proposed course was estimated at $4,500.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the matter was referred to the Superintendent General:\n\n\"The Rev.

This included substantial building on brick foundation for the building, also a concrete floor in the foundation to accommodate the bed rooms. These stables are now fitted with many modern appliances which add much to the convenience and comfort of all concerned.\n\nIn the general improvements it became necessary to include the building and living and these two buildings are now on foundations as substantial as what is under the house, and are used for a variety of purposes. The ground is covered with the roofs, and so fitted all the windows.\n\nBy a skilful arrangement of pipes and pipes and water system for the\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nThe work of remodelling the old buildings here has been carried forward as far as the season and the money will admit.\n\nThe grant was $1,500, used to be spent on material and such work as the Institution staff could not do. The work so far as carried forward is well worth $1,500, but to do that we have exceeded the grant by $1,200. That is, we have unpaid invoices for material amounting to that figure.\n\nOur apology for exceeding the grant was the urgency of the case, \"necessity known no law.\"\n\nTo save two of our old houses the logical way also other it was absolutely necessary to clear the rock foundations well; i.e., to fit them for cattle stable with cement floors, etc., which cost for material, but in a colonial job will stand test for a generation.\n\nThe old Institution has been remodelled out with its splendid slate roof, a much sharper roof than the old one was, and its walls painted and \"locked off,\" the appearance is that of a new and beautiful building. Its hospital wards, school-rooms and home of the cook and family and the watchman and his family are all adapted for the purpose.\n\nIndian Affairs. (PG IC, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWork yet to be done on this building, heating, plumbing and furniture for one school room and for the hospital. At a close calculation this will cost $1,500.\n\nWe have one other barn 110 by 40 ft., built over twenty years on a wood foundation, which must be put on the same kind of foundation as the other barns to save it and bring it into harmony with the other buildings in the block. It is one side of the block. At a close estimate it will cost $400. for the material.\n\nAgain we are very anxious to complete the attic of the new building which was erected in '95. The contract did not include the attic and it is a great disadvantage to have it unfinished as our water tanks are there and the pipes leading to different parts of the building. We have had much anxiety every winter in the extreme weather conditions to keep the chimney of this attic will give us a closet room for the girls in one end and a dormitory in the other for twenty more boys. It will take 1,100 yds. of plastering and all the joist, studding, base boards, window and door cases and at a close estimate will cost for material and work we cannot do at least $600.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to grant us the sum of $3,000 we can see our way to help make the most complete Institution of its kind in the North American area. It to the Department and the chapel.\n\nThe proposed improvements will place the old institution in harmony with the new and will cost approximately $2,000.\n\nThe completion of this work will also accommodate to the growing needs of the school.\n\nIndian Affairs.

W.W. Shepherd, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Industrial Institute with reference to the work accomplished under the authority of the Indian Department in the renovation and improving of certain of the buildings, and the need of some additional aid in bringing the whole undertaking to a satisfactory conclusion. In commending Mr. Shepherd's letter and request to the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General, it is not necessary that I should do more than recall the valuable work which has been done at Mount Elgin, and the very economical manner in which the various contracts for the erection and repairs of buildings have been carried through, and the large saving to the Department by the work done by the Staff of the Institute. With the completion of the repairs, as now contemplated by Mr. Shepherd, we may safely say the result will be a model Institute so far as efficiency and economy are concerned, and will enable the Principal to carry on in the same efficient way the valuable work he has been doing for many years.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 10th January, 1900.\n\nMem: Mr. Scott,\n\nWould you kindly look into the matter of the contribution towards certain building operations in connection with Mount Elgin Institute. The Minister cannot make provision in the estimates for the amount asked, but would be prepared to consider the question of making a reasonable contribution from the Indian funds if the same could be done advisedly. Would you please say what would be a fair amount to contribute, whether you think the contribution could be made from Band funds; and have prepared and attached to your memorandum a statement showing the apportionment among the different Bands interested of the amount. It would be well to have the statement show in a parallel column the capital at the credit of each of the Bands.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The contribution might fairly be made from the Capital Funds at the credit of Bands having children at the School. I am in favour of assisting Schools in this way, even if it can be done without straining the Band funds unduly.\n\nI attach a statement of the proportions of the grant which each Band should bear. The division can only be made upon the basis of the number of children attending the school from each Band, and the only fact which shows a hint of injustice upon the proposed action is that nearly 40% of the pupils come from Bands which cannot afford to pay any share of the grant above from the Oneidas or the Thames, which Band is almost destitute of Capital Funds. The division is unavoidable unless the Government would vote 40% ($15,240.00) of the grant. The Bands interested have already contributed $10,000.00 to this school for the late improvements, and with the present grant the amount will have reached $28,600.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAccountant.\n\n13th January, 1900.\nThe undersigned has the honour to state that the Mount Elgin Industrial Institution, situated at Ianczy, Ontario, is conducted in the interest of the Indians by the authorities of the Methodist Church, and as considerable expense has had to be incurred recently in connection with the institution, application has been made to the Department for a contribution.\n\nAs the Indians in the vicinity derive very great benefit from the institution - 100 Indian pupils being in attendance - and as they have given nothing in support of the same since 1865, the undersigned would respectfully recommend that, under Sec.70 of the Act, as substituted by Sec.6 of Chap.24, Vic.61, an Act be given for a contribution of $3000 being made above mentioned institution from the funds of the concerned, in proportion to the amount of capital credit or each hand and the number of children attending, as shown in the following statement:\n\n| Tribe                  | No. of Pupils | Capital Credit |\n|------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Chippewas of Thames    | 475,000       |                |\n| Mississauges of A'nnick| 111,400       |                |\n| Six Nations            | 880,320       |                |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since that time occurrences seem to have proved my suspicions correct, and the new well is taking steps to improve the supply. While this is done, grave dangers will threaten the Institution, although it is not yet known how to avert it.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo applying for a grant of $3500.00 to be expended in purchasing material for making certain improvements mentioned therein, all of which you state are urgently required in connection with the Mt. Elgin Institute.\n\nFirst, With regard to the item of $400 for galvanized iron piping to be used in connection with the supply of drinking water for the Institution I beg to say that in view of your many reports as to the excellent quality of this supply the Department does not feel called upon to incur this expense.\n\nSecond, As to the item of $800 for the cost of tank and pipes for fire protection and other purposes I may say that the Department is not disposed to incur this outlay as there are two large tanks in the main building which should give all the pressure required.\n\nThird: With regard to the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs of your letter I beg to remind you that it was only last year that a grant of $3600.00\n\nRev.

The Department cannot recognize any claim for over-expenditure in excess of the per capita grant.\n\nWhile the Department appreciates your desire to improve the appearance of all the buildings connected with your institution, it cannot furnish funds for this purpose owing to numerous more pressing calls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nDear Sir:\n\nWe want a favor from the Department and take the liberty of calling your personal attention to the matter. We are sure that if you can give it a few moments' attention it will commend itself to your judgment.\n\nOn the 27th inst., we sent to the Department a very urgent request for a small grant to purchase material to complete the reconstruction of the east or outside building and bring all into harmony with the magnificent new Institute.\n\nWhile we are only asking for the price of material and will do the work with our Institute staff, although it will take us...\ntwo years to do so. This may \nsuggest making the grant \nin instalments covering two \nand should that obtain it will \nbe satisfactory.\n\nMr. Mr. Griffin, the member \nfor this riding (Great Sudbury), \nwill always support this petition.\n\nHope for an early and \nfavorable reply, I am \nrespectfully yours,\n\nW.W. Shepherd\nPrincipal\nTo the Sec.\nThe Department of Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your communication No. 165001, I am glad to report for information recently received here:\n\nFirst, you asked me to report on the condition of the water supply on the farm. I have just returned from a recent inspection of the water supply. I am very reluctant to give up my opinion of the water supply, but the following facts have led me to the conclusion that it would be better to stop the water in favour of the field.\n\nFirst, the tests applied by the Department revealed the fact that the water was objectionable.\n\nSecond, there died one of the members of the foreman's family, and one child traced to the water by the doctor's quite alarmed me.\n\nThe foreman lives near the Institute, but on the line of the water supply, and he feared the fertilizers of the field.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RJL TC, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nhad a large pipe installed in the house and so the cost is not great. It would be better to refund the small amount asked for than to run any risk.\n\nAbout the necessity for a large volume of water for many purposes, but especially for fire protection. We consider that it is desirable to have constantly on hand a larger supply of water than has been used to date, especially for fire protection. The great advantage we would have from the increased pressure is the insurance. Remember that this is quite a little town in itself and requires a large supply of water always ready. Prevention is often cheaper than cure.\n\nIt is true that a fire is more likely to occur when there is no water available, but the fire department is not responsible for fires outside buildings. In fact, the attic of the new building should be considered as an additional fireproof space and valuable storage for all kinds of materials.\nwould like to complete the job\nand make it into what it is fast\nbecoming a model institute.\nIt is true we have already\naccomplished the former part and are\nworking the remaining part but\nthe latter needed for a while\u2014part\nof what we have asked in doing\nthe first part will therefore be very\nmoderate indeed.\n\nWe are also very satisfied by\nmembers of the House in making\nour modest request for a small\naddition to the funds to complete\nmaterial and we will do the work\nwith our staff.\n\nWe will be delighted if the\ndepartment can see its way clear\nto recommend the plan without\nthe necessity of any additional\nincrease on the head of the department.\n\nThe excellent manner in which we\nare prepared to work for all former\nparts we thought would recommend\nour use of money that you would\nlook favorably on this our modest\nrequest to complete a model\ninstitute alike a credit to the\nConc...and Church,\n\nIf our request is granted to complete this work as proposed, it is not likely that we will apply again for place to come.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nW W Shepherd\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs.

Elgin Industrial school for a grant of $500 to be expended in the purchase of material for making certain improvements in connection with that institution.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official reply to Mr. Shepherd sent him on the subject and turned out herewith.\n\nThe whole cost of these buildings has apparently been provided for by the Indians and a small Parliamentary vote. Any amount contributed by the Methodist Missionary Society is not known to the Department.\n\nThis school has been under the care of the Methodist Church since '81 and has cost a large amount of money, the buildings being worth over $40,000, and I do not think it would be right to call upon the Indians to make any further contributions.\n\nYou will see by Mr. Shepherd's original application that he asks for $900 to improve the water supply; $400 for pipes to convey the drinking water and $500 for fire protection. The management is responsible for providing pure water and if there is any trouble in this respect it is owing to the defective manner in which the pipes were laid and they should remedy it.\nThe school is well supplied with tanks and fire appliances and an insurance of $36,000 is carried on the buildings.\n\nAs to the enlargement of the barns I may say that Mr. Shepherd has now ample stable and barn accommodation for the ordinary needs of the school, but as he is extensively engaged in cattle trade, feeding stock for the market, I suppose he may need more space for that purpose. This business is carried on for the benefit of the school and is hardly necessary for the training of Indian pupils to the extent followed by him, as the extra amount of work entailed ceases to be instructive and becomes mere drudgery.\n\nHe asks for $1000 to reconstruct the old shops as he wishes to have all the buildings in keeping.\n\nOver $350.00 is asked for to meet a deficit; this is no concern of the Department's and will have to be made good by the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYou will see that in Mr. Shepherd's second application on file he hopes that the Department will see its way clear to recommend the grant \"without the necessity of additional pressure on the head of the Department\". A statement like this hardly comes with a good grace from the Principal of one of our Industrial schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have done all possible to complete the said contracts and in doing so find that the increase in wages and cost of material together with an underestimation by the late Principal has made it quite impossible to do all desired at the estimated cost. Enclosed you will find invoices for material used and for labor performed to the value of $1450.73. This together with the $1066.28 received in payment of invoices forwarded by the late Principal covers the entire grant.

The site for the Institution (4 acres) was dedicated by the Chiefsmen of the Thuron for the purpose on the 13th February, 1849, and also an additional 200 acres for use in connection with the Institution.\n\nThe land is not officially the property of the Indians who contributed to their construction, however, I think, 300 acres of the land but the title to the 4 acres on which the first buildings were erected, is in doubt.\n\nIn addition to the 300 acres above referred to the authorities of the Institution occupy by lease or otherwise about 300 acres (the rent for which is, I presume, paid for the profits which accrue from the land). The negotiations are now being carried out.\n\nThe funds for the construction of the building came from contributions from the Great Plains of Canada and bonds:\n\n- Chippewas of Lake St. Clair and Bearte.\n- Laken Baron and Simon\n- Mohawkmen of No Thuron\n- Mississaugas of the Credit\n- of Rice A Land Laken\n- of Alnwick\n- of Shingwauk & Nawash.\n\nFor the contributions were first made, the Methodist Missionary Society promised to supply necessary furniture, books and\n\nIndian Affairs.

The\nIndian Board interested contributed $1000 towards this end\nand Parliament voted $2500 for heating apparatus and slate roof,\nso I am willing to say over the whole cost.\n\nIn 1899 a Parliamentary vote of $3500 was given to cover\nthe cost of certain minor improvements, but\nbefore the end of the year the Department\n$2000 in excess of the grant; but in 1900 the interested Board\nwere assessed for $3600 to meet this expenditure and\nto make further improvements and repairs. This grant was\nalso exceeded by $195.75, all at the last session of Parliament\n$2500 was voted for improvements,\nand the Board assessed at $195.75. This $2500\nin the hands of the Board, and the Board of the Board\nfor the Principal the cost of the work done exceeds\nthe grant by only $30.54. All this expenditure was made\nby the school authorities without supervision or interference\nby the Board. It will be observed that since 1896\nthe Indians have paid $22,600 and the Department (for\ndonative grants) $2,500 on the buildings.\n\nThe buildings were insured for about $24,000 and\nthe premiums are paid from the Ontario and Quebec School Rates.\n\nOttawa, 27th January, 1904.\n\nAccountant.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nOttawa, 26th January, 1904-\n\nTo the Deputy Minister,\n\nAs desired, I beg to submit a Statement as to the Mount Elgin Institute Lands.\n\nSurrender No. 58\u00bdB.

(PG 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nExtract from a letter from the Rev. D. D. George, Principal\nMt. Elgin Industrial Institute,\nMuncey, Ont., Jan. 11th, 1904.\n\nTo the Honorable Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe subject of communication referred to is\nthe necessities and conditions of this Institute over which\nI have been placed. I have understood that it was the in-\ntention of your Department to increase the per capita grant\nand to place this Institution on a more equitable basis as\ncompared to others in the west and thereby enable its man-\nagement to attain a standard of efficiency now absolutely\nbeyond its reach. The late Principal felt as I feel that\nwith the present grant it is impossible to effectively\ncarry on the work even supplemented as it may be by occa-\nsional grants for repairs and equipment. When I entered\nupon my duties July last last I found repairs under way,\ncontracts let and material purchased. I have done all\npossible to secure the best results from the outlay made,\nbut after boarding the workmen and counting only cost of\nmaterial and of wages paid, I find the cost of completing\nthe work has far exceeded the amount of the grant. This,\nnotwithstanding the fact also that our regular staff car-\npenter and two of the apprenticed pupils were constantly\nemployed upon said works. I find no shadow of fault with\nmy predecessor. A natural sanguine temperament led to an\nover estimation of what might be done with said grant, and\nthe largely increased cost of all kinds of material as also\nlabor could not have been foreseen by him. The work done\nis of a permanent character and will add much to the conven-\nience and equipment of the Institution. Still there re-\n\nIndian Affairs. (FO 10, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nremains much needing serious attention, which can only be accomplished by the kindly and sympathetic co-operation of your Department.\n\nI have lived a most anxious life during the past six months, in that I have been the responsible head of an Institution representing not only a large invested capital representing the interests of your Department as also of our Missionary Society, but also the more valuable lives of its more than one hundred inmates. Such accidents as the burning of the Mohawk Institute last year and such sad fatalities as that of the recent fire in Chicago cause uneasiness to the responsible head of such an Institution as this, when the utter inefficiency or entire absence of protection against fire is as marked as it is in this Institution. I have worked hard to conceive a plan suitable to our isolated condition and feel confident that with the assistance such as I am assured you will freely grant that such plan can be put into operation with entire satisfaction and without serious cost. The assistance I ask is not a special grant (though I might be justified in making that request) but it is that of an increase in the per capita grant, which would enable me to make these improvements little by little through the work of our regular staff and at a much less cost than is the case when the work is of a special character and done by contract. The present per capita is so small that with the late Principal I am in entire agreement when he stated that \"the mere struggle for existence is so keen and constant as to paralyze the management in its efforts towards efficient work in the interests for which the Institution was founded.\"\n\nAs you know the land grant contains but 225 acres granted at a time when the pupils in attendance were limited to forty, increased to sixty, then to eighty and later still to one hundred, but in all this there has been no increase...\nof the lands from which we are to draw our supplies through cultivation. To meet this want the late management as also the present has been compelled to resort to leasing of such areas of land as our needs have demanded. This has been and is a serious drain upon our current income. There are adjacent lands that could be purchased from their holders at a nominal price, the possession of which is very important, not only for the above mentioned reasons, but also because they contain the sources of our water supply in large measure and it is important that we should control them. I do not think that I am asking more than sheer necessity forces me to and the important work committed to my trust demands, when I press upon you the necessity of an increase in the per capita grant and also the importance of an increased area for cultivation. \n\nx x x x x\nOttawa, January 30th, 1904.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Sifton,\n\nHaving reference to the personal letter from Reverend Mr. George, Principal of the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, in which he deals with the difficulties confronting him in the successful management thereof and alluding particularly to the scarcity of funds and the insufficiency of the land, I beg leave to report that the Mount Elgin Industrial School cost in 1851, $1,000.00, later on $3,660.00 for an addition thereof and in 1857 an additional expenditure of $640.00 was made for repairs and improvements, making the original cost $9,500.00.\n\nThe funds for the construction of the building were contributed by the following bands:\n\n_The Chippewas_\n\nIndian Affairs. (FC 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nThe Chippewas of Lake St. Clair and Ecarte,\nThe Chippewas of Lakes Huron and Simcoe,\nThe Moravians of the Thames,\nThe Mississaugas of the Credit,\n* * * * Rice and Mud Lakes,\n* * * * Ainvick,\n* * * * Saugeron and Kawash.\n\nIn 1896 a new main building was constructed, the bands contributing $19,000.00 and Parliament $2,500.00.\nIn 1898 Parliament voted $3,300.00 to cover the cost of other additions and improvements and in 1900 the interested bands were assessed for $3,600.00 for a similar purpose.\nLast Session Parliament voted $2,500.00 for improvements, repairs, etc., the cost of which, according to the account rendered by the Principal, exceeds the grant by only $30.54.\nIt will thus be seen that since 1896 the Indians have paid $32,600.00 and the Department, from Legislative Grants, $8,300.00, for the buildings. Both the Department and the Indians have contributed liberally towards the support of this institution and the particulars of the alleged financial straits are wanting to substantiate the Principal's case. The per capita grant is $60.00 for 100 pupils and without a very full statement of the case being submitted to the Department by the Principal I would hesitate about recommending increased financial assistance.\n\nIndian Affairs. (FO 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nRegarding the land connected with the Institution, I beg leave to say that the school authorities have been in possession for many years of four acres and 200 acres surrendered and used for the purposes of the school. In addition to these the school has under lease 275\u00bd acres, is using 30 acres of unsurrendered Indian lands and has applied to lease 100 acres, making a total of 607\u00bd acres.\n\nWith reference to the water supply, Mr. George's predecessor found no fault with this either as to quantity or quality, and in his last annual report there is nothing to show that the supply of water was not satisfactory, in fact his reports are the other way.\n\nThe buildings would appear from the report to have a fairly good supply of fire appliances, such as extinguishers, etc., and besides this a very heavy insurance is carried, $36,100.00, probably two-thirds of the value.\n\nThis Institution has run along from year to year and in so far as it is a going concern has been practically self sustaining. I really do not see how much more the Department or the Indians can be expected to do under the circumstances and no satisfactory reasons are given for an increase in the per capita grant. It may be considered that the Principal should either visit Ottawa and take the matter up in detail here or if not he should be asked to\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nprepare a fully detailed report setting forth the particulars of the needs of the Institution.\n\nIf the per capita grant is raised for the Mount Elgin Institute we will undoubtedly be asked for a similar increase for the other Industrial Schools of this Province.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\nOttawa, February 18th, 1904.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 11th ultimo, with reference to the Mount Elgin Industrial Institute, in which you indicate the financial and other difficulties confronting you in regard to the successful conduct of your work as Principal of that Institute.\n\nI have given the subject matter of your letter careful consideration and while desirous of promoting the efficiency of this school, in so far as doing so is reasonably incumbent on this Department, I am as yet unable to determine exactly, from your letter, to what degree or in what particular assistance is necessary.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Industrial School, erected some fifty years ago, cost originally about $3,600.00, contributed by the Chippewas, Norwegians and the Mississaugans Indians.\n\nReverend T. T. George,\nPrincipal, Mt. Elgin Industrial Institute,\nHuncoy, Ont.\nIn 1896 a new main building was constructed, the bands contributing $10,000.00 and Parliament $3,500.00; in 1898 Parliament voted $3,300.00 for additions and improvements and in 1900 the interested bands were assessed $3,800.00 for a similar purpose. Last session Parliament voted $2,500.00 for improvements, repairs, etc., and the accounts which you have rendered in connection with the grant exceed it by only $30.54. These contributions since 1896 thus amount to $23,600.00 by the Indians and $8,500.00 by Parliament and in addition there is the per capita grant of $60.00 for 100 pupils.\n\nIn so far as the land question is concerned, I find that there are 204 acres surrendered and used for the purposes of the school, 273\u00bd acres under lease, 30 acres of unsubmitted Indian land used by the school and that application has been made to lease 100 acres, which, if favourably dealt with, would make a total of 607\u00bd acres available.\n\nAs to the water supply, the information in the possession of the Department, based very largely upon the annual reports of the school, would show that this is satisfactory both as to quantity and quality.\nI quite agree with you that fire protection is essential in connection with these institutions but I understand that the Institute has a fairly good supply of fire extinguishers, etc., and there is carried also an insurance of $36,100.00.\n\nThe above facts indicate clearly that in dealing with this institution the Department has not been at all illiberal and having due regard to the school expenditure as a whole I am of the opinion that at present it is not possible to increase the Departmental contribution in accordance with your request. At the same time I desire, before concluding the matter, that you furnish the Department with full particulars of the assistance you require under the various heads which you have dealt with in a general way in your letter. As soon as your communication is received it will be given careful consideration and disposed of as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The boys, I understand, will be hiring out the new 260 acres and to provide the boys something on the farm.\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Daniel Albert, a child of the Mohawk band of Indians on the Thames, has asked me to write you in respect of the Government allowance due him according to $18.00, which the Indian Agent, Mr. S. Sutherland of Delaware, Ontario has not paid and refuses to pay to him. The Indian Agent claims that he is entitled to deduct the sum of $5.00 from Mr. Albert's fees incurred under the following circumstances:\n\nA son of Mr. Albert had been attending the White Institute for some time, and when he came home for holidays he refused to return to the institute, and the boy's parents notified the Manager of the Institute that he would not return, that he had been there two years. Neither the boy nor themselves wished him to further attend the Institute. The Indian Agent and the constable came after the boy, and took him to the Institute where he remained a short time and then ran away again, and is now with his parents.\n\nIt appears to me the action of Mr. S. Sutherland in withholding the allowance, or any part of it, for payment of constable's fees under the circumstance above set out is entirely unwarranted, and Mr. Albert wishes me to ask that you forward instructions to the Agent to at once pay him over the allowance. The boy, who is now 16 years of age, has been home for five months and the Indian Agent has again threatened to come and take him away to the Institute. As I understand the facts, there is no authority whatever for doing this and you might instruct the Agent...\nMemo. Registrar,\n\nThe attached letter should be filed in the regular way.\n\nAccountant: If there is anything you want done in connection with this please refer to me as I shall be in Mr. Sutherland's Agency next week.\n\nMr. Macrae:\n\nWe have no correspondence on this subject.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, for a grant of $3,000.00 to carry out certain improvements and repairs in connection with that Institution; I beg to say that when I visited this School in July last I found that, while the new Principal had been carrying out extensive improvements and repairs to the barns, fences and drainage and water supply for the past two years costing $6,166.91, he had done nothing to provide for the comfort of the pupils.\n\nThe boys' playhouse, for the repair of which $1200.00 is now asked, was in a most deplorable condition; it was bad enough when I was at the School in 1902, and, as nothing had been done in the meantime to improve it, it had gone from bad to worse until now it is totally unfit for habitation during the winter months and unless it is thoroughly overhauled and supplied with a heating plant and appliances for washing it would be cruel to the boys to expect them to pass another winter in it. They perform their ablutions at the pump in the summer and bathe in the river occasionally and I am at a loss to know how they manage in the winter.\n\nThis building, which is the oldest on the premises, consists of two stories and a basement and a stone foundation, is forty feet by twenty-eight feet and the\nrooms are nine feet, six inches high.\n\nThe old furnace is completely worn out and should be replaced by a new one. Stationary basins and at least two bath tubs should be supplied. The concrete flooring should be repaired and the brick casing around the old boiler removed, and entrance to the basement should be from the first story instead of from the outer door as at present, which is below ground.\n\nThe building wants reflooring as there were broken boards which have been patched by laying other boards on top. The walls should be reshaped on the inside and the whole building repainted.\n\nIf it is decided to do anything to this building the Principal should be asked to give a detailed estimate.\n\nWith regard to the laundry, for which $1,000.00 is asked, although the repairs are needed, there is no such immediate demand for their being made as for the boys' building and the overhauling of the girls' playroom, which contains a lavatory and bathroom and is situated in the basement of the main building. I consider it a mistake to place the lavatory and bath in the playroom, as the constant slopping of water on the floor keeps it damp and unwholesome. There would be no difficulty in finding room for a lavatory immediately in rear of the playroom, and I think that in its present condition it is anything but a suitable place for the girls to spend so much of their time. The room certainly needs to be changed and I think the Department should ask for a detailed estimate of the cost of these improvements.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute has been carried on under the control of the Methodist Church since 1851 and large amounts have been expended on buildings, nearly all of\nof which has been provided for by the Indians by assessment on Indian funds aided by small Parliamentary votes. The Methodist Missionary Society have contributed in the way of improvements, most of which has been given during the past two years, and they do not feel disposed to let Rev. Mr. George expend any more money at present. It would be a hard matter to call upon the Indians to make any further contributions, and, as there is no doubt about the immediate necessity for these repairs, the Department should provide the necessary funds.\n\nAttached to this memorandum are copies of Financial Statements of this School for the years ended the 30th June, 1904, and 30th June, 1905, which were furnished me by Mr. Shannon, the auditor and accountant of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (R0 1C, Volume 6205, file 468-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nFrom Mr. Benson's memorandum it is clear that the need of repairs to the boys' play house at Mount Elgin School is pressing but unfortunately we have no funds specially provided for additions and repairs at that institute and the present vote will not bear the additional tax. I must, therefore, if you approve the expenditure, place an amount in the Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 2nd October, 1905.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't. General.\n\nIn connection with my memo of the 28th ultimo relative to certain improvements and repairs required in connection with the Mount Elgin Institute, I am sorry to say from the Accountant's memo that the present school vote will not bear the expense of improving the condition of affairs that are existing there at present. I note, however, that you have approved of placing an amount in the estimates for the next fiscal year to provide for this work.\n\nI have no hesitation in saying that the present condition of the boys' building and the girls' play-room is such that immediate action should be taken to make these places habitable before the winter sets in, as if nothing is done they will have to be abandoned, and the boys crowded into the school room which would be rendered almost unfit for class purposes if they were to use it for a play-room and a lavatory, while the girls would have to spend their time in the sewing room. Dr. Sutherland is aware of the state of these buildings, and the necessity for some action, and I think he would be willing to expend the money needed to put them in order on the chance of being recouped next year after the estimates were passed; and I would suggest that he be asked if this proposition meets with his approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I foresee the delay that would arise on account of the cement work needing to be done before other things could be finished & it is unsafe to attempt such work in cold weather. Thus the work involves the change of certain sewer connections in the school hall & the fact whether I found it impracticable to go on with this business. I have enclosed the pipe house-pan & pipe for the house on an upper floor of white maple from which I took off two coats of old paint but the windows have not been given our so far as possible. The basement windows have much snow thrown at its sides and covered & these wont repair by replacing with cement when the weather permits. In other words, I believe, if I were able to get started on the cement work where they can be completed the work would have advanced or for no practicable. The furnaces have been replaced in a later attachment which is fitted to a chance of air as frequent as possible.

As soon as received I will settle the outstanding drafts, and forward the accounts to the Department.\n\nThe work of improvements is going on as rapidly as possible. We hope to occupy the laundry in about ten days. The necessary sewer changes are well advanced and barring delay with workmen the plumbing repairs of the main building can now be pushed forward to completion. We are now in the midst of our haying, and at present the prospects are the best for a good all round harvest that I have known at the Institute.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) F.T.
