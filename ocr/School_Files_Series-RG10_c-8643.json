When\nI last saw this building some two years ago, it impressed\nme as being rather a comfortable one for that outlying\nsection of the country.\n\nIt could be readily converted at little expense into a\nquite suitable house for school purposes.\n\nIt is not likely that we shall ever require the\nbuilding again, and I am of the opinion that $1,000.00 would\nbe a fair valuation to place upon it at the present time.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Comptroller,\nR.

Police detachment building at Split Lake, Man., and particularly to your letter of the 29th March last, file No. 306640/1.\n\nI have now the honour to inform you that the Hon. the Minister has authorized the use of the building above mentioned for school purposes by your Department, rent free, under the conditions set forth in the Order in Council of the 4th May, 1917, copy annexed hereto.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Comptroller.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy Minister & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.,\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a Report, dated 28th April, 1917, from the Acting President of the Privy Council, submitting the following memorandum from the Comptroller of the Royal North West Mounted Police:\n\n\"On account of the re-distribution of the Force, the Mounted Police detachment building at Split Lake has been vacated and the Department of Indian Affairs has written this Office requesting to be informed whether the building in question could be obtained by them for school purposes, with the view of establishing a joint school for Indians and Whites at Split Lake in conjunction with the Provincial Government of Manitoba.\n\nThe quarters formerly used by our detachment at Split Lake consist of a log building 24' X 24', with rubberoid roof, and was erected during the Summer and Fall of 1907 at an approximate cost of $1,250 including improvements and alterations which have been made from time to time.\n\nThe Commissioner reports that it is not likely that the police will ever require the building again and that it could be readily converted at little expense into quite a suitable school house.\"\n\nThe Minister recommends, under the circumstances, that the Department of Indian Affairs be allowed to use the building, rent free, for the above mentioned purpose, provided they keep it in good repair\u2014the necessary alterations to be made at the expense of the Department of Indian Affairs\u2014to which course the Commissioner sees no objection.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, May 10, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the establishment of a joint school for Indians and whites at Split Lake I beg to enclose herewith a copy of an Order in Council allowing the use of the building there formerly occupied by the Royal North West Mounted Police for school purposes.\n\nI should be glad to know what repairs, if any, are necessary to make this building ready for occupation and the probable cost. The Department would be glad if you would undertake to make the necessary arrangements for securing a suitable teacher and opening the school and it will pay two-thirds of the expenses of operation. Kindly furnish the Department with full information as to the name, age, religion, qualifications and experience of the teacher you select.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

I have wired the Indian Superintendent at Ilford to make sure that it will not be possible to ship the building in during the summer. If this is so, it will not be necessary to rush the ordering of the building until after the first of April.\n\nHowever, if it is necessary to send the building in by tractor train, could you please advise me whether you have in stock a small four room bungalow which you could recommend for use as a teacher's residence. I have your catalogue here and of course can refer to it if you are only able to quote me a catalogue number.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

It is however, just wide enough to enable a Bombardier to pass and will have to be widened in spots, where the road passes through timber.\n\nConsidering this would be the first trip from ILFORD to SPLIT LAKE for a tractor train, I am of the opinion Mr. Lindal's quotation of Thirty-Five Dollars ($35.00) per ton is reasonable.\n\nUnquestionably, this will be the cheapest and quickest way to get the building in.\n\nTrusting the above clarifies the situation.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6247, file 543-5, part 1)\nMarch 11, 1949.\n\nDear Mr. Staunton:\n\nToday is the deadline for the arrival at Ilford of the prefabricated teacherage for Split Lake.\n\nSome weeks later the question of how to furnish it will arise. For your guidance, I enclose two copies of the mimeographed scale of issue of furniture, etc., as supplied to the teacherage of our standard one room school. This house, however, will differ considerable in plan from our teacherage and the problem of furnishing it will be best solved after it has been erected. When that time comes, perhaps you and your wife (to whom please convey my regards) will give this matter your attention and you can then send along a requisition for furniture, etc., drawn up in accordance with this scale to suffice for a man and his wife and a few extras necessary to entertain a couple of people at meals or in the evening. Furnishings for children are not to be anticipated, but if there is an extra bedroom it should be furnished so as to provide stand-by accommodation for official visitors who would otherwise have to stay at the mission or the Hudson's Bay House.\n\nBy way of clarifying the picture of school accommodation that may hereafter be stated to be necessary at Split Lake and other points in your superintendency, I enclose a number of blanks of a pro forma which we find useful in surveying prospective needs. It would be helpful to have an exact accounting for the whereabouts of, for instance, 114 children whose names appeared on the Split Lake register in December.\nConcerning other concentrations of Indians in your Superintendency, we get letters from time to time from well-meaning people who think we are overlooking something. I had a letter recently from the Churchill Chamber of Commerce which suggested that there are now Indian children there who ought to be in a day school. That reminds me that we have had almost no news at all about the attendance of Indian children at the recently established Provincial Schools at Ilford and York Factory. Perhaps, you have not gone so far afield yet in your snowmobile, but I understand that Corporal McCardle was to go by dog-team to York Factory in February.\n\nI hope that you folks are now comfortably installed in your own home with the furnace functioning.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nMr. J.H. Staunton,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nIlford, Manitoba.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nCAFC/HEM\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th on the Split Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI only visited the school for a short time, as I was busy visiting the Indians, finding out how many hours a day the school was in operation, and receiving complaints which were numerous. Most of the Indians said it was useless to send their children to school as it only started in the morning around eleven o'clock and closed at twelve; opening again around two or half-past and closing at three o'clock. No effort was made by the Rev. Cowley to teach the children.\n\nWhen I visited the school there were 12 children in the classroom and an additional 40 were around the homes, who were not attending school. Mr. Grafton advised me that Rev. Cowley claimed that he taught the children in Cree; however, as Mr. Grafton can speak the language and has taught Indian children, it was quite evident that the children were not taught Cree, English or anything else. I would recommend that this man's services be dispensed with and a first class teacher engaged.\n\nAs we have not a residence at this point, arrangements should be made to have material sent in before Spring, so we can erect a residence next summer. In the meantime, a teacher could board with the Hudson's Bay Company Post Manager. There is no doubt, that Rev. Cowley has done good Missionary work but the only interest he has had in the school is the salary attached to it.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Feb 26 | To paid for cleaning of Split Lake Indian Day School as per attached receipts | $3.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Be good enough to report to the Department what action you take in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 2nd Dec., '09\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of above date and number, in reference to supplying a mid-day meal for the children of Swan Lake Day School.\n\nIn reply would state, so far as a mid-day meal goes, it would be very nice for the children, but the Indians are of such a roving disposition, that when they go hunting, fishing, visiting, etc., they invariably take the whole family old and young, and the children only getting one meal, in my opinion it would not increase the daily attendance but for a few days at a time, and I think it would be a bad precedent, as there are other nine day schools in my two Agencies and news of this kind travel very fast among the Indians.\n\nThe teacher Miss Mo Ilwain I understand is willing to prepare the mid-day meal for the time she may be at Swan Lake, and is only waiting for a person to take her place, she may go at any time and she may stay on until the end of February, and the person be it man or woman may not be willing to perform the duties required. It might be as well to take no action until her successor is appointed.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepart. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nbut that is for the Department to say.\n\nIn my opinion regular attendance with Indian children can only be obtained by Boarding or Industrial Schools.\n\nI am sir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent\nSir\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst. with reference to supplying a mid-day meal at the Swan Lake school, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the contemplated change of teacher, no action need be taken for a time.\n\nThe Department is at present devoting its efforts to the improvement of the day schools in the West, and during the past few months has met with much success at several points. Your opinion that regular attendance can only be secured at boarding or industrial schools is not borne out by the experience of the Department. On several reserves in Saskatchewan there are excellent day schools with good attendance. The primary influence is that of the teacher, who must be devoted to the work, but it has been found that the supplying of a simple mid-day meal is an inducement to regular attendance. On one reserve particularly every available child is registered and all who are well are in attendance.\n\nThis matter will be taken up with you again, if you will advise the Department when a new teacher takes charge.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nR. Legan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nAt the annuity payments at Swan Lake Reserve on the 15th April last, I was informed that Miss M.

The school has been vacant since April the 1st. She notified the Church that she was going to leave but said nothing about it to the Department.\n\nIt would be advisable to have a teacher at this point as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 22, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in reference to the resignation of Miss McGawane, teacher of the Swan Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 26th ultimo the Department communicated with the authorities of the Presbyterian Church with a view to having this vacancy filled and no doubt a successor will soon be appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTHOMSON\n\nSecretary.\n\nR.

The Department trusts that you will be able to nominate a competent teacher to take charge after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. F. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No.\n\nI beg to bring to your attention the fact that Swan Lake Day School has been vacant since April the 1st, 1910. It is a great shame back in the woods to have this school closed for five months and if the Church officials have no one to send perhaps something might be done locally. It is a great pity to see these schools close and sit there eight months at a time if they are to do their best work.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 23rd August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to refer you to official letters of the 26th May and 22nd June last in reference to the appointment of a teacher to succeed Miss McIlwaine at the Swan Lake Day School and to say that a communication has just been received by the Department drawing attention to the necessity for immediate action. It is to be hoped, therefore, that you will be in a position to nominate a teacher without further delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, 23rd August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant referring to the appointment of a teacher of the Swan Lake Day School. In reply I beg to say that this matter will be again taken up with the authorities of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nH. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nI beg to state that through the farm instructed of Swan Lake Reserve, I am told that Miss Mrs. Ilwain has returned to take up her duties as Teacher in the Swan Lake Day School.\n\nShortly after that I received no notice from her when she resigned and no notice of new re-employment. I spoke to her about the necessity of reporting but she evidently thought that if she reported to the Church there was no necessity to report to the Department.\n\nWhile Miss Mrs. Ilwain was a good teacher she will not cooperate with anyone and wishes to manage everything on the Reserve. She would confine her interests to the school and missionary work. It would be much better for the work as a whole.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 25th, 1910\n\nSecretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nReferring to No. 205980/1\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nYour letter of August 22nd, referring to the appointment of a successor to Miss McIlweine, Swan Lake School, received.\n\nIn Dr. MacKay's absence from the city, I reply stating that I am communicating with Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nOttawa, 27th August, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant; and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not yet been advised by the Presbyterian Church of the re-appointment of Miss McIlwaine as teacher of the Swan Lake School. The Department regrets that Miss McIlwaine is not able to always work harmoniously with officials of the Department, but still it is understood that on the whole she has been producing very satisfactory results in the school. It is regretted that she did not send you notice of her resignation, but as her appointment was made by the Presbyterian Church subject to the approval of the Department, she perhaps did not think it necessary for her to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nThe Western Committee wish to appoint Miss J.G. Bruce and her sister to Swan Lake. Miss Bruce has a First-Class Ontario Certificate; taught a considerable time in Ontario, and has been teaching for some years in Alberta, on a permit received on the strength of her Ontario certificate. She seems to have very satisfactory testimonials. Our desire is to conduct evangelistic work alongside of the educational work, and accordingly Miss Bruce's sister is to co-operate with her. Also, I believe she has been a teacher.\n\nI am simply writing today asking your approval of this appointment. We shall consider further what can be done to develop the work. If they prove as satisfactory as the testimonials indicate, we can look for real results. I am sure the Department will act both promptly and wisely as to the farm instructor of whom I wrote you last week.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.P. Mackay\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Bruce as teacher of the Swan Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church In Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, October 4, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 19th ultimo approving of the appointment of Miss J. G. Bruce as teacher of the Swan Lake school I beg to say that in view of the fact that Miss Bruce is the holder of a First Class Ontario Certificate and that she has had considerable experience both in this Province and in the West the Department will pay her an initial salary of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, October 4, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss J. G. Bruce as teacher of the Swan Lake School. Her salary will be at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nI beg to report having visited the Swan Lake Indian Reserve on the 19th of October and while there I visited the school, and found Miss Bruce, Miss McIlwaine's successor, on duty. I am of the opinion that she is capable and in time should make a success.\n\nI brought up the matter of a mid-day meal for the children, and Miss Bruce was quite willing to undertake the preparing of it, as she has her sister with her.\n\nShe is now giving a hot dinner to the children, the five school days of the week, to five, six and seven children and she expects the number to increase. She requested a grant of $10.00 per month for purchasing supplies and she stated that if she had the money she could plan to spend it to good advantage. I would therefore recommend that Miss Bruce be allowed $10.00 monthly.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, November 3, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will be glad to have Miss Bruce undertake the preparation of a mid-day meal for the children attending the Swan Lake school. The object is not to supply a full meal, but rather to supplement the lunches brought from home by the children. For that reason it is thought, taking into consideration the probable attendance at this school, that a sum not exceeding $7.00 should be sufficient to provide a suitable lunch. This should consist of soup meat, rice, flour, beans, bacon, tea and sugar. The Department will expect for a time at least monthly reports showing the cost of this meal, the number served, etc., etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Department is pleased to learn of this and has authorized him to expend a sum not exceeding $7.00 in the purchase of supplies, the nature of which has been outlined. The object of the Department in preparing these meals is not so much to furnish a full meal as to supplement the lunches brought by the children and give them some simple instruction in the preparation. Should the attendance at a later date increase the Department will be prepared to make an additional allowance for this purpose and in your reports you will be good enough to deal with the question of the mid-day meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss J.

Upon coming\nhere we had to make a full list of house hold necessaries,\nsending to Hudson Bay Company, the butcher, bread, coffee, tea, sugar, and the complete\nquantity of beef. So the supplementing to the store\nis quite from 10 to 20. Children has been taken\nfrom the family store, and I know of no better way than\nto do this. Enclosed find an estimate of expenses which I\ntrust will meet with your approbation. We cannot calculate\ntoo closely.

It will be necessary for you to submit vouchers in the ordinary form for this expenditure for each month as payment cannot be made without a voucher certified by you. Or, if you consider preferable, the Department will send an accountable cheque for say $15.00 and when expended it will be necessary for the teacher to forward through you receipted accounts for the supplies purchased. The Department wishes to facilitate purchases by Miss Bruce as it recognizes the difficulty and is willing either to pay by the month upon receipt of the proper vouchers or make the advance as stated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nDecember, 18th, 1910.\n\nI beg to report on the Swan Lake Indian Day School which was visited on December the 7th when we were paying Surrendered Land money to this Band.\n\nThere were present 10 pupils, 6 boys and 4 girls. The children were not in advanced standards but had a good grasp of the work gone over. They spoke out distinctly and were always ready to take part in any work assigned to them. They were neatly dressed and both pupils and teacher seemed happy in their school surroundings.\n\nThe teacher, Miss Bruce, will most likely do very good work. She is a certified teacher of many years experience, being between fifty and sixty years old. Her sister, who is somewhat younger, is engaged by the Presbyterian Church to co-operate with her in this work and so acts as housekeeper, looking after the mid-day meal for the school children. They are cultured ladies and have a good sense of what is wise, so will work harmoniously with any one with whom they shall be required to co-operate, for the advancement of the work on the Reserve.\n\nThey were brought up in the city and know very little about country life, and being up in years will not be able to adapt themselves to their surroundings very readily. They seem to be afraid to handle a horse, but they are six miles from Swan Lake and the Indian homes are so far apart that it will be impossible to do much visiting if they have to walk and a horse is almost a necessity.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nThe school building is in a good state of repair both inside and out. The new stove, purchased by the Department, will keep the building warm on the coldest days. A small woodshed say 12 feet by 12 feet is needed so that wood can be cut and stored for the cold weather.\n\nThe blackboard is much too small being only 6 feet long and 3 feet wide and it is a very poor one. The School is in need of a hyloplate board 16 feet long by 3 feet wide for the wall directly in front of the pupils and the old blackboard could be used to advantage on one of the side walls. This would give the teacher excellent blackboard space which Miss Bruce would be able to appreciate and also to use to great advantage.\n\nMiss Bruce has the idea of having a vegetable garden in connection with her school, which is a good one. On half an acre of land, with the help of the school children, she can grow all the potatoes, turnips, beans, carrots, parsnips, cabbage and celery required for the mid-day meal of the school children and also for her own use. Further, it is an excellent training for the children and will have a good influence on the Reserve.\n\nIf these two ladies get into the way of the work, which they will if they decide to remain in it, I am sure they will build up a good Day School at this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 28, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant reporting upon the work of the Misses Bruce at the Swan Lake school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn that these ladies are meeting with success.\n\nWith reference to the woodshed you may obtain an estimate of the cost of erecting a small building of the size mentioned, 12' x 12', and submit it to the Department.\n\nYou may also procure a hyloplate blackboard 16' x 3' with the necessary moulding. I may state for your information that the Department pays for this hyloplate board in Ontario about 17 cents a square foot and it is thought that you should be able to obtain it at a price not much exceeding this.\n\nThe Department heartily approves of Miss Bruce's suggestion to have a garden in connection with this school and I have to ask you to be good enough to report more fully in this connection, stating whether the grounds are fenced and submitting an estimate of the probable cost of preparing say half an acre for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. Logan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 28th 1910.\n\nNo. 205980/1\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of above date and number in reference to Swan Lake Day School, and can assure you that the generosity will be much appreciated by Miss Bruce the teacher at Swan Lake, as it is by myself.\n\nRegarding the wood-shed I shall report on the matter of it later, but on account of the extremely cold weather it will be impossible to build it until spring.\n\nThe hyleplate blackboard can be purchased locally or in Winnipeg, at 17\u00a2 per sq. foot but this does not include the moulding which will cost 15\u00a2 per linear foot extra. If the hyleplate can be purchased at 17\u00a2 per foot including moulding in Ontario it would pay to buy there rather than here.\n\nRegarding the school garden I might state that the soil around the Swan Lake Indian Day School is not suitable for garden purposes. A few rods from the school there is a field of three acres nicely worked up and half an acre fenced off this field would answer the purpose splendidly. I shall get the cost of fencing half an acre and send the estimate to the Department later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 11, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant in reference to the equipment for the Swan Lake day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the price quoted for the hyloplate blackboard by you is quite reasonable, but that for the moulding is excessive. The E. N. Moyer Co., Toronto, who have an office in Winnipeg, sell hyloplate blackboards including strips which should be attached to the wall between the top and bottom of the moulding to allow for ventilation of the back of the board, which is most desirable. They also sell mouldings at 5 cents per foot. You will be good enough, therefore, to purchase your boards with the strips and mouldings from this firm.\n\nThe Department will await your estimate of the cost of a woodshed, which can be erected in the spring, and also of the cost of fencing the half acre of ground which will be required for garden purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

When Spring opens up Mr. Campbell states that there will likely be an average of from 12 to 14 children.\n\nI would suggest that they be given an extra 150 lbs of biscuits.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, 14th February, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will order 150 lbs. of biscuits from the contractor, Mr. J.

There are two sisters engaged in the work at this point, one acts as teacher, the other as housekeeper and looks after the mid-day meal.\n\nI am very pleased to see the Department act so generously in this matter as I am sure it will be a success if it gets a fair trial. It requires a man and his wife to carry the plan out, the man to act as teacher and look after the school garden, and his wife to look after the mid-day meal and teach sewing to the girls. For instance, the Department is paying Miss Bruce, the teacher at Swan Lake, $500.00 per year and the Church pay her sister $440.00 per year. At $600.00 per year it would be possible to get a good man and his wife to take charge of such a school and I am sure the results would be entirely satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd.) R.

Statistics do not represent all the conditions. The pupils like to attend school and are ambitious as to standing in classes and for regular attendance. It is to be regretted that parents keep children at home for triviate reasons. Some who were encouraged to school have ceased to show active enmity. The Chief is friendly to the school to us, and sometimes comes in to visit the school. Besides has the grace to come and see me when and other he has occasion to keep his three grand children buty school.\n\nThe older pupils explicate my belief that it is moved in round. \"I no believe that why?\" \"No fall off, lay away.\" Neither do they believe that the earth moves. \"How we stick on,\" go explain Porter. \"From the air and bring them to gravitation.\" I no see that well John you can't see the friend. Yes I see around see other go go dat way moving this house.\n\"What man be find out dat\" so I don't go un-\nchallenged\u2014look & see the contradiction. Indians\nare very sensitive to ridicule so one must be con-\nscious of superstitions respectfully. For example, Osca\nin winter, boys girls they clone you make a snow\nman! No we no make a snowman. We get lots\nof fun. \"It bring big storm,\" another. \"Miss Bruce\nyou ever see Wendigo? No joe what is it\u2014\" Oh big\nbig ugly wild man be made by ice come down\nfrom face, you not go near him he kill you. Did you\never see our Joe? No old Indians see him, these does\nnot exist? \"way off hundred miles in woods.\" Another\n\"How much money dem government fancies you\neach in day rich!!! \"Give me lots money, please\nthese all young nice clean. And that they ought to try\nand earn and thank dem government fancies for all\nthey do. Officials lead this 3rd generation from\npaganism. Instead of the first to lead.\n\nNicholas in the Bank\n\nOf the Indians I do sorrow that instead of offering\nmoney for horse-racing, racing etc., for all every\nlittle hamlet, prizes for cultivating their land and\nfor the products of industry were offered it moved by\na vast improvement. And my belief moved not so\noften be discriminated.\n\nThe mid-day meal is an\nattraction and healthfully popular. It gets much more\nand articles of food seem to be up in price but it keeps at\nattendance at school and in so far the feel repaid.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ogletree\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 5th December asking why the Indian children are not attending school, we would ask you to consider that out of the 25 children mentioned as census return for this Reserve, there are 12 of the pupils now at the Portage Boarding School, leaving 13 very young children, and as some of them have to go 2 & 3 miles they cannot attend the school in very cold or stormy weather. The Indians of this Band want to have all their children sent to school so that they will be able to read and write and understand how to do their own business later on. Also we are having very hard times and sometimes we have to go away to hunt or to work, and as there is no place to leave them, we have to take them with us, but at other times we send them to school as much as we can. It happens some days that the children are not all at school and that was the case the 11th date mentioned in your letter as far as we know the children are attending the school better this fall than they have ever done, and we intend to see that they attend at all times when the weather is good and the people are at home.\n\nIf the Dept. would arrange to have the children kept & boarded at the school, during cold weather, and at times when the parents have to go to hunt or work for a living there would not be any trouble about them attending all the time, we would also supply all the wood and vegetables for the School and the Mission.\n\nTheir Marks\n\nChief, Meesha Keepanais X\nCouncillor, Gesses pomesitt X\nCouncillor, John Daniel X\n\nWitness\nFred Peters\n\nInterpreter.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, No 305980-I. I beg to say that I wrote the Chief and Councillors of the Swan Lake Band, as I did not expect to be out to their Reserve until April next, asking them why the children were not attending school, and stating to them the intention of the Department if the children did not go to school more regularly, and I beg to enclose a copy of their reply to my letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

Stores, Winnipeg.\nSir,\n\nI visited the Swan Lake Improved Day School on the 9th day of May and beg leave to report that I found on the roll of the school 9 boys and 5 girls, a total of 14. There were present at the time of inspection 4 pupils. They read well in the First and Second Books, and can do sums up to Long Division. They all write well and sing nicely Sacred and Patriotic Songs.\n\nEvery time I visit this school the attendance is poor. As Miss Bruce says I happen to come when the attendance is poor on account of some particular thing. This time the Indians were nearly all away from the reserve wolf hunting. On many occasions I have spoken to these Indians about sending their children to school and they always promise to do so. Miss Bruce is a good careful teacher and feels that a lot of her time is thrown away on account of the poor attendance.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nJ.D.

You suggest a salary of $600.00 per annum. I feel quite sure before we make the effort that a competent teacher can not be secured for this amount.

D. McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nWe have never been able to secure a teacher for Swan Lake Indian Boarding school since Miss Bruce left. This means that the school has gone without a teacher all winter. I have taken this matter up with our District Superintendent and with Presbytery authorities and we have come to the conclusion that we will not be able to secure a teacher at the salary you are offering, namely $600 per annum for a competent teacher.\n\nRev. J. W. Fulton, a man of good education and experience in teaching, with whom we are now in correspondence, may be available. I do not know what certificates he has but those who know him feel that he would do splendid work. What salary would you be willing to give if we can secure him? I do not expect that he could maintain his family on the salary you will give, but we might be able to add a little to it and have him do some missionary work on the Reserve. Would you be willing to give $900? This is the salary you are giving at most other points. The school may not be very large, but it will take just as much to maintain a family at Swan Lake as elsewhere.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Edmison was requested in July, last, to endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher for the Swan Lake Indian Day School, as the former teacher, Miss Bruce, was resigning on September 30th, and he was informed that the Department would allow a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum for a competent teacher.\n\nThe school has been closed since September 30th, last, as he was unable to obtain a teacher. He now states that he can secure the services of Rev. J. W. Fulton, a man of good education and experience in teaching, and requests that he be paid a salary at the rate of $900.00 per annum. He states that it is impossible for him to get a suitable teacher at a less salary. Miss Bruce, the former teacher, only received $500.00, plus the bonus.\n\nThis is a small school, with an enrolment of 16 and an average attendance of 6. The last census shows that there are 26 children of school age on this reserve and, if the services of the Rev. Mr. Fulton are secured, he might be able to increase the enrolment and average attendance.\n\nI shall be pleased to be informed as to what salary will be allowed in this case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Should the bonus be discontinued at any time, the full amount of $900.00 will be continued.\n\nIt is noted that you may be able to obtain the services of the Rev. J. W. Fulton, whom you state to be a man of good education and experience in teaching and, if so, the Presbyterian Church would be prepared to augment the salary paid by the Department.

McLean,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nOn April 1st last I wrote you re securing a teacher for Swan Lake Indian Boarding School. At that time I suggested the name of Rev. J.W Fulton. I asked that you give $900 because of his work as teacher and we would make up the balance of his salary and have him do a little missionary work.\n\nOn April 10th you wrote me that this arrangement would be acceptable to the Department. Unfortunately Mr. Fulton at the last moment decided to go to the Old Country and during the summer months we were not able to secure anyone.\n\nI have a letter to-day from Rev. J. A. Cormie, our new District Superintendent for Manitoba, in which he intimates that Rev. J. A. Donaghy would be willing to accept the position. We have written Mr. Donaghy for his qualifications and he writes as follows:\n\n\"I am a graduate of Manitoba College in the Minister Evangelist course. I spent a winter on Matriculation work, then entered the M.E. course taking University literature, ethics and Philosophy along with the corresponding M.E. year, that is first year Arts literature etc. with M.E. Theology. I have substituted in local schools at times when the teacher was ill or away for a day or two. Third class teacher's work was being studied in every case by some of the schools. All through the College course I studied the Indians of Canada as a hobby and have considerable knowledge of their origin, customs and languages as well as the psychology of the Indian mind which I studied at first hand for I spent seven years as missionary on the Okanase Mission\".\n\nMr. Donaghy has visited the field and he seems quite willing to accept provided the Indian Department is not planning to sell the Reserve in this vicinity. Apparently there has been some mention made of this.\n\nKindly let me know if you would approve of the appointment of Mr. Donaghy and at the salary you agreed for Mr. Fulton. He does not seem to have had a Normal training but it is quite impossible to get fully qualified teachers to take up work in these Indian schools at isolated points.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJH Edmonson\nOttawa, September 16, 1920\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, nominating Rev. J. A. Donaghy as teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School and stating the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that his appointment as teacher of this school is approved and you will be good enough to arrange with him to begin duties as soon as possible. The Department will allow him a combined salary and bonus at the rate of $900.00 per annum.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Donaghy will meet with every success in the work.

A.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received my quarterly cheque representing the Indian Department's share of my salary. I notice it is for $187.50, as was also the last one. I did not write about it as I wished to see how it would go with the June quarter. As my salary from that source is $900.00 per year, and is thus $225.00 per quarter, I cannot understand why these cheques were both $37.50 short. During the first quarter the school lost 7 days through an epidemic among the children and I thought they had charged me up with the lost time. In the June quarter, I taught 61 days, that is, 2 days over what the regulations really demanded. I was trying to make up some of the lost 7 days. But again the cheque is $37.50 behind the amount due. No explanation has accompanied either cheque so would you kindly look into it for me?\n\nIf I put in the school year of at least 200 days I will expect to be paid the year's salary by then, namely, $900.00. The regulations state that the September quarter will be paid for as a \"broken quarter\" that is, they will only pay for actual days taught. If this is so, it looks as though at the end of the year, when I will have completed the school year, that they will be far short of the school year's salary.\n\nYours truly, (sgd.) Jas. A. Doughy.\n\nP.S. These cheques come to me through the W. M. S. J.A.D.\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a communication I have received from Rev. James A. Donaghy, who is a teacher at Swan Lake school. The arrangement we made in the first instance was that Donaghy was to receive for his work as teacher, $900.00 per year. If there has been some mistake in his grant, we will be glad to have it corrected.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/EWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nExtract from Report of Inspector Wood's on the Swan Lake School\n\nSchool Inspected Dec. 9th, 1922. Original on 20580-5.\n\nMr. Donaghy is quite interested in his work. I consider him a very suitable teacher for this type of school. If he had some special training in primary work it would help very much. We have a special course for this department in our Teacher's Summer School held in the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, during the month of July. The only expense in connection with this is travel fare and $1.00 per day for board and lodgings. I did not suggest this course to Mr. Donaghy but feel that it is all he requires to make him efficient.\nOTTAWA, Dec. 21st, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn his recent report on the Swan Lake School, Inspector Wood suggests that you take a special course in the Teacher's Summer School, which is conducted in the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, during the month of July. He states that the special training in primary work which is given in this School, would be a considerable help to you.\n\nIf you are prepared to take this course the Department would give you an advance next June of $50.00, which amount would no doubt cover your expenses. The Advance would be deducted from your salary in four quarterly instalments, during the School year 1923-24.\n\nIf you take the course the Department will increase your salary to $950.00 from September 1st, 1923.\n\nKindly give this matter your careful consideration and advise me if you will adopt this suggestion. If you decide to do so, it might be advisable to communicate with Inspector Wood, and request him to make the necessary arrangements for you to attend this course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Donaghy,\nTeacher,\nSwan Lake School,\nIndian Springs,\nMan.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received your letter referring to Inspector Wood's report on this school. He recommends that I take a special course given at the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, which deals with primary teaching.\n\nI do not know his reason for the suggestion, but I drew his attention to the fact that the Indian Department does not supply things essential to the training of very young Indian minds. A white child, you know, comes to school age with its mind loaded with dormant ideas awaiting development. Whereas an Indian child comes to school age with its mind entirely devoid of ideas. These have to be \"planted\" & then developed. To aid this we acquire special equipment, something to keep them occupied between lessons, otherwise they become restless.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nI am quite willing to take a copy that will assist me in my work here, as we have a large number of children just about to become of school age, at the same time I have certain doubts as to the special course having much in it that takes into account the psychology of the Indian mind, for this is something in a class by itself.\n\nHowever, I accept your offer & will write Inspector Wood & that offer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. G. Doughty.\n\nP.S. While writing, there is another matter I would like to mention. I believe it will be my turn to attend the General Assembly, which will meet at Port Arthur next June. (at Mrs. Smith). To attend this meeting would necessitate the closing of the school for not less than two weeks. Can it be arranged, that if I go, the time be made up by opening school in the middle of August instead of Sept 1st?\n\nJ. G. D.\nOttawa, January 4, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, intimating your willingness to attend the Teachers' Summer School at the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, during the month of July. In May, next, you will please requisition, through the office of Mr. Agent Ogletree, for an advance of $50.00 in this connection. I am convinced that this summer school, while held primarily for teachers of public schools, will offer you real assistance in the matter of teaching methods for the Indian youth.\n\nWith reference to your wish to attend the General Assembly next June, favourable consideration will be given if you make your request to Mr. Agent Ogletree, early in May, next. He will forward the application to Ottawa and arrangements will be made, if our representative concurs, to close school early in June and to re-open on the 15th of August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. A. Donaghy,\nTeacher,\nSwan Lake School,\nIndian Springs, Man.\nOttawa, Jan. 8, 1923.\n\nSir:-\n\nAt the suggestion of the Provincial School Inspector, the Rev. J. A. Donaghy, Teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School, has intimated his willingness to attend the Teachers' Summer School at the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, during the month of July, next. We have informed Mr. Donaghy that the Department will make him an advance of $50 towards his expenses in taking the course, which advance will be deducted from his salary in four quarterly instalments during the school year 1923-24. When he completes the course, his salary will be increased to $950, from September 1, 1923.\n\nMr. Donaghy has been informed that he should requisition, through your office, for this advance of $50, in time to receive the same before he begins the course. When this request has been made by him, you will be good enough to forward it to the Department, and a cheque for the above amount will be sent.\n\nMr. Donaghy has further requested that he be granted leave to attend the General Assembly next June and he was informed that favourable consideration would be given to his request, if made through your office early in May, next.

Ogletree Esq.\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago the Indian Department asked me to make formal petition through you to attend the Presbyterian General Assembly at Port Arthur in June, with permission also to open school in the middle of August instead of Sept 1st as is usual. In this way the 10 days at Assembly will be made up.\n\nYours truly,\nJno. A. Donahy\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose Application from Rev. Mr. Donaghy, Teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School, asking permission to attend the General Assembly during the month of June for ten days, school to reopen on the 15th August.\n\nI would recommend that leave of absence be granted to Mr. Donaghy for 10 days in June.\n\nDepartment, letter dated 8th January 1923.\n\nNo. I27-6-1.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 15th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing a communication from Rev. J. A. Donaghy, teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School, in which he requests ten days' leave of absence in order that he can attend the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that approval is granted for ten days' leave of absence for the purpose for which it is requested. It is noted that Mr. Donaghy will make up this lost time by re-opening the school after the summer holidays on the 15th of August, next.\n\nIt is presumed that Mr. Donaghy will make the necessary arrangements in due time to attend the summer school at the Agricultural College, Winnipeg, during the month of July, next. If so, a request should be forwarded in due time for the amount which this Department promised to advance towards his expenses, viz: $50.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nIndian Springs, Mo.\nApril 30, 1924\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.\nToronto.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am just writing a few lines to report on the progress on the Mission and to bring one or two things to your notice.\n\nI am pleased to say that quite a change has come over the situation here during the past few years. When I took over the Mission scholars were few and the attendance low. Now the school is overcrowded, the average being about 27 or 28 out of 29 on the roll. A mid-day meal has to be prepared for the scholars, and while they were few in numbers, this work was not considered very difficult, but it had not been mentioned by the Indian Department as far as I know; at least nothing was said to me about it when I took over the Mission. Gradually the work progressed, the attendance increased until we reached the present overcrowded condition. This is an encouraging fact, but with the increased attendance has come additional work in preparing the hot meal. It now practically takes up all the forenoon of my wife's time cooking for them, that is, to such an extent that she cannot undertake any of her own household duties until afternoon.\n\nNow the Indian Department has issued an order that she must bake bread for the school, and this to be used in place of the Government biscuits used up to now. This, added to the already increasing amount of work in connection with the feeding of the school is going to be quite a task, especially as we expect to have about 35 attending next winter. I spoke to the Agent a day or two ago about this he said the Department had nothing to do with arranging for the cooking of the meal, they simply supplied the material. I said that we had not been informed that this work had to be done at all.\n\nMy wife acts as Field Matron, and has charge of the medicines and also looks after the sick. This sometimes keeps her very busy, and with the increased amount of school work her duties will take up a great deal of her time. She receives a small allowance for this but quite a bit is paid out for horse hire in the winter; in the summer the car will run, but of course they do not run on air either. So I am writing to see if the Department made any arrangements with the committee about the school work, as it is not included in the work of the Field Matron.\n\nI understand that at the Fairford school, the only other one serving dinner, they have put in a girl to do all the baking and cooking. Their attendance is about double ours; they have two rooms. My wife sometimes takes the big girls out of class to help prepare the meal so as to teach them, but does not care to use too much of their time in this way.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nWe are now waiting for word about the promised new school which will have to have a large class room, dining room, kitchen, cloak room and wash room. If we do not get a new building the present unsanitary conditions cannot produce proper results. I went into this fully in my last annual report and expect to hear about it soon. But the new school with its equipment for cooking and serving dinner for about 35 on an average will mean considerable more work. The meal will have to be cooked at the school and the cook will have to be there to look after things until all is cleaned up after dinner, so I feel that the Department should supply some help. It also looks as though it will be necessary to have someone to care for the new building, as it will have to be thoroughly cleaned every day. A big boy or girl could be allowed a little for this. I could do it myself and save the expense but my other work (Mission) would suffer, and besides it would not allow any time for business or work in connection with the mission.\n\nYou see our work is passing into a higher and more complicated stage, which is an encouraging feature, and I am writing this to acquaint you with this fact and the conditions arising from it, and also to ascertain if it is the Church or Department that makes the arrangements for preparing and serving the hot dinner.\n\nThe teaching part of the work has reached the point where there is no lost time, and I use everything I can to keep up interest and make study easy. This makes it more interesting to teach.\n\nYours truly,\nSgd. Jas. A. Donaghy\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C., Litt.D.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a letter I have received from Rev. J. A. Donaghy, our missionary at Swan Lake, Man. I am not sure that I am very familiar with the situation but I understand that in most of the Indian Day Schools the Government provides food for a hot meal at noon for the school children, and that two or three of the larger pupils, under supervision of the teacher or the matron, if one is employed by the Department, prepares this meal, and the children are taught to set the table, wash the dishes etc.\n\nI believe that at Cote Indian School the Matron is employed by the Department and gives her whole time to this work and that Mrs. Marshall, the teacher, has been aiding the Matron.\n\nWe are delighted to hear of the progress of the work at Swan Lake and the close cooperation between Government officials and our Missionary and his wife has largely been instrumental in bringing this about. Three years ago this Reserve was reported to us as one of the most pagan. A remarkable change seems to have taken place.\n\nTo return to the Field Matron's duties, I do not see how she can do the work on the Reserve, visit the sick and dispense medicine, prepare the mid-day hot meals, bake the bread, teach the children etc. without more assistance. It must also be borne in mind that she is the Missionary's wife and in this capacity has countless other duties devolving upon her. I do not know how to overcome the difficulty. How would it be to give Mrs. Donaghy an increase in salary and let her secure her own assistance for this work?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nSwan Lake Indian Mission,\nIndian Springs, Man.\nMay 22, 1924.\n\nRev. J.H. Edmison, D.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe situation in connection with our day school at this mission is such that I find that unless something is done immediately the work will be severely handicapped.\n\nThe school is a one roomed building (downstairs) about 17'x26' inside. It is fitted with 30 single seats and we have 51 on the roll without counting my own two children which make 53, and the attendance is around 30 to 31. 9 of these sit at a table used for their mid-day meal, and 3 sit at another small table, and still another at my desk. Efficient teaching is impossible in such cramped quarters as it is impossible to take class up to the front for a blackboard lesson as the tables are there. Lack of room keeps everything in disorder as there is only room to hang a few coats or hats; the rest are deposited in a corner behind the rear seats. The porch is used as a washroom in the summer, but during the winter this very important part of our equipment has to be dispensed with for lack of space.\n\nThere being only table room for a few during the mid-day meal the rest are forced to use their desks, which become greased up when soup or meat is served. The desk tops slope and spilling is the usual thing with the little ones. This makes things far from sanitary, especially during the fly season. The teacher's desk has to be used for a side table.\n\nThe atmosphere of the room during the severe winter months becomes filthy because of lack of ventilation. Windows cannot be opened as they lift from the bottom and children sit right against them. This is hardly in keeping with what the Department considers a healthy environment. To talk on the value of fresh air in such a class room is very inconsistent.\n\nConditions have changed to such an extent that the present building is totally inadequate to meet our needs, so what will it be like next winter when more are attending if I take them in?\n\nWe are desperately in need of a building having the following accommodation:\n\n1. Seats for 40 scholars.\n2. Dining room in which to feed them.\n3. Kitchen in which to prepare the meals.\n4. Separate wash rooms and cloak rooms for boys and girls.\n5. An adequate water supply. At present it is all carried from a well about 600 feet away.\n\n6. Some arrangement for a supply of help in preparing the meals.\n\nWhen we came here over three years ago it was not a very big task to prepare the meal for the 8 or 9 attending; but now the work has become so great that something must be done to supply help. The Department has ordered my wife to bake bread for this large group of children. (It must be kept in mind that she has her own baking to do also). This is no small extra to add to what she has been doing, and there is a limit to the amount of time she can spend upon such work. At Fairford day school a cook was put in, but of course their attendance is double ours. But ours is large enough to require that something be done. Either they should make it possible for my wife to hire someone to do her work, or hire someone to assist in the baking and cooking. To take the big girls from the morning class every day is too much. Cooking lessons are all right in their place, but they should not displace mathematics and reading.\n\nAt present the meal is prepared at the Mission House and carried over to the school more than 200 feet away. In a summer gale or winter blizzard this is not a pleasure. That is why I say the new school should have its own kitchen where the cooking can be done and the dishes washed and put away.\n\nWe have always had to supply the fuel for this small restaurant when our oil stove would have done our private cooking for the summer, but expensive fuel must be used every day because of the school.\n\nYou will see from these lines that something should be done this summer as more scholars are coming of age, and none will be leaving for a year at least, then we might lose four.\n\nHoping something will be done shortly, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd- Jas.

You will remember that in April of last year you recommended that a new school house be erected and that the old one be used for a dining room, washroom and cloak-room. There were so many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education, that the item in this connection was crowded out of our Estimates for this fiscal year; but I wish to inform you that the need at this school will not be overlooked as we are placing our requirements for next year before the Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nMr. Donaghy reports that the preparation of the noonday meal for the pupils is becoming so onerous a duty that the field matron has very little of her time released for other work. It has been suggested that some assistance be given Mrs. Donaghy. Please let me have your recommendation in this connection.\n\nThe teacher reports that the field matron has been instructed to discontinue the serving of biscuits at noon and to bake bread. Please let me know if you have any knowledge of these instructions, as they do not appear to have been given by the Department. It may be that, if biscuits are issued and the field matron is empowered to take some of the older girls from the classroom to assist her, no further action will be necessary in connection with the preparation of the noonday meal.\n\nThe teacher states that he has had to supply the fuel needed for the preparation of the midday meal. The Department considers this a charge against Appropriation for Indian Education and you may instruct Mr. Donaghy to requisition to you for whatever is required for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 9, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letters of the 21st and 27th ultimo, in which you enclosed copies of communications from Mr. J. A. Donaghy, the teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to note that there has been splendid growth in the activity at this school. I am directing a communication to the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie, a copy of which is enclosed for your information, and you may rest assured that the requests of the teacher will receive the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nIn reference to your letter of the 9th instant, No.127-6-1. I beg to say that I cannot recommend any assistance being given to Mrs. Donaghy in preparing the noon day meals by the Department. If she requires help in the kitchen she should pay for the help herself as Mr. and Mrs. Donaghy are getting enough salary from the Department and Church to keep help. If the work is too much for Mrs. Donaghy I would suggest that the appointment of Field Matron be discontinued, and have her devote her full time in preparing the noon meals.\n\nIn regard to the baking of bread, I did not instruct Mrs. Donaghy to discontinue the serving of biscuits. I told her what we were doing at the Fairford School, giving the children bread instead of biscuits, she asked me if she could bake bread for them. I informed her that she could bake the bread if she wished, as I told her the children looked under fed, it was her own suggestion to bake the bread.\n\nI did instruct her to give these children milk instead of tea as I do not consider the children should use tea, we do not allow any tea in the other school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nOttawa, June 25, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to official letter of the 9th instant, in reply to your letters of the 21st and 27th ultimo, in which you enclosed copies of communications from Mr. J. A. Donaghy, Teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School, regarding the preparation of the midday meals.\n\nI beg to state that our agent at Portage la Prairie, to whom this matter was referred, recommends that if Mrs. Donaghy requires further help in the kitchen, she should arrange to pay for same from the salary which she and her husband receive from the Department and the Church. It is further suggested that Mrs. Donaghy utilize the services of the older girls to assist her in the cooking and serving of the meal. The older boys also might assist in the carrying of water and in the cleaning up after the meal.\n\nRegarding the baking of bread, the agent states that he did not instruct Mrs. Donaghy to serve bread instead of biscuits. It was her own suggestion that she be allowed to bake bread. The quantity of biscuits contracted for to be delivered this school year for the fiscal year 1924-25 is 1000 pounds. The older girls would receive valuable training if they assisted in the preparing and serving of the food, and, if Mrs. Donaghy would utilize their services and the services of the older boys, there would not appear to be any need for hiring extra help.\n\nThe Department is aware of the lack of facilities at this school for the preparing and serving of the meal, also the need of more accommodation for classroom purposes. When our Estimates are being considered for the next fiscal year the needs at this school will not be overlooked. We hope that Mr. and Mrs. Donaghy will endeavour to carry on under present conditions until better facilities can be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n424 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 23, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the preparation and serving of the noonday meals at the Swan Lake Indian Day School. In this connection I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication which we are directing to Rev. J. H. Edmison, General Secretary, Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, through whom the teacher, the Rev. Mr. Donaghy, brought this matter to the attention of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclos.\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nThere is a matter upon which I would like to have your ruling, although I regret having to do so.\n\nThrough what I considered lack of organization, some of the Indians left the Reserve to work outside. This left their own thrasher probably a little short. Now as the season is getting late, the Farm Instructor wished to release some of the men and help so they can plow and take my school boys to fill the gap. I have protested to him, claiming he as truancy officer has no right to do this, especially as we are taking up particular work with this class. He has plenty of man power at his disposal and I feel that he should use it and not my scholars. This reflects upon my work by reducing my average, as well as putting my high scholars behind in their work.\n\nOn account of the attitude Mr. Hillhouse has assumed I feel that we ought to have your ruling upon this. I can conceive of conditions in which it would be good to release some boys for a short time but not when members of the band are working outside the Reserve.\n\nI regret that Mr. Hillhouse's attitude toward the Department's educational work here is not what I feel it should be. I was sorry to have to speak to you last summer about some work which he had promised to do many weeks before, but never found time to carry out. Also, it is now about fourteen months since you asked him to see that the lattice in front of the closets was painted. I was partly done, and since then I have only been able to get his assurance that he is going to do it. The unfinished job is very noticeable to visitors, and it reflects upon my ability to look after the premises and keep things neat. I would like to see it finished before another winter sets in. I am sorry to bring these things to your notice, but I do not like to see my end of the work used in this manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.) Jas. A. Donaghy\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham\nIndian Office\nRegina, Sask.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nREGINA, SASK. Oct. 27th, 1924\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am herewith forwarding a copy of a letter which I received from the Rev. James A. Donaghy, the school teacher on the Swan Lake Reserve. You will note that the gist of his complaint is that some of the Indians left the reserve this fall to work outside, and that the Indians being short handed on the reserve machine, some of the boys from the school were taken to help out with the work.\n\nThis man seems to be impossible to get along with. I have been on this reserve on several occasions and Mr. Hillhouse has done exceptionally good work since he went down there, as conditions on the reserve certainly show.\n\nIt is only natural that the Indians who do not have a crop would go off the reserve to work at threshing in order to make some money to provide for themselves and their families, and if the threshing machine on the reserve was short handed probably for a week or ten days I can find no fault with the Farming Instructor for keeping a few boys out of school to help out with the work. We all realize that while the weather is favourable the threshing must be pushed to the limit, and there is no doubt in my mind that the same thing is taking place in every white settlement in Western Canada, i.e., boys old enough to work are being kept out of school to help with the harvesting and threshing.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\n\nOct. 27th, 1924\n\nI would be glad to have your opinion on this matter, and I think the Church authorities should be told that unless Mr. Doneghy assumes a different attitude it will be necessary for us to ask for his removal from the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 5, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your No. 208-11A of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter you have received from the teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School relative to pupils' working during the harvest. The Department has no objection if older day school pupils are allowed to absent themselves from the classroom for work of a special or emergency nature. It is understood, of course, that local officers as well as teachers will guard against abuses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSwan Lake Indian Mission,\nIndian Springs, Man.\nDec. 6th, 1924.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast spring I wrote to you asking about the fuel used in preparing the mid-day meal for the children at the Swan Lake Indian School. You forwarded to me a copy of a letter sent to the Agent, Mr. A. Ogletree, in which he was instructed to ask me to requisition him for the necessary amount. As this was not done I wrote asking him if he knew anything about what should be done. I received no reply, but we went on using our own supply, thinking it would all be arranged later. I wrote again last week, and have just received word from him that he has no authority to purchase wood for the school.\n\nProbably he has forgotten about the letter he received last June, or may have overlooked that paragraph.\n\nSince school opened on Sept. 1st we have used quite a lot of fuel preparing daily dinners for about 30 children, as a big fire has to be kept going until the dishes are cleaned up after dinner. This increased fuel consumption about one third, we have judged. I do not like to remind the Agent that he has information about this matter, but as it is now four years since we began using our own wood, which is costing $6 a cord sawed (but not split) I think it is time the Department did something about it.\n\nThe paragraph in the letter to Mr. Ogletree from Mr. J. D. McLean reads as follows:\n\n\"The teacher states that he has had to supply the fuel needed for the preparation of the midday meal. The Department considers this a charge against Appropriation for Indian Education and you may instruct Mr. Donaghy to requisition to you for whatever is required for this purpose.\" (Dated June 9th, 1924).\n\nI judge that the Department owes us around 15 cords for the four years, but I don't suppose they feel like making up for past years.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Jas. A. Donaghy.\nMr. J. A. McLean,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nYou will recall the correspondence we had last June in regard to the supply of fuel for the Swan Lake Indian Mission Day School. Kindly refer to your letter to me dated June 9, 1924, in which you enclose a copy of a letter you sent to Mr. A. Ogletree. I forwarded a copy of your letter of June 9th to Rev. Jas. A. Donaghy. I heard nothing more from him until today. I am enclosing a copy of the communication I have just received from Mr. Donaghy. Kindly look into this matter. Evidently your Agent has forgotten all about your instruction as contained in your letter of June last.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE /PG\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 11th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the supplying of the fuel required for the Swan Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that we are again requesting Mr. Agent Ogletree to make immediate arrangements for the purchase and delivery of the quantity required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, December 11th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 9th of June, last, the closing paragraph of which referred to the supplying of fuel for the preparation of the midday lunch at the Swan Lake Indian Day School. It has been brought to the attention of the Department that no wood has been supplied for this purpose. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange to have the quantity of fuel required both for the school and for the preparation of the midday meal supplied at the earliest possible date. You should have this wood delivered in proper stove lengths, suitable for use. Prices for supplying the quantity required should be obtained from the Indians, and the contract should be given to the person quoting the lowest price. When the fuel has been delivered, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThe Department will expect you to see that the matter of supplying the fuel for the use of this school receives your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA.

I understand these supplies are sent out by the Church, clothing, blankets, quilts etc., I am aware it is contrary to the provisions of the Indian Act, for a Missionary and school teachers to trade with the Indians, and before I take action under the Act, I would like the Approval of the Department.\n\nKindly advise in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDecember 29th, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison,\n\nI am informed that Rev. J. A. Donaghy is at present selling supplies to the Indians of the Swan Lake band. It is understood that these supplies consist of clothing, blankets, quilts, etc., sent out by the churches.\n\nWill you kindly make inquiry and advise me whether these goods were intended for sale to the Indians or for distribution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. K. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nDecember 29th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd. instant regarding the sale by Mr. Donaghy of supplies to the Indians of the Swan Lake band. The Department is instituting some inquiries and you will be further advised later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nUNITED CHURCH INDIAN MISSION.\n\nINDIAN SPRINGS, Man.\n\nDecember 17th/26.\n\nMrs. Chas. Clark,\nToronto.\n\nDear Mrs. Clark:\n\nI am writing this in haste so as not to waste any time in getting it to you. Your letter arrived today, and at the same time we received two parcels of Xmas gifts for the children. One was a small box that came by mail, but it helps out the situation. The other was from Garden Hill, Ont., and had a few articles of clothing, but Xmas gifts from the young folks constituted the main bulk. We had a friend at Creemore, Ontario, who had sent out presents for two years, but they went against Union and of course could not help any more. But she has written saying that she spoke to the Erskine Church, Meaford, and they sent out the box by mail. Mrs. Ferguson of Creemore is very much interested in our work and is very sorry they are now separated from it. But she thinks the Meaford folks will take an interest in it now. The Garden Hill young people asked if they could be of any help, and I sent a reply in haste so their box came today. Then there is still a donation coming from Wawanesa, Man. It will be Xmas things. So though it looked discouraging only a week ago, it has brightened up suddenly as the Xmas season approaches.\n\nThen, I must acknowledge the bale that came from Toronto a day or two ago. This is the bale that is going to make the little school children feel like enjoying the winter holidays. It contained warm stockings, underclothing, and quite an assortment of clothing. One thing we were pleased about in this, and that is that the boys have been looked after. The girls have been getting the big share of the clothing but the boys are now going to have their turn. We have one little fellow coming to school and he has not sufficient clothing to keep out the ordinary fall breezes. What he has is in rags. We have had a very cold spell of winter, and I believe the East has had some too. But out here it bites deep into the flesh, and can numb and freeze your face in a very short time.\n\nThis bale contained some very nice baby clothes, and there are babies here to use them. I think we have eight under a year old. Then the piece of canton flannel will be an good hands, as some of our women are very good with the needle. There were also twelve quilts, and the old folks have been coming frequently to see if we had anything to give them during the severe spell. I think some of them saw the bale at the station, for its arrival seems to be widely known already.\n\nAt present it must be quite a task for the United Church to carry on this work, as none of it has been handed over to the non-concurring congregations yet, and they are standing by doing nothing. It is too bad Mr. Okanase is acting as he is. We have some true friends there among those Indians, and they write to us. We are at present selling some\nmoccasins for three of the women who have a hard time making their own living. Our Indians here cannot get the leather, so we send up there for the moccasins. These people were the mainstay of the church there, and stood up against some of Joe Boyer's doings. They say they cannot get anything from Mr. Wilson, unless they pay for it. I have known him ever since he started in at College and never admired his character. The Antis expect to have the Birtle School and the three reserves up there, I should say four, as the Birdtail is there too.\n\nNow I must close. I hope some of the worry will fall from your shoulders. We are in very fair shape now for Xmas. Some of the Indians gave a few dollars to buy things for their children.\n\nThe weather is trying to moderate a bit, and it will be a blessing to many on the prairie and in the city.\n\nWe thank you very much for the relief you have given us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) James A. Donaghy.\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., F.R.S.C.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have yours of December 29th. in regard to Swan Lake. I have taken this up with Mrs. Clark of the Women's Missionary Society, and she has given me a copy of a letter she received recently from Mr. Donaghy. You will see that he has been selling \"accessories\" to some of the Indians. These were not sent forward by the Women's Missionary Society.\n\nI expect that the complaint that has been sent in to you is just a continuation of the old anti-union propaganda which has been, and is still being conducted by some of the anti-union leaders.\n\nWith regard to the selling of supplies, I find this occurs only when there happens to be an over supply of articles. The old and needy are always cared for, but if there is an over supply and if there are some who can well afford to pay, the proceeds are used for some urgent needs of the school. If some of these Indian people can afford to pay there is no reason why they should be pauperized.\n\nI trust this information will be sufficient.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE:AK.\nEnc.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nJanuary 5, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, regarding the sale by Mr. Donaghy of supplies to Indians of the Swan Lake Band, I am in receipt of information from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada which goes to show that he sold some moccasins to Indians for other parties. They were not from supplies forwarded by the Church.\n\nPerhaps it would not be well to take any drastic action at the present time. In any case, it would seem advisable for you to get more definite information when you might communicate again with the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instaht. No.127-6-1.\n\nOn the 12th 13th and 14th of this month I visited all the houses on the Swan Lake Reserve, and found most of the Indians had purchased Quilts from Mr. Donaghy, teacher at Swan Lake at 50\u00a2 each, some of the Indians purchased as many as four quilts from Mr. Donaghy. The quilts are cheap at 50\u00a2 each, but the question is as I understand, these quilts we sent out by some Society of the Church for the Indians. Why should the Indians have to pay for them? Is the money accounted for to the Church? I understand the Moccasins were purchased by Mr. Donaghy, from the Northern Indians and sold to the Swan Lake Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nJanuary 27, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant in further reference to the sale of goods by Rev. Mr. Donaghy to Indians of the Swan Lake reserve.\n\nThe sale of the moccasins has been apparently satisfactorily explained. With regard to the quills, I may say that the officials of the Women's Missionary Society were aware that Mr. Donaghy was disposing of some of the quills to Indians in a position to pay for them at the very nominal price of fifty cents; this after the needs of the needy and destitute were provided for.\n\nIt is reasonable to presume that Mr. Donaghy accounted to his superiors for these sales. It, therefore, would not appear necessary or advisable to take any action at present along the lines indicated in your letter of December 22nd, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Ogletree, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nSir;-\n\nI beg to report that there is trouble between Mr. Donaghy, teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School, and Mr. Minielly, Farm Instructor, at Swan Lake Reserve.\n\nMr. Donaghy is interfering too much between the Indians and the Farm Instructor, both over the Farming and the School children. Mr. Donaghy gets very nasty and abusive at times and Mr. Minielly has threatened to leave several times on account of Mr. Donaghy's actions. I have had assurance from the Church Authorities and also from the Department, that Mr. Donaghy will be removed from Swan Lake, but nothing has been done yet.\n\nWe cannot keep a Farm Instructor here, unless Mr. Donaghy is removed, as he is using his influence against the Department's Officials, he did the same with Mr. Hillhouse and there is no doubt he was the cause of turning the Indians against Mr. Hillhouse.\n\nMr. Donaghy, has now caused trouble between Charlie Tanner and his son Archie, he forced this boy to get a divorce from a girl he married, which cost Archie $165.00 and as far as I can learn he is the cause of Archie desiring to stop farming with his father.\n\nIn the case of two children, he reported to me for their not attending school, Mr. Minielly is the Truant-Officer and he had the doctor examine these children and the doctor reported them unfit for school, Mr. Donaghy was very abusive to Mr. Minielly and threatened to report him for not having these children at school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) A. Ogletree,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter I have received from Mr. A. Ogletree alleging interference by Mr. Donaghy, the teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School, with Mr. Minielly, the Farming Instructor on the reserve. This, as you will recall, is not the first instance of trouble occurring on this reserve as a result of Mr. Donaghy's actions, Mr. Hillhouse new Farming Instructor in the Carlton Agency having been transferred from Swan Lake for these reasons. Mr. Minielly evidently finds the position so intolerable that he has threatened to leave on several occasions, and the tension which exists is not only disagreeable but is bound to have its effect on the work on the reserve.\n\nMr. Ogletree refers in his letter to having had assurance from the Church Authorities as well as from the Department, that Mr. Donaghy would be removed, and if this has been given, the promised action might well take place without further delay before the position on the reserve forces Mr. Minielly's hand and compels him to resign. We have had no trouble with Mr. Minielly and he is carrying on his duties satisfactorily. He appears to be a type of man not easily replaced and deserves the protection of the Department. I shall be glad if steps can be taken to have Mr. Donaghy withdrawn from the Swan Lake Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 9, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11 of the 4th instant, with enclosure, concerning the advisability of having Mr. Donaghy, the teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School, transferred to some other work. The Deputy Superintendent General is writing to the church authorities in this connection and I am hopeful that early action will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 9, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI am informed that Mr. Minielly, the farm instructor on the Swan Lake Indian reserve, Manitoba, is not satisfied to continue his duties, because of the attitude and actions of Mr. Donaghy, the teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School. You will remember that we have discussed Mr. Donaghy's case at different times and I believe it is now advisable for him to be transferred to some other work. I should be grateful if you would take steps to this end at an early date. Some time ago, the Department transferred the previous farm instructor because of difficulty with Mr. Donaghy, but I am now satisfied that this teacher must shoulder much of the responsibility as, apparently, none of our officers can work in harmony with him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I have written Dr. Cormie, our District Superintendent, and have advised him to find another place for Mr. Donaghy. He may not be able to move him until the end of June but I am convinced that he ought to be placed elsewhere then.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EWS\n\nIndian Affairs.

WEST\nTORONTO 2, ONTARIO\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nMay 10,\n1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of May 7th (No.127-6-1), re appointment of Rev. Joseph E. Cooper as Missionary Teacher to the Swan Lake Indian Day School to succeed Mr. Donaghy, I beg to say that I am today notifying Mr. Cooper that I will apply to the Settlement Committee of the Manitoba Conference to have him appointed to this field. I have no doubt whatever that this will be done.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\nUnited Church Indian Mission\nIndian Springs, Man.\nJune 14th 1927\n\nThe Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to bring to your attention a situation which I feel should be looked into by the Department.\n\nI believe you have received numerous reports from Mr. Ogletree, Agent at Portage la Prairie, reflecting upon my conduct here, and creating the impression that I am making trouble for the Farm Instructor. He has sent in a number of absolutely false statements which I feel it is my duty to have cleared up. He says he has sent in many, all equally untrue, I believe. I have been advised to ask the Department to look into these before taking any other action against Mr. Ogletree. Such charges are serious, and Mr. Ogletree should have enquired into them before sending them on as facts. I realize that the Department has a right to believe its representatives, and he has imposed upon this trust and made himself liable.\n\nFIRST. He has accused me of trying to engage a lawyer to fight the Department in a liquor case. My record in the fight against liquor on this Reserve is not in keeping with such a statement, which is absolutely false. A family engaged a lawyer when the head of the house was sent to jail, and denied the right to secure a lawyer to defend him. So they claimed. The lawyer told me lately that he had a good case against the Department, but it would have cost the man too much to push it. And not until the other day did I know what was done about this matter, as I did not even ask the family what was being done. Mr. Ogletree must correct this matter.\n\nSECOND. Mr. Ogletree has stated that I have been writing to the fur buyers of Brandon, and trying to make trouble between them and Mr. Minisilly. This untruthful report could only have its source in the mind of Mr. Minisilly who is primarily responsible for it.\n\nOn one occasion Mr. Minisilly cashed a fur check for an old man, and did not give him the full amount. The man asked me to phone the buyer and ascertain how much he should have received. The man did not say how much, but said it should have been more. He wrote to the Indian and told him to go to Mr. Minisilly and he would fix it up. He did so and received a few dollars more. Naturally, this set every tongue on the Reserve wagging, but I told the man that there must have been some good reason for what Mr. Minisilly had done. Please compare this with what Mr. Ogletree has said about the matter.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nTHIRD. I also understand that I am accused of being the author or instigator in the production of a letter recently sent to the Department, the letter being sent in the name of the Chief. The Agent tried to force the Chief to state that I was responsible, but in spite of all he said he stood by what is true. This letter was the sole production of the old men; they worked out among themselves at some time, I do not know when. They felt that things were being run in a strange manner here and so expressed themselves. When asked to produce proof of his contention Mr. Ogletree will find his position a difficult one.\n\nFOURTH. Two school girls were absent for many weeks after Xmas, one was supposed to be sick, but was attending dances and picture shows. I asked the Farm Instructor, as Truancy Officer, to look into these cases. He refused to have the sick one examined to ascertain whether she was ill or not. I asked Mr. Ogletree why nothing could be done. He apparently ordered an examination then, and she was declared too sick for school. In replying he gave me what is termed a \"bawling out\" for complaining about the non-attendance of certain children, and trying to make trouble for Mr. Minielly, while he held reports showing they were too ill to attend. I replied that his statement could not be correct, as he held no report until I had insisted upon action being taken, and also he held such a report for ONE case, as the other was kept home to nurse the baby. I also told him I was doing what the Department insisted upon me doing, and embodying it in my annual report.\n\nFIFTH. The school coal ran out very early this spring and I was forced to burn very small cook stove wood in the furnace. 8 tons should have been put in the bin last fall, but not over 6 were delivered. There was one ton on hand when the new arrived. The bin is 7 X 10 ft., and the coal averaged 4 ft deep, or 280 cu. ft. Call it 300 ft. The rule I used calls for 42 ft. for loose lumps, which proved correct in my own case where it was both weighed and measured.\n\nI merely asked Mr. Ogletree what I would do in case of shortage. He questioned Mr. Minielly who reported that he delivered the 8 tons, which is positively incorrect, as that would have made 9 tons in the bin, only 4 ft. deep. 9 tons would have reached to the top of the door. The grain elevator at Indian Springs got a few tons out of this car, and Mr. Minielly has a large supply in his own bin. Mr. Ogletree gave me to understand that it was none of my business where the coal went. Perhaps he is right. If the Department is satisfied that 9 tons can be put in less than 300 cu. ft. all right, but I received 9\u00bd tons and it occupied around 390 cu. ft. So I am reported for making trouble when I asked where our school coal went. I think the Agent should have made it HIS business to know where it went.\n\nI believe a regular campaign of such material has been forwarded to the Department from time to time, some of which is of a much more serious nature than any I have mentioned, but all equally baseless. As I believe this has resulted in real damage being done to my reputation, and to my home, and my ability to act fair and above board in my work, I must ask that Mr. Ogletree be requested to\ndo something immediately to remedy the situation ha has produced, I have been advised to try and have this settled within the Depart-\nment, but failing in that I will have to resort to other means. The Department refused to let me take an appointment in the east, showing conclusively that the false statements sent in by the Agent have done real harm, the value of which will have to be estimated.\n\nThe Farm Instructor seemed to be indifferent to everything but his salary check. The young men wanted leadership, and he failed in what was a supreme opportunity to do something substantial in moulding their opinions. The old men wanted guidance, and got none. I did all I could for them, and it remains to be proven that my influence has done harm. The Agent has wielded the \"big stick\" over the Chief and Councillors, and forbade them signing any letter to the Depart-\nment. With them gagged and me out of the way, many irregularities can be put through. The old men wrote the letter mentioned because things are not what they should be. They blame the Instructor for much of it, including the loss of a large number of cattle last win-\nter through lack of supervision. Mr. Ogletree says I have been \"inter-\nfering with all the farm instructors we have had there during the last few years\". There was only one other, Mr. Ogletree's action put him out. The Indians feel that an Instructor should be able to teach them, and this man had to bring in another to run a very small thresh-\ner last fall, at a cost of $10 a day, so they say. The Indians ran their old big outfit several years when there was no Instructor here. So they look for someone better than themselves, and I feel that he should measure up to their expectations. But it is not my place to criticise him. The Department has concluded that I am unsuited to take charge of an Indian School, and that decision is based upon untruthful reports sent in by the Agent. Only a complete correction, and restoration of my standing will clear the matter up. I trust the Department will see that this is done.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 1)\nJune 27, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Donaghy:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, concerning the differences you have had with the Department's local representatives. I may say that the associations in Indian work and the circumstances surrounding these are such that difficulties often arise among the workers. I feel you should not allow misunderstandings to occupy an important place in your mind and I wish to assure you that I have always studied such problems with a desire to be fair to all parties concerned. No doubt, in time to come, you will be able to look back on your missionary service with satisfaction and will be assured that results have followed your labours.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is in answer to one from me asking that your Agent at Portage la Prairie be requested to retract certain false and damaging statements which he sent in to your Department. You refer to these as \"misunderstandings\". If that were all they were I would let them pass unnoticed, but they are not, but are statements sent in for the purpose of damaging my record in the eyes of the Indian Department. Evidently he succeeded in doing this as you refused to allow me to take an appointment in the east. I intend to take action against your Agent for sending in falsehoods concerning the work done at the Swan Lake School unless I have definite word from you that these have not injured me in the eyes of the Department. I would be very sorry to hear that the Department supported Mr. Oglethorpe in this despicable piece of work, and naturally, in a court action, the Department's conduct towards a Missionary-teacher, as reflected through an Agent in the mental and physical condition of Mr. Oglethorpe, would create a very unfavorable impression. For at least three years he has been unfit to have charge of such an important position.\n\nWill you kindly let me know if I am now ruled out of ever being permitted to teach in an Indian School. I have accepted my present charge as a temporary arrangement, as my interest in the Indians has not been dropped.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I think that once the girls have been taught to cook and wash, they would take sufficient pride in their work to carry on with very little supervision.\n\nWith reference to the meals cooked for 20 other persons, doing work around the school and grounds, I presume this work was authorized by the Department, and sufficient funds would be estimated for to cover all expenditure in connection with the work, and bills should have been forwarded covering this item.\n\nI appreciate the good work Mrs Cooper is doing, and regret that you did not look into this matter before accepting the appointment, as your predecessors will have done the same work for about two years without any financial assistance.

However there is one point of your letter which is hardly correct. The following excerpt from letters will explain. Before accepting the position I wrote to the authorities asking several questions one of which was:\n\n\"General duties to be performed:\n(a) Period of teaching days - also holidays.\n(b) Missionary duties.\"\n\nThe answer to this question affecting this head was as follows:\n\n\"The duties may be teaching in school and attending to the mission work with Sunday service. The Indian Department asks each teacher to teach 200 days and the holidays are arranged through the Indian agent for the school.\"\n\nThis will explain my attitude and reasons for letter of July 2nd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I wish you would return it to me, also after you have noted contents and studied my letters so that you would decide.\n\nI happened to be in Portage on Aug 1st, and in our conversation at letter of July 2nd, Mr. White said Mr. Christiansen has that matter in hand, I suggested to Mr. White that the Department might supply me with coal this year for the work and service Mr. Cooper did last year. I believe he understood what was meant and as really he had nothing to do with last year's work the matter was not pressed.\n\nThis year a very agreeable arrangement has been made and Mr. Cooper will carry out the work same as last year, we have found it more economical both as regards time, fuel and labour to cook the meals over in the kitchen of our house (of course it hasn't been economical from previous, as we have supplied the fuel.)\n\nMr. Cooper has different girls at different times and shows them how the work is performed.

J. E. Cooper, and I believe good progress is being made. The roll calls for 26 pupils, and 25 were present. The average for January & February was 23.08. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| I     | 7      |\n| II    | 4      |\n| III   | 7      |\n| IV    | 5      |\n| V     | 4      |\n| VI    | 1      |\n\nThe children appeared to be well along in their grades, and in arithmetic, spelling, writing, and book work are doing well. They do not, however, speak out, and it is difficult to hear them read.\n\nThey were well clothed, and clean in appearance.\n\nThe classroom is well equipped and nicely arranged. The basement is used for a dining room, and a noon-day meal is prepared by Mrs. Cooper.\n\nSewing and mending are also taught to the girls, and they are able to do some very nice work.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Cooper\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowah Agencies. This report was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was occupied from the 25th February to the 11th April in making an inspection of these two agencies.\n\nEverything at the Swan Lake Indian Day School seems to be in a most satisfactory condition. The Inspector makes the usual comment regarding the children not speaking out distinctly. Conditions at the Waterhen Day School also appear to be fairly satisfactory.\n\nAt the St. Andrews Day School the Inspector points out that the attendance is irregular and progress slow. I am afraid the trouble here is that the Department have not the right kind of a man teaching the school, and it has occurred to me that it might be a good plan to suggest a change of teachers and also to issue instructions to have the children who are not attending school regularly sent to Boarding School. Those who belong to the Church of England might be sent to Elkhorn, and the two Roman Catholic boys mentioned could go to Lebret. In the case of Moses Cook it is pointed out that he has scarcely attended school at all during the past year.\n\nWith reference to the Ebb and Flow Day School, I would draw your attention to what the Inspector has to say regarding the teacher, Mr. Taggart.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n-The Inspector-\nThe Inspector points out that the Lake Manitoba Day School was closed on the day prior to Good Friday. I do not know why this should be. The attendance here is fair. The Inspector points out that while the teacher is qualified, he is of the opinion that a married man could fill this position much better. I do not know that I can agree with him in this. We have had some splendid results with two girls working in these schools, in fact better than when we had a man. We have nothing in the estimates to provide for repairing the interior of this school. I note the Inspector states that a large patch of plaster has fallen off the ceiling and more is loose.\n\nThe Lake St. Martin Day School was closed at the time the Inspector made his visit, as also was the Little Saskatchewan Day School.\n\nThe Fairford Improved Day School seems to be doing good work. There is nothing in connection with this institution that requires any special attention from the Department.\n\nThe Portage la Prairie Residential School is up to its usual standard, and good work is being done. The Inspector points out that the walls are cracked in places, and the plaster is lifting from the lath, due to a leaky roof which allows the rain to penetrate. There is nothing in the estimates for repairs excepting $400.00 to repair the verandah. Part or all of this amount might be used to repair the roof, as it is more important that the roof be cared for than the verandah, if only one of the two jobs can be done.\n\nThe Pine Creek Residential School is giving splendid satisfaction, and the children are well cared for.\n\nThe Inspector reports that the classrooms in the Sandy Bay Residential School were tidy and well aired, and the children clean. The building is not in good shape, and I would hesitate to spend much money on it. In the first place the school is not in a good location in my opinion.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the report on these schools is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your No. 208-11 of the 26th ultimo, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the various schools in the Portage la Prairie and Manitowah Agencies.\n\nThese reports have been read with interest, and the Department is pleased to note that, generally speaking, these schools are showing satisfactory progress. The various matters mentioned by the Inspector as requiring attention will be dealt with in separate communications to you or taken up direct with the respective Indian Agents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These supplies should be purchased from time to time, and the teachers should see that they are properly taken care of and that there is no waste. The expenditure incurred should be kept as low as possible, and you should forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified, from time to time covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J. E. Cooper is the teacher in charge and also the United Church Missionary on the reserve. There are 19 children on the roll, 13 Indians, 3 Canadian Halfbreeds, and 3 American Indians. The average attendance for December was 15. The children appeared well along in their grades and are bright and alert. They were all well clothed and neat in appearance. A noon lunch is served, but not on such an elaborate scale as when I last visited the school.\n\nThe classroom was clean in appearance, tidy, and well ventilated. The building is in good repair and little, if any, expense will be needed for its upkeep during the coming year.\n\nIt will be noted that when the children belonging to the American Indians and Canadian Halfbreeds do not attend the school, the enrolment will only be 13. There are, however, a number of small children on the reserve reaching the age of 7 and by fall the number enrolled may be considerably enlarged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nIn your letter of October 10th, 1932, you stated that, as a midday meal was not required at the Swan Lake School, it would not be necessary to pay for the preparation of same. As you are aware, the Department has been allowing Mrs. Cooper, wife of the teacher, the sum of $15 a month less 10 percent. Owing to the reduction in our Appropriation and the fact that a midday meal is not being served, it has been decided to discontinue this payment. You should so inform Mrs. Cooper.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nIndian Springs,\nManitoba,\nNovember 25th, 1936.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nAgent, Indian Office,\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to the general circular letter of Mr. MacKenzie, re attendance at school for Indian Schools for the present school year, Day schools close on the 18th day of December for Xmas holidays. If it meets with your approval I would like to keep this school open till the 24th of Dec. I am chairman of the Carman Presbytery for this year, and duties in connection with that position will necessitate my absence for a day or so at one or two different times of the year. In this way I could get four days ahead for this purpose. I trust this request will meet with your favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJos. E. Cooper.\nMissionary Teacher.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter received from Mr. J.E. Cooper, teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School in which he asks permission to keep this school open till December 24th.\n\nWill you please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication received from Rev. J. E. Cooper, teacher of the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt is considered that this school should close on the 18th instant. All other Indian day schools will close on that date and it is not likely that, if the Swan Lake Day School is kept open, there would be a good attendance during the extra week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Department,\nDepartment of Mines,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nDuring the early part of July I had the pleasure of visiting at the home of my friend, Mr. D.F. MacKenzie, M.P. Neepawa. We talked over certain educational problems. Since then I have been thinking over the work on this Reserve and in accordance with instructions of your letter of January 16th, 1937, I beg to make the following suggestions.\n\n1. No children should be allowed to go to Portage school from this Reserve while there is room for them in this day school. Also children should attend here until a written statement has been received from the Agent transferring them to another school.\n\n2. All half-breed children living on the Reserve should attend the school on the Reserve and not be sent to Portage.\n\n3. A daily hot meal be provided in the day school (and not just for about three months) during the whole school year.\n\n4. A reasonable amount of good milk be provided daily for the school children, not canned or evaporated milk.\n\n5. Arrangements be made for the bigger girls to be taught how to prepare, cook, and serve meals. Also how and why wash dry and iron various articles used such as towels, etc.\n\n6. A janitor to look after cleaning the school and fires.\n\nI might say, that 3, 4 and 5 used to be carried out here. Mrs. C. was given a little allowance to do that work, and on the morning of every school day, some girl was given individual instruction in this kind of work. Two tons of coal were supplied for the year for this work and a number of the Indians told Mrs. C. that they were glad their girls were getting this kind of teaching.\n\nI estimate the above cost would be around $400.00 for the year and in my opinion would be well worth while.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nJos. E. Cooper,\nMissionary-Teacher,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, August 17, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Cooper:\n\nI have, for acknowledgment, your letter of the 16th instant, in which you submit, for my consideration, a number of proposals which, in your judgment, would contribute substantially to the progress of the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI may state that it is my intention to communicate with the Indian Agent for the district with respect to a number of the proposals you have submitted. Just as soon as I hear from the Agent, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJos. E. Cooper, Esq.,\nTenashap,\nSwan Lake Indian Day School,\nIndian Springs, Man.\nOttawa, August 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your consideration, a list of suggestions sent forward to the Department by the Rev. Joe E. Cooper, teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYou might, at your convenience, consider the practical value of these proposals and let me have any recommendations you may care to offer. May I direct your attention particularly to Mr. Cooper's suggestion that arrangements be made for the girls to be taught how to cook and serve meals. It might be well if you could make arrangements with the teacher to have the girls in attendance at school undertake a certain amount of this work. You might, also, consider the desirability of supplying them with yarn and material for dressmaking, etc. A number of our Indian day schools have taken up this work in recent years and have discovered that the Indian pupils are deeply interested in vocational instruction of this character.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Neey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nRe file No. 127-6-1.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo with enclosed list of suggestions sent to the Department by the Rev. J.E. Cooper, teacher at the Swan Lake Day School. I have considered the proposals set out in Mr. Cooper's letter, and beg to report as follows:\n\n1 and 2. I think Mr. Cooper's suggestion, especially in connection with the half-breed's, is unfair. There are two half-breed families on the Reserve, and the elder children in both cases have been through the Portage la Prairie Residential School. The families are named Swain and McKenny. The Swain family lives three miles from the Day School, is poorly clothed, and not fit to walk the three miles to school during the winter months. All the Swain children have been educated at the Portage la Prairie School and applications have recently been received for the admittance of the two younger children. I think that Mr. Cooper's suggestion refers especially to these children.\n\n3. A daily mid-day meal is provided in all schools in this Agency where a Day School is situated during the winter months. The cooking of this meal is done by the teacher with the assistance of the older girl pupils. The materials for the meal are purchased by the Department and the service for cooking is given without cost and with pleasure by the teacher.\n\n4. Mr. Cooper has a cow, and previous to the shipping of condensed milk with the mid-day meal supplies, used to sell milk for the meal, and this was paid by the Department. In discussions with various Medical Officers I am informed that condensed milk is purer and better for Indian children.\n\n5. No mention is made in this paragraph of knitting and sewing. Only the serving and preparing of meals and washing and drying the articles used. This is also done at other Day Schools, the necessary washing of pots and pans being done after the meal is finished, and this again without cost to the Department.\n\n6. This matter was taken up in my report of April 21st last, which was in answer to Department letter 14-127 of April 17th.\n\nIn making a general survey of all the suggestions embodied in Mr. Cooper's letter, the one fact is obvious, he is trying to augment his salary by being paid for work that other teachers do, gratis. Mr. Cooper is the best paid teacher in the Agency and does no other service but teach school.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 2)\nOther teachers cook meals for the school children and in many cases for old and destitute people, issue drugs and visit the sick. In a number of schools where a male teacher is employed the wife of the teacher takes the sewing classes without cost to the Department.\n\nI am inclined to think that Mr. Cooper has lost sight of the duties associated with a missionary resident on a Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 15, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Cooper:\n\nMay I refer to departmental letter of August 17th, in which the statement was made that the suggestions contained in your letter of August 10th had been submitted to the Indian Agent for the district for his consideration and recommendation.\n\nThe Agent, in his report to the Department, states that only the children of certain half-breed families who live a considerable distance from the day school have been sent to the Portage la Prairie institution. You may be interested to learn, in this connection, that I have a request from the Principal of the Portage la Prairie School for an additional enrolment of ten pupils. Mr. Jones expresses the opinion that at least an enrolment of 100 pupils is necessary to operate the school efficiently and economically. I make this statement as an illustration of how difficult it is to make certain adjustments that on the surface may appear comparatively simple.\n\nI feel confident you will experience no difficulty whatever in reaching an agreement with the Agent whereby the senior girls can be given a certain amount of instruction in cooking and in the serving of meals. My own opinion is that these girls should do all the work in connection with the noonday meal. I feel confident that such instruction would prove very valuable to them when they are called upon to take up household duties later. If you believe that, in addition\n\nJos. E. Cooper, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nSwan Lake Indian Day School,\nIndian Springs, Man.\naddition to this, a certain amount of instruction should be given them in Sewing, Knitting, Crochet Work, etc.; you should send in to the Agent a list of the supplies and material necessary. A number of Indian day school teachers have been supplied with this material and have discovered that their pupils are deeply interested in this particular phase of school work.\n\nA difference of opinion seems to exist with respect to the supply of milk at our schools. If the Superintendent of Medical Services was assured that cattle on reserves were free of tuberculosis and that the barns and milking utensils were kept in a sanitary condition, he would be disposed to recommend the use of fresh milk. In the absence of such assurance, however, and as a general policy, we have been recommending the use of condensed milk as a very valuable and wholesome substitute. This is a matter, however, upon which the local Agent is in a better position to pass judgment than any of the officials here. You might discuss this and your other suggestions with the Agent on his next visit to the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCame of letter received in reply to my letter asking permission to close school for the purpose of attending the Manitoba Conference in Winnipeg, in June.\n\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nManitoba,\nApril 28th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter in which you ask leave of absence to attend the Manitoba Conference of the United Church, I wish to advise that I am now in receipt of a letter from the Department granting the three days in the month of June, providing you make up the time lost. It is suggested that this time could be made up before leaving for the conference.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. J. E.

I had an opportunity of interviewing the nurse today with reference to this new outbreak, and was informed that in all probability the new infection is due to the children using the same basin for washing purposes. Apparently there are three ways of overcoming new contacts:\n\n1. To provide the children with individual wash basins.\n2. Eliminate washing of hands at midday.\n3. Disinfecting the washbasins after each child has used same.\n\nPersonally, I do not think it necessary for the children to wash at midday, as they should be clean when they enter school in the morning.\n\nIf you consider ablutions at midday necessary, then individual basins should be requisitioned for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

All the children now attending school are suffering from this disease. Your suggestion of eliminating washing hands and faces just after morning recess is a good one and with your approval I shall eliminate this exercise during the next term.\n\nThe suggestion that the new contact may be through the use of the common wash basins is, of course, possible. However may I point out that two of the new cases so far as I know, are the Swain children. Their sister Mable has been living with them for most of the fall period. Also they have been staying in the house of John Paumogan for some weeks, who has been suffering with that disease for several years. The Enosah family got their contact from Mable Swain, now Esquash, just after her return from Portage School to the Reserve.\n\nThe other case, I believe, is Isabel Cameron. Her grandfather, John Cameron has this disease, and she may have got her contact from that home as both his ENNENEN boys coming to school have it.\n\nWould it be possible for the nurse to pay more than one visit to this school a month? Could she arrive here so that she could visit the school on her arrival and again just before she left? What I do cannot be an efficient as what she does. If I were unfortunately make contact with this disease I shall expect to get all the medical help possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn E. Cooper,\nTeacher\nPortage-la-Prairie,\nManitoba,\nJanuary 9th, 1937.\n\nFile No. 7-25.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and have to advise that the ablation exercise in the school may be excluded from your syllabus during the present term. The result of this action will be noted.\n\nThe suggestion that the nurse visit the school twice a month is feasible, and an effort will be made to have this carried out.\n\nI was not able to answer the last sentence of your letter, and passed same to Mr. Inspector Hamilton whose reply is as follows:\n\n\"I do not quite understand what Mr. Cooper implies in the closing sentence of his letter. Although he is paid by the Dominion Government, he is appointed by the United Church of Canada and I presume he is at liberty to quit at any time if he feels the risk he is taking is too great. It would almost appear as though the missionary side of this appointment is entirely lost sight of. As I think we are all aware, many missionaries make even greater sacrifices and take greater risks without thought of reward or compensation. My own opinion is that Mr. Cooper cannot expect any medical attention from the Government for any ailment which he might contract while working with Indians.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. White,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. Jon. E. Cooper,\nIndian Springs,\nMan.\nSwan Lake Indian Reserve,\nIndian Springs,\nManitoba,\nOctober 15th, 1937.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 15th ultimo. May I place a few facts before you. Enclosed sheet number 1 shows the various items of provisions used for a hot lunch at this day school for each year from 1927-1928 to the present day. The total amount is estimated as I do not know the price of biscuits supplied. For the first years the prices of the other items are made from a copy of the bills paid. You will notice that in 1927-1928 the estimated value of provisions used was $264-57. This fall we started school with 24 boxes of biscuits. The Agent in 1927 told us that it had been found necessary to supply a hot mid-day lunch to the school children.\n\nA study of sheet number 1 tells its own tale, and further comment is hardly necessary. However, I would like to point out that these children who stay on the Reserve and come to school here should have as good a consideration given to them as the children who go away to Portage. I could point out many advantages that these children do enjoy, but there are some that should come through the day school.\n\nMay I point out also, in accordance with instructions received in Winnipeg Normal School, I have each year made out a list of children of school age, and I have taken an interest in their attendance. When children have not been at school, I have visited their homes and while I have found some, I have also found that some were reported sick, but were away running around the country. In this connection I have found that in trying to get them to come regularly to school, they have, i.e., the parents have resisted my enquiries. Of course all teachers are up against this kind of proposition. My actions along this line were successful during the first years, but now are not so successful. I enquire and try to persuade the parents to send their children, and it is left there, as that seems to be the only way out of the difficulty for me. Parents are able to tell me what they can do with their children.\n\nIn the question of attendance I find that the half-breed children and those of U.S. Ancestry, give the greatest amount of trouble. John McKinney, is a Canadian half-breed, and a very good worker. His children were coming very irregular although they have only a little over 1\u00bd miles to come to school. Mike Swain, a U.S. Half-breed, has given a lot of trouble. He lives a little over 2\u00bd miles from this school and a little over 1\u00bd miles from a provincial public school. His children were taken by Mr. Jones to Portage on the 31st. of August.\n\nA couple of weeks ago some of our Indians were over to Portage and were at the school. Mr. Jones told them that he had 92 children in school and could not take any more. He also\nI understand that Mr. Jones paid you a visit. I wish I had at my disposal the funds similar to his, then I could pay you a visit and put before you the claims of the children of this Reserve, who, in my opinion are not receiving anything like the help that the Portage school is getting. I think it is very unfair for any principal of a school to come on this Reserve and take children from it without talking the matter over with the resident teacher. May I point out to you that Mrs. C. and I have been on this Reserve over 10 years. We know something of human nature and we do know a little about these people here.\n\nEver since there was a school on this Reserve till 1932 there has always been a hot lunch provided for the children. As stated in my letter of the 10th of August the older girls were given instruction by Mrs. C. along that line. You also think that such instruction is invaluable. The work was done by the older girls but instruction was not given by me. The children will not work to any advantage unless there is some one older with them. I know why this mid-day lunch did not meet with the approval of Mr. Waitz.\n\nAs regards the milk supply. When we first came here we were told to spend \u00a340 per day on milk. We had considerable trouble in getting milk that satisfied us. However in January 1932, to make sure we bought a cow ourselves and supplied milk to the school. The barn is kept clean and often disinfected, the cow is government tested, I do the milking and Mrs. C. washes the milking utensils. This was done primarily so that the children could have good milk to drink. Of course secondary, the milk clause at the end of the month was welcome. We bought hay from the Indians and thus helped them. We could supply milk if necessary.\n\nI wrote to my friend Mr. F.D. MacKenzie because as a teacher he would understand. He saw you and read portions of my latter to you. Apparently you promised him that some things would be done. For example an allowance for janitors' work would be made, some ploughing would be done, and so forth. Not one thing...\nI suggested a janitor in my letter of August, I did not desire to state the reason for this. On June 9th, 1928, Mr. Christianson with Mr. Waits as the newly appointed Agent paid Treaty in the school house. After the payment, the then Clerk, Mr. Burton, (now deceased) with Mr. Christianson's instructions paid me two dollars so that I could get some Indian woman to clean the school. Of late Mr. Waits has used the school house, and it has been left in a very different state from what he got it. In the cloak rooms there were much spitting on the floor and on the school room floor there was much of tobacco remains and many used matches. I have had to clean this mess up a number of times and I object to it, but the Agent pays no attention to my objection.\n\nOn the back of school registers supplied, it states that the floors are to be frequently washed. When I started on this job, the first time the then Agent visited the school, I asked him about this. His reply was that the school floors washed every two weeks. I have carried out my instructions along that line to the best of my ability. The last time I had it cleaned was on the 19th. of June last. At the end of June I sent the original receipts to Portage Indian Office, and at the end of September I put in a bill for same. Up to the time of writing I have not received payment for this account.\n\nIn the spring the boys and I dug the ground for the potato crop. We looked after it, and at the end of March and again at the end of June I requisitioned paris green or arsenate of lime. During July I bought some at my own expense and my boy and I dusted the potato crop and thus saved it, with the result that we got more than two large barrels full of potatoes. I have not yet received any of these articles.\n\nFor a number of years I have requisitioned a buck saw. Two loads of poplar poles were delivered this last spring. We have used my buck saw till one day last week it was broken. I certainly would like it replaced and also one for the school. How can we get firewood for the school? The axe needs sharpening and is not in very good shape. I suppose my axe can be used till it gets out of commission.\n\nWe are 6\u00bd miles away from Swan Lake village. For a number of years I have been allowed to get our supply of coal for the house along with the school supply. Last year it was sent in from Portage a distance of about 70 miles with track. I was not told anything about it coming and I found myself in the position of being almost frozen in with no fuel supply. Common courtesy would seem to suggest that I should be informed that I would have to make arrangements for our supply. Then again 4 tons of the 10 tons supplied to the school were left out on the ground, some of the boys and I shovelled it into the coal bin. This year it will stay outside as far as I am concerned.\n\nI have seen that the school was warm for 9 o'clock in the morning. I have also scrubbed the toilets myself so that they could be clean and sanitary. I shall see that the fires do not go out but I feel inclined not to get up around 7 A.M. in the winter to do it and I certainly am cutting out cleaning the toilets.\n\nWill you please read sheets 2 to 9 and inform me what to do? I have a wife and boy and I certainly desire to do my best, but it appears to be more difficult each year, especially as your best efforts seem to be disparaged. Last year I looked after the equivalent of 1448 persons for trachoma and this...\nThis year 1542 persons so far.\n\nThe enclosed pictures were taken on the 10th. and 11th. of Sept. Pictures 1 and 2 are of trees on the Mission grounds that were planted on the 12th. of May 1932. Those of 3 and 4 were planted on the school grounds on the 11th. of May 1932 and are about 100 yards from those shown in pictures 1 and 2. I have asked and requisitioned for Indian help to keep these trees clean but these requests were granted and as we have not many boys we could not keep the trees clean.\n\nI hope this letter will not weary you, but I would like to see this school in better shape.\n\nMrs. C. will be glad to help the girls and I would be pleased to give the bigger boys some instruction along manual training in woodwork, but arrangements would have to be made for the other children to be either kept at work or sent home. This would mean the school would have to be supplied with at least two outfits of woodwork tools. Also some wood would be needed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJos. E. Cooper\n\nMissionary-Teacher\nOttawa, October 22, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Cooper:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant, in which you discuss a number of problems relating to your work as missionary teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI may state that immediately following the receipt of your communication I looked up the Inspector's reports on his visits to your school. These reports appear to be eminently satisfactory, and I note that Inspector Robertson refers also to the general improvement in the grounds and particularly to the tree planting programme that has been undertaken in recent years. In view of these facts, I have been wondering if you have not been attaching too much importance to a number of small problems that have arisen. In any event, I am anxious that you should make out a complete list of the equipment you feel necessary, including buck saw, axe, etc., and send this forward immediately to the Indian agent. If you do this, I feel your request will receive prompt attention.\n\nIt is my intention to discuss with certain representatives of the United Church when they visit Ottawa on November first the whole matter of residential schools and their enrolment as well as the inadvisability, or otherwise, of recruiting on Indian reserves where day schools have been established. I feel confident, from my discussions with these men in the past, we shall experience no difficulty in reaching a satisfactory agreement.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Jos. E. Cooper,\nTeacher,\nSwan Lake Indian Day School,\nIndian Springs, Man.\nOttawa, October 22, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a somewhat lengthy letter from the missionary teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School, in which he refers to a number of problems relating to his work there.\n\nI have asked Mr. Cooper to send forward to you a list of the equipment which he feels necessary to carry out a worthwhile programme of instruction at this school. He claims that a bucksaw and axe are urgently required. He also refers to a certain tree planting programme that he has carried out and intimates that he has experienced the utmost difficulty in getting Indian labour to keep these tree plots in proper condition. This is a matter that might be referred to the farm instructor on the reserve. My personal opinion is that this man has been too long in his present position and is attaching altogether too much importance to a number of comparatively trivial matters. It is my intention to discuss his case with representatives of the United Church when they visit Ottawa in the immediate future. It is altogether likely that they may consider the advisability of making a change at this school. In the meantime, however, and until a change takes place, I think we would be well advised to supply him with the equipment he claims is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nJanuary 3, 1938.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 22nd of October last I beg to advise that I have interviewed Mr. Cooper in reference to the purchase of certain carpenter tools for use in vocational training on the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Cooper's first list of equipment amounted to approximately $125.00 and this I refused to pass as I felt it was too much to expend as only one boy is of age to undertake this training. The matter was again referred to Mr. Cooper and today I am in receipt of a letter advising he can give the boy such training with his personal own tools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Inspector Lockhart's report on the Swan Lake Indian day school on November 24, 1938:\n\nAttendance -- The attendance in this school is not what it should be.

The reply to your letter has been delayed awaiting this reply which to date has not been received. The American Indians have been advised that their children will have to attend school either on the reserve or a provincial white school. They are more or less transients working out during the summer months coming back to the reserve for the winter. I would be pleased to have a ruling in their case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 8, 1939.\n\nRe - Attendance of children at Swan Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nThe children of American Indians who may be living on the Swan Lake reserve from time to time are subject to the same laws insofar as attendance at school is concerned as Canadian Indians and the law in their case should be enforced.\n\nI am not at all sure however that these American Indians have any actual rights on the reserve. It might be well if you secured definite information with respect to the number of these Indians, the length of time they have resided on the Swan Lake reserve and the names of the reserves to which they may be nominally attached in the United States. The whole question should then be submitted to the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts for a ruling. In the meantime and until such a ruling is received by you, their children should be encouraged to attend school regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nEXD\n\nOttawa, November 4, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nThe records here indicate that the attendance at the Swan Lake Indian Day School is in no sense satisfactory. This attendance has been irregular and somewhat unsatisfactory for two or three years. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, however, a sincere attempt is being made by the Department to encourage more regular attendance at our Indian day schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to take a personal interest in this matter and interview the Principal of the Portage la Prairie Residential School in respect to conditions on the Swan Lake reserve. The Principal of the Portage School, Mr. Jones, is constantly requesting an increase in pupilage at the Portage institution, while the records here indicate that he has at least 31 pupils enrolled at his school from the Swan Lake reserve. In other words, he is asking for an additional pupilage while the Swan Lake school is experiencing the utmost difficulty in securing a satisfactory attendance of pupils. It has occurred to me that it might be possible for the Principal at Portage la Prairie to return to the reserve a half dozen or so pupils who come from Indian homes where conditions are reasonably satisfactory. This matter has been discussed very fully with a representative of the United Church; the church authorities feel that some adjustment should be possible between the Principal of the Portage school and the teacher in charge of the Indian school at Swan Lake. There is not even a remote possibility that we can increase the pupilage at Portage la Prairie at any time in the immediate future, nor is there in my judgment a remote possibility that we shall have funds sufficient to buy the Principal at Portage la Prairie the additional lands that he has been anxious to secure during the last year or two.\n\nYou might, at your convenience, discuss this matter with the parties concerned and with Indian Agent Waite and let me have any recommendations you may care to send forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 2)\nThe presbytery of Carman appointed a Commission to investigate conditions on the Indian Springs Reserve in so far as these conditions affected our Missionary and his work there.\n\nAt our September meeting the commission reported and the report was left in the hands of the executive which was charged with the responsibility of putting it in shape and of forwarding the resolutions arising out of the report to the proper authorities.\n\nI am therefore forwarding to you the following resolutions:\n\n(1) \"That whereas we find that the School Attendance Act is not being enforced on the Indian Springs reserve to the extent that in our judgment it should (out of a possible attendance of 29, there is an average attendance of eleven) we respectfully suggest that more definite action be taken by your department to ensure a fuller compliance with the Indian Act regarding school attendance. We further suggest that the attendance enforcement officer should be in much closer touch with the school than it is possible for the R.C.M.P., who lives thirty miles distant, to be.\n\n(2) That whereas we find that Trachoma and other diseases are prevalent on the Reserve and whereas we know that one lad living in the Floral School District contracted Trachoma as a result of coming in contact with children from the Reserve and whereas we understand that the inspection of the school by a Medical Officer has been discontinued, we suggest that medical inspection be restored and that action be taken to safeguard the white people living adjacent to the Reserve from the ravages of these diseases.\n\n(3) That whereas we understand that many of the children on the Reserve are undernourished and whereas we know that the serving of a hot lunch at noon has been discontinued, we suggest that your Department should serve a hot noon-day lunch in the school and thus bridge the gap between the treatment of children in the residential schools and those in the day schools.\"\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of Carman Presbytery.\nOttawa, November 9, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. STONE:\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend William Reid, Secretary of the Carman Presbytery of the United Church of Canada.\n\nI am today communicating with Inspector Hamilton and asking him to thoroughly investigate the matters referred to in resolutions 1 and 3. It is just possible that you may want the Inspector to report on the subject matter of resolution No. 2. I have also communicated with Mr. Reid and acknowledged receipt of the letter.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nare not as a rule equipped to serve such meals, but I do believe that a lunch is advantageous and should be provided. We have discovered also that where a noonday meal is provided the teacher or the wife of the teacher usually requests additional remuneration for cooking this meal and the Treasury Regulations now in force do not permit such payments to Indian day school teachers or to the wives of such teachers.\n\nFor some reason or other that I find it difficult to explain, there has been lack of cooperation on the part of our officials with the teacher in charge of the Indian Springs school. Just who is to blame, I am not in a position to state. I have felt for some time, however, that Mr. Cooper, in view of his academic standing and the experience he has had, might render better service at another school and on a different reserve. However, in view of the fact that his classroom work is satisfactory to the Department, a recommendation for any change would have to come from the church authorities.\n\nThe Principal of the Portage la Prairie school has been recruiting on this reserve for a number of years. I am not sure that it is wise to continue this recruiting. This is a matter, however, that will be thoroughly investigated by Inspector Hamilton, who will discuss the question in detail with Mr. Jones.\n\nI am referring the resolution relating to Trachoma to Dr. Stone, Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 9, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Reid:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, three resolutions arising out of an investigation undertaken by a Commission appointed by the Carman Presbytery of the United Church of Canada, into conditions on the Indian Springs reserve.\n\nI may state that prior to the receipt of your communication I discussed the subject matter of these resolutions very fully and in detail with the Reverend Dr. Dorey, who visited my office a week or so ago. On November 4 I wrote to Inspector A. G. Hamilton, asking him to make a personal investigation of conditions on this particular reserve and report to the Department. I am today communicating with him again in respect to this matter.\n\nThere is nothing on file here to indicate that the noonday lunch was discontinued at the Indian Springs day school. The Indian Agent, who resides at Portage la Prairie, was authorized to purchase supplies for noonday lunches at the schools in his agency, to an amount equal to that allowed last year. We have been attempting, as a matter of general policy, to limit somewhat these noonday lunches. We have learned from experience that the preparation of a full meal, the washing of the dishes and the adjustments necessary in the classroom take up an amount of time that can scarcely be justified. In other words, we would be better advised to make a relief allowance to Indian parents and have them serve these meals in the Indian homes.

These resolutions, you will note, relate to certain conditions on the Indian Springs reserve, referred to by me in my letter to you of November 4.\n\nI had learned from a number of sources during the last year or two that conditions on this particular reserve were growing gradually worse. I was not at all surprised, therefore, when I received these resolutions. I am anxious that you should make a thorough investigation of the matters referred to and report fully to the Department. It is my understanding that a noonday lunch is provided for at this school. I am anxious to know if in your judgment this lunch should be extended into a full noonday meal. The time spent in the preparation of such a meal at a number of our schools scarcely justifies the multiplication of such meals unless conditions on the reserve demand such action. It might be better for us as a relief measure to provide meals for the children at their homes.\n\nI am referring the resolution relating to Trachoma to Dr. Stone. He will in all probability communicate with you with respect to the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. A. G.

I spent Nov. 21st in this school examining the work of the students and the teaching methods of Mr. J. E. Cooper, M.A., B.D. This is Mr. Cooper's thirteenth year on this reserve. During this time he has served the Reserve well and faithfully but it would appear that during the last year or so some misunderstanding has arisen between him and the Church Officials. In late October of this year a Commission was appointed by the Church to investigate all matters pertaining to the church. Mr. Cooper was kind enough to allow me to see a copy of this report. I think the report is a very comprehensive one and very fair in every respect. Mr. Cooper told me last year that he would like to be transferred to a new field and from what I was able to observe and from what he told me it is my opinion that this might be in the best interests of all concerned. I certainly think that this matter should receive the attention of the proper authorities before the close of the next school term. There are a number of factors which enter into this case and which do not concern me as an Inspector of Schools but as I have previously mentioned I feel that it would be in the best interests of everyone if a change were made.\n\n(over)\n\nN.B.\u2014ONE FORM TO BE USED FOR EACH CLASSROOM TEACHER.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 2)\nThe students of this Reserve are not attending school in the way that they should and evidently no pressure is brought to bear upon them to do so. You will note that the enrolment speaks for itself and I might refer you to my report of last year which gives some indication of the attendance. I have singled out for this report two examples, such as that of student Mimir Tukumum, born 1925, attended school for the first time in 1932 and has attended a total of 32 days up to and including Nov. 21/39.\n\nAlso the case of her sister Dorothy Tukumum, born 1929, attended school in 1936 and has a grand total of 27 days up to and including Nov. 21/39.\n\nThere is also a student born 1932 who has not attended and a Walker family of five, ranging between the ages of 7 and 15, not attending school at all.\n\nMr. Cooper states that when he first took over this school, a number of years ago, he received a larger allowance to provide food and clothing and, of course, this was an attraction in itself to attend more regularly. Since the early days this has been reduced to practically nothing and at the present Mr. Cooper is trying to get by by serving them one light, warm lunch which consists of a bowl of soup and a couple of biscuits.\n\nMr. Cooper has another complaint to make and that is that the pupils are not getting the medical attention they deserve. Trachoma is very prevalent on this Reserve and there are few families, if any, not affected by this dread disease. This is also a matter which I feel deserves the immediate attention of the authorities.\n\nGROUNDS.\n\nComparing pictures taken then and now, one would not recognize the grounds today from that of 12 years ago. Mr. Cooper has worked wonders in planting trees, shrubs and grasses. The fences and playground equipment are in very good shape.\n\nBUILDINGS.\n\nThe outside buildings have received attention prior to the opening of school for this term and there is no criticism to be levied in this regard.\n\nFLAG.\n\nThe flag is in good shape but requires a new rope. This needs immediate repair.\n\nROOM EQUIPMENT.\n\nThe library, Geography equipment, Music (Organ) and general supplies are very good. This year, I am sorry to say, I must report that there is no fire extinguisher or any kind.\n\nSCHOOL HOUSE.\n\nThe school was redecorated last year. The exterior was painted during the summer of 1938 and the interior was redecorated during the Christmas Vacation. The seating, heating, lighting and ventilation is very good. The blackboards are the same as last year and range from good to poor. One piece of board will soon have to be replaced. The basement is very neat and tidy and it is here that the lunch is served and wood-working classes held. The students did not make as much progress in this particular field of work as they might have done. It is my opinion that in all these schools they should be given the opportunity to turn as much with their hands as possible. In the general classroom work I have found all the note books of the students very neat. Mr. Cooper does not allow them to keep many scribblers as he believes this to be in their own advantage due to the amount of Trachoma. The number work, writing and spelling is good, the reading fair. From my report you will note that the students are not graded higher than Grade V but I found one doing writing, spelling and some composition equivalent to Grade VII or VIII standing. The teaching of history, grammar, and geography seems to be a difficult matter.\nI might add here that if a change is made in the teacher of this school this year an effort should be made to engage a good Primary teacher.\n\nIn closing I would like to pay a special compliment to Mrs. Cooper for the work that she has done in the interests of the girls of the Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nWSL/GS\nOttawa, December 4, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a report on the Swan Lake Indian Day School, submitted to the Department by Inspector Lockhart.\n\nIn view of the trouble that has arisen at Swan Lake, it occurred to me that you would be interested in this report.\n\nYou will note the Inspector's reference to a fire extinguisher. You might let me have your opinion with respect to the desirability of supplying Indian day schools with fire extinguishers, particularly schools with a teacher's residence attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n588 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, December 4, 1939.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a report on the Swan Lake Indian Day School, submitted to the Department by Inspector W. S. Lockhart. It occurred to me that in view of the existing conditions on the Swan Lake reserve you would be interested in this report.\n\nI have discussed with Dr. Stone the desirability of taking immediate steps to improve the medical services on the reserve, and I feel confident that steps will be taken to improve this service in the very near future. It is Dr. Stone's intention to have Dr. Wall, the trachoma specialist, visit this reserve just as soon as he can conveniently do so.\n\nI have never been able to convince myself that Mr. Cooper is responsible for all the ills from which the Indians appear to be suffering at Swan Lake, but I do think that it would be in the interests of all parties concerned to have a change of teacher at the school. In my humble judgment 13 years is altogether too long a period for a teacher to remain in charge of a school on an Indian reserve. The average teacher simply cannot hold the esteem of the Indians for this lengthy period of time.\n\nMay I direct your attention particularly to the suggestion made by the Inspector in the penultimate paragraph of his report. I feel confident that if this suggestion were adopted it would result not only in better attendance but also in greater progress generally at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West, Toronto, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 127-6-1, dated November 9th and to report that in company with Agent Waite, I investigated the complaints registered by the Carman Presbytery and would report on each resolution as follows:\n\n1. The roll calls for 24 pupils. There are 5 children living over 2 miles from school. One child, Alexander Esquash, age 9, has enlarged glands and is in poor health. These facts naturally affect the attendance as often the Indian children have not the warm clothing required. Then again there are 7 children from American parents, 3 of which have not yet attended this term. These Indians live on the Reserve but are not members of the Band. Does section 10 of the Indian Act apply to the American children? I am of the opinion they should abide by the regulations or move off the Reserve. The balance of the children enrolled attend fairly well. Children who must continually be compelled to attend school, I fear, will make little progress. I am sure if the school life, and lessons, were made more attractive we would have less trouble.\n\n2. This paragraph is somewhat misleading. Mr. Cooper explains that when he first took charge here the local doctor examined all school children in September and again in June. This practice has been discontinued. However we now have a nurse who visits the reserve quite often and new cases without spending some time at the school and especially attending to all the trachoma cases. We have a good medical officer and he comes to the Reserve when required. Dr. Wall has visited here and, I believe, intends doing so again this fall. In my opinion, these people receive good medical supervision.\n\n3. The following food is supplied for a noon meal: Barley, rice, beans, oatmeal, 1 bushel of onions, 1 bushel of potatoes, cocoa, canned milk, biscuits and meat for boiling. This can be prepared in the school basement and cooked on the school range, if the teacher so desires. I am not at present prepared\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nto recommend more supplies. This meal is usually provided from November 1st until March 31st or until the supplies are exhausted.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I believe the Presbytery investigation was brought about by Mr. Cooper who, in my opinion, is disgruntled and dissatisfied, perhaps not without cause, yet as the result of the following accumulated circumstances. He points out that 14 years ago when he took charge, he received from the Department, in addition to his salary, two tons of coal which was used in his home for cooking the children's noon meal. His wife received $15.00 per month for her trouble. He also sold milk to the Department for the children at 5\u00a2 per quart, from his cows which pastured on the Reserve. These extras have, in my opinion, rightly been discontinued. The noon meal can be cooked in the school basement on our own range. Teachers all across Manitoba do this work free and express delight and appreciation when food is supplied. In addition to all these changes, Mr. Cooper states that at first he received, from the Church, $700.00 per year plus his house. Now he receives $50.00 per year and house\u2014certainly a drastic reduction.\n\nMr. Cooper stated he had written the Church officials stating that he feels his period of usefulness, at this point, has expired and he would like to be transferred to some other place. I think Mr. Cooper is quite sincere but, as pointed out above, circumstances have made him dissatisfied and, in my opinion, a dissatisfied man cannot render efficient service. I think, for all concerned, the Church would be well advised to favorably consider Mr. Cooper's request for a change to take effect June 30th, 1940.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

W. Ebbert to the Swan Lake Indian Day School for the academic year 1940-41.\n\nOur information is that Mr. Cooper has been advised by the Superintendent of Missions and the Home Mission Convener for his Presbytery that his services will not be required at the end of the present month. Dr. Dorey is now at the Conference in Winnipeg and will, I am sure, have seen to it that proper notification has been given to Mr. Cooper.\n\nIn our correspondence with Mr. Ebbert, we told him that his salary from the Government would be at the same rate as that paid Mr. Cooper, namely, $110.00 per teaching month. Now I note that you say his salary will be at the rate of $90.00 a teaching month. Mr. Ebbert has given up a very good position as principal of a village school at a higher rate of salary than even $110.00 a month for nine months, and it does not seem to me that it is fair at this stage to cut the remuneration by $20.00 a month, without giving us any previous notice of such a reduction. I rather think that the figure of $90.00 in your letter must have been a mistake.\n\nWill you please let me know just what the situation is, because, if the reduction stands, it is possible that Mr. Ebbert may not accept the position, and at this date we may have difficulty in getting another or as good a man.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-1, part 2)\nOttawa, June 11, 1940.\n\nRe: Swan Lake Indian Day School\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant, in which you express surprise that the salary rate allowed by the Department for the teacher recently nominated by you at the above noted school is lower than that allowed Mr. Cooper.\n\nI may state quite frankly that in response to instructions received from the office of the Minister we have just completed a very thorough review of the salaries paid at Indian day schools throughout the Dominion. In the course of that review I found it somewhat difficult to understand why we ever paid Mr. Cooper at the rate of $110 per month. This salary is more than double the amount paid the average one-room rural public school in the province of Manitoba. The Swan Lake school at this date has an enrolment of 11 and an average attendance of 8. In addition to the salary, it is my understanding that a house for the teacher has been provided by the Church. I note that the Principal of the Swan Lake Public School, which in addition to public school work provides high school courses, receives a salary of $1,000 per annum. A great many of the high schools, I note from the last report of the Manitoba Department of Education, receive substantially less than $1,000 per annum. These facts, I should add, are constantly being brought to the attention -\n\nReverend R. B. Cochrane, D.D.,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nattention of the Minister, in a period when the Government is putting forth every effort to secure the funds necessary for the conduct of the war.\n\nIn view of your representations, however, and in view of our anxiousness to secure a first-class teacher for this school, it is my intention to recommend that Mr. Ebbert - should he accept the position - be paid at the rate of $100 a teaching month. It is my hope that this salary rate will be acceptable to you. It is positively the best I can do, in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJune 13th, 1940.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have your letter of June 11th, in which you say that, in view of our representations in regard to salary, you will recommend that Mr. Ebbert be paid at the rate of $100.00 a month. While, of course, this is better than the $80.00 a month previously suggested, it does not meet the situation. What bothers me is that the Government and the Department feel free to make changes, not only in the amounts paid for salaries of the day school teachers, but in the per capita grants to the Indian Residential schools, without any consultation at all with the Church.\n\nAs I understand it, the Churches and the Government carry on this educational work together - at least so far as the residential schools are concerned - on the basis of an agreement adopted some years ago. We nominate teachers after we have told them what the salary paid by the Government is. They are willing to accept on these terms. Then, like a bolt from the blue, we hear from the Department that a change has been made in the salary. It seems to me that even in war time, an agreement is an agreement, and before it can be changed, both parties should be consulted and should be satisfied. While we recognize the financial difficulties faced by your Department, the Board of Home Missions of the United Church has financial difficulties too, and it seems to me that it is hardly treating us fairly to make arbitrary changes in amounts previously granted by a mere notice, such as has been given. It does not seem that the Churches, which put very large amounts into Indian education, have received quite the consideration which they deserve.\n\nI want to be quite frank in letting you know how we feel about the way in which these reductions have been made. You will doubtless hear from the representatives of all the Churches later on.\n\nI should like to add that we are grateful for the extra $10.00 a month for the Swan Lake School.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nHBC.MLT\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. Lockhart.\n\nI was disturbed to learn that there were only five pupils in attendance at this school at the time of the Inspector's visit. You can readily understand that it is not the policy or intention of the Department, in a critical period such as the one in which we find ourselves, to keep schools open and in operation with an attendance of five Indian pupils. As a matter of fact, we have refused to open a number of seasonal schools in the outlying districts of the Dominion, for the simple reason that the enrolment, in our judgment, did not justify us in operating such schools during the war period. I should add, however, that at several of these schools the enrolment was higher than it appears to be at Swan Lake.\n\nIt was my understanding last year that what was needed at Swan Lake was a change of teachers and the representatives of the United Church were disposed to agree with me. Consequently, Mr. Cooper was transferred to another appointment and Mr. T. W. Ebbern, B.A., was appointed to take charge at Swan Lake. Mr. Ebbern is paid salary from this Department at the rate of $100 per month and is, no doubt, made an allowance by the Home Mission Board of the United Church.

You should also discuss the matter quite frankly with the teacher. The Inspector is of the opinion that the present teacher has had little experience in primary work and that an attempt should be made to secure a good primary teacher. I should like to learn from you, also, the number of pupils from the Swan Lake Reserve at present enrolled at the Portage School and if, in your judgment, it is necessary to send such pupils to Portage for their education.\n\nA full report on conditions at the Swan Lake Reserve will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

In a letter dated January 4 which has just been received he advises that the instructions contained in your report will be carried out.\n\nApplications for the admission of the two children of Harry Soldier were forwarded to the Department yesterday and their admission to the Portage la Prairie School has been approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter 127-6-1, dated January 8, and note that my recommendations 2 and 3 in my report of December 23rd, have been passed on to Agent Waite.\n\nIt seems to me that recommendation No. 1 is equally as important. We all wanted to know just how far we could go in forcing attendance of the half-breed and American Indians, resident on the reserve. Is it advisable to take the same stand as in dealing with treaty Indians, and would such a stand be approved by the Department? Until this question is settled I doubt if the attendance at this school will be greatly improved.\n\nIn Department letter 127-1-10 dated January 18, all the names submitted are, I believe, either half-breeds or American Indians. A ruling concerning these people will give some grounds on which to start a real campaign for better attendance.\n\nI would be pleased to hear further concerning this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa, January 29, 1941.\n\nRe: Attendance at Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you seek information with respect to certain so-called American Indians and half-breeds, residents of the Swan Lake Indian Reserve.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Department explained rather fully the position of American Indians resident on Canadian reserves, in a letter to Indian Agent Waite dated February 8, 1939. There is nothing on file, however, to indicate that the Indian Agent replied to that particular letter. American Indians living on the Swan Lake Reserve are subject to all the laws and regulations governing Canadian Indians. In a strictly legal sense we cannot exercise the same authority with respect to half-breeds. However, my personal opinion is that these half-breed children should be compelled to attend school regularly or be expelled from the reserve. The whole matter of half-breed children living on the Swan Lake Reserve is one that might very well be discussed with the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts.\n\nIt would appear that we have at this date a large number of Canadian Indians living in the United States. This is particularly true of American territory immediately south of the province of Alberta. These Canadian Indians have never been denied access to the United States and have enjoyed over a period of years the right to attend American educational institutions. The privilege of attending an educational institution in the United States is also extended to Canadian Indians such as the Indians of the Caughnawaga Reserve, who visit the United States periodically and who, it would appear, live in that country for periods of two or three months each year. This is a somewhat delicate matter and you can readily understand how important it is that we should extend to the few American Indians living in this country all the rights and privileges extended to our own Indians. Should the number of American Indians in Canada increase substantially at any time, it is not possible the whole matter might have to be reviewed in the light of such an event. In the meantime, however, you should inform Indian Agent Waite that American Indians on the Swan Lake Reserve are subject to the same rules and regulations as the ordinary residents.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nresidents on the reserve.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated here if we could have a report from the Indian Agent, in the course of a month or so, indicating to what extent, if any, the attendance at the Swan Lake Indian Day School has been improved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nFebruary 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: 208-11\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the Swan Lake Indian Day School, and wish to report that I visited the Swan Lake Reserve and school on the 13th and 14th; all houses on the reserve were visited.\n\nThe register at the school shows 17 pupils, of these 13 were at school. The average attendance since January is 12. Of the 17 on the register, James and Mary Soldier were approved for admittance to Portage School by Department letter dated January 7th. I have advised the teacher to delete these names from his register. The two other children, Emma McKenny, daughter of John McKenny, half-breed, has a bad attack of Empetigo, so has Wm. McKenny, Treaty Indian boy. Neither of these children are fit to attend school.\n\nThe following is a report on the children of Frank Walker, American Indian.\n\nFlorence Walker. This girl is living with Caroline Martin, No. 108. This girl is approximately 13 years of age and appears mental. However, I had her taken to the school for the teacher's opinion and his opinion is the same as mine. He is doubtful if she is capable of learning. She also has a speech impediment.\n\nThomas Walker. This boy will commence school on Monday (17th.)\n\nBertha and Elizabeth Walker. These two girls are in the neighborhood of 8 and 10 years respectively. They have very little in the way of clothing and I would not take the responsibility of insisting on them going to school. The matter was brought to the attention of the teacher, but he is doubtful if he will be able to assist in the way of clothing as most of the clothing furnished by the Mission Board has been given out. The above children are Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Joe Walker family which includes the One-side girls were not on the reserve. One or two One-side girls are in the United States. I could not get definite information of their return.\n\nLeon Cuntois is living with Madose and will commence school on the 17th. Vina Swain, Canadian half-breed will also commence school on the 17th. Betty McKenny, daughter of John McKenny, half-breed will attend school as soon as her face and head is free of Empetigo.\n\nOf the Indians who should attend school, Winnie\nTukendum is 16 years of age, but a younger girl, recently returned from hospital, Emma, will commence school on the 17th. Her face is improved, but not better.\n\nJohn Hobson is a discharged pupil of Portage School, 16 years of age and cannot be forced to attend day school.\n\nFrancis Esquash, 7 years, is delicate, not fit to walk the one mile to school. She will commence attending in the spring.\n\nLily Daniels, 7 years, and Dorothy Ahehey, 8 years are now in attendance. Jean Scott, 8 years is also attending.\n\nThere is another half-breed boy, 14 years, George McKenny, son of John McKenny. This boy is the only help McKenny has. The man is down with Rheumatism. I have asked for help from the Provincial Government and if this is forthcoming, the boy will attend school.\n\nI also wish to refer to Department letter 127-1-19, of January 19th which quoted from Mr. Jones letter addressed to the Department. As you will observe, all the children mentioned are American Indians and Canadian half-breeds. Mr. Jones took these children from the Swan Lake Reserve knowing that they were not treaty Indians and Roman Catholic. The children were never admitted to the school as grant earning pupils.\n\nI expect to again visit the Swan Lake Reserve towards the latter part of this month and will report further on the attendance at the school when I return.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I\nshould add, however, that the attendance at a large\nnumber of our Indian day schools throughout the\nDominion was very unsatisfactory last fall. When\nInspector Lockhart visited the Indian Springs Day\nSchool on November 8, 1940, there were only 5 pupils\nin attendance. We communicated with Inspector\nHamilton at that time and reminded him that it was\nnot the intention of the Department, in a critical\nperiod such as the one through which we are passing,\nto keep Indian day schools open and in operation when\nthe average attendance did not exceed 5 pupils.

A hot lunch of soup is prepared and served by Mrs. Shellenberg. Next year the teacher plans a school garden so that vegetables will be available for the children's meal.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Schallenberg is the teacher in charge. There are twenty-six pupils enrolled and twenty-two were present; with an average of twenty.\n\nThe pupils were well dressed and clean. They appeared to understand their work and most of them speak out quite loud when reading.\n\nThe school garden was a real success. The work of planting the seeds, hoeing and taking up the vegetables was all done by the children. The vegetables were stored in the basement of the teacher's residence. The quantities of vegetables stored are as follows: 20 bus. of potatoes, 30 bus. of carrots, 50 bus. of turnips, 1 bag of onions, and 20 lbs. of beans. These vegetables will be used to give the children a good noon meal all through the winter. The girls prepare the vegetables and lunch is served in the school basement.\n\nThe school building is in good repair and the yard was tidy.\n\nMr. Schallenberg appears greatly interested in his work. He has a good way with children and they appear to enjoy their work. There is a marked improvement in attendance since Mr. Schallenberg took charge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nDecember 24, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Schellenberg:\n\nI am in receipt of a report on your school from Mr. W.S. Lockhart, Public School Inspector, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I made my official visit to this school (Swan Lake Indian Day School) on November 6. I am very pleased to report that the progress referred to in my report of last year has been more than maintained. There are at present 25 students enrolled and 24 were present on the day of my visit, the one absentee being ill.\n\n\"It was my opinion last year that Mr. Schellenberg was the type of teacher that this school required and, after seeing what he has accomplished during the past year, I am more than convinced that he is the right man in the right place. I also understand that the attendance from the reserve at his church service is also being maintained. In addition to this he has attempted some changes and improvements on the reserve and has met with hearty co-operation from the Indians.\"\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that the receipt of this report was very encouraging to the officials here and to myself. I am particularly pleased to compliment you on these results when I remember that the results at this particular school for a period of years were in no sense satisfactory. It is scarcely necessary to add that anything we can do to assist you from here will be done gladly and without hesitation.\n\nMay I express the hope that the year ahead of us may be for all of us a year of opportunity and a year of accomplishment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. H.S.

Then high wind swept them clear and there is some blowing of topsoils. Practically all surplus grains have now been hauled to elevators and sufficient seed if retained for the 1946 crop acreage. All rentals are now completed as far as the Department share of crop is concerned, and all leases have been checked are found still in force. One Indian, a returned veteran, would like to take over Indian Garden Reserve and farm both quarters, now rented to Buxton and Metcalfe for another year, February 1947, and farm it with the help of a loan under the Veterans' Land Act, given recently to Indians. A separate report will be forwarded to the Department on this matter as soon as the feelings concerning this matter have been ascertained. There does not appear to be any active opposition at the present time. Two veterans will be making application for the V.L.A. loan in the near future. Both will farm on the Swan Lake Reserve. The snow of November 9th and 10th stopped all work on the land. This snow came very early, soon after the completion of threshing and little or no fall plowing was accomplished. This leaves a lot of spring plowing to be done for coarse grain crops. Still plenty of potatoes among certain Bands. There are approximately 300 bushels pitted in the open at Lake St. Martin reserve. The pit is well covered, placed so that it is also well covered with snow. It is also satisfactorily ventilated. The root cellar, erected at Swan Lake Reserve has proved quite satisfactory and the children are getting a meal of vegetables every school day with bean, corn and pea soup. Considerable corn and tomatoes were canned by the children, under the direction of the teacher's wife. These provided a real meal during the months of November and December. The beans and peas were threshed by the pupils by tramping methods on a canvas floor. Raw carrots are given daily and much appreciated by the children, without authority from the Department I allowed this school a quantity of wood for summer firing, $15.00, as it is intended to supply the children with a hot meal during the spring and summer months. Results of a similar nature could be initiated at other Day Schools where married couples are installed. The single school-teacher is satisfied just to teach school.\n\nJ.

The class-room was tidy.\n\nThis year the pupils had a good school garden. The vegetables are stored in a cellar adjoining the basement and are used for the noon lunch. They have a good supply of potatoes, turnips, carrots, and onions. The garden certainly has proven worth while, and no doubt, required close supervision by the late Mr. Schellenberg.\n\nThe school and outbuildings were painted last summer and present a good appearance.\n\nThe attendance is good and the pupils appear to enjoy their school work.\n\nE&D.\n\nA.O.

Schellenberg who is in charge of your Indian school there. She attends our secondary school, taking Grade XII, and since she does not live in our School District she is classified as a Non-Resident student. In Manitoba the provision is that the Provincial Legislature pays a grant of 20 cents and the Municipality from which the student comes, a grant of 10 cents per day of such pupil's attendance.\n\nWe are informed that this Reserve does not belong to any municipality. Would you be willing to pay 10 cents per day for this girl? Her attendance from Sept. 1, to Dec. 23 of 1946 was 74 days. The amount payable would therefore be $7.40.\n\nFor your information we may say that we are receiving this grant from municipalities for other Non-Resident students.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSec.-Treas.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Smith, teacher at the above noted school, should be at the rate of $112.00 a month.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nSwan Lake Indian Day School\nInspector's Report.\n\nWe have now received the inspection report as submitted by Mr. Leckhart after his visit to the above Indian Day School on November 6. Under the heading \"General Comments\" he makes the following remarks:\n\n\"I made my official visit to Swan Lake Indian Day School on the above date. After Mr. Schellenberg's death last year, just after the opening of the fall term, Mrs. Schellenberg carried on for the balance of the year. Mrs. Schellenberg had no teaching experience whatever and I can see that the school slipped back considerably. Mrs. Schellenberg's chief contribution to the school, previous to assuming the teaching responsibility, was to teach the girls to sew and cook. She had them prepare and serve hot school lunches and in this respect she accomplished a great deal.\n\n\"I doubt very much that Mr. Smith is any too happy in this position. He is a bachelor, with no car, and finds living conditions rather lonely. This is an ideal set-up for a married couple. The residence and grounds are in good shape with a wonderful garden, fruit trees, etc. Mr. Schellenberg liked this type of work and he carried on a number of experiments in conjunction with Mr. Leslie, Superintendent of the Morden Experimental Farm. As Mr. Smith is...\"\nnot interested in this particular type of work I am of\nthe opinion that the garden and grounds will not receive\nvery much attention.\n\n\"School Garden - \"This has slipped badly. In previous years\nwhere the root-house and cellar was stored with potatoes,\ncarrots, turnips, onions and ripe beans, this year there are\nonly potatoes. The garden had been stripped by the time\nMr. Smith arrived on the scene. As a result the hot noon-\nday meal will suffer accordingly. Previously a hot meal was\nbeing served by this time of year, but as yet no effort has\nbeen made to carry out this project.\n\n\"Handicraft - \"I doubt very much will be accomplished in this\ndepartment. Mr. Smith is not very handy with tools but feels\nthat he can achieve the same ends through athletics. I doubt\nthis very much but there is very little that can be done\nabout this at present.\n\n\"School Work - \"I have already intimated that the standard of\nthe school has slipped during the past year. I also recommended\nthat certain work books should be supplied but evidently these\nhad not been requisitioned. Mr. Smith informs me that he now\nhas a requisition in for work books covering all his grades\nI - VI. These should prove to be of great help once they\narrive.\n\n\"In summing up this report I would say that the\ndiscipline, manner, attitude and response of the students appears\nto be fairly satisfactory although a good deal of hard work\nwill have to be done to bring the school up to the standard of\na year or so ago. I doubt very much if Mr. Smith, working by\nhimself, can accomplish these results.\n\n\"I made inquiry about the school bulletins\nwhich are being sent out regularly and these were all in\ngood order.\"\n\nThe Inspector has also recommended that a new\nflag be supplied and this has been sent to Mr. Smith. He has\nalso recommended that a fence be placed around the school garden. Would you please keep this in mind for next year and obtain an estimate as to how much this will cost, so that we can have this work carried out in the early spring.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 27, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Lockhart:\n\nWe have received your inspection report of November 6 upon the Swan Lake Indian Day School. I am sorry to note that the school slipped somewhat during the period Mrs. Schollberg taught there. Mr. Smith did quite well at Pekangokwa, which is in an even more isolated situation than Swan Lake. We will hasten to fill his requisition for workbooks and textbooks which he has requested. We have also mailed a flag to him, as one had apparently not previously been requested.\n\nWith regard to the fence, we decided to proceed with the work required in the interior and exterior of the school and to supply the fence next year. We spent over $300.00 in carrying out general repairs to the school and also supplied a sewing machine and general miscellaneous articles at a cost of about $150.00.\n\nI have written to Mr. Waite concerning the comments which you make about the school garden, school work, etc., and have asked him to pay special attention to these items during his future visits to this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. S. Lockhart, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nBaldua, Manitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The children might even benefit by the joint handling of the school programme.\n\nMy attempt at an inspection did not, however, materialize, at this time as Mr. Supt. Hamilton was not available to make the trip. I did, however, get word to Dr. Best of the United Church Missions, and I understand that he has visited the school and made some suggestions calculated to make its operation more agreeable to the Indians whom it serves.\n\n(sgd) C.A.F.

He appeared very indifferent and showed no real interest. I think my past feelings now are quite justified. Apparently he made his own arrangements for Mrs. Reynolds to teach and then went off and took on jobs of painting. I strongly recommend the Church be requested to appoint a qualified teacher and with as little delay as possible. A male teacher with several years experience could best fill the requirements.\nOctober 19, 1949.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has you listed officially as teacher at the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that there have been several days on which you have been absent from your teaching duties and on which your wife has been doing the instructing.\n\nI have examined your monthly day school report forms and have found that you have given no indication of these absences.

Edmison, M.A.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nToday my cheque for Sept. quarter arrived, that is, the grant from the Indian Department. There has evidently been some mistake made in filling out the amount. The cheque calls for only $78.34, one month's salary instead of three. My grant is $900. per year from that source, ($225. per quarter,) and the regulations state that when a teacher is on steadily as I am no deduction is made for summer holidays. They have never deducted salary for July and August heretofore, and it is simply an error this time.\n\nFurther July was not a holiday for me, I spent it, at the request of the Indian Dept. studying latest in teaching methods at Winnipeg and my salary from the Dept. is now $950. per year, from Sept. 1st/23. But the increase was to cover cost of the course and as they advanced me $50. the increase will not be shown on the cheque until next Sept. Time taken off during Assembly was made up in August by opening before the usual time, so you see my holidays were really cut down to two weeks.\n\nPlease draw their attention to the mistake in salary for July, August and September and it will no doubt be rectified at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.)

Ferrier, Esq., M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your communication of the lst. inst. re 10% reduction of salary to start with the lst. of this month. According to press reports the Premier has stated that the superannuation assessments of civil servants receiving a salary of less than $1000 yearly, will be paid by the Treasury. May I ask if my superannuation assessment will be met also? I am paying 5% also to the minister's superannuation fund and as one part of the scheme is applied to my salary should not the other part apply also?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 544-3, part 1)\nOttawa, May 2, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Cooper:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the 10% reduction in the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools. It is true that the superannuation deduction is paid by the Treasury in the case of Civil Servants who are on superannuation and are drawing salary of less than $1,200, but, may I point out that you are not under any of the superannuation schemes and you do not contribute. Teachers of Indian day schools are not considered permanent Civil Servants and therefore cannot benefit by the provisions of the scheme. Of course, any payments you make to the Church superannuation scheme are not considered by the Government.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jes. E.

A.C. Kershaw discussed with his superior - they're not particularly interested. I went back to find out why reports that since reports would only be coming in quarterly it should really be too much of a job. He also suggests person concerned might be for his own benefit after 1 yr. & whether reports are being used or if not to cancel same. I'm inclined to agree. The only reason for the report is so that we could be in a position similar to that of the Supply Office when External & our own Minister asked for figures if we could supply them. Personally I think that's a ridiculous reason but there it is.\n\nFor your decision please -\n\nDRT\n\nI have discussed with DWS - we (this division, that is) don't need the statistics in Item 12 of the proposal OM 32. Nature of statistics needed being worked out - Jan 1964 to be the only sample.\n\n14-9-64\n12. (a) Statistics will be maintained at Regional Headquarters concerning the number of family units and total number of individuals involved under headings of applications approved and refused.\n\n(b) Regional Administrators will mail their initial consolidated reports to the Chief of Operations for arrival at HQ on 27 October 1964 and at quarterly intervals thereafter. No reports will NOT be required.\n\n(c) Officers in charge will submit an immediate detailed report to the Chief of Operations concerning each refusal.\nOPERATIONS MEMORANDUM\nTO ALL HOLDERS OF IMMIGRATION MANUAL\n\nNo. 32 (Revised)\nAugust 26, 1964\n\nSubject: Sponsorship by the Canadian Armenian Congress\n\n1. The Department has concluded an agreement with the Canadian Armenian Congress to the effect that we will accept applications submitted by the congress for the admission of families of Armenian origin from certain countries without numerical limit.\n\n2. The countries are Algeria, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. In addition, the congress may sponsor immigrants from these countries who are residing in a country of Europe where a Canadian Immigration office is established.\n\n3. Stage B will be dealt with in the normal way. Therefore, applications for persons residing in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia will be accepted only when the immigrant comes within the categories in 7.07 or 7.11 of the Manual.\n\n4. The immigrants must be:\n\n(a) desirable persons who do not meet in full the normal occupational requirements; or\n\n(b) socially or physically handicapped, provided they do not come within the classes described in section 5 of the Act other than paragraph (b) in respect of tuberculosis only or paragraph (c); or\n\n(c) admissible as sponsored relatives under section 31 of the Regulations and the financial or economic position of the potential sponsors is not yet secure enough to warrant approval under current procedures.\n\n5. In ALL cases the Congress must assume full responsibility, i.e., the Congress will be the formal sponsor, even though a relative in Canada is eligible under the Regulations to sponsor the immigrant. The Congress must guarantee suitable accommodation, adequate maintenance, assistance in finding employment when required, and such other help as the immigrants may require to ensure their successful establishment in Canada.\n\n6. This responsibility must be accepted by the Congress for five years or until the persons sponsored become eligible for Canadian citizenship, whichever is\nOperations Memorandum No. 32 (Revised) (con.)\n\nthe earlier.\n\n7. Each application must be accompanied by a form of guarantee (text in Appendix A) under the letterhead of the Canadian Armenian Congress and with a subject heading identifying the immigrant(s) on whose behalf the application and guarantee are being made.\n\n8. Immigrants certified under section 5(b) of the Act for tuberculosis may be allowed entry as non-immigrants for treatment, provided that the Congress furnishes adequate guarantees for treatment and care until the condition is regarded as cured, as set out in 8.82 and 8.84 of the Manual.\n\n9. The approving office will indicate in the \"REMARKS\" space on the Imm. 55 that visa is to bear the notation \"SPD - Canadian Armenian Congress\" and the name of the approving office.\n\n10. In ALL cases, when the usual requirements have been met, the officer dealing with the case will send duplicate Imm. 655* to the Chief, Admissions Division, requesting Order in Council authority for the immigrant's admission. If the immigrant is not in possession of a passport or certificate of identification acceptable under section 27 of the Regulations, the officer will also request the necessary Order in Council authority to waive the passport requirement.\n\n11. When visa is granted to a person sponsored by the Canadian Armenian Congress, the visa officer will write under the visa the notation \"SPD - Canadian Armenian Congress\", the BHQ file number and the name of the approving office.\n\n12. (a) Statistics will be maintained at Regional Headquarters concerning the number of family units and total number of individuals involved under headings of applications approved and refused.\n\n(b) Regional Administrators will mail their initial consolidated reports to the Chief of Operations for arrival at BHQ on 27 October 1964 and at quarterly intervals thereafter. Nil reports will NOT be required.\n\n(c) Officers in charge will submit an immediate detailed report to the Chief of Operations concerning each refusal.\n\nBHQ file 554-3\n\nChief of Operations.\n| Name       | P.L.

These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to paint the school building.\n\nIt is noted that the teacher requests that authority be granted to employ Indian labour to dig grass from among the trees of plantation, at an estimated cost of $5.00. The Department is not aware as to the necessity of this work, and considers that, if same is necessary, the teacher should arrange to have the work done himself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The siding is raising from the studding and the openings are quite large. A small quantity of siding will be required for the repair; this work should be done before school opens in September.\n\nI estimate the approximate cost would be $35.00. If this repair is done, and it is very necessary, the school would be much easier heated during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 28th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your No. 10 of the 17th instant, I beg to say that you may expend an amount of, approximately, $35.00, in repairing the siding of the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The school is nearby and is equally as badly in need of paint. The two jobs could be carried out at the same time and no doubt a saving affected.\n\nThe paint and labour will cost approximately $80.00 and I urge that this expenditure be incurred.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, August 25, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 21st instant, in which you ask for the authorization necessary to proceed with the painting of the Swan Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI may state by way of comment that we have in the Estimates for this year the sum of $200.00 for digging a well, piping and pump at the Swan Lake School. Is it your intention to proceed with this work? If so, will the sum of $200.00 be sufficient to paint the school in addition to the above mentioned improvements? In view of the fact that Mr. Christiansen has authorized you to proceed with the painting of the residence, it might be advisable to paint the school at the same time. I regret, however, that it will not be possible to provide a sum exceeding $200.00 for repairs and improvements at the Swan Lake School this year. You might consider the matter and undertake the work which may appear to you to be the most urgent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Reay,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

The meat and other provisions which you sent in November, 1940 will soon be gone. If the Department were to send biscuits, we could do without any other material for lunch. Will you please use your best offices to urge the Government to get the biscuits? If more children come as you expect, the biscuits will be a great help to me in making provision for lunch.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. H.

I beg to recommend two new children's toilets.\n\nThe material for the toilets could be used for forms for the cement tank, previous to being used for the toilet walls. The tank would be 5' X 7' X 6' high. The material 24 sacks cement,- $24.00, 6 yards gravel,- $24.00. The material for the toilets would cost $16.00 each, and the labour for both jobs,- $50.00.

He has a splendid school garden and uses the oven for roasting potatoes and cooking beans that have been grown in the garden. The oven can be used, but a lot of firing is necessary and this is unsatisfactory.\n\nA second-hand stove can be purchased locally, from Mr. DeReo? I am informed that this range is in first class condition and can be bought for $20.00.

Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nSwan Lake Indian Day School\nInspector's Report.\n\nWe have now received the inspection report as submitted by Mr. Lockhart after his visit to the above Indian Day School on November 6. Under the heading \"General Comments\" he makes the following remarks:\n\n\"I made my official visit to Swan Lake Indian Day School on the above date. After Mr. Schellenberg's death last year, just after the opening of the fall term, Mrs. Schellenberg carried on for the balance of the year. Mrs. Schellenberg had no teaching experience whatever and I can see that the school slipped back considerably. Mrs. Schellenberg's chief contribution to the school, previous to assuming the teaching responsibility, was to teach the girls to sew and cook. She had them prepare and serve hot school lunches and in this respect she accomplished a great deal.\n\n\"I doubt very much that Mr. Smith is any too happy in this position. He is a bachelor, with no car, and finds living conditions rather lonely. This is an ideal set-up for a married couple. The residence and grounds are in good shape with a wonderful garden, fruit trees, etc. Mr. Schellenberg liked this type of work and he carried on a number of experiments in conjunction with Mr. Leslie, Superintendent of the Morden Experimental Farm. As Mr. Smith is...\"\nnot interested in this particular type of work I am of\nthe opinion that the garden and grounds will not receive\nvery much attention.\n\n\"School Garden - \"This has slipped badly. In previous years\nwhere the root-house and cellar was stored with potatoes,\ncarrots, turnips, onions and ripe beans, this year there are\nonly potatoes. The garden had been stripped by the time\nMr. Smith arrived on the scene. As a result the hot noon-\nday meal will suffer accordingly. Previously a hot meal was\nbeing served by this time of year, but as yet no effort has\nbeen made to carry out this project.\n\n\"Handicraft - \"I doubt very much will be accomplished in this\ndepartment. Mr. Smith is not very handy with tools but feels\nthat he can achieve the same ends through athletics. I doubt\nthis very much but there is very little that can be done\nabout this at present.\n\n\"School Work - \"I have already intimated that the standard of\nthe school has slipped during the past year. I also recommended\nthat certain work books should be supplied but evidently these\nhad not been requisitioned. Mr. Smith informs me that he now\nhas a requisition in for work books covering all his grades\nI - VI. These should prove to be of great help once they\narrive.\n\n\"In summing up this report I would say that the\ndiscipline, manner, attitude and response of the students appears\nto be fairly satisfactory although a good deal of hard work\nwill have to be done to bring the school up to the standard of\na year or so ago. I doubt very much if Mr. Smith, working by\nhimself, can accomplish these results.\n\n\"I made inquiry about the school bulletins\nwhich are being sent out regularly and these were all in\ngood order.\"\n\nThe Inspector has also recommended that a new\nflag be supplied and this has been sent to Mr. Smith. He has\nalso recommended that a fence be placed around the school garden. Would you please keep this in mind for next year and obtain an estimate as to how much this will cost, so that we can have this work carried out in the early spring.\n\nBernard F.

The P.O. address of the school being Winnipegosis, Manitoba.\n\nDenomination: This is a Roman Catholic school. Both English and French are taught.\n\nLand: There is about ten acres of land in connection with the school. (There is no correspondence on file in reference to title or ownership of this land.)\n\nBuildings: The buildings in connection with Water New River Boarding School are as follows:\n\n1. The School House: A log building on stone foundation, 30x30 ft., with a clerestory above. This is used as a classroom for Day and Boarding pupils.\n\n2. The Main Building: With a frontage of 70 feet, 24 feet deep, T-shaped and one story high, is where the Boarding pupils are housed. It contains the Dormitories, Dining Room, Recreation Rooms, and Kitchen. It is heated by stoves.\n\n3. Woodshed: 12 x 14 ft.; (4) 2 Stone houses, each 12 x 15 ft.; (5) Horse stable 12 x 16 ft.; and (6) Cattle stable 14 x 14 ft.\n\nAccommodation: There is accommodation for 20 pupils.\nHistory of School\n\nDay school (1) The work of building the first Day School on the Water New River Reserve was commenced by the Indians in 1880. The Deptt contributed in 1882 the sum of $50.00 to procure such articles as may be necessary for the completion of the school house. A further grant of $44.40 was paid in 1883 towards completing the cost of the building, making a total amount of $94.40 contributed by the Govt. to build the first day school on the Reserve. This building was finished and ready for occupation in August 1883. It was a log building 20' x 30' ft. worth when finished about $150.00.\n\nOn May 18th/83, the Indian Commr (the Hon E. Dewdney) was instructed to procure a suitable teacher and one Jules Sabourin was engaged.\n\n(2) During the summer of 1892 the Indians commenced work on a new school building \"as the old school was becoming useless\" and applied to the Deptt through Mr. M. Lock for a grant towards completing the building. In the Estimates for 1893, a grant of $650.00 was voted for that purpose. Tenders were called for the work and two were submitted but were both found to be in excess of the grant provided for that purpose.\nIt was then decided to have the work done by Indian Labour under the supervision of a foreman \"working by the day who may engage at the Reserve such other assistance as he may require.\"\n\nThe following payments were made by the Dept towards the cost of completing the school on the 28th April 1893 a cheque for $50.00 was sent in payment for material supplied on the 6th July 1893. Cheque for $250.00 was sent in payment for material supplied on 18th Sept 1893. Cheque for $100.00 was sent in payment for lumber supplied on Oct 14th 1893. Cheques amounting to $74.63 were sent in payment for supplies purchased on the 22nd Dec 1893. Cheque for $281.85 was sent in payment for material supplied and work done on building. This made a sum of $806.48 being the total cost contributed by the Dept towards the building of the school at the Wali New River.\n\nThe building is of log 31 x 23'10\", on a stone foundation with a store room above. It is the building which is now used for classes taught by the Day and Boarding School pupils. A wood shed 12 x 16 ft was also built at this time and payment therefor is included in above.\n\nIn regard to the main building which the principal mentions in his annual report for 1900 as being 70 x 24 ft. \"shaped\" and whether...\nused to house the Boarders and contains the Dormitories, Kitchen &c. There is nothing on file to show when this building was erected and no amount has been provided in the estimates towards the cost of its construction. It was probably built at the expense of the Roman Catholic Church Authorities.\n\nPer Capita Grant\n\nThe first grant made by the Deptt. towards the support of a teacher at the Water New River, was provided in the Estimates for 1883-84, when \u00a3300.00 was voted for salary of Day School Teacher. The Day school continued to receive this yearly grant of \u00a3300.00 from its start in 1884, up to the end of the fiscal year 1895-96.\n\nThe Boarding School was first started during the year 1890, being run in connection with the day school. The Estimates for that year (1890-91) provided for 10 pupils @ \u00a360.00 per capita. This grant for 10 pupils was voted annually in the Estimates for the fiscal years 1891-92, 1892-93, 1893-94, 1894-95, and 1895-96.\n\nOn the 3rd March 1896, the Deptt. performed Inspector Mr. Coll. that from the end of the June quarter 1896, the...\nDepartment would cease to pay the $300.00 a year allowed as salary for the teacher of the Day School, but would instead pay a maintenance grant of $60.00 per capita for the boarders up to the authorized number of ten pupils and a tuition grant of $12.00 per capita for those and the day pupils in attendance at the school. By this arrangement the school was placed on the same basis as other boarding schools.\n\nThe Estimate for 1897-98 provided for:\n15 Boarders @ $72.00 per capita = $1080.00\n11 Day Pupils @ $12.00 \" \" \" $132.00\nTotal $1212.00\n\nThe Estimate for this year provided for:\n15 Boarders @ $72.00 per capita = $1080.00\n11 Day Pupils @ $12.00 \" \" \" $132.00\nTotal $1212.00\n\nThe Vote was the same as during the years 1897-98 and 1898-99.\n\nThe Estimate for 1900-01 provided for:\n15 Boarders @ $72.00 per capita = $1080.00\n15 Day Pupils @ $12.00 \" \" \" $180.00\nTotal $1260.00\n\nNo grant will be voted in the Estimate for 1901-02 for a Boarding School at Water Hen River as Boarding School was closed on the 30th September, 1900, having become amalgamated and the pupils transferred to the Pine Creek Boarding School; however will be conducted a Day School.\nat Water Hen River to meet the requirements of the Indians and will be carried on so long as the attendance of pupils warrants it being kept open. It will receive the usual Day School grant of $300.00 per annum.\n\nAmalgamation of Water Hen River with the Pine Creek Boarding School\n\nMr. Inspector Marlatt in his report on the Boarding school at Water Hen River conducted under the auspices of the R.C. Church authorities gives it as his opinion that this school should be closed. His reason being that the attendance is irregular and that the school is not necessary on account of the proximity of the Pine Creek Boarding School, and that better results could be obtained from one large, well conducted school than from two small ones.\n\nHe therefore advocated the amalgamation of the two Boarding schools of Water Hen River and Pine Creek, and that the grant to the latter be increased and the pupils at Water Hen River transferred to Pine Creek, thus leaving only a day school at Water Hen River which would be sufficient for the needs of the Indians at that point.\nThe Archbishop of St. Boniface, the Principal of the Pine Creek Boarding School and the Indians themselves were in favor of the scheme.\n\nThe Water Street River Boarding School was closed Sept. 30th 1900, the pupils being transferred to Pine Creek Boarding School.\n\nFor all correspondence, plans, memoranda, see files 23.674, 96.219, 98.150, 98.150, 118.340, and 118.340.

(RG 10, Volume 6248, file 545-1, part 2)\nWith reference to the enquiry made by Mr McKenna in his memorandum of the 25th ultimo in connection with the claim of Mr I.H. Adam, Principal of the boarding school situated at Water Hen River, which was lately amalgamated with the Pine Creek Boarding School, I beg to say that this school appears to have been closed at the suggestion of Mr Inspector Marlatt with the concurrence of His Lordship, the Archbishop of St Boniface and the Department (See letters turned out on file 96150 herewith) There is nothing on file to show that any mention was made of transferring any school equipment or payment for the same by the Department, and previous to Mr Adam's claim there was nothing to show to whom this equipment belonged.\n\nThere was a day school at Water Hen River as far back as '82, and I find on referring to Agent Martineau's reports that in '89 there were four pupils boarding at the school, but nothing was allowed for boarders until the year 1890, when provision was made for ten pupils, which was afterwards increased to fifteen in 1895.\n\nMr Adam has been in charge of this school since 1888, but who owned the equipment or who paid for it I am unable to state.\nExtract - original copy\n\n232259\n\nWater New River\n22nd Aug. 1902.\n\nHon. Clifford Lipton\nMinister of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nWe had one of the best schools in this Agency, and it has been closed last year without any good reason by Inspector Marshall under the influence of the P.C. clergy, the latter, thereby expecting to get our children for the Pine Creek school. Our children have been kept from going to school during the whole year.\n\n(Sgd) Chief Baptiste Ripinach\nOTTAWA, 19th September, 1922\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an extract from a letter received from Chief Baptiste Nipinach of the Water Net reserve who complains of the closing of the school on that reserve. Although the boarding school there was amalgamated with the Pine Creek school, it was not the intention of the Department to close the day school, provision for which is made in the current year's estimates. The Department would be glad to have a report from you in regard to this statement.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWater Hen River, 29th Jan., 1903.\n\nThe Minister,\n\nSir:\n\nBut to disorganize our reserve Mr. Marlatt has made use of many other means, which we leave for your Excellency to appreciate. One of these means has been to ask Mr. Adam, who has been the school-teacher here for a number of years, to use all his influence to persuade everyone on the Water Hen Reserve to go to Pine Creek, promising him that if he succeeded he would obtain for him a much better situation than that which he was enjoying then. Seeing that he did not attain his ends and that Mr. Adam absolutely refused to misuse the mission that the Government had entrusted to him, he has, in order to close the school in spite of him, used absolutely disloyal means; and it is of the greatest importance, Sir, that you should be warned thereof.\n\nKnowing that our boarding-school was our property, and that nothing could meddle with it, without our consent, Mr. Marlatt called a general meeting of all the Indians of Water Hen to ask them whether they would agree to the closing of their boarding-school. They replied that they would oppose this energetically; that they were determined to keep their school and that they were unanimously opposed to its being closed.\n\nMr. Marlatt had foreseen the difficulty. He knew well we would hold on to our school, of which we were justly proud, since the official reports made by Mr. Marlatt himself showed that it was the best school in his district.\n\nUnder these circumstances he found nothing better to do than to take with him an interpreter who nuts, in his interpretation from Saulteaux into English, tell him just the contrary of what the Indians replied: that is what happened. This interpreter told Mr. Marlatt, in his free interpretation, that the Chief, the councillors and the others desired that the boarding-school\nIt was thus, Sir, that one day we learned with consternation that our dear school no longer existed. That was the means employed by Mr. Marlatt to do us a great wrong.\n\nSince that time we have been without a school. They take our children away from us by force to send them to the Pine Creek School, which we are obliged to do nevertheless in spite of ourselves, for we understand the importance of education and we do not want to let our children stagnate in ignorance.\n\nVictims of these injustices we come, Sir, to ask your Excellency that our boarding-school be given back to us, because it has been taken from us by fraudulent means and without our consent. We ask that we be given a master to conduct it; we ask that the Water Hen Reserve may become again what it was, and we very humbly pray your Excellency to consider that we do not ask anything that is not strictly and perfectly just.\n\n\\[x\\]\n\\[x\\]\n\nhis\nBaptiste X Okilchegeeshekowenin,(Chief)\nmark\n\n(and signatures of three Councillors.)\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the returns of the Water Hen Day School for March quarter forwarded today, Mr. Agent Logan remarks that from an average attendance of 8.54 for September, 4.61 for December, there is now only an average of 1.46.

I took for granted that Mrs Adam was accepted as school teacher, it is only today when reading over again your letter, I notice that you are asking for an answer. I hardly think she is qualified to be a teacher. I am in doubt whether she knows English enough to teach. Besides she is married and has small children, nevertheless as it is very hard to find a teacher for a reserve you might perhaps try her, if after one year she is an efficient teacher she could be continued in her work.\n\nYours truly,\n(Sgd) A.

Logan,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie,\nMan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Miss Bernadette A. Adam's case I will state the following facts; It is at the request of the Water Hen Indian Councillors that I have sent Miss Adams to teach School at the same Water Hen Indian School. At that time said the chief, it was impossible to wait any longer on account of bad roads on the lake and he told me that he will notify you as soon the said teacher will be there.\n\nMiss Bernadette R. Adams completed her English studies in Portage La Prairie School, and she is supposed to be qualified to teach school as well as her sister was at least.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J. Chaumont Retre. O.M.I.\nReferring to your letter of 29th ultimo, No. 117,638/1 in reference to the teacher of Water Hen day School.\n\nIn reply would say, I wrote Rev. J. Chaumont who was at Pine Creek Boarding School, when Miss B. Adams commenced to teach at Water Hen, and I herewith enclose copy of Letter received from him which will explain itself.\n\nI know that Miss. B. Adams was at School in this City, and am satisfied she will make as good a teacher as her predecessor who was her sister; at the same time, she is not what is required as a teacher.\n\nI also received a letter from the Chief and Councillors stating they were satisfied with her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJodie Oides, Man.,\nJanuary 13th, 1914.\n\nMr. R. Lazare, A.A.,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nSir,\n\nPlease accept my resignation as teacher of Waterhen Day School.\n\nCircumstances have arisen which will prevent me from returning. I am very sorry but it was also impossible to get a suitable boarding place, and I could not stay alone as you will understand.\n\nI hope you will be satisfied with my work as teacher while there.\n\nWith thanks for past favors.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nBernadette L. Adam.\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith enclose letter containing resignation of Miss Bernadette A. Adam, teacher of Water Hen Indian Day School, which I have received this day.\n\nIt would appear from Miss Adam's letter that she had already quit teaching, apparently at the close of the December quarter, 1913.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 26, 1914.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing the resignation of Miss Bernadette A.

I was in hope of Miss Adams doing good work in this school as she had the children well in hand when last I visited this school. It seems a pity to have this school closed so soon after the completion of the new school which the Department had erected at considerable expense this summer but hope that it will not remain closed long.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) R.

The ordinary salary of $300.00 does not command itself to him.\n\nWe can get him, provided a sufficient salary is paid him, and in my opinion he should be paid $500.00 per year, the same amount, I understand that Mr. Clare is to receive for teaching at Little Saskatchewan Reserve.\n\nIf granted kindly advise by wire, as Mr. Inglott may get some other position, and it seems impossible to get teachers for the Indian Schools which are Vacant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nThe Great North Western Telegraph Company of Canada.\n\nExclusive connection with the WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO.\n\nCable Service to all the world\n\nGEO.

We have now a new Chief and these Indians promise me that they will have 15 children to attend school, and the chief assures me that he will see that the children attend, the reason they claim that the children did not attend was on account of the teacher Mr. Inglott, as the Indians did not like him, and that the children did not learn anything while he was there.\n\nThe Rev Father Brachet, Principal, of the Pine Creek Indian Boarding School, does not approve of opening the school, as he wants all the children to attend the Pine Creek Boarding School, the Waterhen Indians are very sore at this. The Rev. Father Brachet is also trying to get all these Waterhen Indians to move to Pine Creek Reserve. This is one of the reasons I consented to recommend to have the Waterhen school re-opened, as I do not want to see any trouble between these Indians and the Church.\n\nI find on\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI find on several of these Reserves now that the Church has not the influence it had some time ago, and I think the cause of it, is that the Priests are a little too strict with the Indians, as in this case trying to drive them from one Reserve to another.\n\nI consider these Waterhen Indians has had a good lesson, in having this school closed, and now I am quite satisfied that the children will attend better in future and would recommend the school be again opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 21, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with further reference to the proposed re-opening of the Waterhen River Indian Day School.

There is another school at Valley River, Man., which has been closed for some time. I do not know what provision is being made for the education of the children, but as far as I could learn at Valley River, a number of the children were escaping and being brought up in ignorance. Unless the Boarding School has demonstrated its immense superiority to the Day School, I think it a pity that these Day Schools should remain closed, or even that they should be closed temporarily. If it is a question of the qualification of the teachers, we should endeavor to remedy the defect as quickly as possible.\n\nOnce more thanking you and expressing my appreciation of your kind courtesy,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n+ Alexius A.

There are 18 pupils on the Register with an average attendance of 15. Good progress is reported from this school and the teacher Mr. D'Aoust doing the best he can for these pupils and the Indians in general and the Indians speak well of him and say that their children will soon be good scholars under their teacher. Most of the Indians live near the school now so that their children can attend.

I also enclose quarterly return for the quarter ending the 30th September, showing that the school on the Waterhen Reserve was not open during that quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\n\nFirst allow me to apologize for writing on too-expensive paper, but we in the north can not just phone Kelowna delivery when we run out of writing pads so please excuse me.\n\nYour letter requesting a report on the life and training of Indian children during and after school years, I regret to say was accidentally burnt, but answering it as best as I can from memory, I would do make the following statements.\n\nFirst, I agree that our school program of studies are not, perhaps, quite all that could be desired. Our readers, for example, while they may be very sweet for little girls contain little to inspire courage, manliness or interest in teenage boys.\n\nSincerely allow my boys to choose the reading lesson. They\nnever choose a leader, but either \"Round the World\" or Canadian History\u2014and nine times out of ten they choose the only \"taunted tales\" story or the Buffalo Hunt,\" or the large geography.\n\nI must express my very real pleasure in our new arithmetics; they are without exception the best I have ever seen. My boys are doing wonders with them. My only regret is that I have no excuse to order Book three. I am keenly interested to see it.\n\nYour letter spoke of manual training. The idea is right, but the difficulty, as I see it, in day schools, is this. Personally I know I am competent to teach woodwork\u2014but how many badly teachers are\u2014while I would be taking the boys who would supervise the girls. I can also teach needle craft and domestic science. But again, while I would be in the house teaching say cooking, who would supervise the boys left in the school?\n\nIf men were substituted for women teachers, I do not see that it would help, as few could teach needle craft and domestic science. One way, would be to employ a woman to take the girls while the teacher takes the boys.\nas in most Reserves there is at least one Indian woman who is good at needle work. But then again few indeed are any good at all in housekeeping or cooking. They scrub and sweep the floors until I have become so tired of seeing the brown curlicues round that I shall take the woman, for goodness sake put it away; but I have yet to meet an Indian woman who would dust shelves without being told.\n\nThere is generally one man in each Reserve namely a man who cannot perform as a teacher\u2014 but who could teach the boys much. He might be asked to take the boys while the teacher takes the girls. That is, on Reserves where the number of pupils warrant the expense of such a man and material, my own school would not warrant such expense, as I have only two baby girls and one eleven years old, and three boys of an age to trust with the intelligent use of tools and lumber.\n\nThis argument would sound to favor Boarding Schools, but speaking from my fifteen years experience on Indian Reserves I would say emphatically, no.\n\nBoarding schools may be good on Prairie Reserves, where the boys are taught farm and\nstable work which they are certain to require after leaving school. But for the northern boy the situation is practically hopeless.\n\nFrom this Reserve at the moment there are five boys in the Boarding School. The mother aunt told me that only the eldest remembers a little of the Indian language. These boys will return to the Reserve at the age of sixteen or eighteen years almost strangers and unable to converse with their own people. The four younger boys have never as much as set a rabbit snare or hooked a fish, yet trapping and fishing will be their only means of a livelihood. This subject along with woodcraft and camping are not taught in Boarding Schools. The boys return young men absolutely ignorant of the business of their future lives.\n\nThe girls return in no better condition. There is nothing in a present day Boarding School that in the remotest way resembles a trapping Reserve home. I myself have watched on this Reserve, of\nless than a hundred souls,\nfive girls return from Board-\ning School quite unmanage-\nable. The school superiors\nblame the parents for not\ncarrying on the school\ndiscipline. To do so is not\npossible. When children of\neither sex are taken from\ntheir parents for nine or\ntwelve years and kept within\ncertain bounds and constant\ndiscipline. Then are suddenly\nthrown onto their Reserves\nwith the excitement of their\nfreedom rushing like wine\nthrough their heads, they\nare like wild creatures let\nout of cages. They are\nstrongers to their own parents\nand parental authority. The\nschool authority is gone, they\nknow of no other. In regard\nto these girls, one had two\nchildren, another had one child\nbefore they married. She third\nis not married and has two\nchildren, she is hardly eighteen\nyears old.\n\nOf course, I am speaking\nonly of northern Reserves where\nthe Mounted Police never patrol\nor why do so about twice a\nyear. The Agent can only reach\nat the most three times in a year.\nThe teacher having no authority can only advise or coax. The Indian pleases himself in the end. The conditions on Prairie Reserves nearer civilization may, and possibly are, different.\n\nIn regard to the training of the girls in Boarding schools, everything is fully modern; electric washers and irons, and ovens etc.\n\nGirls come back to the Reserve. They do not remember having seen a wash board etc., wood fires and salamanders. Have no idea of baking bannock or bread by hand. They are as much at a loss in their sphere as the boys in theirs.\n\nThey marry and make very discontented wives, because their husbands cannot provide for them as the school did. This is not a healthy discontent. It is well known that the trapping has not been good for a number of years. The chief reason is that there are altogether too many half-breeds & whites allowed to cover the Indians' grounds. The Indian being poorer equipped has no chance against them. And also too many bush fires driving the fur too far north from the Reserves. The men...\ndo their best but children certainly do not make the best of their homes. The girls from the day schools make better wives because they have lived in their natural environment and have learned from their own mothers the trappers needs and appreciate their difficulties.\n\nIt may be argued that if all children went to boarding schools that both sexes would have a higher standard of living. I think not; some young Indians could not visualize having a small house built within his means could in any way compare with the expensive buildings and furnishings of a boarding school. I have never seen one idea brought from a Boarding School applied to a Reserve home.\n\nIf boarding schools were conducted on the cottage plan, built and furnished cheaply and simply on a scale that would be within every Indians means, and the girls taught to keep them entirely by hand, the conditions and training would be an improved replica of their own Reserve life which they could carry out on their return.\n\nNorthern Reserves never will...\nhave electricity. Then why teach girls to use machines instead of the wash tubs.\n\nThe boys cannot be taught wood craft and camping. That should not prove difficult. Day school boys learn these things naturally. I know one little boy of only eight years who in between school hours snared forty odd rabbits in one season.\n\nJudging from my experience the northern Indians have very little interest in education. They send their children to school because it is the law. But on Reserves like here, where the Boarding School is only a matter of about forty miles by water, the Day School works under a very severe handicap. The parents are continually disputing over putting the children in the Boarding school, so that they will be fed and clothed. There is no question of a better education. It is simply the prevailing idea of the \"Government\" among all the provinces. Their only difficulty seems to be which children to send.

The mother and aunt told me that only the eldest remembers a little of the Indian language. These boys will return to the reserve at the age of sixteen or eighteen years, almost strangers and unable to converse with their own people. The four younger boys have never as much as set a rabbit snare or hooked a fish. Yet, trapping and fishing will be their only means of a livelihood. This subject, along with woodcraft and camping, are not taught in boarding schools. The boys return young men, absolutely ignorant of the business of their future lives.\n\nThe girls return in no better condition. There is nothing in a present day boarding school that in the remotest way resembles a trapping reserve home. I, myself, have watched on this reserve, of less than a hundred souls, five girls return from boarding school, quite unmanageable. The school superiors blame the parents for not carrying on the school discipline. To do so is not possible. When children of either sex are taken from their parents for nine or twelve years and kept within certain bounds and constant discipline, then are suddenly thrown onto their reserves, with the excitement of their freedom rushing like wine through their heads, they are like wild creatures let out of cages. They are strangers to their own parents and parental authority. The school authority is gone; they know of no other. In regard to these girls, one had two children, another had one child before they married; the third is not married and has two children. She is hardly eighteen years old.\n\nOf course, I am speaking only of northern reserves, where the Mounted Police never patrol or only do so about twice a year. The Agent can only reach at the most three times in a year. The teacher, having no authority, can only advise or coax. The Indian pleases himself in the end. The conditions on prairie reserves nearer civilization may, and possibly are, different.\n\nIn regard ...\nIn regard to the training of the girls in boarding schools, everything is fully modern - electric washers and irons, ovens, etc. Girls come back to the reserve. They do not remember having seen a washboard & tub, wood fires and sad-irons and have no idea of baking bannock or bread by hand. They are as much at a loss in their sphere as the boys in theirs.\n\nThey marry and make very discontented wives, because their husbands cannot provide for them as the school did, and this is not a healthy discontent.\n\nIt is well known that the trapping has not been good for a number of years. The chief reason is that there are altogether too many half-breeds and whites allowed to cover the Indian's grounds. The Indian, being poorer equipped, has no chance against them. And also too many bush fires driving the fur too far north from the reserves. The men do their best but their wives certainly do not make the best of their homes. The girls from the day schools make better wives, because they have lived in their natural environment and have learned from their own mothers the trappers' needs and appreciate their difficulties.\n\nIt may be argued that if all children went to boarding schools, both sexes would have a higher standard of living. I think not, as the young Indian could not visualize how a small home built within his means could in any way compare with the expensive buildings and furnishings of a boarding school. I have never seen one idea brought from a Boarding school and applied to a reserve home.\n\nIf boarding schools were conducted on the cottage plan, built and furnished cheaply and simply on a sum that would be within every Indian's means and the girls taught to keep them entirely by hand, the conditions and training would be an improved replica of their own reserve life, which they could carry out on their return.\n\nNorthern reserves never will have electricity. Then, why teach girls to use machines instead of the wash-tub.\n\nThe boys could be taught woodcraft and camping. That should not prove difficult. Day school boys learn these things naturally. I have one little boy of only 8 years who, in between school hours, snared forty odd rabbits in one season.\n\nJudging .....\nJudging from my experience, the northern Indians have very little interest in education. They send their children to school because it is the law. But, on reserves like here, where the boarding school is only a matter of about forty miles by water, the day school works under a very severe handicap. The parents are continually disputing over putting the children in the boarding school, so that they will be fed and clothed. There is no question of a better education. It is simply the prevailing idea of the \"Government\" doing all the providing. Their only difficulty seems to be which children to send. The mothers want to keep the girls and the fathers want to keep the boys, so, while they are disputing, the children are thoroughly unsettled in their present school. This generally goes on for years before any final steps are taken by the parents.\n\nWhere boarding schools are at a greater distance, this unsatisfactory condition does not exist for the day school teacher, as parents will make at least some effort to maintain their children rather than send them far from them.\n\nIn regard to following up the boys after they leave school - in this particular Band there is nothing else for the boys to do but trap, which they do, going along at first with the men. Later, ex-school chums go together.\n\nThe girls simply stay at home until some young man asks them to marry.\n\nThis report is respectfully submitted by\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSister Patricia Fuller,\nTeacher & Dispenser.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE MINISTER,\n\nI am returning herewith certain correspondence relating to the operation of the Waterhen River Indian Day School, Waterhen Reserve, province of Manitoba.\n\nThere is an Indian population of 105 on the Waterhen reserve and, of these, 24 are of school age. There is on this reserve an Indian day school with a pupil enrolment of 10. Sister Patricia Fuller, the present teacher, has been in charge of this school since 1929, and, prior to that date, she was in charge of the Indian day school at Bloodvein, Clandeyoey agency, Man. The Inspectors' reports on the work of this teacher are uniformly satisfactory over a long period of years.\n\nIt would appear that this school was closed at the end of the academic year 1933 but was re-opened early in February, 1934, in response to a petition signed by the Indian parents on the reserve and on the recommendation of the Indian agent. There is nothing on file to indicate that requests have reached the Department at any time in recent years for the closing of this school.\n\nThe Indians of this reserve are, without exception, recognized in the census report as Roman Catholics. It is assumed that the additional 14 children of school age on the reserve are enrolled at the Pine Creek Residential School. This residential school has an enrolment at this date of 114 pupils. A per capita pupilage grant of $165.00 is paid for 100 pupils. The school...\nschool management received no allowance for the 14 additional pupils and the last Auditor's report states that the cost per pupil per annum is $174.79.\n\nMr. Adams' statement, that the Superior or Principal of the school at Pine Creek is anxious to close the Indian day school on the Waterhen reserve, in an attempt to have all the children of the Band transferred to the residential school, cannot, in my judgment, be taken seriously. Archbishop Sinnott has always taken a sympathetic interest in the work of this school. He protested vigorously to the Department against the closing of this school a few years ago. In a letter to the Department dated November 12, 1933, Archbishop Sinnott stated:\n\n\"Unless the boarding school has demonstrated its immense superiority to the day school, I think it a pity that these day schools should remain closed, or even that they should be closed temporarily. If it is a question of the qualification of the teachers, we should endeavour to remedy the defect as quickly as possible.\"\n\nI feel confident Archbishop Sinnott would be vigorously opposed to the closing of the Waterhen River Day School at this time.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, an excerpt from a report on Indian education, sent forward to me on May 10, 1937, by the present teacher of the Waterhen River Indian Day School, Sister Patricia Fuller.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6248)\n\nFile 545-1, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Waterhen River Day School - Protestant - School Establishment. 1910 - 1911\n\nFile 545-1, part 2\nManitowapah Agency - Waterhen River Day School - Roman Catholic - General Administration. 1901 - 1938\n\nFile 545-1, part 3\nManitowapah Agency - Waterhen River Day School - General Administration. 1938 - 1949\n\nFile 545-3, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Waterhen River Day School - Teachers' Salaries. 1910 - 1936\n\nFile 545-5, part 1\nManitowapah Agency - Waterhen River Day School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1895 - 1901\n\nFile 545-5, part 2\nPortage La Prairie Agency - Waterhen River Day School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1940 - 1949\n| Date       | Description                                      | Amount |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 19/4/47    | PA                                               | \u00a31     |\n| 22/4/47    | EXD                                              |        |\n| 30/6/47    | EXD                                              |        |\n| 25/7/47    | EXD                                              |        |\n| 18/10/47   | EXD                                              |        |\n| 18/10/47   | EXD                                              |        |\n| 25/11/47   | EXD                                              |        |\n| 28/12/47   | EXD                                              |        |\n| 1/1/50     | PA                                               | \u00a31     |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 545-1, part 3)\nOttawa, May 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sister Fuller:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of April 19th and also copy of the annual report of your school for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1938, attached thereto.\n\nI have sent forward a copy of your communication to the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch who are responsible for the regulations governing the employment of Indian day school teachers, to which you refer. I am also directing their attention to your remarks with respect to the condition of the school building and conditions generally on the Waterhen reserve.\n\nIn view of the large number of problems to which you refer in your letter, it has occurred to me that it might be advisable to have the Indian agent visit you at your reserve, just as soon as he can conveniently do so, and submit to the Department a full report on your work at the school and the difficulties you are encountering from day to day on the reserve. I am suggesting to the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch that instructions be issued to the Indian agent to undertake this investigation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Patricia Fuller,\nTeacher,\nWaterhen River Indian Day School,\nSkownan P.O., Manitoba.\nWaterhen Indian Reserve\nSkowman P.O. man\nApril 19th 38\n\nHon. J. A. Brierar\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs His Grace Archbishop Adenot of Winnipeg informed me that you are now the Superior of the Indian Dept., I am addressing this report and petition to yourself, so it would seem that these reports are properly filed in the mainline way.\n\nI have stated in nine reports to the Dept., and the Agent has seen for himself, the failing condition of this school and teachers buildings. The latter never has had any paint.\neither inside or out, the floor is simply worn out. However, it would never look clean if scrubbed daily. The furniture belonging to the Department consists of an old broken bedstead and spring to wear out mattress, one table\u2014home made\u2014and three chairs, two of which I myself, could not dare to sit in (all remains) and a cook stove. All remaining furniture heater, tables, desk, kitchen utensils and crockery, I have had to purchase myself according to the national curriculum I am supposed to teach drawing, knitting and sewing. The drawing books are simply ignored on my requisitions. My last supply being in 1927 those once supplied seven dollars worth of books myself. I have ordered them again or last month's requisition, however, I have received each year...\n30 yards of flannel, but it has come in November. How can I even take time to teach little girls to make underwear when they are shivering in our own homes? Yarn has come also, except this winter and it did not come at all. Of all the cruel sights it was to see the poor little children with bare hands and cotton stockings in so bitter a weather. Material and yarn and needles to be abused in this school showed reach there was later in September 1st.\n\nThe Department for the last few years gave my boys pants, for which we are very grateful. But when I have spoken to the agent about the material & yarn he has told me \"how expensive the yarn is and what if the parents can not afford to keep their children they must put them in the Boarding School, that is what the Boarding Schools are for.\"\nIf this is the dept policy I am afraid I fail to see any wisdom in it. First, how is the cheaper to completely maintain a family of from 5 to 14 children in a boarding school for ten years each, than to supply a few pounds of meal and a few pounds of sugar, also a few pairs of rubbers. The half breed children have received complete supplies of clothing including rubbers, while my poor little ones had not even a mitt to put on while carrying in the school wood; their poor little hands freezing with the contact of ice & snow while pulling out and carrying the wood.\n\nAgain, is it wise to train parents to believe that they need have no responsibility of their families, all they have to do is to bring into the world as many children as they can, then throw them to the government to raise.\nMost of the parents who love their children do not wish to throw them away. They have to see them go to Day School practically naked because there is not even a rabbit or fish to catch, so during the winter and spring, at the same time they see the halfbreed children warmly clad. This spring also there are few or no rats to be caught.\n\nStates it, sir, that you have a copy of the \"Regulations Governing the Employment of Teachers in Indian Day Schools.\" I would like to respectfully discuss a few points in it.\n\nAlto I have been teaching Indian Day schools for sixteen years, now is the first time I have received the Regulations in writing.\n\nI wish it to be clearly understood that although I may have to mention from time to time my own experiences, I am doing so only to emphasize my point, and not to plead\nmy own cause... this is no call but I wish to plead for justice for our younger teachers.\n\nI am sure the Dept. can not realize the indignity of the pay school teacher's position, she or he is neither just, clear, nor fair.\n\nThe teacher knows that her salary comes from the Dept., and what she earned pays not me cost for either her maintenance or the upkeep of the school. Yet any priest can come in here and what have to open or close the school or on any day she can order it closed. He can come in here and what she is or is not to teach. If she has the conviction that so the Dept. learns all the financial expenses & has written definite rules regarding school regulations that she should obey the Dept. rules that the priest, there is a battle royal if she is considered as a bad teacher. Then along comes the Dept Inspector & agent both demanding school inspections & discussing\nactive matters. She Ottawa sends along for reports.\n\nWhen the Personnel Record Card was sent me last year, I had to write the Agent to know just exactly who my immediate superior is. He wrote back that it is himself, so other teachers and government employees then what might have priests to get angry when the teacher refuses to delay opening her record until ten or ten thirty for days at a time just because they can not say their mass at time. They tell me that the church comes first, that they put the teacher in the school to serve the church, then why do they not pay her salary, and by what authority do they demand school inspections?\n\nSection 4 of the Regulations states \"Teachers...\"\nmust hold complete academic or professional certificates.\" Presumably this is a new ruling, and a good one from the pupils' point of view.\n\nOf the six Catholic teachers I have met, four were French Canadians totally unfit to teach English even to English speaking children. To teach Indian children was quite impossible. Out of a school of thirty-two pupils from grades I to V not one child could express the simplest sentence she read. I took this school from a teacher who had been here five years; his highest pupils were only in grades I & II.\n\nI said the ruling is a good one from the child's point of view but what of the teacher's position? She must be a fully qualified teacher from the White Dept. If she stayed in the White Dept she would eventually receive her superan-\nnutrition allowances. She has also her \"teacher's association\" to give her moral and legal support. She takes an Indian Dept school and loses her standing in the White Dept and is less than nothing in the Indian Dept. She has no recognition or protection of any description.\n\nElevation men, office boys and typists are all come under the protection and benefits of the Civil Service Act. But teachers, as myself often serving its aspect in sickness or health for sixteen years\u2014so long that any other line of business is now impossible are simply cut out by both government and church. Both have received the best of the teacher's years, yet both let her loose like the Indian does his dog at the end of the winter's work. His dog runs thro' the woods he will be\ncaught to secure the next position, but if he should die no one gives it a thought.\n\nI had decided to resign at the close of this term, but on both his grace the Archbishop & the Indians have begged me to remain I have promised to do so for one more year solely to see my two grade VII boys and one grade P girl - to whom I am teaching cooking and music - through school. The parents told me plainly they will never send their children to boarding school & that if I leave they will take their children out of school altogether. These children being exceedingly shy, I know would fail with a new teacher at this period. Having taught them through kindergarten and having known them for nine years I should know how they react to various situations. These children\nbeing deeply interested in their studies,\nthis news has made me feel the wrong\nI should be doing them in resigning\nthis June, unless the Dept decides\notherwise I will take them through\nthe 1938-39 terms. This sacrifice is\nnot as great as it may appear as I was\nonly going out to try to settle myself\non a potato patch before I became too\nold to dig a piece of ground.\n\nSections 142 are rather too long to quote,\nhas the Dept given a thought of the\ninjustices and impracticalities of such\nrulings.\n\nI fear the impracticability of it.\nWhen I was stationed on Lake Winnipeg,\nthe last summer mail came up about\nthe 18th of October. The first winter mail\nabout December 24th. The last winter mail\nMarch 30th. The first summer mail June 16th.\na matter of about two and a half months in tall & strong cut off from all outside communications. needless to say the teacher's salary does not permit of such luxuries as radios. Had the Dept wished to have sent me an official notice of dismissal or a month's notice. How would they have done so. The school returns were made out quarterly, the dismissed and resignation notices should be made out the same. Had His Grace not stepped me, this was my intention. I suppose I decided to resign at the end of March and only gave one month's notice. The Dept cannot not get another teacher in here until late May or early June depending on the roads, the roads are never used in winter & the ice covered is too dangerous. No! three months notice on either side is the only possible arrangement.\nNow take the question of the present arrangements. The teacher has lived for years with only Indians and perhaps a few half-breeds, she may or in my own case have had no higher commercial training. And after years of isolation from absolutely all refined society and commercial contacts to be compelled to ever think of her obtaining any kind of remunerative position. Now comes along an Inspector or Agent who tells a child like to her for some reason she requires an official letter of commendation. She has no avenue of appeal as a civil service committee or teachers association. It is no use appealing to the Board, it is not their superior. So no use appealing to the Dept., it is their own ruling.\n\nIt has taken the Dept. exactly 16 yrs $/monos to show me these regulations. It is to be hoped that young teacher get a copy at once so\nthat they can order their own accounts at another point. Now one does imagine that the teacher's salary is sufficient to enable her to move her freight and self out of the Reserve hundreds of miles from civilization at a moment's or even a month's notice. If I were told on this mail to go off the Reserve at once, I should have scarcely $3.65 p. to pay an expense that covered amount to at least $30.00 simply to get me to the railway. Few teachers I imagine go on to Reserves with bank accounts, and unless they have hearts of stone they certainly could not bank much if anything from their salaries. Allow me to quote just a few cost of living & travelling expenses of my own experience. I am only quoting from free trader's prices not the Hudson Bay Co.\n\nfood cost\n\nflour from 8 5.00 to $8.00 per lb\nsugar from 7.50 to 8.9.00 ave $8.00\nI am from 60\u00a2 to $1.25 per lb\n\nTea milk 80\u00a2 to 50\u00a2 per can\n\nPotatoes 75\u00a2 to 1.30 per lb ave 85\u00a2\n\nBread oil 40\u00a2 75\u00a2 per gal\n\nBread 15\u00a2 80\u00a2 per lb\n\nTravelling\n\nFrom Reserve to Railway $15.00\n\nRailway ticket to city ave 10.00\n\nHotel at reserve 6.00\n\nHotel in city per month ave 90.00\n\nThere are bare expenses for one way travelling.\n\nCity expenses are more burdensome to you.\n\nClothing is another item of far greater expense than that of city dwellers.\n\nThe teacher is also dispensable; she can hardly be expected to visit the sick in zero weather in city clothing.\n\nMay I now just briefly consider just exactly what the teachers position on an Indian Reserve is.\nFirst, she teaches an average of eight grades dividing them into seniors and juniors. She has to teach every child to understand English before she can commence teaching English subjects. A far more exhausting work than teaching English speaking children. She is expected to be a walking encyclopedia. If the R.C.M.P want information, first ask the Reserve teacher. The agent wants the fall crop report, ask the teacher to obtain it. The cattle have to be counted. Ask the teacher to do it. The history of the Wild life of the district is required, oh! just ask the teacher to get it. The Vital Statistics want a division register, make the teacher it.\n\nA body has to be buried ask the teacher to read the prayers. The weather may either be far below zero, a howling blizzard, pouring rain or choking heat & mosquitoes, no matter the teacher does not mind.\nThe Church wants an organist, choir master, prayer leader, sacristan, janitor and caretaker etc., all free of charge. Why? That's just what the teacher is paid on the Reserve for.\n\nThe Department wants an unlicensed physician surgeon & nurses also on one on the Reserve. All, just make the teacher the caretaker, and pay her an average of one dollar per week. For that she must teach school all day. Then after she will work in bad weather to visit the sick. If she is not too tired when she has finished she must cook her dinner\u2014many a time I have dined at 8 p.m. or 10 p.m. A man chopped off the toes of three toes at the first joints. I took sole charge of him & had him dressing again in 2\u00bd months another froze his legs solid up to the knees, he died not before a toe. The department is called out of bed to go out in pouring storms bitter cold or dreary days with mosquitoes (knowing to bring first pneumonia case) to attend pneumonia crisis of a woman in...\ndanger. Up one night, when back school the next day. But says the Dept: the dispenser is not supposed to take these responsibilities, the Dept: doctor is paid for such work, therefore, but what do the dispenser do, when communications are cut off for two weeks or more, even here it takes twenty-four hours to get the doctor up. Anyway the dispenser hears so much complaining about the expenses to the Dept: & how the Dept: objects to these expenses, etc., etc.\n\nThe dispenser wrote to send me any sick at all. My income for the past nine years has been one per year. The Indians are starving, etc., the teacher for something. \"But the Indians have rationed\" feet broad man about 65 yrs old, so frail he can only walk with the aid of a stick, receives 25 lbs of flour & 2 lbs of tea 4 lbs of bacon, in which is added 1 lbs of rice. I have pleaded many times for the poor old soul to have food that will give him a little warmth & strength.\nsuch as sugar, land, oatmeal, beans, and\nI am told \"He is getting a good ration and\nthat more is spent on this reserve than\nany other.\" I fail to see it. This reserve\nhas very bad relief since in the nine years\nthere have been none. The sick have had no\neffective ration until they have been serious\nenough to send the doctor & he himself\nhas ordered suitable nourishments. So\ndeficiencies of rations & have no real supplies,\nas I was given in Lake Winnipeg, such as\noatmeal rice, tea and flour, etc., & at least\nhave been asked for me to send a letter to\ndoctor for permission to purchase\nnourishments for the sick. In the mean\ntime who supplies the necessary food.\n\nnot only does the teacher save the Dept:\nfor far more than she cost it, but also\nthe R.C.M.P. Does the Dept's Police imagine\nthat an isolated Reserve can exist for\nyears and not have trouble worthy of\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 545-1, part 3)\nPolice notice, yet the teacher saves many dollars both to the Dept't Police by sheer bluff in some cases & by reasoning & pleading on others. She having absolutely no authority.\n\nThis is only an outline of the teachers' dispensers work in Northern Reserves. I have said nothing of the years of isolation, after years this fine ladies had only a dog for company. The salary of men who work in isolation is an absurd amount increased. It is not so with the Indian Day School teachers & dispensers. After all they are doing for their employers, far, far our above their salaries, doing it all gladly in the spirit of cooperation for the general good of the Indians, they know that any mail may bring them an official letter of dismissal, without warning without a care for their welfare.\n\nGentlemen, as related in the beginning...\nI am not pleading my own cause. There only one more year and my days will be finished. But I am pleading with all my heart for common justice for the younger teachers. My own experience can not possibly be unique. Please gentlemen in the name of humanity and justice reorganize the teachers status. Take them either right into the Indian Dept., with the same standing as all other Dept.'s servants or cause the Church to take full responsibility, making them absolutely Church servants. Although I suggest this alternative, I do not think it would be wise, owing to the amount of Reserve work to be done what does not concern the Church. The teacher's position now is an impossible one, she belongs to everyone yet she belongs to none.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPatricia Fuller T.O.S.T.\nTeacher & Superintendent\nSir,\n\nRe: 126-12-1\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter dated May 12th, last, with enclosure being a copy of letter received by the Department from Miss Patricia Fuller, Teacher, Waterhen Day School.\n\nIt is true that the Teacher's residence is of old construction and is not worth repairing. I have placed an amount of $2500.00 in estimates for a new teacherage. The inside walls of the school were washed on May 25th, see voucher No.1217 and are not in bad condition. However, school should be painted inside and out next year and an amount covering labour and material is placed in next year's estimates. The furniture was purchased for the Sister about seven years ago and is not adequate, but I would not suggest new furniture until a new teacherage is erected.\n\nThe Teacher has made repeated complaints about not receiving the articles she requisitions from the Department. From time to time she has asked for a certain drawing book, and others have been substituted, until now the desire for this special book has become an obsession. Flannelette has been shipped into this Reserve as soon as received from the Department. Yarn and needles have also been forwarded as soon as received. The Teacher has an attendance of six boys and three girls. Boy's pants were shipped into this Reserve to outfit all the boys and thirty yards of flannelette together with yarn should go a long way to outfitting all the children she has attending school, and as the articles of wearing apparel are made at home by the parents of the pupils, the month of November is early enough for these supplies to be shipped.\n\nAll families on this Reserve are on direct relief during the winter months and in my opinion the children would be better cared for in the boarding school. This also appears to be the visiting Priest's point of view, and is a point of contention between him and the Teacher.\n\nThere is not a resident Priest on the Waterhen Reserve. A travelling Missionary from Pine Creek School holds a mission on the Reserve three or four times a year and it appears to me that the Teacher could co-operate with the Missionary Priest during these times instead of getting into a \"battle royal\" every time he is on the Reserve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nIn regard to superannuation of teachers, the contents of Department letter were made known to her. The Teacher at the time of my visit was determined to resign at the close of the 1939 term, however, as this is a periodical threat, I do not place any stock in her intention.\n\nThe Teacher was very emphatic in stating that she has absolutely no interest in Department regulations. The intention of her writing was for the protection of younger Teachers coming after her with a view to making their condition easier on Reserves at outlying points. The living costs enumerated in her letter are those she paid at the Bloodvein Reserve during the years 1926-27 and the expenses shown also refer to travelling and hotel expenses during those years. The grocery costs and travelling expense are considerably lower at the Waterhen.\n\nThe Teacher also stated that she prefers isolation to city life and would not consider being moved to a Reserve where conditions might be more congenial. Her serious complaint is, that being only a member of the Third Order of St. Francis she is only a third degree Sister with little or no connection with the church, and she is not in line for superannuation as she is not a civil servant.\n\nIn summing up, I wish to say, that in my opinion the Teacher is \"bushed\". I also wish to refer to various reports to the Department in which I have stated that the Teacher is nervous and in need of a holiday. These outbursts are periodical, usually occurring during the long grind between Christmas and the end of the term. I have repeatedly told Miss Fuller to take full advantage of every holiday and get away from the Reserve even if the holiday is of only short duration. Her complaint is that she does not have the necessary funds, her claim being that the cost of living was too high to allow her sufficient money for holidays. This was investigated in her presence and a reasonable balance sufficient for holidays was shown. She then intimated that she was still paying the funeral expense of her parents who died many years ago. I concluded from her conversation along these lines that she has lived so long on isolated Reserves that she is afraid to go out into civilization. She complained of insults taken from young Priests on missions to the Reserve. These insults when sifted were nonsensical to a degree of foolishness.\n\nI would suggest that the Teacher be given more work to occupy her mind. From her letter it appears that she is overworked, such is not the case, as she is of a brooding temperament and broods if her time is not occupied.\n\nI enclose herewith requisition which I would ask the Department to kindly fill as soon as possible.\n\nThe following is the size and condition of the buildings:\n\nSchool.\nBuildings:\n\nSchool. 24' x 18' 12' stud.\nPorch 6' x 8'.\nAll frame, fair condition.\n\nHouse. Log, sided, unpainted 20' x 15'\nStorey and a half, poor condition.\nLog leantoo 15' x 12' poor condition.\nLog leantoo 15' x 15' poor condition.\n\nThe leantoo 15' x 12' is used for the storing of Department rations and material was purchased recently to repair this building. The accounts will be forwarded in due course.\n\nThe Teacher requested me to ask especially why she is not being furnished with graphic drawing books suitable for grades 6 and 7.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, September 9, 1938.\n\nRe: Waterhen School:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your report of the 5th instant, relating to conditions at the Waterhen Indian Day School, and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the comparatively small enrolment at this school, I am not at all sure that the Department is justified in keeping it open and in operation. It is just possible that the pupils now in attendance might be transferred to residential schools, although most of our residential schools, it would appear, are at the moment filled to capacity.\n\nI feel confident you will agree with me when I state that the Department would not be justified in spending the sum of $2,500.00 on the erection of a teacher's residence. I note, with interest, that all the Indians on the reserve are now in receipt of relief allowances. I am anxious to know if it would not be possible to have these Indians take out logs during the winter months and assist in the erection of a teacher's residence, on the understanding that the Department would purchase the roofing, windows, flooring, etc. Should the Indians consent, it is just possible we might have to allow those actually engaged in the work additional rations. Apart altogether from the economies effected, such a task would be apt to exercise a wholesome influence on the reserve. You might investigate\n\nJ. WAITE, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nthe possibilities of having a teacher's residence erected in this way.\n\nIn addition to this, I should like you to discuss with Inspector Hamilton the advisability of having the teacher transferred to another reserve. Your report has convinced me that this teacher has outgrown her usefulness on the reserve and is, as you say, for the time being, \"bushed\". Mr. Hamilton might see Archbishop Sinnott and discuss the whole subject very frankly with him. If the church authorities are unwilling to nominate a new teacher and if the Indians are unwilling to assist in the erection of a teacher's residence, I am inclined to think that the school should be closed and the pupils enrolled at residential schools in the province.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have asked myself Gabriel to leave school for the following reasons.\n\nFirst\u2014now that he is 14 years of age, he has the idea that he is too big a man to attend school, and accordingly acts so exceedingly foolish both in his work and conduct, as to upset the rest of the school. He not only wastes his own time but that of the other boys and mine also.\n\nSecondly\u2014his parents too frequently ask, for him, leave of absence. His father is sick, and there are five smaller children, he claims now he needs the boy's help.\n\nLastly\u2014I wish to enlist next spring. I desire to leave the school as early as possible to teach. However, Mr. Brown has not a teacher to take my place who has a knowledge of the Indian language; therefore...\nI do not feel happy in keeping a boy who is not only a nuisance and a bad example to all, but is holding up the work of the school.\n\nTrusting this explanation will be satisfactory,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPatricia Tucker T. P. F.\nOttawa,\nJune 3, 1940.\n\nDear Archbishop Sinnott:\n\nIn a letter dated May 25 Sister Patricia Fuller has tendered her resignation as teacher of the Waterhen River Indian Day School and states that she wishes to be relieved of her duties on the 30th instant. She is being advised that her resignation is accepted.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1940-41. The school will re-open on October 1, 1940. You will no doubt be interested in knowing that arrangements are being made for the erection of an addition to this school during the coming summer in order to provide living accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I had some hesitation in recommending a young lady for such a position, but Miss Lumsden is going to marry at no distant date a young man who lives on the edge of the Reserve.

I note from your letter that it is Miss Lumsden's intention to be married at some date in the near future. Under these circumstances I regret that, unless the present regulations are modified in regard to the non-employment of married women whose husbands are able to support them, the Department will be unable to continue Miss Lumsden's appointment longer than June 30, 1941.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

In view of all the circumstances, and the fact that Mrs. Campbell is an Indian, born on the Reserve, married at the Skowman church, children all baptized there, received her education up to Grade 4 on the Skowman Reserve, is a good type of woman, married to a good type of halfbreed, would it not be possible to make an arrangement with the Indian Department whereby their children could attend the Skowman school on the Reserve? This is only about a mile and a half distant, whereas the Mallard School, even if open, is 1/2 miles distant. The children are as follows:\n\nElsie, born August 16th, 1925,\nMartha, born August 5th, 1928,\nHelen born February 2nd, 1930,\nMaggie, born January 13th, 1936.\n\nI think that Mrs. Margaret McCreery of Waterhen P.O. would be as reliable as anyone in that district in connection with enquiries about building a teacherage.

This man is a halfbreed but the mother is an Indian and from the information we have available it appears that they are living off the reserve.\n\nThere is a possibility, of course, that if this halfbreed family is allowed to attend the Waterhen River School we will receive similar applications from other halfbreed families. Before making a decision in this matter I thought it advisable to write to you as you will be conversant with local conditions. I should appreciate your advising what action you consider should be taken.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

A. Hoare\nSuperintendent of Welfare Training\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of Feb. 26/42 No. 126-12-1 received. In answer, may I thank you for your courtesy in referring the subject to myself. But may I advise that half-breed children be not permitted to attend the above Day School.\n\nThe Pierre Campbell family mentioned in your letter are not only living off the Reserve, but are four miles from the school, while other half-breeds are living less than two miles from the school.\n\nIn the past I have found it very unsatisfactory to have half-breed and Indian children in the same school.\n\nFirst, the children do not mix well, everything wrong in\nschool or school grounds is doomed.\n\nTo the halfbreeds, they both the Indian pupils and their parents.\n\nExtremely important, while the Indian children & parents know that the day school is compulsory for them. The halfbreeds know this is not so for them, in an Indian school.\n\nTwelve years ago I had Miss Pierr\u00e9 Campbell's older children in school, at the time they lived on the Reserve, they attended classes just as usual themselves. With the news that the school discipline was seriously impaired, the Indian children felt the injustice of themselves being punished for missing classes, whereas the halfbreeds could do as they wished. My speaking to the parents made no impression, I was forced to appeal to the teacher,\n\nI have no wish to talk any more now.\n\nTreaty children in my school,\n\nWe are only twelve, but we are very happy together, the attendance is as perfect as human health will allow.\n\nWe do not wish outsiders separating our ever and peace.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(Signed) Patricia T.S.F\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are fourteen pupils enrolled and the grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Pupils |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 3      |\n| 2     | 2      |\n| 3     | 2      |\n| 4     | 3      |\n| 5     | 4      |\n\n14\n\nThe attendance in September was poor but this was due to the fact that most of the Indians were still out working for the white farmers. They got back in October and the attendance now is good.\n\nThe children appear to be fairly well along in their respective grades and the book work seen was neat. The children were all well dressed.\n\nThe school is in good repair except for the floor. If possible this should be renewed next year.\n\nA number of the seats are also past repairing and in poor condition. The teacher's desk is very old and badly racked. A new desk should be provided.\n\nA.G.

She replied by forwarding me the enclosed letter. Mr. Hoey thought it advisable to send this letter to you, so that you could consider the various matters that she mentions. I would draw your special attention to her suggestion that the school term be extended to the end of July and the holidays taken during August and September. I should appreciate having a reply when you have had an opportunity of studying the letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.G.

Instruction no 6 covers non Treaty children only of which I have none. If not on the quarterly Returns, where are the names of Treaty Treaty pupils to be reported.\n\nAbout twelve years ago one father brought his children back to the Reserve late for school.\nopening. The agent sent him a reprimand, not until the fall of 1942-43 had I any more truant pupils. Then in Oct. 1942 four children did not return until Oct. 26th last September seven pupils failed to report, two of which returned Oct. 18th and the last was not until Nov. 15th.\n\nAt the Treaty meeting of 1942 Mr. Haite impressed on the men that they were expected to go out to assist with the harvesting, but he did not say that on the day the school was closed, everyone was to rush off to town.\n\nThat fall when four pupils returned late nothing was said. Last fall seven pupils took from four to four & a half months vacation. Still no reproof was given. What will it be this fall?\n\nWhen I complained to Mr. Haite and Mr. Hamilton, that besides ruining the school discipline,\nit is impossible to teach properly\nwith half the pupils returning\nat different times. They answered,\n\"that the Indians must earn\ntheir living, and that if the\nwives want to go with their\nhusbands there is nothing to\nprevent them.\"\n\nUntil 1942, our women earned\ntheir living digging seneec\nroots, while the women and\nchildren kept the gardens and\nate from them, and also picked\nberries. The return of the children\nto school on time was taken\nfor granted. Now the discipline\nis so spoiled, the mothers ask\nfor their children to miss\nschool on every possible and\nimpossible excuse, especially,\nso, in this with the girls.\n\nThe mothers more than the\nfathers are absolutely indifferent\nto the benefits of education. This\nindifference has naturally spread\nto the children. This June\nwill be the second year that\na number of pupils will be\nunable to pass their examinations.\nThis failure is not only the\nresult of indifference, but of poor\nfeeding. During the winter of\n1942-43 only one family had\nvegetables, which had measured\nto each family the following:\nseeds sent via the Dept = 2 oz ea\nof carrots and turnips and 1/2 oz\nof onions. Both summers\nnothing could be seen in the\ngardens but weeds. The family\nwho had vegetables stayed home.\nThere were no crop reports made\nin 1942-43. There was simply nothing\nto harvest and so nothing to report.\nThe skin diseases and minor\nsicknesses among the children\nthis winter has been the worst\nin my fifteen years here.\n1943-44 is a ten months term.\nUp to date some pupils have already\nmissed three months. It would\ntake a smart\u2014besides a well fed!\nchild to pass a yearly examination without only a six months or less tuition. These children are neither.\n\nThere may be no law preventing mothers leaving the Reserve all the summer, but there certainly is a school act ordering children to return to school on the correct dates.\n\nI would like to suggest that the present term be extended until the end of July, and that the vacations be from July 28th to October 9th. This will keep the mothers and children on the Reserve during the garden growing season. The one week in October will allow parents time to return after the harvesting. We could take the Easter week to make up this one week.\n\nI would further wish to suggest that Mr. Poile be asked to speak strongly at the next Treaty meeting\u20141st on the duty.\nof parents keeping good gardens for the benefits to their families,\n2nd of the benefits of an education,\nand of the Indians obligation to the tax payers to use to the full these benefits. 3rd. That it is obligatory for all pupils to be present on the opening dates.\n\nAnother reason against these people leaving the Reserve in July is the fact that they find little or no work. The farmers have finished seeding and the harvest is not ready. Having no steady work, the young men get into trouble in poolrooms and beer parlors, while the girls pick up with strange service men.\n\nIt must be remembered that this Waterhen Band does not consist of Indians, but of treaty half-breeds\u2014and a very poor type.\n\nI have it on the authority of the priests, and the police, and\nalso from what these people themselves have told me, that even in harvest time, these men do not work steadily. With only one or two exceptions they are of no use to the farmers. Their contribution to the war effort is absolutely nil; neither do they benefit themselves or families. They do not bring home any new clothing, nor food supplies, nor even money, but have to get straight into debt at the store, much to the store keepers annoyance.\n\nI would further suggest that the police at Winnipegosis and Dauphin be asked to keep a closer watch on our young people, with authority to send home young men convicted of drink, and families whose mothers do not keep the children properly, especially the young girls.\nI beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPatricia T.O.S.F\nA.G. Hamilton Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Manitoba Inspectorate,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: 208-11, March 24, 1944, Sister Patricia's letter.\n\nIn reply to the above noted letter and enclosure being a letter addressed to the Department by Sister Patricia, Teacher, Waterhen Reserve, I beg to state that there is very little I can say in reply to same. It is the usual type of letter that has been received about this time of the year, over a period of years. It is true that I have encouraged Indians of all reserves to go out to work and I feel that they have been a great help to the farmers all over the Province. It is also true that in the majority of cases very little money was brought back to the reserve, although the average Indian is better clothed than he has been for some years. In fact many Indians are extravagantly dressed. The harvest and threshing operations, in many parts of Manitoba, were delayed last fall through rain, and after threshing Indians were occupied in cutting cordwood, until close to the opening of the winter fishing season. This condition is due to the war and will not be righted until the war is over. The Indians, even from the most inaccessible reserves, were out last summer seeking work. In all my reports on this situation I have pointed out that gardens are bound to suffer, and especially in these reserves where transportation in and out is costly. The Indian will not work out and leave his wife and family at home. Neither will the wife stay home while her husband is away. The whole family moves out to work and all the family work if work is to be obtained. Sister Patricia is aware of this condition and, as you know, it has been pointed out to her that this will most probably right itself after the war when the Indian's services will not be in such great demand.\n\nOver.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge your letter 126-12-1, dated March 20th, together with one from the Sister in charge of the Waterhen School. I am returning her letter with my reply.\n\nSince receiving this letter I requested a report from Agent Waite and attach a copy of the same for your information.\n\nMr. Waite has given a full report and there is little I can add. We have tried to co-operate with the Provincial authorities in regard to farm labor and as stated by Mr. Waite, I believe the Indians have rendered splendid help. They probably have not taken much money home; but they have lived well and generally speaking are well clothed.\n\nThe Sister's suggestion in delaying the holidays until the end of July might prove beneficial. I would recommend that it be given a trial.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnclos.\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sister Patricia:\n\nThe Department received your letter of the 11th ultimo, with reference to conditions on the Waterhen River Reserve. We forwarded the letter to Mr. A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, for his comments and he has discussed the letter with Indian Agent Waite.\n\nIt appears that conditions now existing are due in a large part to the war and they are difficult, if not impossible, to overcome at the present time. As you know, there has been a great demand for labour and consequently many Indians have left the reserve and obtained work elsewhere. In most of these cases the wife and family insist on accompanying the head of the house. While the money they earn is probably not always wisely spent, at the same time reports received indicate that the Indians are much better clothed than they have been for some years.\n\nThe Department is interested in your suggestion that the school remain in operation until the end of July and that the two months' annual holidays be taken during the months of August and September. It has been decided to try this for the current year. A careful check should be kept on the attendance during the month of July with a view to ascertaining if better attendance is secured when the holidays are taken during August and September.\n\nSister Patricia,\nWaterhen River Indian Day School,\nSkownan, Man.\nthan if they were taken during July and August. This will serve as a guide for future years.\n\nI desire to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of your bringing reserve conditions to the attention of the Departmental officials.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOctober 16, 1945\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have had a suggestion from Mrs. R. Adam, of Skowman, Manitoba, that since there are only seven Indian children in attendance at your school at Skowman, and since there are 16 Half-Breed children who have never been to school, that arrangements might be made to have the latter attend the Indian School at Skowman. Mrs. Adam has been advised by Sister Patricia that she would be willing to take the Half-Breed children of the district, provided:\n\n1. The Department of Education would furnish supplies and texts, as is done by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\n2. That these children attend regularly.\n\n3. That the Department of Education make provision for desks.\n\n4. That she receive remuneration in accordance with her years of teaching.\n\n(All of this, of course, contingent upon the approval of her employers.)\n\nWe are approaching you with a view to finding out whether we can make some such arrangements as those suggested above. We shall be glad to have your views at your earliest convenience, so that if there is a possibility of coming to an agreement, provision can be made to get the children into the school as soon as possible.\n\nAwaiting your reaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA/Superintendent of Education.\n\nCKR/BT\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Superintendent of Education, Province of Manitoba, in connection with 16 half-breed children attending Waterhen Day School.\n\nNine Indian children are at present attending the Waterhen Day School, and this would appear to be all the children of school age on the reserve. A number of children from Waterhen Reserve are attending the Pine Creek Residential School.\n\nI hesitate to make recommendations in this matter. The teacher, Sister Patricia, seems at times to have all the responsibility she is capable of standing with the few pupils she has at present. It seems to me that by the end of the teaching year comes around she is a nervous wreck. There is a possibility that a larger school would keep her mind off herself and have a beneficial effect. It would seem from the attached letter that the teacher has been approached and is willing to accept these additional pupils, subject to certain conditions.\n\nJ. White,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 5th November, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Saite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to 16 half-breed children attending the Waterhen Day School. I note from your letter that their attendance would not hinder the attendance of the Indian children who are our first concern. If the Provincial Government authorities are willing to accept the teacher's conditions, the Department has no objection to the half-breed children attending the School. As far as we are concerned, we are prepared to accept any amount which the Provincial authorities consider reasonable.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-12-1, Ottawa, November 5, 1945.\n\nIn reply to the above noted letter, I wish to advise that I interviewed Mr. Rogers, A/Superintendent this date, in connection with the 16 half-breed children entering the Waterhen Day School.\n\nThe amount agreed upon was $200.00 a year. This amount, apparently, is being paid at other schools where half-breed children are in attendance. I asked Mr. Rogers to have the cheque made out in favour of the Receiver General of Canada and forwarded to the Portage Office. The Department will then be able to make payment to Sister Patricia if desired. Text books will be purchased and forwarded to the Sister and eight double desks will be shipped in her name to the reserve. The Provincial Attendance Staff will see that the children attend school regularly.\n\nIt is not likely that the children will attend the school until after the Christmas term.\n\nWill you please advise if I am to inform Sister Patricia of the arrangement.\n\nJ. Weite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 25, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.,\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to half-breed children attending the Waterhen Day School.\n\nI note that the Provincial Government is prepared to pay $200.00 a year for the tuition of these children. If this amount is forwarded to this office it will have to be deposited to Casual Revenue and we would not be in a position to make any payment from it to Sister Patricia.\n\nI think that you should discuss the matter with Sister Patricia and if she feels that she is entitled to part of the amount we are prepared to agree to any reasonable decision that you and she reach. In that event, the amount which she might be allowed could be sent to her direct by the Provincial Government and the balance forwarded to this office for deposit to Casual Revenue.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nMay 28, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

This morning a further letter has been received from the Chief Inspector of Schools regarding this request. The letter is attached hereto and I would be pleased to be advised in this matter.\n\nA few days ago Reverend Father Lavigne telephoned that he would suggest the closing of the Waterhen School for this year, as he was having difficulty obtaining the services of a teacher.\n\nJ.

Hamilton,\nInspector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nRoom 538 Dominion Public Building,\nMain Street,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Hamilton:\n\nRe: Skownan\n\nLast year we had an arrangement with your Department whereby the Non-Treaty children attended your school at Skownan. A grant was made to your Department for the services performed in the amount of $2.50 a day. The arrangement was very satisfactory. Treaty and Non-Treaty children together just made up a good school.\n\nThe people of the community have been pressing us to do something about getting the children to school again this year. We shall have to do something immediately. If your Department is not planning to re-open the school making possible a renewal of the arrangements of last year, we should like to get the use of your buildings and send a teacher in to open up before Winter begins. We can get another building, but it would be far less suitable than yours. There is another advantage in getting use of the existing building in that there is housing for the teacher.\n\nIf we have the use of your building I think we could get a teacher to go in and I know we can get the co-operation of some of the people in the community to provide fuel and supplies. I would suggest that if you are not going to open the school this year that you permit this Department to use the building and teachers, and we, in turn will take care of the education of the Indian children in the community. I think we can arrive at some arrangement which will be mutually satisfactory. My information is that there are about 25 children in all with a little more than half of them Treaty children.\n\n(Over)\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from Mr. Rogers and is self explanatory.

It should be understood that this use is authorized until such time as we can provide a teacher for this school.\n\nIn return for the use of the school building and the teacherage, the Provincial Department of Education will take care of the education of the Indian children in this community. We will continue to provide the necessary textbooks and school supplies required by the Treaty Indian children only. The total Indian pupilage at this school during the 1945-46 academic year was 9. Therefore, will you please instruct Mr. Indian Agent Waite to carefully check all requisitions coming from this school to insure that supplies are being provided only for the Treaty children in attendance. All efforts of Mr. Waite to explain this situation to the Indians would be appreciated.

He advised that a teacher had been sent to the Waterhen Reserve by his Department of February 4th. Indian Affairs Branch had not been advised. Mrs. Langhan was stopped at Winnipegosisis by the Inspector of Schools for the district, and informed that a teacher had already been appointed.\n\nMr. Rogers suggested that Mrs. Langhan be transferred to a school at Meadowland, under the Manitoba Dept. of Education, as the girl appointed to the Waterhen Reserve Day School by his Department, had become settled. I inquired if the girl was Roman Catholic. It appears that she is Protestant and I suggested that she be moved to Meadowland School, as she is already in the employ of the Dept. of Education, and Mrs. Langhan, who was recommended by the Catholic Church, be allowed to take over the duties of teaching at Waterhen Day School.\n\nThis Mr. Rogers agreed to do, and the Department will be further advised in due course.\n\nJ.

N. Paget Esq.\nChief Accountant\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of September the 14th 1925 stating that I was in error about the payment of service as Distributor of Medicine, for which I stated was $45.00 per quarter, and for which cheque of $45.00 had never been received at that date.\n\nIn reply to this I must say that the cheque of $45.00 in question that I claim is for payment of service as Distributor of Provision for the June quarter 1925.\n\nWhen I wrote to you on Aug. the 25th claiming $45.00, I was under the impression that I was receiving $45.00 for Medicine, and that the $12.50 cheque was for provision, as stated to me by the Indian Agent, but I see now that it was changed about when he explained it to me.\n\nI hope you will see that this matter is straightened out.\n\nI remain\nYours Truly\n\nAristole D'Amour\nOttawa, December 1st, 1925.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th ultimo, I beg to say that previous to March 31st, 1925, you were allowed salary as teacher of the Waterhen River Indian Day School at the rate of $600.00 a year. This amount was paid on a basis of ten teaching months in the school year. In addition you were allowed bonus at the rate of $150.00 a year which was also paid on a basis of ten teaching months. These two amounts made a total of $750.00 which you were paid for your services as teacher.\n\nPayment of bonus to teachers of Indian Day Schools was discontinued on March 31st last but from April 1st 1925 your salary was increased by $150.00. Since that date you have been paid salary at the rate of $750.00 a year which you will note is the same amount that you received when you were drawing bonus. This amount is paid on a basis of ten teaching months in the year and therefore for quarter ending June 30th, in which there were three months, you were paid three-tenths of $750.00 or $225.00. For quarter ending September 30th in which there was one teaching month, you were paid one-tenth of your salary, or $75.00. There is therefore, no balance due you as teacher.\n\nIn addition to your salary as teacher you are allowed the sum of $50.00 a year for issuing provisions, medicines, etc.,. This is paid in quarterly instalment, and payment for the June and September quarters has been made. There is therefore no balance due you in connection with this.\n\nI trust that this letter will fully satisfy you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\n\nAnatole D'Aoust, esq.,\nTeacher,\nWaterhen Indian Day School,\nSkowman, Man.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6248, file 545-5, part 1)\nSir,\n\nIn connection with Indian Boarding Schools to which per capita grants are paid for the board, lodging, clothing and education of Indian children, I have the honour to inform you that the Department desires to have the following requirements insisted upon, viz:-\n\n1st. Comfortable lodging should be provided and sleeping apartments for girls and boys to be entirely disconnected, well ventilated, and kept scrupulously clean.\n\n2nd. A sufficiency of wholesome and nutritious food to the extent of three meals a day.\n\n3rd. Suitable clothing for winter and summer and change of under-clothing once a week at least.\n\nTo secure these the Department instructs, Everything connected with the institution to be regularly or periodically enquired into, approved of, and reported on by the Indian Agent for the locality once a month, and the schools to be subject to his inspection more frequently if he deems it necessary.\n\nI have the honour, etc.\n\n(Sgd) A.H. Forget.\nAsst. Commr.\n\nE. McColl Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nI presume that Mr. Adam bases the present claim on the grounds that the school was closed by the Department and for this reason the articles enumerated are of no further use to him, the school was closed by the Department, but with the consent, advice and concurrence of the Roman Catholic Church under whose auspices it was operated, and I am of opinion that if Mr. Adam has any claim it is against that body.\n\nMany of the articles in the account are such as are required in ordinary family use and as Mr. Adam has a large family I cannot see that it will be any hardship for him to retain them or dispose of them as he may see fit, with reference to the dwelling it is customary for teachers leaving a reserve to dispose of their dwelling to the incoming teacher and no doubt Mr. Adam will take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nFinally, I am of opinion that Mr. Adam has no claim in law, or equity, against the Department and that the claim should not be entertained. Should you think otherwise and decide that all or part of the items should be assumed by the Department I would recommend that no action be taken until a valuation can be fixed by an officer of the Department as the prices asked are in my opinion excessive.\n\nI have the honour, &c.\n\n(Sgd) S.R.

Adam, amounting to $890.90, I beg to report as follows:\n\nI have made a diligent search through the files in this office and can find no data that would support the account; all I find points the other way. Neither can I find any reference as to the conditions on which the school was started; I find a letter written by Mr. A.E. Forget, Asst. Indian Commissioner, to Mr. R. McColl, Inspr. of Indian Agencies, of which I herewith enclose a copy which would lead me to suppose that the Department accepted no financial responsibility other than a per capita grant; no other inference can be drawn from the opening clause of the letter attached.\n\nI also find from a letter of Mr. McColl, to Mr. Martineau dated Feb. 10th, 1890, that the Department refused to pay an account of $185.00 made by Mr. Adam for the erection of a teacher's dwelling on the ground that the expenditure was not authorized and that no provision had been made for it in the estimates. I cannot find that this claim was again rendered which would lead me to suppose that Mr. Adam had concluded that the claim was not good against the Department.\n\nHon. David Laird,\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo and enclosure, being an account from Mr. J.H. Adam, ex-principal of the Water Hen Boarding School, amounting to $890.90 for buildings, etc., and to say that we have no data in this office by which the legitimacy of Mr. Adam's claim can be gauged. I am therefore returning the said account and would be obliged to have a report upon any items which you think ought to be considered, and in each case stating the amount which would be a reasonable compensation and also making a general report upon the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n(Sgd) D.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: The enclosed report on water supply.\n\nUp to last year water was taken from a small spring near the school. This water was used by many on the reserve. All this for the past four years was quite unfit to drink. Last year it went completely dry. I myself have to pay 25\u00a2 per barrel of water, at this price, I can not afford to supply the pupils with water for washing dirty hands after recesses, and drinking, two very serious problems. So dirty hands means soiled books, the Indian child deserves much drinking water, which I have ever encouraged. For fear Indians owning horses, can easily get water, but for others it is certainly\nhard for them to pay for water, which means the lowering of sanitary conditions. They could not afford much water for washing either bodies or clothing.\n\nI strongly suggest that a well be dug this spring. The men, I know, will do the work, if the Dept. will supply the cribbing. Yes, it will cost a few dollars, but not nearly as many as future hospital bills will cost, if these Indians are forced to continue to drink water in which cows stand in, and use as a toilet. This is a daily fact. Even to get clean, pure water, mothers have an average of 5 miles to go when the men are away. This is quite a problem for young mothers.\n\nI seriously think the time for getting things done is past; Ottawa waited, and correctly so, that we can not afford medicines & hospital bills,\" yet, what am I, as dispenser, to do, with this ghastly water condition, no child under 14 yrs of age has been vaccinated or inoculated, some years ago I had just case of typhoid, but I had, then, medicines, and several case cases. Now\nI have no such things.\n\nI wonder if you would be interested in a little measure I have taken to conserve paper and needles.\n\nSome years ago when orders came, \"sandbags were not to be used in future\" as they were considered unhygienic. In some schools this may have been true, but not in mine, as wet and dry bags were compulsory, which were washed every week. I soon realized at seeing so much paper wasted by little ones unable even to write their letters, so I gave them back their slates using white chalk instead of slate pencils, chalk being rubbed off instead of washed. Teachers who are advanced sufficiently to use writing books, still use slates or pieces of small blackboard for drill work. Next year, three little ones will commence school, they will not have writing books until they enter grade 1. I figure this will be a saving of an average of 14 books during the term, quite a consideration if all schools did the same during the\npresent paper shortage.\n\nErasers were so often getting lost and swept up, that I have cut all erasers in halves, and have tied short strings thro' the thick part & a little stick on the other end of the string, so each eraser has its owner's initials on it. Further each pupil has his own pencil box, and at each recess or closing time I sort if each box has its little felt meaning eraser, since in a general settle of boxes, to show me what our fingers are in, I had found that whole erasers were being destroyed. Now, being fairly small to start with, they are being neither destroyed or lost.\n\nI remain\n\nyours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6248, file 545-5, part 2)\nOttawa,\nMay 1, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I am writing to Indian Agent Waite with a view to ascertaining what arrangements can be made for water for the Waterhen River School.\n\nThe section of your letter which refers to your work as a dispenser is being brought to the attention of the Medical Branch.\n\nI note, with interest, the efforts that you are making to economize in the use of school material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir, Re: 126-12-5, May 1st 1942\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter as above noted in which you advise that Sister Patricia has asked for a well to supply her with drinking water.\n\nIt is true that the water in Waterhen lake is very low and I am very doubtful if a well could be dug to sufficient depth to obtain a supply of water. The situation at this reserve is very similar to Lake St. Martin where the school and residence are built close to the Lake shore.\n\nThe experience at Lake St. Martin was that water seemed unobtainable in close proximity to the lake shore and I am afraid that the situation would be the same at Waterhen. However I will look further into this matter at treaty payments and will try to obtain a 12' drill and test the ground in the school area.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                        | AMOUNT | AMOUNT |\n|----------|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|          | Combination Heater & Cooker -      |        |        |\n|          | with Reservoir                     | 29     | 85     |\n|          | Charges                            | 29     | 85     |\n|          |                                    | 1      | 70     |\n|          |                                    | **31** | **55** |\n\nShipped To:\nSister Patricia, T.O.S.F.,\nWaterhen Indian Day School,\nWinnipegosis, Manitoba.\n\nAuthority: 136-12-5\nAllotment: 16\nVoucher: M.J.B.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

As soon as I am in receipt of a reply the matter will again be taken up with the Department.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDecember 10, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-12-5, November 3, 1943.\n\nWith reference to Department letter above noted, and further to my letter of 5th instant, I wish to advise that the following are the approximate costs of reflooring the Waterhen Day School.\n\n500 feet of flooring $37.00\n4 pcs. 2 X 4 - 20 $4.00\nNails 10 lbs. $.60\nLabour laying floor $10.00\nFreight to reserve 1200 lbs. @ .75\u00a2 per 100. $9.00\n\n$60.60\n\nCosts can only be given approximately as lumber yards cannot guarantee material. The above price is for 4\" No. 3 spruce or cheap fir.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 14, 1943.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nRe: Repairs to Floor, Waterhen School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 10, in which you submit a statement indicating the approximate cost of reflooring the Waterhen Indian Day School.\n\nIf there is, in the Waterhen district, a man capable of undertaking this work, it would be appreciated if you would employ him and have the work completed at the earliest possible date. It is noted that the cost is not likely to exceed $60.00.\n\nR. A.

This appears to be the first intimation the Department has received that a house is being erected for the teacher's use. We note, however, that the Indians have the building erected and require the lumber, hardware, etc., to complete it.\n\nIn view of your recommendation that this material be supplied, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantities of lumber, shingles, doors and window frames and hardware, as enumerated in the bill of material for which you obtained prices. The tenders which you forwarded for the material required are returned herewith, for your information and to be attached to the vouchers for payment. If there are any other firms from which you desire to obtain prices, you should do so and in any event the materials should be purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is understood that when this material is supplied the Indians will do the work of finishing the house without cost to this Department. When forwarding your accounts for the material, please furnish a brief statement descriptive of the house erected, giving dimensions and other particulars. The total expenditure for material to finish this house is not to exceed $300.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclos.\n\nA.

The Reports may not be filled up as they should be, but as I never saw a complete form, I had no idea as to how they should be done. You will, therefore, kindly excuse mistakes. It will be seen from my Reports that the number of School days fell far short of the 216, but it must be taken into consideration that I am a missionary who has to travel a great deal, in order to preach the Gospel to the wandering people scattered over this vast district. I have not yet found any man or woman to whom I could entrust the tuition of the children during my absence. In fact, we had not the funds for a school teacher's pay, but now that his lordship assures me that the government will willingly make over a grant of $100 towards defraying the expenses incurred in the tuition of the Indian children, I think I can secure a teacher to carry on the school work during my absence.\nThere are quite a large number of scholars during the summer when the Indians are here. It is most to be regretted that the Indians cannot stay longer in summer, but owing to a scarcity of food they find it impossible to live together at the fort for any length of time. The Indians of York Factory are the Cree Indians, and are Christians. They barter their furs with the Hudson's Bay Company for goods & provisions, but as a rule they are poor & find existence a hard struggle.\n\nI should be much obliged if the Dept. would send me the Daily Registers, Forms for Quarterly Reports &c. as soon as possible, so that I may be able to use them next summer. Hoping that the enclosed reports will be satisfactory.\n\nI remain\n\nyours truly\n\nR. Harris\nC.M.S. Missionary.\nOTTAWA, 2nd May, 1901.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th February last relative to the work in connection with the Indian school conducted by you at York Factory, and in reply to that portion thereof which refers to the grant to this school, I beg to say that it is one of six schools in the Diocese of Moosonee for which the Government has provided a grant of $1200.00, being $200.00 for each school, which sum is yearly placed to the credit of the Moosonee Church Extension Fund.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nExd.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 22nd September, 02\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the report which appeared in this morning's \"Citizen\" on the address delivered by His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin at All Saint's Church in this city last evening, I beg to say that the same is incorrect in so far as the statement that the Government did nothing for the Indian of Hudson's Bay is concerned, and that consequently in training and educating them, great responsibility rested upon the Church. For a number of years past the Department has been contributing the sum of $1200.00 annually at the rate of $200 for each of the six following schools: Moose Fort, Albany, York, Rupert's House, Fort George and Fort Resolution. This money is sent in a lump sum in March of each year to the Royal Trust Company, Montreal to be deposited to the credit of the Moosonee Church Extension Fund. I consider that it is hardly fair to the Department that such statements should go unchallenged.\n\nMartin Bruce\nBishopstowe, Kenora, Ont.\nNov. 12, 1910.\n\nThe Hon. Frank Oliver,\nOttawa.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\n(2) Split Lake and York Factory.\n\nThese Indians, about 350 at each place, have now been taken into Treaty and schools promised, but as yet nothing has been done. I am most anxious to have good Day Schools at each point.\n\nIt may in time be necessary to have boarding schools at each place and as the Episcopal Church is the only body that has engaged in Mission work in these places (we have had missions at York over 60 years and Split Lake over 15 years) I hope that in the event of such they would be placed under our control.\n\nI am most anxious to assist the Department in every possible way and shall gladly give you all the information necessary re sites, buildings, &c.\n\nJ. Keewatin\nOttawa, 17th November 1910.\n\nMy Lord:\n\nRegarding schools at Split Lake and York Factory I would be glad to have any information you can give me as to the establishment of day schools at these points, the number of Indians and whether they are permanently or temporarily resident.\n\nYours very truly\n\nHis Lordship\nThe Bishop of Keewatin.\nOttawa, November 25, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 13th instant in reference to the erection of day school buildings at Split Lake and York Factory.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Mr. Sommers, who visited these posts during the last summer, will be written to and asked to submit his report at once. In the meantime any suggestions that Your Lordship may have to offer in regard to sites, style of building, method and means of construction, etc., will be gladly received.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Kenora,\nKenora, Ont.\nOTTAWA, NOVEMBER 24, 1910.\n\nREV. SIR,\n\nI beg to call your attention to official letter of April 18th, last, in which you were asked to look fully into the matter of the erection of a school-house at Split Lake and report upon your return from making the treaty payments. The Department would like to have this report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYou should also make a similar report on the situation at York Factory, keeping these reports separate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nREV. J. SEEMAN,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nBishopstowe, Kenora, Ont.,\nDec. 9, 1910.\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd. ult. re school at Split Lake and York Factory. I may say that the latter place there is a good school belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co., but which has been used by the Mission for over twenty years. It would not be necessary to erect another, at least not at present, but they would require supplies, etc.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. Keewatin.\nSir,\n\nIn regard to the question of erecting a School House at York Factory, I beg to report as follows:\n\nNo building is needed for the present as the Church Missionary Society has a very fair building sufficiently spacious which can be made warm and comfortable and will answer the purpose until the Reserve is surveyed and we can definitely ascertain the best permanent site.\n\nMy remarks in regard to the situation at Split Lake sent under separate cover apply with equal force in this connection. The Indians are not too insistent on this matter. They wish to be independent of the Missionary Society to have a school house all their own, and to have it on their Reserve which has not yet been located. The speedy erection of such a building would have good effect because it would prove stronger than words that the Department intends to keep all the pledges of the Treaty made with them last summer. They could easily reason from one thing granted to the granting of other things in due time. At present it is a case of faith without any practical evidence except the payments of last August.\n\nThe School is at present under the supervision of the Rev Mr Faries an intelligent gentleman of good education and as far as I can learn of good influence with the people. He has School material sent by the Church but when the Payments are made next summer a supply of School Material should be sent in for future use.\nWhen in the wisdom of the Department it is thought fit to erect the School nothing better can be done than to make a grant for that purpose and ask the Rev R. Faries of York to carry out the work. I think that the cost at York will be about \u00a3700.00.\n\nThere is this difference between this place and Split Lake. Any Government boat going to Hudson's Bay might take in all lumber required. The rates should this plan be adopted I cannot give. To my own mind the old plan of cutting logs and sending in only what is absolutely needed viz doors windows nails and Mica Roofing is the surer plan.\n\nIn conclusion I do not see any special need of haste in the matter only this that all correspondence is necessarily slow and the wise man takes time by the forelock and does the preliminary work without delay.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nJohn Semmens\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nYork Factory, Hudson's Bay\nVia West Selkirk, Ont.\nDecember 16th, 1910\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Dept. Sec.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen the York Factory Indians were taken into Treaty last August, the government promised to provide for the education of the children. The Anglican Mission at York Factory has always attended to the education of the children, receiving from the Government every year $200.00, which sum was sent to the Bishop of Keewatin. Now that the government are going to provide a School for the Indians, I desire to know how much salary will be allowed for the teacher. And further, I should like the money sent direct to me so I shall have to arrange about the School & the teacher.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.J. Hume, Missionary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 30, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not as yet decided to erect a new building at York Factory. Rev. Mr. Gammans, who will visit the locality next summer, is too look further into the matter and the Department will await a report from him.\n\nSince the school at this point is now within the Treaty limits a salary of $300.00 will be paid the teacher, but no returns have been received from this school since March 31st, last. As soon as the returns are received payment will be made at the rate above mentioned. As this school is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England the Department cannot without the consent of the authorities change the present system of payment of salaries, which is made direct to the Bishop of the Diocese.\n\nI may say that the Department will try to arrange to send in some stationery, etc., for your school next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. Paries,\nMissionary,\nYork Factory,\nHudson's Bay,\nVia West Selkirk, Man.\nOttawa, May 29, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to the correspondence had with you in regard to the erection of new school buildings in the district visited by you when you paid treaty last year I beg to say that the Department would like you to give both Mr. Calverley and Mr. Watson full instructions in respect to the information that they should gather and reports that they should make regarding the schools in the districts in which they will pay treaty this year. As you are quite familiar with all that has been undertaken in both districts the Department considers it advisable to ask you to give these necessary instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. Semmens,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, May 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nKindly advise the Department whether the day school at York Factory was in operation at the time of your visit last year. No mention is made of it with the other schools in your annual report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Calverley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Keewatin.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Rev. R. Laries of York Factory finds that his work prevents him giving the attention necessary to the Day School there. He desires to have a teacher for his school.\n\nWill the Department give the usual grant of $500 a year to this school? We have a lady teacher, Miss Collins ready to go if this salary is forthcoming, but cannot send her without.\n\nMiss O. was some years ago in the Indian school at Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca and I understand did good work and gave satisfaction. If granted would the Dep't make any allowance for Miss O.'s travelling expenses as the cost is heavy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 2, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 27th ultimo stating that Rev. R. Paries desires to have a teacher for the York Factory Day School and asking if the Department will give a grant of $500.00 a year to this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be glad to have Miss Collins take charge of this school and will allow her a salary at the rate of $500.00 per year. The Department regrets that it cannot make any allowance for her travelling expenses.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nYork Factory, Manitoba\nTo the Department of Indian Affairs, Sep Oct 2, 1914\nMr. McLennan Sec'y.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI cannot allow the present opportunity of direct mail service, to pass without writing to you something of the conditions here re - the Winter teaching. You will remember I came here this summer under the direction of Bishop Loftus, to take over the work of teaching the Indian School, as a Government worker, with the understanding I was to receive from you five hundred a year.\n\nIn your blank forms for Quarterly Returns it plainly states no salary is paid until these are filled out and sent to the Department.\n\nOf course I knew this from past experience, but who would dream to ask for a moment; \"Is the school kept open all the year?\" when the salary of five hundred was to be received. It was to me a shock I can not easily get over, when during September I went heat to find that not only was there no wood but more could be given, or bought.\n\nI made an appeal to the Indian chief, who said\nthe Indians were going to take away all the children away but 2 or 3 & they would not get wood, + as the responsibility of the wood was thrown upon me, I appealed to your Agent; Major Howard of Ft Nelson, through whose prompt reply + liberal offer to pay for wood, kept me from going out in the \"fall\" Canoes. I tried but failed to buy any, the Indians got about 15 or 20 poles, + the three o'clock scholars have gathered wood + chips. The senior boys picked up debris of an old sidewalk, + we purchased axes + chopped this up, but I see no possible outlook for heating a school even to Christmas. We managed to get through the first quarter, + I trust my returns will reach the Department with this mail, but the outlook for school this Winter is as dark as night. It is through no fault of mine, then what about my salary? I have no place of residence, only with the missionary in charge, for which I pay $3.00 a week for my board + lodging.\n\nThe Indians have nearly all gone off to the bush + I have begun the second quarter with 17 names on the register, a number more are leaving this week + more when the mail packet returns on the 15th.\nOct 9th Seeing my letter has not gone, I will finish & send by the first opportunity. The attendance at school is so much decreased in members, interest or otherwise that there will be nothing I fear to report at the close of this term. I have the last Quarter's Returns to the missionary in charge to mail to you at Rt Nelson. Personally I thought I should have sent them to your agent Major Howard for his signature but Rev. Faris said No, he would sign & mail them. Will you please instruct me by return of mail, what I shall do with this Quarter's papers, & please write direct to me, either through your agent or straight to me at York. Please do not fail, & may I ask you as a personal favour not to show this letter or answer it to anyone but me. I am obliged to live in the house with the missionary in charge, & do not want to provoke his displeasure. There is absolutely no other accommodation. The Indians will not be back before next June, & imagine me, remaining in this uninviting undesirable place with no school all these months, in order to teach three months in what is called summer. Now Conscientiously & frankly I say I do not want to do this another year. If you will favour me with another school where the work goes on the year round.\nI am willing to take it; or the work of nurse or matron, but I prefer teaching, however I trust you do will do me this kindness, & provide one with employment.\n\nWhen the Bishop was here, he said if I should so desire, he would await on the Department for my salary, & back for one \u00a325 quarterly, I gave him a letter to hand to them so to that effect, because I thought you would not wish to be burdened with my financial affairs.\n\nI have also written to him that owing to conditions etc here I should be glad of a change another year.\n\nI cannot afford my expenses for transportation, unless they were advanced & then deducted from my salary.\n\nWhy might I not have a \"Pass\" as (I believe) some other Government workers have. I only mention this because of necessity. Hoping Gentlemen you will answer. I remain your obediently,\n\nIda E Collins (Deaconess)\nTeacher of York Indian School\nOttawa, November 10, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd ultimo I beg to say that your salary will be paid for the year and cheques will be sent to the Right Rev' J. Lofthouse, Bishop of Keewatin. You will be expected to send in quarterly returns showing the attendance, if any, during the time that you are at York Factory.\n\nThe Department regrets that it cannot assist you in the matter of travelling expenses either going to or returning from the school and Bishop Lofthouse was so informed in May, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ida E. Collins,\nTeacher,\nYork Factory School,\nYork Factory, Man.\nMiss Collins who was appointed teacher for the Indian School at York Factory has resigned and left the work.\n\nI would ask that the Rev. P. Harris be re-appointed as school teacher as he will now be able to devote more time to the school.\n\nMiss Collins had to pay her own expenses out and it cost her $140 from 4-5 to Ootibisk. I think the Department should pay the whole or part of this. We paid her expenses in nearly $100 but cannot pay the other. I should be greatly obliged if you could do anything in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nSIR,\n\nEnclosed you will find an official Cheque of this Department in payment of the account or service shown upon its face. It should be presented at the Bank for payment as soon as it is received by the person in whose favour it is drawn. If any correspondence becomes necessary with reference to this payment, kindly refer to the number, amount and date of the cheque, and address your communication to \"The Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\"\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of Aug 5th. May I be allowed to say that I think it very hard upon Miss Collins to have to pay her own travelling expenses, and that the Dept should make some allowance. It would be quite impossible to get a teacher to take up this work if they have to pay their own expenses in and out, and we cannot pay them.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Faries appointment as teacher I note you say he will be paid $450 per an. I cannot consent to Mr. Faries doing this work unless he is paid the same rate as other teachers viz $500, as he is quite as capable, and gives the same time to the work as any other teacher.\n\nAn additional enclosed cheque as there is a mistake I think Mr. Marshall's grant being $500 per an.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Leeward\nOttawa, August 5, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 30th ultimo stating that Miss Collins, who was appointed teacher for the Indian school at York Factory, has resigned and left the work and asking that the Rev. R. Farries be re-appointed as teacher and that the Department pay the whole or part of Miss Collins' expenses from York Factory to Selkirk, which amounted to $140.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department cannot make any grant towards paying Miss Collins' expenses.\n\nThe appointment of Rev. R. Farries as teacher of this school is approved and he will be paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, August 13, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 8th instant in reference to the amount of salary to be paid Rev. R. Faries, who was recently re-appointed as teacher of the York Factory Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department will allow Mr. Faries a salary at the rate of $500.00 per year, the same rate as was paid the former teacher.\n\nAs Your Lordship has already been informed, the Department regrets that it cannot make any grant towards the travelling expenses of Miss Collins.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of the enclosed cheque for $300.00, which was sent you in error for the salary due Mrs. Marshall, teacher of the Jack River day school for the March and June quarters last. Her salary is at the rate of $600.00 per year and a cheque for $250.00 will be sent you for amount of salary due for these two quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keswatin,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, June 2, 1920.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to the conversation today regarding the salary of a teacher at York Factory I beg to say that the Department will be prepared to pay a salary at the rate of $800.00 per annum for a qualified teacher. This will be paid quarterly upon receipt of the usual returns of attendance.\n\nAs nearly all the Indians are away during the winter months at the hunt, it would be advisable for the teacher to take holidays during the months of January and February and to teach the balance of the school year, especially during the summer season when the Indians are at the post. This would save expense to you in the providing of fuel and by keeping the school open during the summer it would benefit a greater number of Indian children.\n\nI shall be pleased to have full particulars as to the qualifications, etc., of the teacher you secure.\n\nBesides the salary the Department will be prepared to supply\u2014a reasonable quantity of school material.\n\nI might also say that, providing the Hudson's Bay Company will take the supplies, such as window frames, doors and building paper asked for by you, the Department will have this material sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to say that on\nAug. 1st I engaged Miss M.E. Baker -\na deaconess of the Anglican Church in Toronto,\nwho, though not holding a certificate for teaching,\nis in every way qualified to teach in the kind\nof school we have at York Factory. Miss Baker\nwas educated in a Church School in England\n& passed the entrance examination for the deaconess\ntraining in England.

I will pay Miss Baker from my Bank account, & the Department will make the quarterly payments over to my bank account, where I send you the returns of attendance.\n\nThe Division of York Factory is paying Miss Baker's transportation expenses, which is a considerable item, & I have already advanced Miss Baker money on her first quarterly payment, as she needed money when I engaged her, to buy clothing for the winter.\n\nAs I am responsible for the teacher, I want the teacher's salary paid over into account mentioned above.\n\nHoping to give you a promising report of the school soon.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\nR. Harter,\nArchdeacon of York Factory.\nOttawa, September 6, 1920.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo informing the Department that you have engaged the services of Miss M.

Payment is, therefore, being allowed for 17 days in December and 60 days in the quarter ending March 31st.

The salary provided is at the rate of $600 per annum, or $4.00 per day, but as you only conducted the school \u00bd hours each day, payment is allowed in proportion, or, as stated, at the rate of $5.00 per day. Owing to this part time service, under the regulations, no bonus can be allowed.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state whether the services of a teacher who can devote his whole time to school work will be secured for the next school year, or whether it is your intention to carry on in the same manner as you did last winter.

In giving 3\u00bd hours a day of my time to School teaching I did all that was possible for a clergyman with a congregation and a Missionary district to look after. I thank the Department for the reward for my services, but I wish you to understand that I did not take over the School work with a view to claiming the teacher's salary.\n\nThe Returns for quarter ending June 30th are enclosed. The Returns for Half-breed attendance are sent also. Will you please inform me whether you require me to send a form of attendance of Half-breed children, or not?\n\nSo far I have not been able to secure a teacher for the School. I had accepted the application of a young man in Winnipeg, but the last mail I was informed he could not come to us this season. I expect therefore to carry on the School in the same manner as I did last winter, only I hope to begin on the first of October. Hoping that this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRichard James\nArchdeacon of York\nDiocese of Keewatin\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1923.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd of September, last, informing the Department of the services being performed by you in conducting classes for the Indian children at the York Factory Indian Day School.\n\nWe note that you have been unable to secure a teacher for this school, but that you will carry on the work yourself this coming winter in the same manner as you did last winter, also that the school re-opened on the 1st of the present month. This arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department until such time as a regular teacher is obtained. We note that you will devote 3/4 hours a day to teaching, for which service you will be allowed salary at the rate of $5.00 per day, upon receipt of the usual returns showing the days taught, attendance, etc.\n\nThe return for the quarter ending June 30th, last, has been received. You will be allowed payment for the 43 days taught by you during the quarter, and a cheque for $129.00 is being sent to the credit of your account, No. F 1848, Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg.\n\nIn preparing your returns the names of the Indian children only should appear. It will not be necessary to send a return showing the attendance of half breed children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVeh. Archdeacon R.

He has not had any experience as a teacher hitherto, but he has passed the High School A.A. of Ontario, which is equivalent to Matriculation in the University of Toronto. With a little help from me in the routine and classification of studies for Grades I. to IV., he will be able to conduct the School. His name is Herbert Alfred Cannon of Toronto. He begins his duties as Teacher on November 1st,\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\nRichard Faries\nArchdeacon of York\nand\nSupt. of Indian Missions\nDiocese of Keewatin.\nOttawa, Dec. 10, 1923.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 20th, last, informing the Department that you have secured the services of Herbert Alfred Cannon as teacher of the York Factory Indian Day School, and stating the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Cannon. We note that he was to begin duties as teacher of this school on the 1st of November, last. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $800 per annum, payment of which will be based on the ten teaching months in the year. Besides, he will be entitled to any bonus provided by law. Should Mr. Cannon teach part time, we could only allow him salary on a per ordinance basis of $3 per day for the actual days taught, but if he keeps school open each teaching day in the year payment of salary will be made him at the rate mentioned viz: $800 per annum, plus the bonus. I shall be pleased if you will see that his quarterly returns, showing attendance and days taught, are forwarded as regularly as mail facilities permit.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Cannon will meet with every success in his work at York Factory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His reports were made up to date, but I held them for Acting Indian Agent's signature and now forward them to the Department.\n\nIn response to our appeal for a teacher to take over the York Factory School, Mr. Albert J. Dewdney of Ganora, Ont., came in September, and today he has taken up his duties as teacher. He holds the Ontario High School Graduation diploma. I hope the Department will approve of his appointment.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\nRichard Faries\nSecretary-Treasurer of York Factory School\nand\nSupt. Of Indian Missions\nfor\nThe Diocese of Keewatin\nOttawa, October 19, 1925\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the last instant informing the Department that Mr. Herbert Cannon has resigned in August last from the position as teacher of the York Factory Indian Day School and that you have obtained the services of Mr. Albert J. Dewdney to succeed him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Dewdney. We note that he took up his duties on the last instant. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $30.00 per month of ten teaching months in the year. Should Mr. Dewdney teach only part time we could only allow his salary on a per ordinance basis of $3.00 per day for the actual days taught, but if he keeps school opened each teaching day in the year, payment will be made to him at the rate mentioned, viz. $80.00 per teaching month. He should prepare and forward his quarterly returns showing attendance as regularly as mail facilities permit. It is hoped that Mr. Dewdney will meet with success in the work as teacher at York Factory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T. R. L. McInnes]\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon R.

Archdeacon Faries\nYork Factory\nVia, The Pas, Man.\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1927\n\nSUBJECT: SCHOOL RETURNS.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Rev. E.W. Gardner has been teaching in the York Factory School, from October 1st, 1926 to August 30th, 1927. I was absent during the winter and on my return in July last found that Mr. Gardner had not sent the Indian Department any account of the tuition given to the Indian children who attended the Day School. From his School Register he made out the enclosed School Returns, which I now send on to you.\n\nThe Report also for fiscal year ending March 31st, 1927, was filled out by the Rev. E.W. Gardner last August.\n\nI may say that the Rev. E.W. Gardner resigned from his duties as teacher on August 30th, 1927.\n\nOwing to the uncertainty of providing the Mission with sufficient supplies because of the loss of the Hudson's Bay Co's S.S. \"Bay Rupert\" for the coming winter, and an epidemic of Whooping Cough going among the children at the present time, I thought it would be better to close the Day School for this winter.\n\nSo we are without a School teacher from this date until such time as we can conveniently carry on again.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRichard Faries\nArchdeacon & Missionary-in-charge\nDiocese of Keewatin\nCANADA\nNovember 28th, 1927.\n\nMemorandum for File:\n\nWith reference to the letter of September 2nd, 1927, from Archdeacon R. Faries, in which he enclosed the returns from the York Factory Day School for the period October 1st, 1926 to September 30th, 1927, these returns showed the following average attendances:\n\nDecember quarter, 1926 - 4.71\nMarch quarter, 1927 - 3.82\nJune quarter, 1927 - 2.96\nSeptember quarter, 1927 - 17.24\n\nPayment of salary was made at the same rate as previously, namely, $800 a year but it is doubtful if we should continue allowing the same amount at this school.\nThe question of a Boarding school for the benefit of the children of the Band was again brought up, as the present system of schooling for the children is very unsatisfactory, although conscientiously carried on when there is school; during my time here I must agree with the Head Men of the Band in this respect, as there has been no school during the summer months, when the children were at York Factory, and had a chance to attend, and during the winter, or rather from early in the fall until late in the spring, practically all the natives are away from York Factory, scattered all over the country, and have no alternative but to take their children with them, as none of them are in a position to leave them behind and have them looked after, and attend school.\n\nJ.

No.6617,\nActing Indian Agent.\nJanuary 10th, 1929.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that we have engaged a Teacher for the York Factory Day School. He is a Professional teacher holding 2nd Class Certificate, and has been teaching in the Province of Manitoba for 25 years. His name is GEORGE BASHAM. He began his duties on November 1st, having an attendance of over twenty children. Since the New Year began however the attendance has fallen off, as the parents of the children were compelled to move into the interior of the country in search of game for food.\n\nHoping the appointment of Teacher will meet with your approval,\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRichard Faries\nOttawa, January 29, 1929.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, informing the department that you had engaged the services of George Basham, who holds a second class certificate and has had a number of years' teaching experience, as teacher of the York Factory Indian Day School. The Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Basham, with salary at the rate of $50 per teaching month, provided he teaches regularly and there is an adequate attendance.\n\nThe department has also received your letter enclosing the quarterly return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., for the quarter ended December 31st, last. It is noted that Mr. Basham opened the school on November 12th, last. A cheque in payment of salary for one and a half months, viz., $120, is being made payable and sent to the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, for deposit to credit of your account No. F1856.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Basham will meet with every success in the work at York Factory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He has a High School education, with one year Arts at Toronto University preparatory to the Science course for Engineer and Surveyor, and is therefore qualified to teach our Day School at York Factory.

T. J. G. Luke, who was appointed teacher of the Indian day school at York Factory, resigned on June 30th, last, and nominating the services of Mr. John Butterfield to succeed him. The Department has noted the qualifications which Mr. Butterfield possesses, and it is considered that his services would be satisfactory. His appointment is approved, with salary at rate of $80 per teaching month, provided he teaches regularly and there is an adequate attendance. You have not stated the date on which Mr. Butterfield began duties.\n\nMr. Butterfield should prepare and forward to the Department, as mail facilities permit, returns at the end of each quarter, in order that payment of the salary due him at the above rate can be made. If he taught any part of the quarter ended September 30th, last, he should prepare and forward a return showing the attendance, days' taught, etc. The last return received was for the quarter ended June 30th, last.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Butterfield will meet with success in his duties at York Factory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

He is not a certified teacher but has passed the Sixth Grade in the Public Schools of Manitoba, and we accepted that standard of education as a qualification to teach for the present term.\n\nI hope the appointment of Mr. John Rouse as teacher for the present term will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI am\n\nYours obediently,\n\nRichard Faries\nSec.-Treas. of York Factory School\nand\nMissionary-in-charge of York Factory Mission for the Diocese of Keewatin.\nOttawa, February 16, 1932.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. John Butterfield, at your request, tendered his resignation to take effect at the end of December, last.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that you have engaged the services of Mr. John Rouse to teach for the balance of the present school year. Although he is not a qualified teacher, it is hoped that his services will be satisfactory. The Department will approve of his appointment to teach during the balance of the present school year.

Archdeacon R. Faries,\nYork Factory,\nVia The Pas,\nMan.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 19, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry, concerning the York Factory Indian Day School, I have examined the files and I find that this is a school conducted by the Anglican Church for Indians and half-breeds. Two buildings are used - one in the summer and the other in the winter. There has been an average attendance of 11 Indian pupils during the past year and a half. At the present time, we are allowing a grant of $70 per teaching month towards the teacher's salary. I understand that the Provincial Department of Education also gives a grant for the half-breeds and any whites that may attend.\n\nThis school is not on any reserve, as the York Factory Band has not been given a definite location. There is no Indian agent in this section, and, as a result, we have very little control over this school and, as a department, do not feel responsible for buildings, etc. Briefly, it is a missionary school, to which we give a grant towards the teacher's stipend.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nFebruary 17, 1932.\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nThe Rt. Hon. Arthur Meighen has sent the Minister the attached extract from a letter from Mr. John Butterfield, of Toronto, touching upon a number of phases of Indian work.\n\nThe Minister would appreciate the return of the memorandum together with your observations on the same.\n\nEnc.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nFebruary 22, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to report on the attached extract from a letter from Mr. John Butterfield to the M.S.C.C. It seems to be an arraignment of the Missionary Society and the Government. The school at York Factory is conducted by the Missionary Society and the building belongs to the Society, and if there is any lack of sanitary conveniences, no responsibility is attached to this Department. We give them a grant of $450.00 a year for educating a few Indians who attend.\n\nThere are some general observations about education and medical attendance in which there is nothing new,- no helpful suggestions that might be carried out. The writer refers evidently to Treaty Nine Indians; and there is no promise, solemn or otherwise, that the sick will be cared for and that they will not be allowed to starve. The provisions of Treaty Nine are the standard provisions for reserves and annuities; whatever the Department and the Government do in excess by way of relief and medical attendance is done as a matter of grace, and the Treaty Nine Indians have the same treatment as all our other Indians.\n\nThe Indians of the district of Patricia can only be visited once a year and that by aeroplane. The Band to which the writer refers is situated at Nikip Lake; it is the Cariboo Lake Band. When the Commissioner met them last year he found them in an impoverished condition, and advised them to meet him next year at Clear Lake where there is a post of the Hudson's Bay Company. They promised to do so. Our information is that the Indians of this district are getting plenty of native food this year, and there should be no evitable suffering.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Fraser passed his examinations for Grade Twelve in the High School at The Pas, Manitoba, so I thought he would be able to carry on the School until we can secure a qualified teacher.\n\nAs there was some difficulty with the Department of Education in Manitoba to obtain a Permit to teach for Mr. Fraser the present arrangement will expire on December 31st, 1934.\n\nI have instructed Mr. Fraser to make his Returns at the end of the Quarter, and hope that the Department will give us the Grant for the tuition of the Indian children attending the School.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Parents do not like to send their children to a School a long way off where they cannot see them for years. The Day School is not satisfactory, as most of the Indians are trapping in the interior of the country and are absent from the Settlement all through the winter and they cannot leave their children to go to School.\n\nIf a Boarding School were operated in the District there would no trouble to keep the School filled with pupils.\n\nWe are told by white people that the Government collect thousands of dollars in royalties from our furs, and in return we think that the Government should do something for the education of our children.\n\nWe have asked the Missionary at York Factory to plead our cause for us and we hope you will give him a message of hope for us in this matter.\n\nWe are\nYour obedient servants\n\nAbraham\nChief of York Factory Band\n\nIndian Affairs.

ONT.\n\nJanuary 11th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary  \nDept. of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, ONT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian Day School at York Factory, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to my conversation with Mr. Sutherland on the 10th inst., concerning the teacher at York Factory, I wish to say that owing to a protest submitted by the Dept. of Education of Manitoba Mr. Leonard Fraser was asked to resign his position as teacher, and his term terminated on December 31st, 1934.\n\nMr. Fraser has not yet sent in his Report for the three months that he was in charge of the School. When the Quarterly Return reaches me I shall forward it to your Department.\n\nWith the approval of the Dept. of Education for the Province of Manitoba I appointed Mr. F.Ed.Goldring, B.A., of Middlechurch, Man., as teacher of the School at York Factory, to take the place of Mr. Leonard Fraser.\n\nHe is a graduate of Manitoba University and also of the Normal School in Winnipeg. He is therefore qualified to teach in the Province.\n\nHe left Winnipeg immediately Christmas travelling by Rail and dog-team to York Factory. I suppose that he reached York Factory in time to begin his duties as teacher on Jan. 7th, 1935.\n\nTo explain the reason for the protest of the Dept. of Education of the Province I may say that the Dept. of Education makes a small grant towards the operation of the School at York Factory for the benefit of the Half-breed children, and the Dept. insists on the School being carried on according to the regulations of the Dept. of Education. It happens that the Dept. of Education has a long list of unemployed teachers this year, and the Dept. feels that no person without a Certificate should be allowed to teach.

Dauphin S/D., R.C.M.P., DAUPHIN, Manitoba\n\nSchools - Indian Affairs Branch\n\n1. Whilst paying treaty at Gillam, Shammattawa and York Factory during the past month, requests from the Chief and Councillors of the York Factory Band were received for the Department to establish a residential school at York Factory to take care of the children at that point, Shammattawa and Gillam.\n\n2. On the whole, the Indians are not satisfied with sending their children out to the school at Elkhorn, Manitoba, and their chief objections would appear to be that the parents do not get to see their children through the year and lose contact with them; the majority of the boys that have returned from the school at Elkhorn are too old to learn how to trap and have a difficult time to make a living in view of the fact that their only source of livelihood is trapping.\n\n3. Their chief reasons for requesting a residential school at York Factory which would accommodate 50 children or more, are that more of their children could receive education without losing contact with their home environment and that the parents would be satisfied to leave the children in school knowing that they would be within close proximity and could see them occasionally.\n\n4. Under the present system, the percentage of their children attending Elkhorn school is very small and those boys which have returned, have not been able to re-adjust themselves satisfactorily to meet requirements.\n\n5. The Indians stated that if the Department would consider establishing a residential school at York Factory, they would supply fresh meat, fish and fuel for the school. Vegetables can be grown at York Factory.\n\nP.S. O.\nSchools - Indian Affairs Branch\n\nContinued............. can be grown at York Factory. Other supplies could be purchased outside and shipped in by Schooner via Churchill during the summer.\n\n6. An attendance of 50 children could easily be maintained by the three points, more likely more than an average attendance of 50 could be expected for their appear to be quite willing to send them to school at York knowing that they could visit them once in a while. Children from Severn, Ont might also be taken care of by a school at York, but it is considered that an average attendance could be maintained between, Gillam, York & Shammattawa. There are about twenty-five or thirty children new at Gillam whom could very well be in school, but the parents do not seem to care to send them outside and make excuses wherever possible.\n\n7. In the past, the Department has contributed some $500.00 per year towards maintaining a day school at York, whilst the Provincial Government contributing $200.00 per year, which permits the white and half-breed residents of the district to send their children to school. This has not exactly been satisfactory to the Indians for very few of them live around the settlement through the year, and therefore few of their children had the opportunity of attending the day school when it was in operation. The majority of the Indian families would only be around York during the months of June, July & August, in some cases not even for three months, they come into the Post early in the spring and leave for their trapping grounds early in the fall, and as they have no place to leave their children behind, they are forced to take them along with them.\n\n8. The present day school at York has not been in operation for the past three seasons, I am given to understand that the difficulty is to obtain a teacher.\n\n9. The request of the Indians concerned merits consideration, from my own personal observations, I would be inclined to favour their request and it is thought that maintenance of small residential school at York would not be prohibitive; however, advice from the Department on this matter would be appreciated.\n\n(A.B.

Further to previous correspondence and in particular to letter of Mrs. H.S. Hughes-Caley dated the 16th ultimo sent to Inspector A.G. Hamilton of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n2. I am unable to recommend assistance in any way towards an Indian School at Gillam.\n\n3. Representation has already been made to the department for a residential school at York Factory, and I am not anxious to encourage any more families to move into Gillam from Split Lake and York Factory.\n\n4. Members of the Split Lake Band already have a school at Split Lake, and those members of this band resident at Gillam and not usefully employed, should return to Split Lake where they belong.\n\n5. At the present time, there is a day school at York Factory, but as the school board at that point have been unable to secure a teacher for the past four years, same has been closed. The salary of the teacher at York is covered by a grant of $500.00 from the department and the remainder by the Provincial Government.\n\n6. When at York in March, the Ven. Archdeacon R. Faries, informed the writer that it was his intention of retiring this year, but as yet, no replacement has been secured for him. He is a member of the school board at York.\n\n7. Perhaps if Mrs. Caley is anxious to teach and has the necessary qualifications, she could no doubt obtain the position at York by applying to the department concerned.\n\n8. In so far as children of treaty Indians situated in the various settlements along the Hudson Bay Railway are concerned, such as at Wahowden, Thicket Portage, Pikwitonei, Gillam and Churchill, I would suggest that the same arrangement as at York be made with the provincial government, whereby what children who are classified as Treaty Indians and resident at these various points, be permitted to attend the schools already established by the provincial government. The Indian Department to contribute a proportionate amount of the teacher's salary and towards the maintenance of the school generally.\n\n9. The attendance at all these schools along the line, is practically the same, being comprised chiefly of a few white children, half-breeds and non-treaty Indians. In so far as health is concerned, Treaty Indian children are just as healthy as non-treaty children, and perhaps more so than the half-breeds.\n\n10. If such an arrangement as suggested in paragraph (8) was adopted, it would be a worth while cause for expenditure, merits of same can be readily appreciated.\n\n11. It would be necessary to make a survey of all the children at the various points along the line, in order to arrive at some understanding of proportionate cost to the departments concerned.\n\n12. This matter might be further discussed with Mr. Hamilton at...\nat Treaty time, in the meantime, departmental views might be obtained, and if favourable to the proposal, Mr. Hamilton could approach the provincial governments in this regard.\n\n13. In so far as Mrs. Hughes-Caley is concerned, I would suggest that Mr. Hamilton take no action other than to inform her of the vacancy at York. The matter of her renting a house was entirely on her own initiative and not on request of this detachment.\n\n14. May I be further advised relative to paragraph (8) of this report, please.\n\n15. It was omitted to mention that it might be considered advisable to approach local school boards first in this matter, however, departmental views would be appreciated before any further action is taken.\n\n16.

I began this work tentatively last fall with about thirteen boys and eleven girls who came alternately for four afternoons a week. Many more children wanted to come, but I was obliged to restrict attendance to those between the ages of nine and fifteen owing to my limited quarters and to the inability to buy suitable material.\n\nThe things I urgently need are 1) about thirty Beginners' Readers of the type used in Indian Day Schools or the colourful Jane & Jerry series in use in our Public Schools for white children.\n\n2) A supply of pencils, scribblers and loose drawing paper & crayons.\n\n3) Wall pictures or Charts for teaching the names of common objects and for assistance in number work and health teaching. These children learn so much from pictures - particularly if health posters are adapted to their own surroundings.\n\n4) Simple rations would be most beneficial as these children are most of them undernourished. A large box of biscuits, 2 cases of milk and 12 jars of peanut butter would be the type of things I would suggest together with tea or cocoa and sugar to stretch the milk ration.\n\n5) As our house accommodation was entirely inadequate my husband and I have rented an empty house and fitted one room with benches. We have paid the rent until June 15th, but it would be a tremendous help to us if your department could see its way to pay the eight dollars a month from June the fifteenth until September the fifteenth. As Gillam is unsuitable for a Reservation it would be unwise to run a school all the time, but there is an obvious need for something to keep the children occupied for part of the time during the summer months. Those who came to me last year all learned to write their names and addresses and were counting quite nicely. Through constant contact with me, both in my home and theirs, nearly all of them can both understand and speak a\n\n........\nlittle English which will be useful to them later. Long before our marriage, my husband maintained a children's corner where Indian children are free to come and look at books and magazines (we need more suitable ones) or play games such as dominoes and draughts, etc.\n\nDuring my work as Dispenser & Matron during the past winter, I have seen many opportunities for educating the parents through teaching the children and I would wish to adapt my teaching to the children's immediate needs rather than give full-day-school teaching in the time available. So far I have made use of my experience as a French Specialist in teaching these children by the direct method. Many of the principles that I used while teaching English to French children in France can also be applied.\n\nFiled under the name of Miss M. Pearman, formerly a teacher in the Correspondence Branch of the Department of Education, you may possibly have a list of my qualifications for teaching. When you come to Gillam with the Treaty party in June you will have an opportunity of inspecting my \"school\" premises, as I hope to use the building for Dr. Yule's inspection. There is a small room which I could fix up as a temporary office for you, if you wish to be near him, but I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the acting Indian Agent, Corporal Moore, R.C.M.P., who may be making other arrangements for you & other members of the Treaty party.\n\nI shall possibly be in Winnipeg during the first week in May for a very brief visit, and could discuss the matter with you further if you so desire. As mails are uncertain, will you kindly send your reply to this letter to me C/o Dr. M.Ellen Douglass, 126 Sherbrook St., Winnipeg and clearly mark it TO AWAIT ARRIVAL.\n\nPlease note that I am asking merely for help with supplies and not for remuneration in connection with this suggestion for teaching our Indian children here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Marjorie Hughes-Caley\"\n\n(Mrs.H.S.Hughes-Caley - nee Pearman)\n\n(My husband is Missionary to the Crees in this area.)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI enclose a letter from Mrs. Hughes-Caley, together with a copy of a report from Cpl.

Many of these people living along the Hudson's Bay Railway line at times find the going hard and their contact with the outside often spreads disease which is difficult to control.\n\nCpl. Moore has made a suggestion that the Provincial Government Schools be used for those Indians definitely located in any of the settlements. I think this proposal reasonable and I am sure the Provincial authorities would agree providing we paid a fair share of the cost.\n\nAlthough the request made by Mrs. Hughes-Caley is quite modest, yet in view of Cpl. Moore's letter I think the matter should be left in abeyance until after the treaty trip. In the meantime, I would be glad to know the Department's attitude on the suggestion made by Cpl. Moore in paragraph (8) of his report.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, May 24, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G.

In so far as health is concerned, Treaty Indian children are just as healthy as non-treaty children, and perhaps more so than the half-breeds.\n\n10. If such an arrangement as suggested in paragraph (8) was adopted, it would be a worthwhile cause for expenditure, merits of case can be readily appreciated.\n\n11. It would be necessary to make a survey of all the children at the various points along the line, in order to arrive at some understanding of proportionate cost to the department concerned.\n\n12. This matter might be further discussed with Mr. Hamilton at Treaty time, in the meantime, departmental views might be obtained, and if favourable to the proposal, Mr. Hamilton could approach the provincial government in this regard.\n\n13. In so far as Mrs Hughes-Caley is concerned, I would suggest that Mr. Hamilton take no action other than to inform her of the vacancy at York. The matter of her renting a house was entirely on her own initiative and not on request of this detachment.\n\n14. May I be further advised relative to paragraph (8) of this report, please.\n\n15. It was omitted to mention that it might be considered advisable to approach local school boards first in this matter; however, departmental views would be appreciated before any further action is taken.\n\n16.

Many more children wanted to come, but I was obliged to restrict attendance to those between the ages of nine and fifteen owing to my limited quarters and to the inability to buy suitable material.\n\nThe things I urgently need are about thirty Beginners 'Readers of the type used in Indian Day Schools or the colourful Jane & Jerry series in use in our Public Schools for white children.\n\n2) A supply of pencils, scribblers and loose drawing paper & crayons.\n\n3) Wall pictures or Charts for teaching the names of common objects and for assistance in number work and health teaching. These children learn so much from pictures - particularly if health posters are adapted to their own surroundings.\n\n4) Simple rations would be most beneficial as these children are most of them undernourished. A large box of biscuits, 2 cases of milk and 12 jars of peanut butter would be the type of things I would suggest together with tea or cocoa and sugar to stretch the milk ration.\n\n5) As our house accommodation was entirely inadequate my husband and I have rented an empty house and fitted one room with benches. We have paid the rent until June 15th, but it would be a tremendous help to us if your department could settle it for May and the eight dollars a month from June the fifteenth until September the fifteenth. As Gillam is unsuitable for a Reservation it would be unwise to run a school all the time, but there is an obvious need for something to keep the children occupied for part of the time during the summer months. Those who came to me last year all learned to write their names and addresses and were counting quite nicely. Through constant contact with me, both in my home and theirs, nearly all of them can both understand and speak a little English which will be useful to them later.\n\nLong before our marriage, my husband maintained a children's corner where Indian children are free to come and look at books and magazines or play games such as dominoes and draughts etc. (We need more suitable ones)\n\nDuring my work as Dispenser & Matron during the past winter, I have seen many opportunities for educating the parents through teaching the children and I would wish to adapt my teaching to the children's immediate needs rather than give full day-school teaching in the time available. So far I have made use of my experience as a French Specialist in teaching these children by the direct method. Many of the principles that I used while teaching English to French children in France can also be applied.\n\nFiled under the name of Miss M. Pearman, formerly a teacher in the Correspondence Branch of the Department of Education, you may possibly have a list of my qualifications for teaching. When you come to Gillam with the Treaty party in June you will have an opportunity of inspecting my \"school\" premises, as I hope to use to use the building for Dr. Yule's inspection. There is a small room which I could fix up as a temporary office for you, if you wish to be near him, but I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the acting Indian Agent, Corporal Moore R.C.M.P., who may be making other arrangements for your & other members of the Treaty party.\nI shall possibly be in Winnipeg during the first week in May for a very brief visit, and could discuss the matter with you further, if you so desire. As mails are uncertain, will you kindly send your reply to this letter to me C/O Dr. M. Ellen Douglass, 136, Sherbrook St., Winnipeg, and clearly mark it TO AWAIT ARRIVAL.\n\nPlease note that I am asking merely for help with supplies and not for remuneration in connection with this suggestion for teaching our Indian children here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Marjorie Hughes-Caley\"\n(Mrs. H.S.

You will note that the views of Mrs. Hughes-Caley are not concurred with by Cpl. Moore of this Force stationed at Gillam, Manitoba. He does suggest, however, that if Mrs. Caley is anxious to teach Indian children and is duly qualified for the position of school teacher, she could apply for employment in the day school at York Factory. This school, you will note, has been closed for the last four years, owing to the fact that the School Board at that point have been unable to secure a teacher.\n\nFor Director, Criminal Investigation.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nEnc.\nWinnipeg, Man., July 17, 1945.\n\nREPORT ON YORK FACTORY AND SHANNATTANA DISTRICTS inspected between June 26th and 30th, 1945.\n\nSHANNATTANA INDIANS\n\nThere were 56 Indians at the Band meeting. The following matters were discussed:\n\n1. The possibility of making a separate Band and having their own Chief and Councillor.\n2. School accommodation; The setting-up of the sawmill and securing logs.\n3. School accommodation\n4. Family Allowances\n5. Trapping areas\n6. Beaver\u2014closing of season.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWinnipeg, Man., July 17, 1945.\n\nREPORT ON YORK FACTORY AND SHAMMATTAWA DISTRICTS inspected between June 26th and 30th, 1945.\n\nYORK FACTORY INDIANS\n\nThe Indians feel that more should be done for the education of their children. The day school has not been in operation for some time\u2014apparently it has been impossible to secure a teacher. In the winter this school might serve about eight or ten Indian children and 15 or more half-breed children, non-treaty. This means some 35 pupils get no opportunity for education. The parents with their families leave early in September and often do not return until late in June so the children cannot be in school. A summer school for such a short period would be useless. If a teacher can be secured I think the present day school should be in operation until something better can be started. In my opinion the teacher should be a married man and in addition to teaching, both he and his wife should carry out certain welfare work. I see no hope of educating the children at York or Shammattawa any way except by admitting them into a boarding school. To build a small boarding school to accommodate 50 pupils at each point constitutes several problems. The cost would be high\u2014freighting in materials would be expensive and keeping a staff would be difficult. A school at York to care for about 100 would meet the needs of both bands and supplies can be brought in twice a year by boat from Churchill. The alternative is to build some place along the Hudson's Bay line and transport the children in and out. The school question is a real problem and one which should be faced.\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nWinnipeg, Man., July 17, 1945.\n\nREPORT ON YORK FACTORY AND SHAWANAGAN DISTRICTS inspected between June 26th and 30th, 1945.\n\nIt is difficult to determine how best these northern Indians could be served, but I believe the following suggestions, if carried out, would eventually bring results.\n\n1. Establish an Agency perhaps at Gillam with a full-time Indian Agent and Clerk. This would take in York Factory, (Fox Lake and Shawanagana Indians), Churchill Indians, Duck Lake Indians and the Split Lake Band.\n\n2. Place a welfare worker experienced in fishing, hunting and lumbering to supervise York and Shawanagana and another man at Gillam to look after the Fox Lake Indians located at Gillam and also to supervise other groups along the Hudson's Bay line and the Split Lake Indians.\n\n3. Establish a nursing station at York Factory and Nelson House. Sick Indians along the line could go to The Pas - also the Indians from Split Lake.\n\n4. Provide a boarding school at York for the York Factory and Shawanagana Indians - perhaps 35 pupils.\n\n5. Establish a boarding school at some other point for Split Lake Indians (perhaps 30 of school age) and those living along the Hudson's Bay line (another 30). Setting Lake has been suggested as an ideal location. There is plenty of fish, game and wood, and this location is only a few miles from the Railway.\n\nA plan of this nature requires large expenditures and the employment of experienced and qualified help. However, these Indians need not only advise but leadership - practical men who understand northern conditions - men who know how to obtain a living from the surrounding country. We have provided Agents, Farming Instructors, Stockmen, Schools and Teachers for the prairie Indians. I feel confident a similar plan must be followed for the northern Indians and this matter should be one of our post-war programs. The big need is for qualified men as leaders and suitable schools to meet the requirements of many Indian children now growing up without education.\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nfor Manitoba.\nExtract from letter from Major C.A.F. CLARK,\nEducational Surveys Officer, dated 7 September, 1947.\n\nSince arriving at The Pas I have spent as much time as possible with Inspector Bateman who is handing over immediately to H. P. MOFFATT, B.A., B.Ed., who is receiving a week's coaching.\n\nMr. Bateman has been so busy that he has still only rough notes of the tour he made last February, and he was unable to carry out his agreement with you to visit a number of our schools. Among these are Cross Lake, Island Lake, and God's Lake.\n\nHe recommends that we consider providing teachers at SHAMATTAWA (south of York Factory) where the figures appear to be:\n\n| Children in the settlement | (a) School age | 31 |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----|\n|                           | (b) Under 7    | 22 |\n\n| Children within 25 miles  | (c) School age | 28 |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----|\n|                           | (d) Under 7    | 19 |\n\nAt York Factory there is a good empty school, ownership undetermined, and a not-so-good teacherage.\n\nChildren (a) 27 (b) 11 (c) 15 (d) 12\n24th November, 1948.\n\nYork Factory Band - Nelson River Agency,\nIndian Education.\n\n1. Referring to my letter of August 4th, 1948, under the heading, \"Treaty Payments, 1948 - Churchill Agency\".\n\n2. I now attach hereto a copy of a report received from Corporal J.E. McCardle, dated at Churchill on the 6th November, 1948, with respect to the desire of the York Factory Band to have their children educated, for your consideration.\n\nS. T. Wood,\nCommissioner.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n1. Relative to the above and in particular to the report submitted by Const. MORRIS under date of July 19th, 1948 Rep.- TREATY PAYMENT - 1948 - Churchill Agency and the requests made therein at Paragraph 7 the said report by the above noted Band.\n\n2. The following was made by the Band as a whole: \"THAT THEY HAVE A SCHOOL TEACHER FOR THEIR CHILDREN ALL THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED AND PAID FOR BY THEM THROUGH THEIR CHURCH AND THE LEAST THE DEPARTMENT COULD DO IS SUPPLY THEM WITH A TEACHER.\"\n\n3. This request with regards to education of their children has been made over a number of years not only in regards to the day school, but rather that a small residential school be established at York Factory. The present day school was constructed in 1937 by the Indians of the captioned noted Band, so that their children might receive the benefits of an education without leaving home to attend a residential school at some distant point, thereby losing contact with home environments. The school is in good condition, some minor repairs and improvements are required to be made to the Teacherage before same could be used, desks and equipment would be required before the school could be opened as the desks in the school at present are in very poor condition.\n\n4. The following information is listed to assist the Department in arriving at a decision in this connection. There are approximately forty children of school age at York Factory which include White, Non-Treaty and Treaty and their attendance at day school could be classified as follows:\n\n(a) ALL YEAR STUDENTS 20\n(b) PART TIME STUDENTS 20\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that this would hardly be satisfactory to the Treaty Indian as they would form the majority of the part time students and would at the most obtain three months schooling in a school year and I am given to understand that in the past when the day school was in operation the Department paid $500 a year towards maintaining it, while the Provincial Government contributed $200.00 a year which permits the white and Non-Treaty residents of the district to send their children to school, therefore it would appear that to open the day school again it would benefit the white and non-treaty residents rather than the Treaty Indians.\n\n5. It is suggested that rather than open the day school...\nOPEN THE DAY SCHOOL that consideration might be given to the construction of a small residential school at York Factory which could take care of the treaty Indian children of school age at Fox Lake, Shamattawa and York Factory and in this connection your attention is drawn to the report submitted by Cpl. MOORE under date July 26th, 1948 Rej- SCHOOLS - Indian Affairs Branch and in the event any consideration is given this matter, then the children of white and non-treaty parents could be assessed an amount to cover the privileges received as day students and at the same time it would take care of the Indian Children unable to attend day school all year round and those from Fox Lake, Shamattawa as well.\n\n6. The request of the Indians concerned with regards to education merits consideration and from my own personal observations I would be inclined to favour their request and it is thought that maintenance of a small residential school at York Factory would not be prohibitive and in the event that favourable consideration be given this matter, that such an establishment be placed under the supervision of the Anglican Mission as the majority of the people including the Indians are protestants.\n\n7.

You are of course aware of the day school at York Factory and know that it has not been possible to obtain a teacher for the past eight years. Archdeacon Faries was formerly the Secretary-Treasurer of the local School Board and was the moving spirit behind the establishment and maintenance of this school. You will recall that we donated an amount towards the construction of this building and that we paid a contribution towards the salary of the teacher.\n\nReports from Mr. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer, indicate that the school is in good condition but that the teacherage is unfit for use. I understand that Mr. Grafton has arranged to have Mrs. Ratlack, the wife of the Hudson's Bay Post Manager, teach school from January on. There will probably be a very small attendance during the winter but the Indians will attend when the trapping season is over.\n\nAs we are anxious to do everything possible to bring educational facilities to these Indians, I would appreciate hearing from you with any comments and suggestions which you would like to make, concerning the operation of this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nRe: File 546-1\nYork Factory Indian Day School.\n\nThank you for your letter of the 3rd inst., informing me of the action taken with reference to the above school, which I am pleased to know is being, or has been, reopened, and that Mrs. Retallack, the wife of the Hudson's Bay Post Manager has undertaken to teach the school from January on.\n\nAs the school building is on our mission property I am pleased to learn by a recent letter from Archdeacon Faries that he has been advised of the steps taken, and of which he approves, which same I now confirm.\n\nAs you are aware this school has since its inception been under the management of Archdeacon Faries, and that of late years he has been unable to secure teachers. He is keenly interested, and though he is out for the winter at Fort William, he hopes to return to York Factory in the spring.\n\nWe shall endeavour to cooperate with the Indian Affairs Branch in every possible way, and I trust it may be possible to continue the operation of the school, and perhaps your Department would consider the possibility of a new teacherage. As Archdeacon Faries cannot carry on the work of the Church much longer on account of advancing years, it would seem best that the salary of the present teacher should be paid by you direct, as is no doubt your intention. There are a good number of children in that area who have had few opportunities for an education, and I trust it may be possible to continue the work of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-1, part 1)\nGERMAN DIRECTORS VISIT NATIONAL OFFICE\n\nIn November, the Canadian Junior Red Cross had the pleasure of receiving two visitors from Germany: Dr. Goetz Fehr, Director of Junior Red Cross in Bavaria and Dr. Heinrich Leuchter, Director of Junior Red Cross in Hesse. Their ten days at National Office was part of a study visit arranged by the American Junior Red Cross.\n\nDr. Fehr is emphatic in his belief that Junior Red Cross is the best medium through which to re-educate the youth of Germany. \"They want practical actions, not mere words,\" said Dr. Fehr. \"In my opinion,\" he stated, \"Junior Red Cross is the best means to demonstrate that, by working cooperatively together, they can help not only others but themselves as well.\"\n\nOne of the first dolls to come to Alberta was recently given to the Junior Red Cross. To be included in a consignment of toys for children over the 65 years old, Major Shortliffe came west with the Royal North West Mounted Police, and brought this doll for his daughter. She has a complete wardrobe, even including boots and a flower-decked hat. Members of the Junior Red Cross in Western Canada High School, Calgary, assist in getting a shipment ready to send to Britain.\nYORK Factory is often spoken of as the \"cradle of the Canadian West\" because so many of the first settlers entered the country by way of this historic old port and trading post on the west of Hudson Bay. Situated just within the mouth of the Hayes River on a narrow tongue of land that has the Hayes River on one side and the Nelson on the other, it was for nearly two centuries the headquarters of fur trade on \"the Bay\" and, as such, it knew stirring times and played an important part in the making of Canada.\n\nIts importance as a point of entry and business centre dwindled with the building of railways to the west until, today, York Factory is merely a ghost of its illustrious past. Yet, like other famous trading posts around the Bay, it is still mantled with an aura of glamour and romance.\n\nWe visited this historic spot last July. We sailed down the Bay from Churchill to York Factory on a little packet ship just as many an Adventurer did in those far-off early days of the fur trade.\n\nIt was shortly after dawn when our ship entered the Hayes River and anchored in mid-stream opposite the trading post, but long before it had anchored, the Indian village that stretches a mile or more along the high river embankment was wide awake. Some early riser had seen us approaching and quickly spread the news, and now men, women and children poured from tents and log cabins, talking excitedly in their high-pitched musical voices.\n\nThe packet ship's arrival is always a big event at York Factory. It happens only once, or sometimes twice, each summer and all the things seen and done on that occasion provide topics of discussion for many a week after. Some of the Cree children were seeing a ship for the first time in memory, and watched it in round-eyed amazement. I waved to them from the deck but, at that, some hid shyly behind their mothers' skirts, for a strange white woman was not to be welcomed lightly.\n\nAs soon as the anchor dropped, Indian men and older boys hurried to the landing, eager to begin the task of unloading the ship. It would be tedious, but a pleasure too, to unload such interesting boxes and bales, and cartons and barrels as stacked the decks and stowed the hold to capacity. They could scarcely wait for the post manager to go aboard and conclude the necessary business formalities with the captain.\n\nThe colour and pageantry once associated with this occasion have long since disappeared. Had it been a hundred years ago, booming cannon would have announced our arrival, and skirling pipes have escorted the post manager, proudly decked in red coat and gold braid, when he walked from the door of the great trading post to greet us at the shore. Instead, when we visited the post a pleasant young man in business suit came aboard to welcome us and to arrange about getting the cargo ashore.\n\nShoals and shallows in the Hayes River prevent a ship...\nThe upper photograph is another view of (quoting Mrs. Eva Beckett) Gitche Waskihigen, the Great House, at York Factory Manitoba.\n\nThe lower photograph shows the left bank of the Hayes River where the houses are unoccupied except during a few weeks in the summer season.\n\nFrom personal examination of the Great House, I can vouch for the accuracy of Mrs. Beckett's statements that \"most of its vast storage space is now unused -- most of the business once transacted here has swung north to the seaport town of Churchill.\"\n\nThis vast substantial wooden structure might, if the company were willing, provide the floor space to accommodate in every way 200 Indian children, perhaps even more.\n\nIt could serve the Protestant children of parents who patronize Hudson Bay posts at York Factory, Shambtawe, God's Lake, Oxford Lake, Split Lake, Churchill, and points within the approximate circle which the places named enclose.\n\nWater routes at certain seasons are open along God's River, Hayes River, Nelson River, Churchill River, and the coastal waters of Hudson Bay. Even Island Lake is part of this age-old river system. The Hudson Bay Railway touches the Nelson River about 90 miles upstream from York Factory.\n\nIndian children in the area under discussion have occasionally attended Residential Schools at such remote points as Ekhorn and Prince Albert. While some of the Indians appreciate the efforts of these Residential Schools, they decline to permit their children to be sent so far away.\n\nI have used the term \"Protestant\" as the area is served mostly by the Anglican Church in Canada and the United Church of Canada. Each is experiencing difficulty in keeping missionaries and teachers at the various isolated posts in the area. By co-operating at York Factory they might each contribute to the educational progress of their people, and at the same time administer to the spiritual welfare of their respective adherents.\n\nC.A.F.

Cook,\nSuperintendent, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nProposed Residential School - Anglican Indians\nNorthern Manitoba\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nAs you are probably aware, there stands at York Factory a very large post formerly the headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company for Rupert's Land. This Great House now stands largely unused. Only a quarter of it is in use, and it has been suggested that we consider approaching the Hudson's Bay Company for the use of part of the building as a small residential school.\n\nArchdeacon Faries of the Diocese of Keewatin has been keenly interested in the operation of a little day school at York Factory. This day school is in quite good condition, but a new teacherage is needed. Mrs. Retallack, the wife of the Hudson's Bay Company post manager is now conducting classes in this school building. As you are probably aware, York Factory was formerly a key post because of its good connection by water routes to Shamattaw, God's Lake, Split Lake, Churchill, etc. I would like to have an opportunity of discussing this subject with you at some time in the future.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 8, 1949.\n\nDear Corporal McCordley:\n\nI recall that you stated when I saw you that you would be making a trip to York Factory in February and I would welcome any news regarding the joint school which was arranged to begin in January under Manitoba control. Were there any Indian families in residence and were there any children of legal Indian status who regularly attended school?\n\nIf you were at Fort Nelson did you find many families there? I understand a number of the Indians are engaged in demolishing a bridge there. Is it reasonable to suppose that the settlement will evaporate when this work is done?\n\nChurchill continues to demand our attention. Supposing that I were there today, how many adults and children of legal Indian status would I be able to count if I explored every house and shelter within the radius of five miles from the Railway depot?\n\nI am enclosing some copies of a pro forma which we use in determining the potential school population. Would you be kind enough to have these completed for the bands on which you keep books and any remarks which you care to make on these forms regarding the geographical points where these bands congregate and the times when they are to be found there will be welcome.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nSee letter from Churchill Chamber of Commerce on 507-1 under date 3 Feb 15 C.A.R.C.\nRecently I saw an analysis of the Churchill population where your twin daughters appeared as prospective school pupils. That seems to take for granted that your tour of duty at Churchill will last another four years, and may give me the chance again to have the pleasure of a visit with you and your wife to whom please convey my thanks and my regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.W.

Neary  \nDirector of Indian Education  \nDept. Mines & Resources  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn answer to your letter of February seventh and further on our conversation about York Factory,\n\nI have been in touch with Bishop Lofthouse who has opinions of his own and also advice from Archdeacon Farkies on the matter in question. The M.S.C.C. Executive has asked that the proposition be explored further but at the moment one or two points indicate that caution ought to be exercised before the establishment of a residential school at York Factory.\n\n(1) Information has it that the soil is of such a nature wholly unfitted for the production of vegetables. This would mean added costs in the way of food purchases and transportation.\n\n\u00d7 (2) York Factory is roughly two days by canoe from Gillam which would \"scare-off\" prospective staff members in many cases.\n\n(3) Most heavy supplies are shipped by rail from Winnipeg to Churchill and by schooner from Churchill about 200 miles up the coast. Such transportation is very costly.\n\n(4) Fuel in the area is expensive\n\n\u00d7 (5) The remoteness of the Post would create quite a problem in procuring staff.\n\nThere is no question but that a Residential school ought to be provided for the accommodation of Anglican Indian children of the northern Manitoba area. Our Church authorities have been requesting one ever since the McKay School was lost. One wonders however if York Factory is the proper site. The experience of both the Department and the Church during the past few years has been, I think, that schools distantly\n\np.t.o.\nColonel Neary\n\nFebruary 22, 1949.\n\nlocated from railways or regular boat transportation are not only costly to operate and maintain but create other problems besides. For my part I'd like to see an Anglican institution located on the Hudson's Bay Railway somewhere between The Pas and Gillam.\n\nHowever please do not take this letter as a refusal of the Indian Affairs Branch proposition. I would appreciate having the opportunity to discuss this with you further at your convenience. Perhaps the difficulties suggested earlier can be overcome.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRGC:NMA Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nI am enclosing, herewith, copy of a letter received from Mr. B. Grafton, Supervisor of Special Schools, Department of Education, Provincial Government, Winnipeg. Will you please advise me regarding the matters in Mr. Grafton's letter.\n\nE.\n\nMr. Staunton may be visiting York before \"break-up.\"\nManitoba has actually made no capital outlay on the installation presently in use.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nProvince of Manitoba  \nDepartment of Education  \nWinnipeg  \n\nFebruary 23, 1949.\n\nMr. Davis,  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs,  \n538 Dom. Public Bldg.,  \nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Davis:\n\nI have just received a note from Joe Bignell Jr. of York Factory. It brought to my mind the fact that you had suggested a new teacherage would be in order at this point. There is plenty of time as yet to consider such a move, as the freight does not go into this point until June and July.\n\nI am wondering whether you are still considering such a move for the coming summer or not? If so I imagine that it would be built under the joint school plan - or would you like to do it all by yourself? I will let you if you wish to!\n\nIncidentally, what is the ruling on joint schools such as those we presumeable started at York Factory - Ilford - Brochet? Are you taking over your share of the expenses next term or not?\n\nI have just visited Anama Bay School - Dauphin River Reserve. They had $218.00 on hand at the time of my visit but were still beefing.\n\nI have bought all the finishing materials for South Indian Day School. They are on their way - that is for a two\nroom Joint School, with teacherage attached.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard Grafton,\nSupervisor of Special Schools.\n\nCOPY\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th, 1949 on the York Factory Indian Day School.\n\nIn the village at the time of our arrival there were 12 Treaty children and 13 non-treaty children. These people live around the settlement. Mr. Grafton, the Provincial School Inspector, made arrangements to open up a classroom the first of the year, and hired the Hudson's Bay Manager's wife as teacher. Both Treaty and non-treaty children will be looked after. This will be a joint school, and, no doubt, the Provincial Government will be taking the matter up with you.\n\nWe were unable, owing to flying conditions, to visit the North Knife Settlement, which is about 8 miles north of Churchill and where the Indians are now permanently located. This being half of the Duck Lake Band, which, I understand, split up a few years ago. There are about 150 Indians in each band, as near as I could learn. It is my intention to go in next summer and check over the whole situation, as we may be able to build a school for these people. We were also unable to visit Neultin Lake, as flying conditions in the Barren Lands were bad, and the pilot advised us it was not safe. Part of the Brochet Band live at this point. The settlement, I understand, is very small - only two or three families living there, the rest being scattered. This point will also be visited by myself next summer. I understand from trappers who arrived in Churchill, that conditions amongst these bands were fairly good and no one was suffering.\n\nT.E.: Folio below, please C.A.R.C. 1/1/49\n## SURVEY OF POTENTIAL SCHOOL POPULATION\n\n**Name of Band:** York Factory  \n**Location:** York Factory  \n**Agency:** Churchill\n\n### Religious Denomination\n\n(Separate statistics for denominations)\n\n| Surviving children | 1931 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 | 1940 | 1941 | 1942 | 1943 | 1944 | 1945 | 1946 | 1947 | 1948 | 1949 |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Born**           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Boys               | -    | 2    | 2    | 3    | -    | 1    | 2    | 7    | 1    | 5    | 4    | 5    | 2    | 3    | 5    | -    |      |\n| Girls              | 1    | 1    | 1    | 3    | 1    | 2    | 1    | 1    | 4    | 2    | 7    | 1    | 3    | 5    | 7    | 5    | -    |\n| **TOTAL**          | 1    | 3    | 3    | 6    | 1    | 3    | 3    | 8    | 5    | 6    | 10   | 5    | 8    | 7    | 10   | 10   | -    |\n\n### Attending School\n\n- **Potential Enrollment**\n  - **Elementary**\n    - (1) Black River\n    - (2) Paterson Albert\n  - **Secondary**\n    - (1) York Factory\n\n### Remarks:\n\nThe families of the above band spend from June until September at York Factory, when they leave for their trapping grounds east of Shuswap Lake.

KIDS\"\n\nOriginal Correspondence attached hereto.\n\n2. Relative to paragraph 1 the above correspondence, please be advised that when in York Factory at the end of January I found six children of legal Indian Status attending the day school and according to the teacher Mrs. Estallack, they were very keen and she was well pleased by the way they conducted themselves during school hours, to use her own words \"IT IS A PLEASURE TO TEACH CHILDREN, WHO ARE SO KEEN TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION.\"\n3. PORT NELSON, when in that area in January there were no Indians living at the old settlement, having finished the work they had been hired to do i.e., piling old steel rails etc., they had left for their traplines, and should they return to work there this Summer, there is no doubt that when the work is finished, they will return to York Factory settlement, due to the fact that the Trading Post and their Church is at York Factory.\n\n4.

It will be noted in the pro forma covering the Churchill Band that they have been divided into two groups i.e., North River and Duck Lake. The North River group of 18 families spend from June until September in Churchill and from September until June at North River, which is approximately 30 air miles Northwest of Churchill and is shown on the Map of Manitoba as North Knife River. The Duck Lake Band or group spend all their time at Duck Lake, the men working their traplines from that point. Duck Lake is approximately 150 air miles North West of Churchill and is shown on the Map of Manitoba as Caribou and the settlement is near Mink Rapids. The Fox Lake Band live along the Hudson's Bay Rly., between Gillam, Man. and 412, Hudson's Bay Rly., and at most are only in Gillam at Treaty payment time, and it will be noted from the pro forma that an effort is being made by the Indians to give their children an education by sending them to Residential School. It will be noted that twelve (12) Children are receiving education from the York Factory Settlement with six (6) attending the Residential Schools and six the day school at York Factory. This Band spend from June until September at York Factory when all, but a few families leave for their traplines, which are situated East of York Factory on the Kaskatsema River and East of Shamattawa on the God'a River. The Shamattawa Band spend...\nTHE SHAWANAGAN BAND SPENT from June until September at Shawanagana Post on the God's River which is approximately 75 Air miles from York Factory Indian Settlement.

For York factory Joint school\u2014Mr. Davis wrote me to this effect some time ago. He also suggested that if necessary; he would be prepared to pay slightly more than $20.00 per month.\n\nI lost the teacher that I had for Anama Bay\u2014transferred my York Factory teacher there and have hired another boy\u2014on the strength of Mr. Davis letter, for York Factory. If satisfactory to you\u2014we will pay him $1400.00 and suggest that you pay his board whatever that may be, possibly $30.00, but not more. This boy is a 1st.B, class teacher with experience both in country and village schools. I anticipate the payment of transportation from the railway to York Factory as well.\n\nMr. Davis suggested the inclusion of money to build a teachersage at this point in next year's budget. I believe that such an undertaking would cost in the neighborhood of $2500.00 dollars. The material for the teachersages that I am building costs me $1400.00 in Winnipeg. If you want to build as suggested please let me know so that I too can include our share of the cost in my budget.\n\nRe-Anama Bay\u2014Is it your intention to continue paying the Indians share of the teachers board at this point? If so I would suggest that you pay both this teacher and that of York Factory direct. The teacher will then realize more fully that this is a joint effort.\n\nyours sincerely,\n\nBernard Grafton,\nSupervisor of Special Schools.\nIlford, Manitoba.\n20th April, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAtt: Mr.B.F.Neary, Supt. of Education.\n\nAttached please find list of Indian Treaty children attending the Provincial Special School at York Factory as per your request in letter dated Feb. 8th, File 42001-3(E).\n\nPlease accept my apologies for not having forwarded this information at an earlier date, but it has been difficult to obtain the data due to the distance involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(sgd.)

Indian Day School\n\nThank you for your letter of July 18 which came to hand on August 6th on my return from an extended visitation of our Indian Missions in the Hudson Bay area and the northern end of Lake Winnipeg, which occupied my time and attention for a month.\n\nI visited Churchill, York Factory and Jack River, Norway House, as well as other points in the northern area of our Diocese, including Split Lake. Teachers are required for York Factory, Jack River and Split Lake, and thus far we have no applicants for any of them. We should be pleased to hear from you as to any Anglican applicants, or other suitable teachers.\n\nI may say that on the occasion of my visit to Split Lake from July 22nd to 25th, the teacherage was not erected, although it was expected that the same would be duly constructed by Mr. Blend and Mr. Hadley, the Hudson's Bay manager and free trader respectively.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Retallack, the Hudson's Bay Company manager at York Factory is being transferred, hence I presume the services of Mrs. Retallack as teacher will not for long be available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd) J. Keewatin\nMay 26, 1949.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nYork Factory Day School.\n\nReference your 215-11 (138) of April 7\n\nPlease advise Mr. Grafton that we would be very pleased to guarantee an amount of $200.00 per annum towards the services of a teacher for the York Factory Provincial School.\n\nWe will establish this as the York Factory Joint School and will pay the teacher at the rate of $20.00 per teaching month and are prepared to go higher if required by Mr. Grafton. With regard to the teacherage, could you advise whether we should include an amount for this in our next year's estimates. You might also tell Mr. Grafton that an Order-in-Council is being put through for the South Indian Lake money and that a cheque will be forwarded to the Department of Education in the near future.\n\nWould you speak to Mr. Rogers by telephone and advise me by Army Message to whom the cheque for South Indian Lake should be made out. I presume it will be to the Minister of Education but would like to have confirmation of this fact.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier le d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\nOttawa, October 3, 1949.\n\nMr. J.H.

Neary, Esq., Supt. of Educ.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of Oct. 3rd, following please find information requested.\n\nNo. 1. Attendance Indian Children York Factory School.\n\nTen children are attending at the present time. This attendance will probably rise to twenty in the near future, as families are expected to move in from Port Nelson.\n\nNo. 2. Progress Construction New Schools in Agency\n\nOxford House School, No. 1 has been completed, with the exception of installation of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nGod's Lake United Church School is also completed, with exception of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nWhen these chimneys arrive it will be only a matter of hours to install each one.\n\nI made a final check on God's Lake United Church School on Oct. 17th.\n\nThis building has been completed sufficiently to legalize payment to the Contractor.\n\nHowever the finishing was an extremely hurried job and reflects no credit to the man concerned.\n\nThe living quarters especially are very poorly painted and finished, the cupboard doors do not fit and the paint has just been slapped on.\n\nIn the Main Class Room, the small windows on the North side are fitted with Butt hinges, these hinges were not countersunk; when the windows are closed it leaves an eighth of an inch gap.\n\nThe Contractor was told about all this by the Assistant Agent at God's Lake and agreed to rectify it, however it was not done as apparently the main idea was to get finished and get back to town.\n\nUnfortunately, the Contractor had left when I made my final inspection. The whole finish shows a definite lack of interest. In my opinion this man should not be given any further Contracts with the Indian Department.\n\nAttached please find Final Progress Report.\nNo. 3 Joint Recommendation by Mr. Grafton and myself on New Schools Next Year.\n\nThere are no further Reserves in this Agency that would warrant a joint School, due to the lack of Non-Treaty Children.\n\nNo. 4 Report on New Teachers.\n\nTo date I have only met Miss M. Rahn of God's Lake United Church School, she appears to be doing well and seems to be quite efficient.\n\nI see no signs of Teachers for Oxford House Schools, No. 1 & 2, nor for Split Lake.\n\nCould I be advised as to when these Teachers may arrive?\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the Quarterly Return ending Sept. 30th, 1949, submitted by this Agency. Under the heading \"Schools & Education\", reference is made to a Permanent School at Shamattawa.\n\nI would appreciate your comment on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H.

Please inform me what amount the Manitoba Department of Education allows towards the salary of this teacher. When your report is received the Department will be in a position to decide what amount can be allowed for the March quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon R. Faries,\nYork Factory,\nVia The Pas,\nMAN.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of June 7th, No.138-2-3 - I have to explain that the small attendance of Indian children at our School during last winter was due to the hard winter the people experienced. Fur-bearing animals were scarce, which meant reduced circumstances for the Indians, and they could not afford to live at the Settlement. So the children were taken away to distant fishing places. Since the summer, however, the attendance of Indian children has increased so much that we were obliged to dismiss the half-breed children in order to give ample accommodation to the Indian children.\n\nAs to the information asked for - I may say that the Manitoba Department of Education allows a grant of $40.00 a month towards the teacher's salary. The teacher's salary is $1000.00 a year. Besides the salary we have to allow $200.00 a year for operation expenses - transportation, fuel &c., and we cannot draw on our Church Missionary funds for any expenses in connection with the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRichard Davies\nArchdeacon of York\nand\nSupt. of Indian Missions for Diocese of Keewatin\n\nYork Factory,\nVia, The Pas, Man.\nJuly 6th, 1924.\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| M.

Since Christmas three more children have been left at the Settlement to go to School, so there now seven Indian children going to School. Unfortunately an epidemic of Measles has broken out at the Settlement and we have been obliged to close the School.

Dewdney to succeed him.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Dewdney. We note that he took up his duties on the 1st instant. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $30.00 per month of ten teaching months in the year. Should Mr. Dewdney teach only part time we could only allow him salary on a per ordinance basis of $3.00 per day for the actual days taught, but if he keeps school opened each teaching day in the year, payment will be made to him at the rate mentioned viz. $30.00 per teaching month. He should prepare and forward his quarterly returns showing attendance as regularly as mail facilities permit. It is hoped that Mr. Dewdney will meet with success in the work as teacher at York Factory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[T. R. L. McInner]\n\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen Archdeacon R.

In this connection it is noted that the Department of Education for the province of Manitoba has appointed Mr. F. Ed. Goldring, B. A., who has the necessary academic qualifications, to succeed Mr. Fraser and that he will likely have reached York Factory in time to begin duties on the 7th instant.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Goldring, with salary allowed by this Department at the same rate as previously paid, viz.: $70 per teaching month.\n\nIt is noted that this school is being operated for the benefit of half-breed children as well as the Indian children at York Factory.\n\nNo doubt, a requisition will be received in due time for the supply of biscuits and classroom equipment required.

As it means a long delay to send it back for the Acting Agent's signature, I have examined and signed the Return as the Missionary-in-charge of the Mission where the School is conducted, and I am in a position to verify the teacher's Report.\n\nThe Cheque for the tuition given in this School may be sent in the usual way: viz., to the Bank of Montreal, account No. 5078, in Winnipeg, Man.\n\nIt may be noticed that there were only six Indian pupils in attendance last Quarter, due to the trapping life of the Indians who have to live on their trap-lines many miles away from the Settlement. After March, however, there will probably be Twenty or more Indian pupils in the School.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Goldring, teacher of the York Factory Combined School. This cheque was sent in error, as a cheque for $70.00 only should have been forwarded.\n\nAs you are aware, the amount allowed this school is $700.00 a year and this is paid on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year. Consequently, only one-tenth of the annual salary is paid for the month of September.\n\nIf this cheque has not yet been cashed, please return it to the Department at once and a new cheque for $70.00 will be issued.\n\nIf the cheque has been cashed, please advise me and the over-payment of $140.00 will be deducted from the amount due the York Factory School for the quarter ending December 31st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Under present regulations this receipt is required before we can issue the cheque direct to you.\n\nAs you have previously been informed, salary is only provided for nine months during the current fiscal year at all Indian day schools.\n\nThe fiscal year runs from April 1, 1940, to March 31, 1941, and during that time, as stated above, funds for only nine months' salary are available. Mr. Chunn has been paid for April, May, June and July, or four months of the current fiscal year, and consequently only five months' salary can be paid between now and the end of March, 1941.\n\nI note from your letter of the 8th instant that Mr. William Hladun re-opened this school on September 16, 1940. This Department has no objection to his appointment. I enclose staff questionnaire which he should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nVen.

These movements can only be anticipated by the missionary in residence.

The Department will pay the freight charges. If you can take this freight I will be pleased if you will state the date on which you would require these articles to be in Montreal and to whom they should be addressed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

These goods should be furnished at the lowest possible price and you will be good enough to forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, to the Department and upon receipt of these payment will be made.\n\nYou should also forward accounts, in duplicate, covering the freight charges on the goods for York Factory and upon receipt of the same payment will be made.\n\nArchdeacon Faries, who is at present in Montreal and for whom all these goods are intended, will no doubt call at your office regarding these shipments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company,\nMontreal,\nQue.\n\nAsst.

Whilst at York Factory on patrol; reference to patrol report dated at Gillam, 30.9.36 the Rev. Archdeacon R. Faries interviewed me with respect to an Indian School which he is building at York Factory. At the present time the Indian Dept. is using a small cottage owned by the Hudson's Bay Co. for a school house and it is too small for the number of children who wish to attend school. The Anglican Mission have therefore started to build a new school for the Indians and the Rev. Faries is desirous of having financial aid so that the school may be completed for next summer. I would therefore request that the undermentioned be included in the estimates for the York Factory band for the fiscal year 1937-38. Hereunder is a list of the requirements.\n\n25 Double School Desks to include\n5 Fronts and 5 Backs, made up as follows; 5 for ages 10-15 yrs.\n10 \" \" 7-10 \"\n10 \" \" 5-7 \"\n\n50 Yds. 48\" Wide Slated Cloth for Blackboard.\n1 38\" Camp Comfort Stove.\n24 Lengths 7\" Galv.

Size Flag (Union Jack)\n1 Gross Slates.\n1 Slate Pencils.\n1 Lead Pencils.\n1 Scribblers, Pencil Ruled.\n1 Exercise Scribblers.\n\nAt the present time there are not many Indian children attending school, but during the Summer months of July and August this year there was an average attendance of 33 which is the capacity of the present school. The school which is being built is 20 feet long by 24 feet wide and will have a seating capacity of 50 children. The material used for the building has been bought and paid for by the Anglican Mission. I would also request that the sum of $500.00 be granted to cover the cost of labour for building the school.\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above and report in the above connection dated at Gillam October 1st, 1936, I would request that I be advised if the articles requisitioned for that time have been approved and if they will be forwarded this year. I have a communication from the Rev. Archdeacon R. Faries of York Factory who informs me that they are ready to go ahead with the building of the school but that they lack the necessary funds and that he does not care to start on the building until he assured that the Government will pay the expenses of erecting the building. He also stated that he approached the Dept. of Indian Affairs ten years ago in regards to building a new school and that they were willing to give him any help he wanted in the matter, unfortunately he was not prepared to build at the time. The material is all at York Factory now for the building, the Anglican Mission having purchased same from the abandoned project at Port Nelson last summer. I would therefore request that I be advised if the sum of $500.00 which was asked for to cover the cost of the erection of this building has been approved.\n\n2. The remainder of the Treaty Supplies for York Factory check out correctly with the exception of a certain amount of school supplies which were requisitioned for under date of April 1st, 1937. I would also request that if possible these books be forwarded as they are necessary for the Indian Bay School at York Factory. An early reply would be appreciated so that I may be in a position to inform those interested of the Departments' decision pertaining to Treaty at York Factory during the latter part of July.\n\nThe O.C. \"D\" Div.,\nR.C.M.P.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nForwarded 24-6-37.\nExtra copies attached for the information of the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.H.

I now enclose a copy of a further report received from Const. J.D. Lee, dated at Gillam, June 21st, 1937, on this subject, in which he asks to be informed if the articles requisitioned for have been approved and if the sum of $500 will be forthcoming, as the material for the erection of the school is now all at York Factory.\n\n3. If you can furnish a reply to these questions at an early date, and also state if the additional books, etc., asked for in Const.

Farries to erect a new school at York Factory.\n\nWhen preparing our Estimates for the current fiscal year, it was not found possible to include in them an item of $500.00 towards the cost of the erection of this building.\n\nHowever, after carefully considering your recent letter, it is found possible to allow an amount of $300.00 towards the cost of the building. It is hoped, with this assistance from the Department, that the church authorities will find it possible to carry out their plans in connection with the York Factory School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

With reference to the above attached hereto please find estimates in duplicate for transmission to the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\n2. In previous years all the Treaty Supplies have been sent to York Factory and then issued to the various bands at this point. During the last year approximately 65 Indians have established a permanent trapping ground at Fox Lake which is situated about 35 miles N.E. of Gillam and it is requested that the supplies shown on estimates for the Fox Lake Band be shipped immediately to the Cst. I/C, R.C.M.P., Gillam, Man. By having these supplies shipped to Gillam it will do away with the monthly Slick & Substitute Account at the H.B.Co. as rations can be issued direct from I.H. supplies at Gillam. It will also eliminate the usual trip which the Indians have to make from this point to York Factory where they have been receiving their Treaty Supplies.\n\n3. In regards to school supplies, I might state that the new school building at York Factory was completed in September. The articles which appear on these estimates are needed to equip the interior of the school and it is requested that every effort be made to forward same with the annual supplies.\n\n4. Drug requisitions from York Factory and Gillam are also attached hereto. The drugs requisitioned for from Gillam are very small owing to the fact that certain drugs and pills now on hand will be sufficient for requirements during the year 1937-38. Drug requisition from Shemattawa has not been received to date but same will be forwarded upon receipt.\n\n5. Supplies for York Factory should be shipped to arrive at Churchill, Man. not later than June 30th, 1938 so that connections made be made with H.B.Co.\n\nThe O.C. - \"D\" Division,\nR.C.M.P., WINNIPEG, Man.\n\nSix: Forwarded 4-11-37.

(RG 10, Volume 6249, file 546-5, part 1)\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Davis' report dated January 4th, 1949 on the York Factory Indian Day School.\n\nIn the village at the time of our arrival there were 12 Treaty children and 13 non-treaty children. These people live around the settlement. Mr. Grafton, the Provincial School Inspector, made arrangements to open up a classroom the first of the year, and hired the Hudson's Bay Manager's wife as teacher. Both Treaty and non-treaty children will be looked after. This will be a joint school, and, no doubt, the Provincial Government will be taking the matter up with you.\n\nWe were unable, owing to flying conditions, to visit the North Knife Settlement, which is about 8 miles north of Churchill and where the Indians are now permanently located. This being half of the Duck Lake Band, which, I understand, split up a few years ago. There are about 150 Indians in each band, as near as I could learn. It is my intention to go in next summer and check over the whole situation, as we may be able to build a school for these people. We were also unable to visit Neultin Lake, as flying conditions in the Barren Lands were bad, and the pilot advised us it was not safe. Part of the Brochet Band live at this point. The settlement, I understand, is very small - only two or three families living there, the rest being scattered. This point will also be visited by myself next summer. I understand from trappers who arrived in Churchill, that conditions amongst these bands were fairly good and no one was suffering.\nMaterial List Teacherage - 2.\n\nDoors (Cont.)\n\n1.

We will be paying a share of the teacher's salary and also contributing towards the erection of a small teachersage. I understand there will be some twelve Treaty children and thirteen non-Treaty children in attendance. This was the number of children in the village last January when our survey party visited the reserve.\n\nWould you please advise your Missionary of these plans and request his co-operation in the operation of this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nI think that Mr. Copley is getting another teacher. The wife of the R.B. manager has gone with her husband to a western poor. Copy sent to R. S.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: York Factory Joint School\n\nThank you for your 546-5(E) of 25th July, 1949, a copy of which we are sending to Rt. Rev. J. Lofthouse, Bishop of Keewatin, Kenora, Ontario, with the request that he issue appropriate instructions to his Missionary in the York Factory area.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nJanuary 3, 1948.\n\nRight Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nYork Factory Indian Day School,\n\nDear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nWe have recently had our Educational Survey Officer accompany Provincial School Inspector Grafton through the various settlements in northern Manitoba. You are of course aware of the day school at York Factory and know that it has not been possible to obtain a teacher for the past eight years. Archdeacon Faries was formerly the Secretary-Treasurer of the local School Board and was the moving spirit behind the establishment and maintenance of this school. You will recall that we donated an amount towards the construction of this building and that we paid a contribution towards the salary of the teacher.\n\nReports from Mr. Clark, our Educational Survey Officer, indicate that the school is in good condition but that the teacherage is unfit for use. I understand that Mr. Grafton has arranged to have Mrs. Metlack, the wife of the Hudson's Bay Post Manager, teach school from January on. There will probably be a very small attendance during the winter but the Indians will attend when the trapping season is over.\n\nAs we are anxious to do everything possible to bring educational facilities to these Indians, I would appreciate hearing from you with any comments and suggestions which you would like to make, concerning the operation of this school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard P. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education.\nElford, Manitoba,\nOct. 20th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention - Bernard F. Neary, Esq., M.P.O. of Edm.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your telegram of Oct. 3rd, following please find information requested.\n\nNo. 1. Attendance Indian Children York Factory School.\n\nTen children are attending at the present time. This attendance will probably rise to twenty in the near future, as families are expected to move in from Port Nelson.\n\nNo. 2. Progress Construction New Schools in Agency\n\nOxford House School, No. 1 has been completed, with the exception of installation of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nGod's Lake United Church School is also completed, with exception of Selkirk Chimney.\n\nWhen these chimneys arrive it will be only a matter of hours to install each one.\n\nI made a final check on God's Lake United Church School on Oct. 17th.\n\nThis building has been completed sufficiently to legalize payment to the Contractor.\n\nHowever the finishing was an extremely hurried job and reflects no credit to the man concerned.\n\nThe living quarters especially are very poorly painted and finished; the cupboard doors do not fit and the paint has just been slapped on.\n\nIn the Main Class Room, the small windows on the North side are fitted with butt hinges, these hinges were not counter sunk; when the windows are closed it leaves an eighth of an inch gap.\n\nThe Contractor was told about all this by the Assistant Agent at God's Lake and agreed to rectify it, however it was not done as apparently the main idea was to get finished and get back to town.\n\nUnfortunately, the Contractor had left when I made my final inspection. The whole finish shows a definite lack of interest. In my opinion this man should not be given any further Contracts with the Indian Department.\n\nAttached please find Final Progress Report.\nNo. 3 Joint Recommendation by Mr. Grafton and myself on New Schools Next Year.\n\nThere are no further reserves in this Agency that would warrant a joint school, due to the lack of non-treaty children.\n\nNo. A. Report on New Teachers.\n\nTo date I have only met Miss M. Halm of God's Lake United Church School, she appears to be doing well and seems to be quite efficient.\n\nI see no signs of teachers for Oxford House Schools, No. 1 & 2, nor for Split Lake.\n\nCould I be advised as to when these teachers may arrive?\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the quarterly return ending Sept. 30th, 1949, submitted by this Agency. Under the heading \"Schools & Education\", reference is made to a permanent school at Shamattawa.\n\nI would appreciate your comment on this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H.
