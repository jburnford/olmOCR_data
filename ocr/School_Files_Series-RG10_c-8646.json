We have two coats of paint to apply yet. For best results this should not be done until the weather warms up in the spring. We have received our last estimate, but with our deposit and 10% holdback on estimates we have about $2665.50 still owing to us. We have allowed $500.00 for painting. Would it not be possible for you to hold back this amount and let us have cheque for balance. We do not like to press this matter, but the financial situation in the West, this year, is terrible, and we need this money badly.

H. Dalton for work done at the Birtle Indian School.\n\nI am enclosing a statement of account submitted on behalf of Mr. W. H. Dalton, Neepawa, for work done at the Birtle Indian School and prepared in this office. I also desire to refer you to the statement of account forwarded to you under date of December 15th last. You will observe that both statements show a balance due to Mr. Dalton of $82.83. In comparing these statements with the one forwarded you by the Canadian Bank of Commerce, on behalf of Mr. Dalton, you will please note the following differences:\n\nTime Sheet No. 1 as originally submitted by Mr. Dalton, totalling $477.65, and after deducting his own time of eighty-five hours at $1.60 per hour there was left $320.35, not $410.35 as shown on Mr. Dalton's statement. Apparently Mr. Dalton has only deducted twenty-five hours for his own time on this pay sheet whereas he should have deducted eighty-five hours. This error makes a difference of $99.00 between the two statements\u2014this amount being $90.00 difference plus 10% profit figured by Mr. Dalton on the $90.00 not deducted.\n\nTime Sheet No. 2 is in agreement on both statements.\n\nTime Sheet No. 3 differs by $2.00\u2014this being an overcharge on Mr. Dalton's statement covering 136 meals at .40\u00a2, whereas his receipt from Claydon Company only shows 131 meals at .40\u00a2.\n\nMr. Dalton's statement shows $262.50 for his own time, whereas our statement shows this should be increased to $264.37. All other items on the statement are correct.\n\nA. E. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce, Neepawa, have enclosed an account of Claydon Company Limited for $115.15. Our information is that this account has not been paid, and accordingly should not be included in the statement giving the amount due Mr. Dalton. The fact that it has not been paid is not the fault of Mr. Dalton but is due to objections on behalf of this office to two or three of the items listed on the account. The matter of the settlement of this account is being taken up with Claydon Company by this office and when an agreement has been reached, Mr. Dalton will be authorized to make payment, after which you will be requested to forward an additional cheque to Mr. Dalton in final settlement of his account. In the meantime I would request that a cheque for $382.63 be forwarded to the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Neepawa for the account of Mr. W. H.

Winnipeg; the price to be $475.00. To this must be added the extra freight from Winnipeg to Birtle, amounting to $16.90, or a total of $491.90. Deducted from this is the amount of $4.71 being a credit note from the General Supply Company covering extra material supplied by this office. The total amount due to the General Supply Company is, therefore, $487.19, and I would recommend the payment of this account.\n\nTwo pressure gauges, supplied by the General Supply Company of Canada, have proven faulty and have been returned to them for adjustment or replacement. To date these replacements have not been made. However, it is not suggested that payment of this account should be delayed, pending the replacement of these two gauges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nA.

Fifty Dollars ($50.00) of the amount of this account is a deposit on the two cylinders of Chlorine, furnished by Messrs.

I find that he requires one black-board twelve feet long to be placed on North side of girl's class room and on the long wall in boy's class room dividing between class rooms, one on each side. An early reply to this and your approval will oblige and I will ask contractor to submit an estimate on same on receipt of your letter and save delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nFebruary 9th, 1931.\n\nA.

As plan only shows open arch be-\ntween living room and hall. I enclosed price of\n$67.00 for two doors as Mrs. Curry wanted them\nbut I have taken up this matter with them since\nand they will be quite satisfied with a 3' x 7'\ndoor. As plasterer is here from Winnipeg to do\npatching etc and is about finished it was necessary\nfor me to order part of this arch to be studded and\nplastered up to suit a 3' x 7' door, before plasterer\ngoes away. I await your approval to put this door\nin so that I can order contractor to order door.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nFebruary 9th, 1931.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received contractor Claydon's Progress Statement No 7, and the following item to metal angle beads and vertical angles to window jambs, the contractor has quoted the sum of $620.00. I asked the contractor to quote prices for ordinary metal angle beads and also a price for bull-nose beads and received approval from the Department for the ordinary metal angle beads. Having sent the original contractor's price to you without keeping a copy I would be pleased to know if the sum of $620.00 he charges refers to ordinary beads or Bull-Nose angles. I have a feeling that $620.00 was quoted for Bull-Nose beads and a sum over $400.00 for ordinary angles. I would be pleased to hear by return mail if the sum of $620.00 is right for ordinary angle beads so that I can check estimate. I wrote on the 3rd of Nov. and asked you to send me a copy but have had no reply. I am anxious to check over Progress Statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nFebruary 10th, 1931.\n\nA. F.

The sum of seven hundred dollars ($700.00) was laid aside for fixtures but no lamps specified or whether they are to be 40 or 60 watt.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear if the Department supply their own lamps. I have the feeling that the seven hundred dollars ($700.00) for fixtures covers this matter but they differ. I shall be pleased to hear at an early date re this matter.\n\nSpecification calls for Door Bell on Front Entrance, one in Kitchen and one in Staff Dining Room.

S. Stead, Neepawa, Manitoba, for work done at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nThere are also enclosed, the necessary vouchers, covering this account. Summarizing the total of the accounts submitted is $6,407.79. Mr. Stead has already been paid $1,300.00 on account, so that there remains to be paid Mr. Stead, $5,107.79.\n\nThere is one account outstanding; that of Claydon Company Limited, and amounting to $82.49, as shown by the statement submitted by them. This amount was considered excessive and the Claydon Company, on December 29th, were requested to revise their account. To date they have refused to do so and until a settlement has been effected with the Claydon Company, final payment can then be made to Mr. Stead. In the meantime I would request that a cheque for $5,107.79 be forwarded to the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Neepawa, for the account of Mr. H. S. Stead.\n\nAs Mr. Stead has been waiting for a considerable time for settlement of this account, I would appreciate if prompt settlement could be made. I may say that the amount shown on this account has been taken up with Mr. Stead, and while he is not entirely satisfied that he has received everything that is coming to him, he agrees to accept the amount mentioned in order to get settlement made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nA.

Gurney Orr Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe-Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just finished the Plumbing and Heating in the above Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba, our contract being with Messrs Claydon Co., Limited, and as we were about settling up, they charge us for excavating for drains inside the building, and as there may be a misunderstanding about the specification regarding this, we would be greatly obliged if you would give us your decision on this.\n\nOn page 14 of the General Specifications paragraph 2., Excavation, reads as follows:\n\n\"Excavate to the depth, form and size shown on foundation and section drawings, or as required, for all basement walls, foundation walls, footings and drains inside the building, to the depth shown and required.\"\n\nWhen estimating on this job, we took this paragraph to mean that the General Contractor was to excavate for all our drains inside the building, and did not allow anything for it, and when going over our accounts, Mr. Claydon says that this paragraph means excavating for the Weeping Drains only, and not for the Plumbing drains.\n\nThere is nothing in the Heating Specification about the Heating Contractor supplying radiator connections for temporary heat, but in the General Specification it calls for radiators connected up for temporary heat, and we did this as soon as building was ready and moved the radiators to suit the conditions of building, and did not make any charge, so we think it is up to the General Contractors to do the excavating for drains.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate getting your decision on this, which will settle up any dispute between ourselves and Claydon Co., Limited. Thanking you in anticipation, we are, yours very truly,\n\nBALLANTYNE & WETMORE LIMITED\nPer W.R. Wetmore, Pres.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thanking you for any assistance you might give us, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nEG-L\nFebruary 12, 1931\n\nR. Gueney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIn connection with the proposal to paint the cement finished floors and base, we have looked into this matter since the writer's return, and estimate that it will cost about Eighteen Hundred and Eighty Dollars ($1880.00) to give the floors a coat of concrete paint primer and a finish coat of concrete paint.\n\nWe can give you the choice of almost any make of paint, Stephens or Master Builders, Dominion Paint or Sherwin Williams. The fact that Stephens is made in Winnipeg and the nearest factory to the job, we would, if suitable to you, award them the business.\n\nOur price is based on estimated cost, and we would be glad to carry it out at a cost plus 10% and give you the benefit of any saving that is available.\n\nWe understand from Birtle that the work is almost finished off, and possibly in a week from now all the men will be off the building. We would be obliged in this connection if you would send any instructions you have to Mr. Henderson or Mr. Currie, who are taking over the building from us.\n\nWith respect to payment of estimates, we find there is a great deal more money owing to us than the writer had any knowledge of when last in Ottawa. The work being virtually completed, there is owing to us as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| December estimate                                | $10,071.00 |\n| Statement January 31st including some additional work | $17,766.10 |\n| Amount held as cost to complete as of Jan. 31st   | $1,000.00  |\n| Percentage retained on total contract less $1,000 cost to finish | $12,900.00 |\n| Deposit cheque lodged with tender                 | $13,500.00 |\n\n$55,237.10\nThis is an extraordinarily high sum to be due on a completed building, and if there is any way of releasing to us the December payment, we would be extremely grateful for anything you could do in this regard.\n\nWe are taking the liberty of pointing this out to Mr. Murphy in the hopes that something may be done, and enclose you copy of our letter to him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEnc.\nFebruary 13, 1931\n\nR.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir: Re Main Entrance Doors.\n\nThese doors swing outwards and calls for Yale Door checks and Contractor has a Yale Door check with tract attached, screwed on to this jamb for pushing door outwards. This is alright but we cannot hang a screen-door on the inside owing to door check and arm tract to same. To get screen doors on this frame it will be necessary to put door checks on outside of doors and have these doors checks exchanged to one without tract, then screen doors can be hung on inside to swing inwards. These door checks being on outside of doors are generally troublesome in cold weather. I have ordered Contractor to exchange door checks and put same on outside of doors, as I see no other way of hanging screen doors on inside save by putting frame and screen doors at top of steps on ground floor level at entrance door to general office. I trust having these door checks changed and putting others on outside will be satisfactory. This also applies to exterior doors at rear entrance leading to basement. These door checks are alright which will swing the door out but for the screen doors, these I am placing on inner vestibule frame at foot of stairs to swing inwards. Putting these door checks in this case on the outside frame to swing inwards.\nas doors come in contact with vestibule doors which swing outwards and to overcome this I am hanging screen doors on inside of the vestibule frame to swing inwards, towards the stairs. Trusting this will be satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nFebruary 16th, 1931.\n\nA. F.

This we find inadvertently included the yardage where the linoleum is to be placed as well as some rooms which are not to be painted.

There is today going down to you two credit notes, dated January 29th from Crane Limited, one amounting to $12.58, and the other amounting to $4.90, so that the total of these two credit notes, plus the item of $55.86, shows a credit in the books of Crane Limited of $73.34, as stated above.\n\nCrane Limited will, at your request, be glad to forward a cheque to you to balance the account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nA.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Wash Basins Etc.\n\nReplying to your letter Re Soap Dishes Etc. I wrote Mr. Stead and Mr. Dalton re this matter and had a visit of Mr. Stead a week ago. With reference to wash basins I explained to him that I thought the best thing to do was to put a four inch Maple board and cover same with nickel zinc and he approves of this himself and thought it the easiest way to overcome the trouble. I have received his estimate and forward same for your approval.\n\nMr. Dalton quoted me for expensive brass etc. and I wrote to him for other prices and when I receive same will forward on to you.\n\nI think Mr. Stead's figure for this work is very reasonable which causes no drilling into top of basins. In place of quoting me a price for three or four galvanized bins required for laundry he has quoted for feed cookers and must have misunderstood me. I forwarded his estimate as I am anxious to get this work in hand. I also bring the matter before you re Filter Tank, High Pressure Tank, Galvanized piping etc. constructed by Mr. Stead, which was ordered by Mr. Gow. They have left this work finished without being painted. The Filter Tank pipe connections are rusting through condensation and I deem it advisable that the Filter Tank and High Pressure Tank receive one coat of Black Japan and Galvanized pipes two coats.\nI have asked Mr. Stead to quote me a price for painting these tanks and will forward same when I receive it. These two tanks have had one coat of paint before they came here and I think one could on tanks will be simple but galvanized pipes will need two coats of Black Japan. I feel these should be painted at an early date. This I leave for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\n\nEnc.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that yesterday, the Electrician at the New School here, requested that he be supplied with the necessary bulbs for the lighting of the school, in order that he may test the wiring before he leaves. The supplying of these bulbs is apparently not in the contract; at least so I am informed by the contractor's foreman at the school, who states that a sum of $700.00 was allowed for \"fixtures\", which does not include the lamps.\n\nI therefore went through the building and listed the lamps that would be required, and find that to fit each light outlet with the lamp required, and still have a small number on hand for emergencies, would require the following:\n\n| Doz | Lamps 15 Watt Inside Frosted |\n|-----|-----------------------------|\n| 1   |                             |\n| 12  | 25 \"                        |\n| 6   | 40 \"                        |\n| 6   | 60 \"                        |\n| 1   | 75 \"                        |\n| 1   | 100 \"                       |\n\nThese lamps can be purchased locally as follows:\nW.E.N.King, Birtle, $71.40; George Moxham, Birtle $72.90, Mair & Huggins, Birtle, $90.00.\n\nAnother matter requiring the attention of the Department, is the cleaning of the windows of the building. The inside of the windows, and the storm sash, can be cleaned by the staff and older pupils, but the outside of the windows requires a man to do the work, as they are very hard to open as yet. The contractor informs me that he is not required by his contract, to leave the windows clean.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\nclean, and I therefore got prices for this work from two men as follows:- Mr Ralph McTaggart, .40\u00a2 per window, outside only, and will supply all materials required. Mr Frank May, .12\u00a2 per window, outside only, and will supply all materials required.\n\nIf this work is given to either of these men I would suggest that he be required to sign a contract to do the work at the price stated, and that a clause be inserted in the contract releasing the Department from any responsibility in case of accident.\n\nWill you kindly reply by wire, regarding the purchase of the electric lamps.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

These having been used on other buildings, they installed the same on the Birtle School.\n\nIf it is necessary to put on lock sets, it will also be necessary to put on bolts on one door in which case the push and pull plates and the check on that door would not be required. It is obvious that these will cost more than lock and two bolts, and it is, therefore, not a question of saving money which made them use the two checks and push and pull plates on both doors.\nWe feel they have made the best interpretation possible of the specification, and trust that in view of the explanation given it will meet with your approval, and would appreciate your advising us by wire as to your decision.\n\nOn the matter of painting for the metal doors, we are arranging to have this done, as it is obviously required, but it is not definitely covered in the painting or the door specifications. Our painting sub-contractors claim they did not include for it, and in view of this we request that you have an additional order issued for payment of this item.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nEC, Jr-L (E. Claydon Jr.)\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nMarch 6th, 1931.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter from Messrs Claydon.\n\nContractor's Superintendent refused to have this work done. With reference to toilet partitions, Painter refused to paint these partitions, although specified to receive three coats after being installed, without a written order from Claydon. I wrote Claydon two letters and sent a wire to instruct his Superintendent to have this work done. Now according to this letter they have made up their minds to do this work. I would like to state that they informed me that the partitions got three coats of Duco paint, put on with a spray and they said this was all the work they were going to do. This I would not accept, so now he has arranged to paint these and it will be up to him to send his painter back to do so.\n\nRe Metal Doors.\n\nThis work also has been done with a spray. Doors were hung before plaster came. I may state that it is nothing but a prime coat on these doors. These are fire doors leading from corridor to staircases. These doors are not specified to be painted. It seems to be omitted and should all receive two coats after being installed. These doors I ordered to be taken off, when\nplasterers came but they only covered them up with paper and paint has peeled off considerably in different places and should at least receive one coat to cover up exposed bare zinc where paint is off. Claydon Co., now demand an order for additional work for this item as per enclosed letter and refuse to make good these defects. This matter to allow an extra I leave to your judgment.\n\nMr. Curry noticed, with regards to these metal doors that no hardware with hinges and locks were specified. These doors are hinged to the door check on each door with four finger plates. Mr. Curry wants locks on these doors because he wants to lock children out when they should be in the play grounds to stop them from running through building. I informed him that these were fire doors and it was customary to have finger plates on these doors. I have told him repeatedly that they will not allow these doors to be locked.\n\nYou will note as per Claydon's letter that they mention that Messrs McDonald Bros, Sheet Metal Workers, have fitted these doors up similar to what they have done in other schools. I may state that the hardware was chosen and approved by the Architect.\n\nPainters will have to come back to finish toilets and I would also like this matter settled so that it can be done at the same time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/VC\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. Curry & Mr. Lazenby have drawn my attention Re galvanized piping connections to Filter and High Pressure Tank which, owing to condensation, has rusted and they think these should be painted, piping to receive two coats of black Japan, filter and High Pressure tank having one coat already. I asked Mr. H. S. Stead, by mail, to quote a price to paint these and he quoted Twenty-Two Dollars ($22.00) I have notified Mr. D. B. Gow that we are now ready to have Chlorinator connected up for filter and to send agent to make connections. I drew his attention that pipes are rusting badly and should be painted and two small leaks made good. This matter Re leak I held over thinking that Mr. Stead would have to come back.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nRAA210 13 COLLECT\n\nSTANDARD TIME\n\nBIRTLE MAN 11 24CP\n\n1931 MAR 11 PM 4 00\n\nA F MACKENZIE\n\nDEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nWIRE RECEIVED AWAIT CONTRACTORS LIST OF OUTSTANDINGS EXTRAS\n\nAS SPECIFIED PAGE THREE\n\nDAVID HENDERSON\n| DATE       | ARTICLES                  | Folio | Credit Amount | Debit Amount | BALANCE |\n|------------|---------------------------|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| March 4    | 12-15 Watt Electric Sockets | 22v   |               |              | 264     |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 3168    |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 1584    |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 1584    |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 200     |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 200     |\n|            |                           |       |               |              | 7140    |\n\nMaterial supplied,\nPrices fair and just.\nCertified Correct.\n\nJ.G.

A copy has been sent to Ottawa accompanied by a request for the release to us of the deposit cheque.\n\nWe did not care to send your original letter, as it was not on Government stationery. In case the Government should call on us to produce the original, would it not be better for your sake for us to have it on the regular stationery in the same way as all your letters to us are? We think it would look better to the Department as the original, rather than the one Mr. Swanson has handed to us.\n\nWe are sending back a copy taken from your statement in case you wish to have one written out on the typewriter.\n\nWe are preparing a statement for the additional work. We would have sent this to you before, but we had to have Mr. Swanson's assistance in some of the items. It so happened that during the past ten days we have been figuring on a very big job in Winnipeg, and were not able to send anyone to Birtle, otherwise we would have been glad to have made out the final statement before Mr. Swanson left.

Mr. Curry is anxious to use this for roadways and scatter over play grounds. This is frozen hard and will have to stand over until spring. There are also one or two temporary buildings to be moved off site.

The purpose of this advance was to meet such items of expenditure as outside labor, freight and expenses charges, and such incidentals as required immediate payment and could not very well be referred to your Department for payment from Ottawa.\n\nDuring the present year we have not been required to meet many items of expenditure along these lines, and as a result there is left unspent of the $250.00 advance, the sum of $240.95.\n\nI understand that your appropriation has been pretty well spent and that the account of Mr. H. S. Stead cannot be paid until additional funds are voted.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter today from Mr. David Henderson, Clerk of Works at the Birtle Indian School, advising me that the water tank and pipes require painting but that he has been advised from Ottawa that such additional work must stand over until after March 31st. Will it be agreeable to you if I have this paint job completed at the Birtle Indian School now, so that the pumping plant will be completed for putting into operation on April 1st, on which date I understand the school is going to be occupied by the children. Any funds remaining I will then pay over to Mr. H. S. Stead to apply on his account, and in this manner the fund could be all spent with no necessity of a refund to the Auditor General.\n\nIf this is not satisfactory to you, will you please advise me to whom you wish the cheque for the balance made out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nA.

However, in order to dispose of it we have arranged for the painter to put on two more coats on the job.\n\nWith respect to the hardware on metal doors, we think the information given to Mr. Henderson in our letter will explain the item to you. We feel Messrs. McDonald Bros. have done the right thing. Your ruling on the item would be very much appreciated.\n\nThe painting of these doors is an item which appears to have been overlooked in the specifications, and there is coupled with it the painting of metal work to stairs. This is not mentioned in the painting specification, and the painting firm did not include for either item. The painting work is obviously needed on both to make a complete job, and their request for additional payment seems only fair.

It is obvious that these will cost more than lock and two bolts, and it is, therefore, not a question of saving money which made them use the two checks and push and pull plates on both doors.\nWe feel they have made the best interpretation possible of the specification, and trust that in view of the explanation given it will meet with your approval, and would appreciate your advising us by wire as to your decision.\n\nOn the matter of painting for the metal doors, we are arranging to have this done, as it is obviously required, but it is not definitely covered in the painting or the door specifications. Our painting sub-Contractors claim they did not include for it, and in view of this we request that you have an additional order issued for payment of this item.\n\nYours truly,\n\nClaydon Company Limited\n\nF. Claydon Jr.\n\nEc., Jr.-L\nR. Gourney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to specifications re metal doors at staircase landings. Painting is not specified for these doors. These doors have been put on by McDonald Bros Sheet Metal Co., and have received a coat of Duco painting with a spray. Somehow or other it has been omitted that these doors receive two coats of paint. These doors were hung by Sheet metal men before plasterers came. I asked them to store these away but they only covered them up with paper, now they are peeling badly down the edges and badly blemished and are left in an unfinished manner. Owing to no painting being specified I took this matter up with Sheet Metal foreman and Claydon Co., and Claydon think they should be granted an extra if these doors are to be painted. I may also state that Principal Curry wants locks on these doors to keep children from running through the corridors when they should be outside. I have explained to him that these are fire proof doors and all they get is finger plates. Locks and hinges are specified for these doors have received hinges, finger plates and door checks, all that is necessary although he still wants locks so that he can keep children out. I informed him that these have been put up similar to other schools.\n\nWith reference to toilet partitions. These are specified in the plumbing to receive three coats of\npaint after being installed. These have also received a coat of Duco paint. Painter of Sub-Contractor refused to do these toilet partitions and metal doors because he had no order from Claydon Co., I wrote Messrs Claydon twice and wired him for him to instruct his Superintendent to have this painting done before they left the job. Contractor Claydon seemed to delay in answering my letter and I find that he had been in touch with the Sheet Metal Company. Enclosed please find copy of Claydon Co. letter.\n\nI had a wire from A. F. MacKenzie to the effect \"Wire me what you expect to issue final certificate Claydon Contract\". Last certificate issued was for seven thousand five hundred and sixty-four fifty nine cents which Messrs Claydon agreed to leave over until completion. A. F. MacKenzie wired me to the effect that they were anxious to grant contractor is deposit cheque on contract and to hold over my last certificate issued. I wired him three days ago to the effect \"Hold over last certificate issued plus extras--Sub-Contractor's payments outstanding--letter follows.\n\nI may state that I have had three telegrams from various Sub-Contractor's re outstanding payment namely:\n\nBallantyne & Wetmore $7000.00\nDominion Bridge Co., 2126.30\nMcDonald Sheet Metal Co., 1,491.40\n\nI wired McConaghie & Forsyth, Plasterers, but have had no reply yet but have the feeling that they may be two or three thousand dollars outstanding. On receipt of said wire I will forward amount.\n\nI deem it advisable that the last certificate be held back until contractor completes is work. There will be a small piece of grading to be done in the spring and\nmaybe one or two other items before his thirty days expire after completion.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear if you intend painting these metal doors and granting contractor Claydon an extra on same.\n\nI have written Contractor Claydon to the effect that no further payment will be made until he completes his painting. This matter of the Sub-Contractor's I mentioned for your discretion as these parties have written me several times as they have had no money since the first of December.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDavid Henderson,\nClerk of Works.\n\nDH/MC\nENC. 2.\nButte School - $34\n\nRefund from Crane\n\nCRANE LIMITED - WINNIPEG BRANCH\nSTATEMENT OF SETTLEMENT\n\n| DATE | DESCRIPTION | AMOUNT |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n|      | Covering C/M | 73.34 |\n\nAccs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School\n\nWe have mailed the Final Account re: the above to Mr. Henderson, and trust that he will shortly issue certificate covering same.\n\nThere is one item of the account which Mr. Henderson is not conversant with. We refer to Item #25 which is headed as follows:\n\n\"To additional cost of excavation being loading and freight charges on dragline to and from Birtle. Dragline necessary to handle boulders and rock which could not be done by ordinary methods.\" ....... $787.56\n\nWe are asking consideration of this account owing to the extra difficulty which we encountered in making the excavation.\n\nBefore tendering on the work we sent our Mr. Mitchell to Birtle to look over the site. He made a small test, and reported the ordinary excavation, and our price was based on same. The exact location of the School was not known, and it so happened where the test was made was not covered by the building.\n\nWe found nearly the whole of the site was packed with boulders which could not be dislodged without drilling or power. After trying four and six horse plows we were forced to use power, and accordingly loaded the 40 ton dragline from Winnipeg to Birtle. Our bill for doing so just represents the bare freight charges to and from Birtle and loading and unloading once.\n\nThe writer discussed this proposition with Mr. Orr,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\nand Mr. Orr promised to consider it, but remarked that he understood we used the machine on a gravelling contract near to Birtle, apparently thinking this might be a set off against freight charges on the School.\n\nIt is true we did use the machine in unloading gravel for a road contract, but it was no advantage for us to do so, and if we had not had it in the vicinity would have used caterpillar and circular scraper, which is usual for that kind of work. This work we usually let by sub-contract at prices ranging from 10\u00a2 to 12\u00a2 per cubic yard. It was no advantage whatever to have the dragline on it, as the moving was so slow, and we had to hire tractors to move our outfit so that our expense with regard to freight was wholly due to the School.\n\nWe make the above explanations about the use of the machine for fear it might be thought we were getting a double benefit for it being at Birtle, but we can assure you this was not the case.\n\nWe trust you will be able to pass the account as charged, and thanking you in advance, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC-L\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt to-day of your telegram of the 12th instant as follows:-\n\n\"Certificate in favour of Henderson has expired unable to continue his services longer than absolutely necessary. Endeavour to have final certificate and detail of extras forwarded by him earliest possible date. When forwarded notify him that his services will no longer be required.\"\n\nI beg to advise you that I had Mr Henderson in the office this afternoon in connection with this matter, and he informed me that he had already wired the contractor for details of the extras, and was awaiting the contractor's reply. Mr Henderson also showed me a letter he had received from the contractor stating that the painters were returning to the school to paint the toilet partitions, and if required, the fire doors leading from the corridors to the stairs.\n\nI instructed Mr Henderson to prepare the final certificate and details of extras at the earliest possible moment, and to bring them to this office for dispatch to the Department. When this is done, I will notify him that his services are no longer required, as per your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Ottawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your telegram of the 12th instant, regarding Mr Henderson, the Inspector of Construction at the new residential school, I beg to recommend that his services be dispensed with immediately, if some other arrangement could be made with regard to the final certificate.\n\nThe Claydon Company sent a painter to the school to paint the steel toilet partitions and fire doors. Yesterday, Mr Henderson and this painter did nothing at the school in the way of getting the work done. They left the school at about 10.30 a.m. and returned about 4.30 p.m., both being intoxicated. I was at the school immediately after dinner to see these men and waited until 4 o'clock for them without seeing them.\n\nAbout 7 p.m. I telephoned to Mr Henderson's boarding place to get in touch with him, and was informed that he had not turned up since noon. I found him shortly afterwards at the hotel, where I was in conversation with Mr Gow. Henderson came out of the beer parlour, intoxicated.\n\nIt is clear to me that Mr Henderson is simply trying to spin out his job as much as possible. I told him that the painter had stated that he was returning to Winnipeg by the night train, and asked him if this was true, as the painting was unfinished. He replied that the painter would have to finish the job before he left. However, when I was at the school this morning, I found that the painter had returned to Winnipeg, and left a\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nlocal man, who, to judge by his work, knows little about painting, to finish the work.\n\nMoreover, in going through the school today, Mr Currie brought to my notice the fact that he had seen one or two windows that had not been painted beyond a priming coat. I saw these myself, and a check up revealed 13 windows in this condition, two others without catches, and one with a broken catch, besides a great number badly in need of puttying, which would indicate that Mr Henderson has not been giving proper care to his work.\n\nLast night Mr Henderson showed me a telegram he had received from Mr Claydon offering to send a representative to Birtle to assist in getting out the final certificate, and Mr Henderson made the remark that he did not want to see either Claydon or his representative.\n\nMr Henderson has had the details of the extras in his possession since the 14th instant, on which date he showed them to me, and as far as I could judge, there is nothing to prevent the issue of the final certificate beyond some grading that is to be done by the contractor, which however, cannot be done until the weather conditions permit and the ground thaws out. This matter could be adjusted, I think, by withholding sufficient money to cover the work, from the final payment to the contractor, until such time as the work could be done, and would eliminate the necessity of Mr Henderson remaining until this job was done, before issuing the final certificate, which he apparently intends to do, as he has made no effort to prepare the certificate as yet, although I have instructed him to do so at the earliest possible moment.\n\nIf you have any further instructions in regard to the above matter, will you please advise me by wire.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nMarch 30, 1931\n\nP. G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nAdvise Henderson his services no longer required and have him turn over all papers to you.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that a satisfactory job has not been done in the assembling of the water pressure system at the new Residential School here.\n\nOne or two of the valves are leaking, one in particular; also the piping is leaking and several of the joints, with the result that the floor is constantly wet, and the cast elbows in the piping system are all badly rusted. Should not the contractor be required to put these defects right? I would also recommend that the pressure tank, filter, and piping be given one or two coats of Japan. This work could be done by some of the school staff, if the Japan were provided, with the necessary brushes.\n\nI may also say that the cylinder block in the water pressure pump has a defect. There is a small hole right through the casting, through which water is constantly leaking. This could no doubt be repaired with an acetylene torch, but in my opinion, the company who supplied the pump should be required to remove it and replace it with another.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

F. MacKenzie.\n\nChg. DIA.\nSir:\n\nI recently inspected the water supply system at the new Indian School at Birtle in company with Mr. Lazenby, Indian Agent. With the putting into operation of the pressure system, it has been shown that leakage exists at some of the pipe jointings, particularly around the pump and the filter plant. The pump was also observed to be faulty but upon representations being made to them in Winnipeg, by the writer, the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company have readily agreed to replace the pump. The leakage at the pipe connections can, of course, be readily made water-tight and upon the completion of this work the pipe, filter and pressure tank should be painted to prevent any further rusting and erosion.\n\nAs I have previously advised your department as to these conditions at the school, I advised Mr. Lazenby, at the time of the inspection, to report the conditions to you. However, I am now in receipt of a letter from him in which he states he had done so and was advised to bring the matter to my attention, inasmuch as the work was installed under the supervision of this office. As you are aware, the installation of the water supply system was let to Mr. H. S. Stead of Neepawa on a cost-plus basis, on instructions received from your department at Ottawa. Mr. Stead was considerably handicapped in carrying out this work by lack of proper equipment and etc., but generally speaking the work was carried out in a satisfactory manner. The worst leakage appears to be in connection with the pipe fittings furnished with the filter by the General Supply Company of Canada and these fittings came ready to assemble, so that no fault can be attached to the work of Mr. Stead insofar as poor pipe threading is concerned. It is necessary to have a competent steam fitter engaged for a day or so to correct any loose pipe connections around the filter and the pump and as Mr. Lazenby is at Birtle, and is now responsible for looking after the structure, I would recommend that you instruct him to engage a pipe fitter to fix all leaking connections and also make arrangements for having the necessary painting carried out and to supervise this work. If it is possible to so arrange I would suggest that Mr. Lazenby have Yates-Heale and Company of Brandon, send a man to make the adjustments to the pipes and that Mr. Lazenby make arrangements to have the painting done by local labor. Yates-Heale and company made a very good job of the water installation at the Brandon Indian School and I am sure would fix-up this system at Birtle in a very satisfactory manner.\n\nR. G. Orr, Esq.,\nChief Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nsatisfactory manner if given the opportunity.\n\nThe connecting up of the chlorinating system will be carried out as soon as the school authorities engage an engineer as the efficient operation of the system requires the attention of one familiar with mechanical equipment. Mr. Lazenby considers that the chlorinator should not be connected up and tested out until such time as the school has engaged a competent engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.B.

Sirs,\n\nAn appropriation ought to be secured at the present session of Parliament for the following new buildings at the Birtle Indian Residential School. These buildings are essential to the proper carrying on of school and farming operations, on our new site. The buildings are as follows - Sheep pens for 50 sheep; Poultry House, for not less than 200 Barred Rocks; Under this poultry house an excavated root house, for potatoes and vegetables, have this vegetable cellar of ample dimensions and frost proof; Hog House, to hold 100 pigs, room in end of same with hot water and provide for killing facilities.\n\nA driving or implement shed to accommodate a full line of farm equipment; A garage for one car, a truck will also be needed but it might be housed in the implement shed.\n\nA grainery to provide room to store crop from 640 acres, to use farming mill in same, to clean seed grain, room to grind the grain for feeding to stock.\n\nIf this money were available at an early date, this work should be done as soon as the weather in the spring will allow. The buildings are needed as soon as can be provided.\n\nMr Henderson, Clerk of Works, at the new School has made sketches of the above buildings also figured out approximate costs. His figures are about $8,000.00.\n\nI trust this work may be undertaken without unnecessary delay so that we may get our consolidated, at present cattle and horses are in the new barns on the new site; Hogs, sheep, poultry; grain, implements and etc., are at the old site about half a mile distant making it hard to do the work and supervise.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

Scott Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn regards to the proposed out-buildings in connection with Indian School here. We understand these were included in this year's estimates, and are to be built this year. We are very anxious for a chance to figure on these at whatever time your Department decide to go ahead with them. There is a strong feeling here that this business should be done locally. We have an acute unemployed condition, as well as hard times which are very prevalent.\n\nWe built the two barns for your Department last fall, and think you have excellent buildings. They have been admired by many. They were completed by the new year with exception of the painting. For best results with this we waited for warmer weather. However, we are busy on that end of it at the present time, and expect them to be fully completed in the next couple of weeks.\n\nAt one time in the erection of these barns we employed twenty men, all of them local, and in almost every case a married man with dependants. Doing all we could to relieve the labor situation. Our actions in this regard have never been criticized.\n\nNaturally we are very anxious to secure the contract for these buildings, and ask for a chance to figure on them when the time comes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. M. DOIG\nOttawa, April 15, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to outbuildings at the Birtle Indian Residential School.

When the necessary repairs have been made will you please advise me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP. G. Lamonty, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\n[Signature]\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSECRETARY.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that on going through the new residential school today, with Mr Polson, the foreman for the Valley Lumber Co; of Minnedosa, to whom the contract has been awarded for the supplying and installing of the fixtures, it was found that several changes or modifications from the plans are necessary.\n\nOn sheet No; 5 of the plans, figure No; 32 and 33; in the boys' dormitory (No; 33) there are two radiators set in the position shown for these cupboards. I suggested that this fixture be divided in two at the left of the central broom cupboard, and the two portions set with their backs to the north and south walls, so as to leave the radiators open. This will mean two extra ends, but as Mr Polson assured me that there would be no additional cost, I authorized the change. No change from the plans is required for this fixture in the girls' dormitory. (No; 32).\n\nOn sheet No; 4, figure No; 19, Cupboard in Residence Kitchen; Mrs Carrie, the matron, has asked that three drawers be installed in the lower part of this fixture at the right of the sink, for kitchen cutlery &c; also that the cupboard at the lower left of the sink, be provided with a double panel door, as this is for pots and pans etc., the upper compartment, Mrs Carrie wishes to be fitted with glazed doors, two single doors and one double door, in order to keep dust from dishes. As these changes would involve an extra cost, roughly estimated by Mr Polson at about $30.00, I have not authorized them to be made, and leave the matter for your decision.\n\nOn sheet No; 3, figure No; 1, owing to there being a complicated arrangement of heating pipes in the position shown on the plan, about 30 inches from the ceiling, it was found to be almost impossible to put this fixture in this position; the doors would only just open if they were made double doors each a foot wide, instead of single doors two feet wide, and the pipes leading to the right hand end of the radiator interfered with the construction of the broom cupboard. The most satisfactory way\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nout of the difficulty in this case was found to be to reverse the plan of the fixture, and change its position from that shown on the plan, to the west wall of the dining room, south of the entrance doors; this would involve no extra cost, and the fixture could be built as planned except that it would be reversed. I have authorized this done.\n\nOn sheet 3, figure No; 10, owing to the presence of pipes in the corner of the kitchen, the broom cupboard on the right of this fixture will require to be made one foot lower with a straight top instead of a sloping top, and the extreme width available is two feet instead of 2'-3\".\n\nOn sheet 3, figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, open lockers for the recreation rooms; owing to the radiators on the walls being too low down, these fixtures could not be placed as shown on the plan. Mr Polson suggested that instead of having open backs and set against the wall, these lockers be furnished with closed backs, made of three ply lumber, and made movable, so that they could be pulled from the wall in order to sweep behind them. There being no increase in cost, I have authorized these changes made in these fixtures.\n\nWill you please advise me by wire if the aforementioned changes are approved, and also advise me of your decision as to the change wanted by the matron in the fixture in the residence, as set out in the third paragraph of this letter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nMay 4, 1951.\n\nDear Mr. Clayton,\n\nI have not yet received from you a statement giving in detail the cost of lighting fixtures installed in the Birtle School.

Orr, the architect, and Mr Claydon, one of the firm of contractors, it was agreed that the contractors were to re-paint all the windows on the outside; paint the steel staircases; and that all the casement windows should be beaded on both edges to make them closed fitting. The large washer in the laundry, which was leaking badly at one end, was also to be put in order.\n\nFour of the Contractors' men have been at the above work during the past week, and I inspected the work this morning on its completion. The windows have all received another coat of white paint; the staircases have been painted brown to conform with the color of the steel doors adjacent thereto; the two ventilating ducts in the dormitories have been painted cream to match the pipes, and the casement windows have been beaded as required. All this work has been done in a satisfactory manner, and I have given Mr Jennings, the foreman in charge of the work, a letter to the contractors to this effect. With regard to the washer, the leak is now very small, and when another washing is done in it, with hot water, this will entirely disappear.\n\nI beg to advise also, that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have rendered an account, amounting to a little over $28.00, for water supplied to the school, up to the 4th March, at which date the building was still in the hands of the contractors. This account, I submit, should be paid by the contractors.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent\nMay 6, 1931\n\nA.F.

I called you later at the Hotel and was told you had checked out, and thinking perhaps you were making a local visit I called on Mr. [illegible], who said you had gone over the C.N.R. via Fort Francis, so I concluded I would not see you over the weekend.\n\nI enclose herewith statement respecting the cost of lighting fixtures and globes supplied. The Levvy Electric Co. who supplied them quoted us a price and submitted a detail, which on consideration we accepted.\n\nIn view of what you state about their costing too much, we had another check made, but cannot find any cause for complaining that the prices are excessive.\n\nThe globes were supplied on demand of Mr. Henderson. He wrote us a special letter about it, and, of course, he being the Inspector we acceded to his demand.\n\nThere was another additional fixture supplied which was called for after the contract was made for which the Levvy Electric Co. are not making any charge.\n\nYou will note there is a credit to the Department of $225.00 which we presume you will deduct from our bill. Of course, if you care about leaving it in as a compassionate allowance, we would very much appreciate it.\n\nWe sent our Mr. Jennings to clean up at Birtle. He was the carpenter foreman at Edmonton and Cardston and had complete charge of the work at Kamloops.

With respect to the warped doors, however, Mr Watt does not feel that they should be held responsible, as this condition is entirely due to the inefficiency of the ventilating system in the barn, which resulted in the whole of the inside becoming dripping wet.

Guerney Orr, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nFarther to my note of this date, I have seen Mr. Gow with respect to the accounts re: Stead and Dalton, and have arranged with him on a settlement which is satisfactory to him.\n\nAt the time Messrs. Stead and Dalton were working at Birtle, they entered into certain engagements with our foreman, and any charges made or statements of cost discussed were quite unknown to us until copy of the account as rendered by our foreman to Messrs. Stead and Dalton was received at the office.\n\nI was fortunate just now having our foreman doing some work in this building, and took the opportunity of calling Mr. Gow, who very kindly came down at once, and after a full discussion of the whole matter, agreement has been reached of which you will no doubt be advised by Mr. Gow.\n\nWith further reference to the electrical items I enclose also brochure containing information as to design, etc., of the various fixtures supplied at Birtle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC-L\nEnc.\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\nGENERAL CONTRACTORS AND BUILDERS\nCONFEDERATION LIFE BUILDING\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nMay 22, 1931\n\nR. Guernsey Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nReplying to your letter of May 18th we offer herewith the following particulars as requested therein and as noted on yours of May 4th.\n\nI regret when answering yours of May 4th the matter of explanation with reference to Item 4 in our Additional Items Account was quite overlooked. I must admit answering the letter hurriedly with respect to the electrical fixtures, and quite unintentionally overlooked the explanation asked for with respect to Item 4.\n\nThis item is made up of additional excavating and concrete done to the order of Mr. Swan and comprises an extra 4\" of width on the footings as shown on separate account attached. Mr. Swan ordered the matter direct from Mr. Mitchell, and for your information we attach copy of letter he wrote us under date of August 26, 1920.\n\nWith respect to the details of cost of the electrical fixtures, we enclose herewith copy of letter received from the Levvy Electrical Co. of April 27th. These details were requested from them in the expectation that I would see you before you left our district. We did not receive it from Mr. Levvy, however, until the Monday after you left so the opportunity was not afforded to make an explanation in regard to it.\n\nWe checked the prices named on the letter with the wholesaler and found them corroborated. You will notice Mr. Levvy mentions a margin over and above net cost of 15/10%, and makes reference to it as being approved by the Public Works Dept., Province of Manitoba. We find this is also correct and is a standard charge in Manitoba in dealing with fixtures and other electrical work.\n\nIn support of the above Mr. Levvy also refers us to\nThe Secretary of International Association of Electricists\nc/o R.A.L.Gray Co., 157 King St.West, Toronto and McCuaig Co.Ltd.,\n1252 McGill College Ave., Montreal\n\nThe reason the above addresses are given is because Mr. Levy does not know the address of the Secretary, and if you see fit to write to him think it would be as well to send a line also to whichever Company you send the letter to requesting that they forward any inquiry you care to make to the Secretary.\n\nYou will notice the Levy Electric letter only accounts for $425.00 whereas the credit of $225 from the $700.00 allowance for fixtures leaves a total of $475.00 as chargeable on fixtures, thus making a difference of $50.00 between the Levy letter and the invoice sent you. The $50.00 is made up by there being sent to Birtle an additional 15- #9104/703 Gill Hyperion Units @ $2.60, a total of $39.80.\n\nIn addition to the above there are several other items of work which Mr. Levy claims they should be paid for which amount in all to about $35.00, making a total with the additional fixtures of $68.80. They were the subject of disagreement between Mr. Levy and Mr. Henderson and also a conflict of interest with respect to work of the plasterers. As some of the alleged additional work had been cancelled, the matter was decided to be dropped by allowing the Levy Electrical Co. $50.00 being $33.80 for the regular charge for the additional fixtures and the balance a compromise amount to settle the outstanding differences.\n\nYou will understand our position as General Contractors was often very difficult owing to the situation at Birtle, and we had a lot of trouble on our own account in the same way. Several items of work were cancelled and even the additional hardware asked for by Mr. Currie was sent to Birtle by express for which we received no payment and then the hardware had to be returned also at our expense.\n\nWe trust the information tendered above will satisfy your inquiry.\n\nIn general, we are disappointed to find an account the size of ours, which has been held so long through no fault of ours, should be held up for payment by an inquiry which has to do with such a small amount as the items mentioned herein. We certainly would appreciate having had payment in full of the contract even if you kept the additional items as the subject of inquiry.\nIn addition to the above we still have the outstanding charge against Mr. Stead and Mr. Dalton of Neepawa on which we cannot get any satisfactory decision with Mr. Gow. We know the accounts rendered to Mr. Stead and Mr. Dalton are in order. In fact have gone into them in great detail since our foreman returned to Winnipeg and are convinced that he erred on the side of leniency, especially as we found we lost $1,000 in running our camp proving that we charged too little for board.\n\nThere is no question but what the sand we charged for was destroyed. It was plowed around by horses and so much clay got into it that the amount we charged Mr. Gow has been destroyed.\n\nFurthermore, our lumber was used without our leave for heating sand and gravel. Our foreman on more than one occasion found some of the men chopping up 4 x 4s and 2\" dimension lumber for this purpose. Until Mr. Gow raised this contention the account was quite agreed between us, and now we are being asked for minute details on lump sum items which were perfectly agreed between our foreman and Mr. Stead and Mr. Dalton.\n\nExcept for the portion of the work which we think was deliberately dragged out by Mr. Henderson our contract has been finished now about three months, and we find it quite a hardship to be out of the money for so long a time. If it is at all possible we think some interest should be allowed us for the delay in making progress estimates during the Winter and on the large amount outstanding since the work was completed. We shall be very glad of any consideration which can be offered in this way, and soliciting your kindly attention to the items on which we requested payment, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC-L\n\nEnclos\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: H.

At the present time there is considerable leakage in the vicinity of the pump and also in the pipe connections of the filter and connects to the filter. Upon proceeding to Birtle I would ask you to get in touch with Mr. Lazenby, Indian Agent, who will point out to you those parts of the system that have been giving trouble from leakage.\n\nYour account covering this work should be submitted to Mr. Lazenby for his approval before being forwarded to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Stead of Nesbawana requesting him to proceed to Birtle and make such adjustments to the pipe connections of the high pressure water system as were necessary to put the system in good working order. A copy of this letter and also Mr. Stead's reply under date of May 9th are enclosed.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter just received from Mr. P. G. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Birtle, from the contents of which I would judge that Mr. Stead is rather averse to having anything more to do with the water supply system at Birtle. Inasmuch as the school authorities will soon be occupying the premises, it is essential that the water supply and chlorinating system be put in a satisfactory working condition. I would accordingly recommend that the Yates-Neale Company of Brandon be employed to put this work in a first-class condition. Trouble is being experienced with the pumping system as Mr. Lazenby writes me that there are some knocks in the system which are hard to locate and very annoying. In my opinion Mr. Stead has not had the necessary experience in the installation of water systems to ensure the correction of the present defects prevailing at this school, and it is for this reason that I am recommending that the Yates-Neale Company of Brandon, who have had considerable experience in such matters and are fully qualified, be employed to put this water system at Birtle in satisfactory working condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEncs.\n\nA.

Cheques for Services: Gordons School & Birtle School.\n\nI am in receipt of yours of Aug. 4th explaining the shortage of $48.00 on my cheques for the first three months of the year. I was very much surprised to learn that it was on account of the trips to Birtle. On my first account sent in for trips in July 1930 I explained that I had to leave Punnichy at 3:50 a.m. one morning and arrived back at 3:10 a.m. the next morning. On none of my accounts did I show any charge for a berth on the trip down, but only on the trip back. On only one trip did I show a charge for a livery both ways from St. Lazare to Birtle, having usually made the return trip from Birtle to St. Lazare in the evening with private parties.\n\nI was under the impression that I was making a definite charge of $12.00 for making a trip of over two hundred miles and spending a day inspecting the work and reporting thereon; I would certainly not have undertaken the trip had I known that I was only to be paid $6.00 a trip. As just mentioned, my detailed accounts on these trips show that I saved the Department on my expense account, not even charging what I might justly have claimed for.\n\nI really feel that the deduction of this $48.00 is very unfair treatment, and would ask that it be given further consideration.\n\nMay I at this time again call attention to the account I sent in for preparing six sets of details for interior fixtures at Muscowequan School. I made seven sheets of details and had same blueprinted at a cost of $6.00 for prints alone, made six copies of a specification and schedule, and mailed all these to the mills for prices. I might here state that I did the same service on Gordon School although the number of sheets drawn was not so many. I do not feel that such services as these would come within the scope of the duties you usually get from your inspectors of Construction.\n\nDuring the construction of both the Gordon & Muscowequan Schools I have endeavoured to give the Department such services as might not be expected from an Inspector only. I have certainly acted as a Supervising Architect; and in doing so there have\n\nIndian Affairs.

There is a concrete post, square, supporting the steps at the back door of the Principal's residence; this is broken clean through just below the top. The concrete treads of the steel staircases inside the building and in bad shape, the concrete on many of the treads having crumbled away altogether which makes them somewhat dangerous for the children running up and down them. The finish coat of cement on the steps at the main entrance to the school, and at the front door of the residence, is coming off piece by piece. Unless these are put in good shape before winter sets in, rain will get into the openings, then freeze, and break off all the finish coat of cement.\n\nI may say also, that the drain in the floor of the furnace room, is absolutely useless, and unless this is put in proper working order, to take away the water, I fail to see how it will be possible to blow off and drain the boilers, which should be done periodically to keep them in proper order.\n\nThis floor has many cracks in it, and any water runs to the base of the furnaces, which appear to be lower than the rest of the floor. One of the furnaces appears to me to have gone out of plumb also.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: BIRTLE INDIAN SCHOOL\n\nIn response to your letter of September 24th, we made arrangements for our Mr. Mitchell to visit Birtle and check up the items of the alleged defects.\n\nAt the time of receiving your letter, Mr. Mitchell was very busily engaged in cleaning up the Arts Building, University of Manitoba, and we were also in the middle of estimating on the Science Building at the same place, so could not break him away immediately. However, he went there last Wednesday, and went over everything with Mr. Lazenby, and brought back a letter from Mr. Lazenby that each item of work had been put in order.\n\nIn general, there was nothing serious the matter. In most cases the work was incidental to what might be expected of a new building with one exception, and that was the possibility of some of the concrete stair filling may have got a touch of frost in it. However, this has been made good, and Mr. Lazenby has expressed his satisfaction with what has been done.\n\nRegarding the floor drain, as pointed out in our telegram, there is nothing that we could do to this excepting put in a sump pump. The boiler room sump is very much below the sewer outlet, and no provision was made by those in charge of the sewer arrangement for taking care of it. At Mr. Henderson's direction, we made a cess pit outside the building, and at the same time gave him as our opinion that it was not a good procedure, and that the connection should be made to the sewer.\n\nApparently there seems to be a little moisture under the floor, although we are at a loss to account for it, and are wondering if there is any leak in the water system at the rear. The drain from the Kelvinator is run through an outside pipe, also directed by Mr. Henderson, and we hardly think it should cause the trouble.\n\nThere certainly is more moisture than one would ordinarily expect, and Mr. Lazenby informed Mr. Mitchell that he has to bail out the sump pit every day.\n\nThe moisture under the floor is sufficient to have caused a slight settlement of the two 8\" I beams supporting the\nChapel floor, and it would appear that the moisture has also affected the setting of one of the boilers. There is a first class footing under the boiler exactly as called for, which is a foot thick, and is in very good shape.\n\nWe think that something should be done at once to take care of this moisture, otherwise we are afraid there may be even more settlement, which would probably be of a serious nature.\n\nWe suggest, therefore, that a Pemberthy automatic electric driven sump pump be installed or a water driven pump, supply for which could be taken from the water system. If the electric pump is put in, we would suggest the size #2E which has a 1\" pipe connection and is driven by \u00bd H.P. electric motor. This pump would cost delivered at Kirtle about $120.00. The water driven pump would cost about $80.00. We have not had time to get the exact price on it, but this is approximately correct. We cannot very well quote on the labour involved in installing the apparatus, but we would make as economical a job of it as possible.\n\nWe would suggest that this be put on the side of the boiler room against the laundry, and the discharge from it taken to the trench underneath the laundry machines. This would cause less cutting of flooring and concrete than any other scheme we could think of. It would mean putting in a new sump pit in the boiler room floor near to the laundry room wall. We would only than have to break through the brick partition wall to connect to the drain. We would suggest that the Kelvinator waste be taken also direct to this pit, and we think then there would be no further trouble about water.\n\nOur Mr. Mitchell believes, and he reports that Mr. Lazenby is in thorough concurrence with him, that the work should be done without delay. We shall be very glad to receive your instructions on the matter, and carry them out to the best of our ability.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have nothing on our file in this regard. Kindly make inquiry and let me have a full report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPercy G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th September, regarding a Mr Thomas Moynes of Birtle, who is asking for compensation on account of an injury received by him while employed as a labourer on the construction of the new Indian Residential School, I beg to report that I have interviewed Mr Moynes himself, Albert John Smith of Birtle, who was an eye witness, Mr J.W.Pratt Barrister, of Birtle, who took statutory declarations in the matter from several individuals, and Dr P.W.Head of Birtle, who attended to Thomas Moynes.\n\nMr Moynes stated that the accident occurred on the 8th October 1930, at about 10.30 a.m. At that time, Mr Moynes was one of several men who were engaged in aligning one of the big steel beams, which they were moving with crow bars. Mr Moynes went in between the beam that they were placing, and one that was already in place to remove some obstruction, and while he was in this position, the beam that was being placed tipped over and caught his right leg above the knee, between it and the other beam. After being extricated, he went on with his work, saying nothing about it, and worked that day until 3 p.m., when he had to stop and go home. The following morning, he went to see Dr P.W.Head, who advised him to return home and put hot fomentations on his injured leg. On the 2nd November, Mr Moynes states, he went into Birtle hospital, and remained there until the 13th November, his hospital bill being $19.75. About a week after the accident Mr Moynes put in a claim for compensation, through the Workman's Compensation Board, making out the papers for this, himself. The Board wrote to Mr Moynes on the 26th November.\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nNovember 1930, advising him that his claim had been rejected. On May 23rd 1931, evidently in reply to a plea for further consideration of the claim, the Board again wrote to Mr Moynes, stating that his claim had been given further consideration, but that the decision as outlined in their letter of the 26th November 1930, could not be changed. Again on the 15th August 1931, in reply to a letter written to them by Mr Moynes, the Board wrote to him, and simply gave him a verbatim copy of their letter of the 26th November 1930, in which they advised him that his claim had been rejected. Mr Moynes advises me that he has a wife and three children, the ages of the children being 12, 9, and 7 years respectively.\n\nAlbert John Smith of Birtle, who was an eye witness of the accident, stated that Mr Moynes' description of the accident was correct; that the boss of the steel work also saw it happen; that about six weeks or two months after the accident he made several sworn statements in connection with the matter, for Mr J.W.Pratt, Barrister of Birtle; and that Mr Moynes had tried again to get work at the school, but could not hold his end up at it, and had to quit.\n\nMr Pratt showed me statutory declarations he had taken from several individuals in connection with Mr Moynes' claim, and a Mr P.R.Phillips, Surveyor, of Birtle, had prepared a diagram, designed to illustrate exactly how the accident occurred. Mr Pratt stated that it was his opinion that Mr Moynes, in filling out the claim papers to forward to the Workmen's Compensation Board, had probably bungled the matter.\n\nDr P.W.Head of Birtle, stated that as a result of the accident, Mr Moynes had sustained a severe bruise, with resultant swelling of the leg, and that he had filled out and signed the necessary papers in connection with Mr Moynes claim for compensation through the Workmen's Compensation Board.\n\nWith regard to the statutory declarations taken by Mr Pratt, I may say that these were all practically identical, simply stating how the accident happened.\n\nMr Moynes himself, is a well advanced\ncase of T.B. All the family are under nourished, and are in straitened circumstances, and are one of a number of families receiving assistance from the Town in the way of food &c;\n\nWith regard to the letters written to Mr Moynes by the Workmen's Compensation Board, I may say that I have before me their letters of May 23rd 1931, and August 15th 1931, but I have not seen their letter of the 26th November 1930. Apparently they did not give the reason for their rejection of Mr Moynes' claim.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n13th October, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nIn further reference to your memorandum of the 21st ultimo with respect to the case of Thomas Moyes, of Birtle, Manitoba, I beg to say that Mr. Moyes was not an employee of this Department. He was working for the builder who had the contract for building the Birtle residential school. The Department accordingly has no responsibility with respect to this man's claim. Moreover, it appears that he has no claim to compensation under the Workman's Compensation Act as his claim was filed but rejected by the Compensation Board according to a report received from our Indian Agent at Birtle, Manitoba.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Departmental letter No; 106-1-15 of the 24th September, I beg to say that representatives of the Claydon Co; L'td of Winnipeg, Contractors for the Birtle Indian Residential School building, were at the school during the past few days, and have re-cemented the treads of the steel stairs; repaired the steps at the main entrance, and the front entrance to the Principal's residence; torn down, and re-built the concrete post supporting the steps to the rear entrance to the residence. The rear entrance doors have also been re-fitted as well as one of the fire escape doors, and the stiles of three inside doors, which were split, have been repaired. Several of the concrete sills of the basement windows were also repaired.\n\nWith regard to the drain in the floor of the boiler room, mentioned in my letter to the Department, of the 16th September, I beg to say that the Claydon Co; advised me in a letter, that they were not responsible for the condition of this drain, as it was put in, in accordance with special instructions from the Inspector of Construction.\n\nMr Mitchell, one of the firm of Claydon Co; who was here this week, stated that there was but one remedy for this difficulty, and that is, to put in a new drain, in the boiler room floor after blocking up the present one with concrete, run a drain pipe from this, to a concrete pit 2'-6\" X 3'-0\" by 4'-0\" deep at the west wall in the floor, for the water to run into, and instal an electric pump to take the water from this pit into the drain in the floor.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nfloor in the laundry, below the machinery, from where the water would naturally run into the main drainage system. I have asked Mr Mitchell to figure this scheme out in detail on his return to Winnipeg, and to submit it, with clear explanations direct to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nAt the present time, there is constant seepage from the ground outside, into the boiler room, through the present drain. The water all runs to the boilers which have settled at least three or four inches. This water has to be dipped out of the mouth of the drain with a tin can, and carried out in pailfuls. This has to be done two or three times every day.\n\nWater is also coming into the boiler room through the floor, at the north west corner. From what I am able to figure out, this is coming in from the sump which takes the excess chlorine water, when the pump is not running. This sump is at the north west corner of the building, outside the pump room, and I do not think it is adequate to carry away the water that runs into it, with the result that the water seeps back and comes into the boiler room through cracks in the floor. I am taking this matter up with Mr D.B.Gow of Winnipeg, under whose general supervision the water system was installed. Mr Rose, of Mr Gow's department was in direct supervision.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Hazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOct. 16, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston,\n\nIt has been reported to the Department that at the new Birtle School they are having difficulty in properly draining the boiler room. Water appears to be seeping into the building from some source.\n\nI would ask you to kindly telegraph Mr. Gow, who supervised the installation of the water supply system, to proceed to Birtle at once, and investigate and report on the cause of the seepage in the boiler room. It is necessary to take immediate action to remedy the condition as the water is causing settlement in the steel columns and the boilers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. T.

A.\nSir,\n\nWith regard to your telegram of the 13th instant, regarding water coming into the boiler room at the new Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the delay in my reply thereto, was on account of the fact that your telegram arrived at Birtle just after I had left by car with two Indian patients for Winnipeg hospital, on the morning of the 14th, and was awaiting me on my return to Birtle at 10 p.m. the 15th.\n\nI wired my reply on the morning of the 16th as follows:- \"Re your telegram of thirteenth. Water still coming into boiler room since repairs to pipe line. Recommend that Gow investigate soon as possible. My opinion that remedial measures should be taken at once to forestall more serious developments. Mailing further report to-day. Your telegram arrived while absent in Winnipeg.\"\n\nWhile I was in Winnipeg, I went to Mr Gow's office to discuss this matter with him, as I had already written him. I was informed however, that Mr Gow had gone to Birtle. On returning to Birtle, my wife informed me that Mr Gow had called at the agency. I went to the school the next morning and asked if Mr Gow had been there, but no one had seen him, and apparently he had not gone to the school. I then sent the above telegram to you, recommending that Mr Gow be requested to investigate as soon as possible.\n\nYou will no doubt, by now, have received Messrs Claydon Company's letter of the 10th October, in connection with their remedying of certain defects - at the school -\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\nat the school, a copy of which they sent to me. In their letter, the Claydon Company recommend the installation of a sump pit in the floor of the boiler room, with a drain, to the wall next the laundry, and an electric or water driven pump, to pump the water into the trench underneath the laundry machines, which connects with the main drainage system. I agreed with their Mr Mitchell that this scheme would adequately take care of the water from the boiler room floor, when blowing out the boilers and such like, as the present drain in the floor is of no use whatever. Mr Mitchell informed me that the installation of this sump pit and pump would be much cheaper than putting in a proper drain, with connections to the main drainage system.\n\nThe chief difficulty, however, is not water that gets on the floor from above the floor, as from the boilers, but what comes in from outside, through the foundation at the north west corner of the boiler room, through cracks in the floor itself, and through the drain in the floor. At present, over 100 pails of water are carried out every day, having to be dipped out of the drain with a tin can. Every morning, the ash pits under the boiler fires are full of water, and the engineer is compelled to wear rubber boots until the water is carried out.\n\nFrom this, I should judge that the ground under the boiler room floor is by this time thoroughly soaked with water. If this is so, there is danger of further settlement of the boilers and the two columns supporting the chapel floor above, which would develop into serious and costly trouble. I am practically certain that the source of the trouble is in the sump pit which takes the excess water from the chlorinator. This however, will no doubt be decided if Mr Gow comes.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Hazenby\nIndian Agent.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI have received your letter of the 16th instant with reference to the seepage of water into the basement of the new Indian school at Birtle, and in accordance with your request have telegraphed Mr. Gow to proceed to Birtle at once to investigate and report on the cause of the seepage in the boiler room.\n\nI will advise you as soon as a report is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Lazenby Esq;\nIndian Agent\nBirtle Indian School\nBirtle Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr Lazenby:\n\nIn connection with the seepage into the boiler room being experienced at the Birtle Indian School, I am in receipt of a telegram from our Ottawa office reading as follows:\n\n\"Indian Department request that you proceed to Birtle Indian School at once to investigate and report on cause of seepage in boiler room. Stop. Please take action accordingly.\"\n\nThe writer does not consider that any further investigation is necessary, personally, as it is apparent that the seepage is caused by the overflow from the sump into which the chlorinator drains. There will be, however, a certain amount of seepage into the boiler room from natural causes inasmuch as there is no drainage from the boiler room and under the circumstances none can be provided except by direct pumping.\n\nTo overcome seepage from the chlorinator sump, two proposals are now being considered. One proposal is that a drain be constructed from the overflow from the chlorinator around the building to connect up with the laundry drain outside the building and inasmuch as the laundry drain by passes the septic tank no ill effects would be caused the septic tank. Another proposal is that the chlorinator at present installed in the school be replaced by a chlorinating system using liquid chlorine thus doing away with the necessity of having any chlorinating substance whatever. This type of chlorinator would be about $500.00 cheaper than the present type installed but the maintenance charges would be somewhat higher, although the action is automatic as is the case with the present chlorinator.\n\nI have been unable to get in touch with Mr Lindsten of Wallace and Tiernan Limited, but hope tomorrow to take up with him the question of whether this different type of chlorinator will give satisfactory service at the Birtle School, and if so, it may be preferable to remove the present chlorinator, and install a different type. As soon as I have taken up this question with Mr Lindsten, I will prepare a short report outlining the two proposals and forward a copy to your Ottawa Office and also a copy to yourself.\n\nInsofar as the natural seepage of ground water into the boiler room is concerned, this is something that cannot now be overcome because the boiler room floor is only a few inches higher than the outlet to the laundry drain and it would be necessary to construct a new drain from the boiler room to the low ground near the outlet from the septic tank. However, this phase of the situation will also be covered in my report.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:\nD.B. Gow\nActing District Chief Engineer\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to recent correspondence and telegrams in connection with the seepage of water into the boiler room at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I have received this morning from Mr D.B.Gow of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau at Winnipeg concerning the matter.\n\nI may also say that two days ago, the Chlorinator was shut off entirely, with the result that the seepage of water into the boiler room from that source has now practically ceased.\n\nThere is still, however, a seepage coming in through the drain in the boiler room floor, but this phase of the matter, will be dealt with in the report and recommendations to be submitted to the Department by Messrs Claydon Co; L'td.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G.

Murphy,\n\nI have received a report from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Winnipeg with reference to the trouble being experienced from the ground water seepage into the boiler room at the Birtle School. When the Water Power Engineers laid out the water supply system for this building they provided a sump at the rear to take care of the drainage from the chlorinating plant. Most of the water entering the boiler room has been found to be coming from this sump.\n\nMr. Gow recommends that in order to provide adequate drainage and protect the boiler room floor and footings it is advisable to lay a new drain from the outlet pipe of the chlorinating system to collect the drainage from this system and also connect up with the drain pipe along the foundations of the boiler room and the catch basin under the boiler room floor.

Vert: 10 Feet to 1 Inch\nSir:\n\nAt the new Indian School at Birtle, trouble is being experienced from ground water seepage into the boiler room, causing considerable inconvenience and also causing settling of the floor and foundations. The natural ground seepage is augmented by overflow from the sump provided for caring for the drain from the chlorinator system.\n\nMy information is that the floor of the boiler room is at elevation 1690.00, the footings of that portion of the building are at elevation 1688.50 and that the drains laid to provide drainage, lead to a sump under the boiler room floor. No provision was made to discharge this drainage through the general drainage of the school system. As the boiler room is nearly four feet lower than the main school building, drainage cannot be obtained now through the school system except by pumping.\n\nTo provide adequate drainage and protect the boiler room floor and footings, it is considered advisable to lay a new drain from the outlet pipe of the chlorinator system to collect the drainage from this system and also connect up with the drain pipe along the foundations of the boiler room and also the catch basin under the boiler room floor. This drain will connect up with the main drain at the manhole below the septic tank. The drain will consist of four inch sewer pipe laid sufficiently below ground surface to prevent freezing and to a sufficient grade to provide against clogging.\n\nThe accompanying sketch plan shows the location of the proposed new drain and the accompanying profile shows the depth of drain below ground level, from its source to outlet.\n\nThe following estimate is made of the cost of laying this drain:\n\n| Description                  | Cost   |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Excavation and Backfilling   | $230.00|\n| 330 cu. yards @ $1.00        |        |\n| Laying pipe                  | 40.00  |\n| Cement & Sand                | 30.00  |\n| 4\" x 10' - 1\" Sewer Pipe @ .30\u00a2 | 125.00 |\n| 4\" x 1/4 Bends               | 4.00   |\n| 3 - Regulation Curves        | 3.00   |\n| 2 - 1/8 Curves               | 2.00   |\n| 3 - Assorted Y's             | 5.00   |\n| Freight and Hauling          | 35.00  |\n| **Total Cost:**              | **$572.00** |\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nI understand that the Claydon Company, Winnipeg, were asked to, and did, submit a proposition to provide drainage of the boiler room by means of an automatic pump that would pump the drainage from a catch basin into the school drainage system. I have no particulars regarding their proposals, but would like to point out that if the drainage from the chlorinator sump is seeping into the boiler room, it is altogether likely that this chlorinated water will have some erosive effect upon the piping of the school drainage system. It was for this reason that the waste from the chlorinator system was not passed into the main drainage system, although elevations were such that this could readily have been done. In my opinion the most satisfactory drainage system for the boiler room portion of the building is the proposal outlined above at an approximate cost of $672.00.\n\nIf it is decided to proceed with this work it will be necessary to have the drain staked out and grades determined so that proper and effective slopes are assured.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nNov. 13, 1931.\n\nMemo randum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy,\n\nI have received a report from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Winnipeg with reference to the trouble being experienced from the ground water seepage into the boiler room at the Birtle School. When the Water Power Engineers laid out the water supply system for this building they provided a sump at the rear to take care of the drainage from the chlorinating plant. Most of the water entering the boiler room has been found to be coming from this sump.\n\nMr. Gow recommends that in order to provide adequate drainage and protect the boiler room floor and footings it is advisable to lay a new drain from the outlet pipe of the chlorinating system to collect the drainage from this system and also connect up with the drain pipe along the foundations of the boiler room and the catch basin under the boiler room floor. This will be connected up with the main drain at the manhole below the septic tank. The drain will consist of four inch pipe and the estimated cost is $572.00.\n\nIf this drain is installed it will take care of all seepage at the rear of the building and no more trouble should be experienced with water in the boiler room.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nRe: Drainage at Birtle School.\n\nWith reference to the work now being carried out at the Birtle School in accordance with Dr. Scott's instructions, the following is an extract from a letter received from Mr. D. B. Dow, our District Chief Engineer in Winnipeg, under date November 27th.\n\n\"Following the receipt of Dr. Scott's telegrams of November 17th and 18th, I proceeded to Birtle with Mr. Rose and we made an examination of the situation at the Birtle Indian School that necessitated further drainage of the boiler room. We also took elevations, laid out the necessary work, made arrangements for the employment of labour and Mr. Rose is now at the site superintending the carrying out of the work.\n\nAt the time of our visit to the work, Mr. Matthews, Resident Architect for the Department of Public Works at Winnipeg, was also at the school carrying out an inspection under instructions of his Chief from Ottawa.\n\nOur examination and inspection showed that while the plans for the building provided for weeping tile to be placed at the edge of the footings under the boiler room, the contractor either did not place any weeping tile or else, if placed, they were located some four feet above the footings. At the time the foundations were poured, no resident inspector had been appointed so that there was but little supervision over this work. After discussing this phase of the matter with Mr. Matthews, we considered absolutely essential for the proper drainage of the boiler room that the weeping tile should be placed in their proper position at the top of the footing. This, of course, involves considerable extra excavation in addition to that outlined in my report of November 3rd. Rather severe winter conditions now prevailing add considerably to excavation costs, which factor, together with the additional work to be undertaken, will result in the total cost of the work exceeding considerably the estimate made in my report of November 3rd. I have asked Mr. Rose to advise me at as early a date as possible, the probable labour costs of the work. It is probable, however, that the extra labour costs will amount to about $200.00.\n\nThe expenses of this office in connection with this work include the travelling expenses of Mr. Rose and myself and also the travelling and living expenses of Mr. Rose during his sojourn at Birtle supervising the work in accordance with the Minister's wishes; and these expenditures will probably amount to $100.00.\"\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMr. Gow's original estimate for the cost of this project as set out in his letter of November 3rd, amounted to $572.00. He now reports that the extra labour costs will amount to about $200.00 with $100.00 additional for the expenses of supervision. This makes a total of $872.00. Mr. Gow reports that he has already received an advance of $300.00 to cover labour charges. To complete the work, however, it will be necessary for him to have about $570.00 additional, and I shall be obliged if you will arrange to have a cheque for that amount sent to this office to be forwarded to Mr. Gow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThe structure presents a good appearance both from close and distant points, and being not on a natural elevation there ought to be no difficulty about drainage or disposing of effluent from the plumbing system. The ground at the building is stated to consist of boulders with clay, very hard when dry. The site is somewhat less than one-half mile from the Canadian Pacific Railway Depot, and less than one mile from the village by road. A picture postcard of the building is submitted with this report.\n\nA catch basin is centrally located in the basement of main building, and the principal drain passes out in an Easterly direction and turns Southerly to connect to the septic tank which is constructed of concrete with two compartments, respectively connected with siphons. The discharge from septic tank spills over the slope of a ravine. Information is that the surface water caught up in the weeping tile system of the main building was carried by a separate drain placed in the same trench as the main sewer and after passing the septic tank it is connected to the main drain thencefrom before it is discharged over the ravine.\n\nSectional drawings in the plans for the building show weeping tile drains to be set at level of bottoms of footings both of the main building and of the boiler room section. No investigation was made to discover if these weeping tile drains had actually been placed according to plans, but information was received that those for the main building had been laid on top of the concrete footing courses, thus following an idea usually approved by Contractors, while it was suggested that weeping tile drains for the lower footings at boiler room had not been placed at all.\n\nThere is a small concrete catch basin about 12\" x 12\" x 24-0\" deep with iron top, in the floor space at front of the two steam heating boilers. It is stated that this catch basin was put in by the Contractors to provide occasional drainage for the boilers, and that its outlet pipe was carried in a Northerly direction underneath the footings to a dry well filled with stones not far from the building. On lifting the cover of this catch basin it was noted as filled with water right up to the top. It was bailed out to a depth of over one foot but filled up within fifteen minutes, thus indicating failure of the dry well idea as a means for carrying away waste water, also that the absorptive qualities of the soil are low.\n\nFor the heating system there are two steam boilers, and at the time of this inspection the floor line at same showed as about two feet lower than the floor line at exterior walls of boiler rooms. It appears as a matter for conjecture if this depression is...\nthe result of settlement or misjudgment in leveling for the concrete bed or foundation of the boilers. The Fall season this year has been dry, and there was no water on the floor of the boiler room at the time of this inspection, but the presence of a watermark up on the sides of the boilers was sufficient to form the idea that such an obstruction in drainage, rainwater entering through roof of coal room, or a broken pipe, after the boilers were erected, the boiler room floor had been covered with water.\n\nWater for use in the School, is obtained by purchase from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, who get it by pumping from \"Bird Tail\" Creek, for the principal purpose of watering locomotives at the station. This water is alkaline and being liable to contamination at source, a chlorinating plant has been installed in the School to prepare the water for safe general use. In the operation of the chlorinating plant there is an amount of water used, and it was stated that such water is carried Westerly from the building into a dry well filled with stones. It is understood that arrangements have been made to construct a new drain at good depth for the boiler room section, and that it will be connected up to take the waste from the chlorinating plant. The water, after chlorination, is considered wholesome for drinking purposes, but its degree of alkalinity appears to be unaltered, and therefore it cannot be regarded as altogether satisfactory for cleaning, bathing and laundry purposes, required in this kind of School.\n\nWindows are mostly of box frame type. A few of them however, have casement frames, and it was stated that after the building was regarded as complete the Contractors came back to fasten some of these frames that through oversight had been left insecure as regards setting. One casement window frame in the chapel appears to have been missed in this job of fixing.\n\nStorm sash for the windows are fitted to the inside of same, in divided sections something like casements. This arrangement for storm sash is satisfactory in many respects, but it does not assure the degree of protection from wind that is afforded by storm sash applied externally. If fitted sash to run up and down in box frames, Contractors usually have to consider if the sash ought to be fitted close or open, because it is well known that through the lapse of six months or so the sash may swell or shrink. In this building, completed last March, the sash are now loose fitting; therefore, the wind-resisting qualities of windows are inferior, and for rectifying the situation it might be well to consider the fitting of the main sash with metal window strip.\n\nThe rear exterior door to the Principal's residence opens directly into the kitchen from outside, and this doorway is deficient because of the lack of a suitable screen.\nscreen door or enclosed porch to protect against the weather. A corresponding deflection was noted at the main front entrance doorway to the Principal's residence. Also an opening at the end of the main corridor of the building where it goes to the Principal's residence, is hardly satisfactory in its present condition without a door.\n\nThe steel joists in the floor construction above basement, are set at approximately 21\" centres. Floors are of concrete two inches thick, carried by \"Hyrib\" lath and having expansion rods embedded. A finishing coat of cement mixture has been applied throughout to the slabs, excepting the top rows that carry the several sections of roof construction. The ceilings are plaster on metal lath at line of bottoms of joists. It is understood that these steel joists were produced by the Truscon Steel Company of Canada Ltd.\n\nSpecifications called for all concrete to be composed of crushed stone, sand and Portland cement, and the use of gravel is distinctly disallowed. Information is that but a small proportion of the concrete was made with the use of crushed stone, and that most of the aggregate was made up with gravel obtained locally. Nearly all of the concrete floors show fine cracks, the presence of which admits of several explanations. There are fewer cracks in basement floor in comparison with the upper floors, and that may be owing to the basement concrete being laid on gravel bed provided, and therefore likely to have greater substance than the two-inch concrete slabs of the upper floors. For the protection of fireplaces concrete of two inches thickness called for in the type of floor construction adopted for this building, the contractor must of necessity exercise the utmost care in every part of the process. The use of gravel in such slabs could only be allowed on the understanding that it should be thoroughly screened and washed, also that the sand should be free from loam and that the water in the mix should be free of alkali if possible. In addition the workman handling the materials must fully realize his responsibility and arrange for the placing of concrete in the most skilful manner and see to it that the setting of poured slabs should be suitably retarded, also that the finish coatings be applied so as not to break the surface of the poured concrete. These details of procedure are well understood by good builders, but there are all too many cases in which the knowledge is unproductive of results. In some cases hardening preparations are used in the mix and in the finish coatings. There is no information if hardeners were used at this building.\n\nThe cracks in floors are irregular and not identifiable with any structural settlement, therefore I am of the opinion that they arise from lack of the exceptional care necessary in mixing and applying the concrete.\n\nAlthough......\nAlthough there are some cracks appearing as having depth the majority are fine, and may be altogether superficial. Some of the deep cracks are possibly at lines of separations dividing the areas in suitable portions for periods of pouring.\n\nThe cement floors in corridors are about one-quarter inch lower than the corresponding floors of rooms along same and the edges of these sinkings that show in doorways are irregular. It appears that the difference of levels between the corridor floors and the room floors, had been designed for placing linoleum or other floor covering in the corridors.\n\nIn parts of the building the cement floors are giving off dust and edges of larger cracks are breaking away. This process of wearing is likely to become progressive. Painting of floor surfaces with silicate solution is a simple method often productive of good results. There are also paints especially suitable for concrete floors and giving both body and colour when applied on concrete floors.\n\nThe plastering of ceilings and walls appears good and no indications of subsidences was noted as regards steel columns. In fact, were it not for the condition of the cement floors, left bare, and resonance to a marked degree, the principal of steel joist construction adopted for the building might be regarded as a considerable advance over ordinary construction.\n\nThe chief features observed in this inspection have relation to the drainage of the boiler room, and the condition of the cement floors. There are a few minor items that can be stated, namely:- One place at a door architrave where plaster has broken away; some of the base made of Portland cement does not show good workmanship; at several doors in rooms lined with enamelled brick the bricks over door heads have dropped slightly; exterior brickwork presents a good appearance, although there is considerable variation in the jointing; window sash are mostly loose fitting and draughty, which will result in considerable discomfort and loss of heat; the painting and wood finishing is a fairly good job.\n\nIn the absence of definite directions on any particular items to be covered by this inspection, I considered that Mr. Currie, the Principal of the School, could be relied on to draw attention to anything that he would regard as matter for my report. Nothing was mentioned to me about the plumbing installation or fittings, or the steam heating system, and therefore no reference was made to those branches of work, but it appeared that the heating of the Principal's residence, which is located at the far point and Westerly from the boiler room, might prove unsatisfactory in relation to the keeping up of suitable heating\n\nfor.......\nfor the remainder of the building, particularly in consideration of the condition of the windows and exterior doors.\n\nNo inspection was made of the roofs, which are flat, and it is likely that they are in very good condition, and have been laid according to specifications. The water from the roofs is taken down inside the building by conductor pipes connected to drains and carried away.\n\nThe grounds surrounding the School are in process of improvement. Groupings of shrubbery, trees, flower beds, etc., will undoubtedly make the place attractive after same have attained growth. It had been stated that the plans for these developments are being considered.\n\nThe foregoing report concerning the Indian School at Birtle, Man., and comprising five pages additional to this, is respectfully submitted by\n\n(Sgd.)

(RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nRe: Birtle School.\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 31st regarding the break in the pipe line supplying water to the Birtle Indian Residential School, the following report has been received from Mr. Gow regarding the repairs which have been made on your instructions:\n\n\"I have for acknowledgment your letter of December 31st referring to the break in the pipe line at the Birtle Indian School. Upon receipt of your telegram of December 24th, reading as follows:-\n\n'Indian Department advises pipe line Birtle Indian School badly broken. Stop. Please give this your immediate attention.'\n\nI telephoned Mr. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Birtle, and requested him to take whatever action was necessary to make immediate repairs, and later wrote him so that he would have the necessary authority to incur the expenditures that might be necessary. Mr. Lazenby, therefore, engaged some local unemployed labour; also Mr. Brown, the local steam fitter, and had the repairs completed as soon as possible. Being without funds to meet expenses of this nature, it was necessary for Mr. Lazenby to guarantee accounts for two or three of these men at the local stores, covering food and etc., and Mr. Lazenby requested that I wire his department at Ottawa to wire him One Hundred Dollars to cover the expenses incurred in carrying out the necessary repair work. I accordingly wired Mr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, as follows:\n\n'Please wire Lazenby One Hundred Dollars to cover repairs pipe line Birtle Indian School'.\n\nInasmuch as the work has been carried out and the labourers are awaiting their pay, I would request that the Department of Indian Affairs be asked to forward the money requested to Mr. Lazenby immediately.\"\n\nWith reference to your request that we instruct Mr. Gow by wire that he should call upon Mr. Stead to make the necessary repairs, Mr. Gow reports as follows:\n\n\"In conversation with Mr. Lazenby, over long distance telephone, I understand that an examination of that portion of the pipe line uncovered, in connection\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nwith the repair work, revealed rather faulty pipe connections, but I would like to point out that Mr. Stead was requested to carry out the water supply installation on a provincial basis, and that the Department of Indian Affairs, had an inspector on the job, whose duty it was to see that the work was carried out in a satisfactory manner. The inspector reported that the main supply pipe line was thoroughly tested with air pressure and no leakage occurred. I further understand that the two breaks that have occurred, and to which Dr. Scott refers, were at bends in the pipe lines in the immediate vicinity of the underground supply tank adjacent to the school building. These connections were not covered up until late in December, at time when the ground was frozen and the back-filling was made with frozen material, and consequently there has been considerable settling of the ground overlying the trenches at these points, especially where there has been heavy teaming at this point during the fall. Under the circumstances I cannot see that Mr. H. S. Stead can be held responsible for the failure of the pipe line at the two points where failures have been experienced, and under the circumstances I do not care to have the responsibility of calling upon Mr. Stead to reimburse the Department of Indian Affairs for the outlay necessary in effecting repairs. Laying of pipe line under severe winter conditions, such as were experienced at Birtle at that time, is very uncertain, and often leads to trouble afterwards, so that the two breaks that have occurred cannot be considered as anything extraordinary.\"\n\nI shall be glad to have your further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Mr. D. B. Gow of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau at Winnipeg, was instructed to attend to the matter. On the 24th Mr. Gow telephoned to me, and asked me to supervise the repair of the break. I therefore hired the necessary labour to dig out the pipe line, and in due time, found that the pipe that screws into the main supply tank had broken. This pipe was only screwed in, and holding with two threads. The pipes carrying the water from the C.P.R. tank were also holding by two or three threads in the couplings, and were re-screwed in a further two to three turns. If this is a sample of the work done in the whole of the pipe line, there is no doubt that further trouble may be expected in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. G.

This is in error, partly due to a misunderstanding of terms used by Mr. Mitchell.\n\nThe writer went to Birtle at the official opening of the school, and found that the pipes referred to should have been called the waste from the chlorinator which is run to the West side of the building, and this we believe accounts for some of the moisture trouble.\n\nWe have not heard what has been done about a drain, but if it is still desired to put one in, we should be very glad to receive your order for it, and attend to the work as economically as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nEC-L\nJanuary 22nd, 1932.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

I am hoping that the drain is going to be satisfactory, but have not yet had a report on its working.\n\nSome fire-place accessories, a basket and screen, are needed for the time when the furnace goes out; also the kitchen has no storm door, and they are finding it rather cold. Will the Department furnish a storm door?\n\nWill you kindly let me know about the above at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nM. C.

This same system has been used by the City of Brandon Fire Brigade for the past ten years.\n\nThese machines are completely manufactured in Brandon Manitoba, and are guaranteed to give 100% satisfaction or money refunded. As you will see by the enclosed cut they are extremely simple to operate and in case of fire just sufficient liquid to extinguish the blaze is used, and operator can then close off both valves, and any remaining liquid and gas is still in perfect condition, as the Gas and Fire Death Liquid are both Non-Injurious and Non deteriorating.\n\nThese machines throw a stream of from 35 to 40 feet, and can be used with equal efficiency either inside or outside of buildings, in calm or windy weather; although they throw such a powerful stream, it can be instantly controlled or closed off completely by closing both valves.\n\nThis point alone is invaluable under actual fire conditions, as it enables the operator to jump from one part of a burning building to another without wasting any fluid, in the event of the wind catching up burning straw, or other articles and starting a fresh blaze.\n\nWhen we install machines, we fully instruct all staffs in institutions of any kind, on how to operate, also refill them. We also inspect all equipment once a year to make sure they are always in perfect condition in case of Fire. This is part of our guarantee to serve machines at all times free of charge. Complete extra refills for each machine can be installed at the same time as machines, or can be had at any other time; altho we usually advise having some extra at the outset, to avoid any losses or delay in case of emergency. ...\n\nWe will await your reply with very great interest and trust you will award us the privilege of equipping your New School with our \"Made in Manitoba\" Equipment.\n\nAssuring you at all times of just class service, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFIRE-DEATH, FIRE EXTINGUISHER CO:\n\nSigned:- S.A. Baker  \nGeneral Manager\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Mr R.Gurney Orr's letter No: 121-5-15 of the 20th November 1931, I beg to say that I procured from the C.C.Snowdon Company of Calgary, who, I understand, are the agents for the Shell Oil Company, a small supply of their \"Sanispray\" Oil and loaned from them one of their special brass sprayers for applying the Sanispray.\n\nTo test this Sanispray, I have had the boys' recreation room floor at the Birtle Indian Residential School at Birtle treated with it twice. This floor is about 900 square feet in area, and requires one gallon of Sanispray for one treatment, which lasts about two weeks, when another treatment is necessary to properly keep down the dust.\n\nThe cost of the Sanispray Oil, is $1.00 per gallon F.O.B.Birtle station, purchased by the 15 gallon drum. The cost may be less than this, of course if a large quantity were purchased. At the above cost, however, it will be seen that to keep the recreation floor properly treated, would mean an expense of 50\u00a2 per week.\n\nConsideration should be given however, to the fact that the recreation floors get the hardest wear of all the floors of the building. One treatment of the dormitory -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\ndormitory floors, for instance, may be sufficient to last for a month or more, and on staff bedroom floors for a much longer period. The floors in the Principal's residence for instance, might require no more than two treatments for a year.\n\nThe Principal, Mr Currie thinks that painting the floors would be more economical in the long run, though the initial cost would of course, be higher. I have no data as to what it would cost to properly paint the floors, or as to how long the painting would last.\n\nWill you please advise me if all the floors of the school are to be oiled with Sanispray, as I have more on hand then sufficient for making the required test, and the unused balance, with the borrowed sprayer can be returned if not required. If this oil is to be used, it would be necessary to purchase the sprayer.\n\nThe Principal of the Muscowequan School advises me that they have had very satisfactory results from the use of Sanispray on the floors of that school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nMarch 31, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter with reference to the oiling of the concrete floors in the Birtle School I would ask you to kindly arrange to have all of the concrete floors treated with Sanispray. You may also arrange for the purchase of the necessary supplies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSECRETARY.\n\nP. G.

At the time, no provision had been made in last year's estimates for the barns and other outbuildings for the School. This winter the stock have been kept for the most part in straw shelters, and came through better than usual as the winter was not a superlatively cold one.\n\nWe were assured that in this year's estimates provision would be made to complete these buildings. So many people are coming to see our School, and we are constantly telling them that the completion of the other buildings is following this year. In the pressure of so many items coming before your notice, I am writing this letter to remind the department and yourself, Sir, of the need for these buildings, that they may be placed in the supplementary estimate to be brought to the House.\n\nHoping for your fullest consideration of these most necessary buildings.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Mary C.

The driving of large spikes and nails would naturally cause some damage to the building, which would be regretable as the building is well built and finished in the same way as a residence.\n\nMr Currie would like the Department to grant him the sum of $250.00 with which he would construct two portable granaries, which he would make do, until such time as the Department could build proper granary facilities.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Failing such grant, the only other alternatives he has, are the use of the class room building, or selling his grain when it is threshed direct from the machine, and buying again as required in which case he would doubtless lose money owing to the fluctuations of grain prices.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend that Mr Currie be authorized to build the two portable granaries at a cost not to exceed $250.00, as suggested, and should be glad if the Department would advise me by wire of its decision in the matter, as threshing on the school farm will be commencing about the 31st August.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Approval is granted for the construction of two portable granaries, and, in this connection, I have to confirm the following night telegram of today's date:\n\n\"Department will approve expenditure of One Hundred and Seventy-five Dollars for materials, erecting two portable granaries, Birtle School.

Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 30th, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nI am quoting hereunder from a letter received by the Minister with regard to the claim of the Claydon Company, Limited, in connection with their contract for the erection of the Indian School at Birtle:\n\n\"In 1930 we built under contract for the Dominion Government an Indian School at Birtle, Manitoba, and in connection with the cleaning up of the account, we feel we have been very unjustly dealt with, and underpaid for some of the work done.\n\nWhen the tenders were called for, there was no special place on the general site upon which we could be sure the building would be situated, consequently we could not make an accurate forecast of what the excavation would be like. We, therefore, figured the ordinary excavation, which we can generally take out with teams in the country at about twenty-five cents per yard.\n\nAfter the contract was awarded to us, the definite position of the building was given us, and it was then found that we were excavating on rock and boulders firmly embedded in clay. We began using picks, shovels, and teams, but nothing we could do in this regard made any effect on the work, as it proved impossible to take the excavation cut by any such measures. We were finally driven to ship a forty ton dragline to the site at a cost altogether of unloading and loading of freight of over Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00). We charged an amount of $787.56 to the Government, which in the final payment was stricken out.\"\nand no explanation given us. The final amount was not paid until last Summer, and until we addressed an inquiry to the Department, we were unaware as to what they had taken from our bill.\n\nAnother short payment, as we regard it, was in respect to fireplace in the principal's residence. There was no mention of this in the specification, and excepting for one unexplained portion of the drawing, no indication whatever that a fireplace and mantle was required. Furthermore, electrical and other more or less sham fireplaces are so much used at the present time that we did not feel we were justified in allowing for a regular fireplace.\n\nAlthough the Inspector on the work was a man who was definitely and admittedly antagonistic to us, the facts were so much in our favour that he was forced to agree with us that if a fireplace and mantle were required, they should be put in at an extra cost, and gave us orders accordingly.\n\nIn addition to the work we did ourselves, such as supplying face and hearth brick, we ordered and paid for a special mantle. Our total bill for the work came to $102.21, and we still feel it ought to be paid.*\n\nThe Minister would like a report covering fully the various points mentioned in the correspondence.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\n\n*Indian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\nSept. 25, 1932.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Baskard,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 30th ultimo with regard to the claim of the Clayton Co., Ltd., in connection with their contract for the erection of the Indian School at Birtle, I beg to say that when tenders were being invited for this building the general site of the school had been agreed upon, and it was to be erected on the property immediately North of the existing school buildings, and the contractor was advised in the specifications that for further information he should apply to the Reverend Principal. The specifications also provided that before the firm submitted a tender they should visit the site of the proposed work and ascertain for themselves the nature of the soil to be excavated, the amount of excavation required and fully inform themselves as to all existing conditions. The specifications also further stated that when the contract was entered into that it was on the distinct understanding that he had investigated and satisfied himself as to all existing conditions.\n\nI may say that the exact location of the school was not determined until the building was laid out on the property, but a difference of a hundred feet or so on the site would have made no difference in the nature of the soil to be excavated. When the barn was erected approximately 250 or 300 feet from the school the nature of the excavation was the same as for the main school building, and there appears to be no just reason why the Clayton Co. should be paid an extra for this work.\n\nWith reference to the fireplace the plans distinctly show that an open fireplace was required in the Principal's residence and there is no reason to suppose that same would be an electrical or more or less sham fireplace. The basement plans show the ash pit required for the fireplace, and the necessary chimney with flue is also indicated on the plans. This extra asked by the Clayton Co. was therefore not allowed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that Mr Doig is the contractor who built the two barns at the School.\n\nWith reference to the final paragraph of the above mentioned Departmental letter, I beg to say that one of the small cottages has been sold to the local golf club for $15.00, the price agreed upon by the Principal and myself. As yet none of this money has been used in any way, but will be used for the purpose of improving the grounds in front of the school in due time; most likely as soon as harvest and threshing is over.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nSeptember 10, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nBuilding material, principally lumber, is required in the construction of two portable granaries at the Birtle Indian Residential School, at a cost of $175.00. Funds for the purpose are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe local Indian Agent, Mr. F. G. Lazenby, who was directed to purchase the materials, states there is no lumber firm in Birtle, on the list to receive consideration, and that it will be necessary to haul the material twelve miles from Foxwarren. He requests that the firm of H. M. Doig, in Birtle, be included on the list for consideration in the purchase of building materials for the Agency and Indian School. Mr. Doig is the contractor who built the two barns at the Birtle School a year ago.\n\nI should be pleased to be advised regarding the firm from which the purchase of the building materials should be made. Birtle is in the federal district of Marquette.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 15, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Schofield, representing the Apostolic Church in Canada, called on me today, with a request that he be permitted to rent the Class-room building at the old Indian Residential School site, for the winter months, at a rental of $10.00 per month.\n\nMr Schofield proposes to live in the building with his wife and one child, and hold religious meetings in the building also.\n\nIf Mr Schofield is permitted to rent the building for the winter, he wishes to have the privilege, after the winter is over, of renting it for a further term if he so desires.\n\nAs the school property is in charge of the Presbyterian Church, I cannot recommend that Mr Schofield's request be granted, and Mr Currie, the Principal of the school also objects, and states that the Church has been in communication with the Department for some time, in an endeavour to obtain the Department's permission to use the building for school purposes.\n\nKindly advise me of the Department's decision as to Mr Schofield's request, so that I can advise him.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nOttawa, September 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the request which you received for the rental of the classroom building at the old Birtle Indian Residential School site.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is not prepared to consider the rental of this building, and you may inform the parties who wished to rent same accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I beg to quote from Mr. Agent Lazenby's letter of the 5th September as follows:\n\n\"In this connection I beg to say that there is no lumber firm in Birtle mentioned in the list to receive consideration. It will be necessary to haul this material 12 miles from Foxwarren .......\"\n\nI gather from this that the material was hauled by the school authorities as they have the necessary equipment and were expected to do all the work, the Department supplying the material.

This debit can be accounted for as follows.\n\nOn December 16, 1930 certain materials were ordered by the undersigned from Crane Limited to be shipped, freight prepaid, to David Henderson, Birtle Indian School, in connection with the water supply installation. Invoices for these goods were received and certified to and forwarded to you for payment in December, 1930 through our Ottawa Office. No receipted freight bill was ever received from Crane Limited nor did we receive any debit charge on this account; although we had received the carrier three way Bill along with the shipper's memorandum of shipment and this Way Bill gave the weights of the packets forwarded.\n\nUnder date of February 10, 1931, I wrote you enclosing a statement of purchases made from Crane Limited in connection with the Birtle Indian School as well as a statement of your cash payment shown on the ledger of Crane Limited. It was then shown that at that time Crane Limited owed the Department of Indian Affairs $73.34 and doubtless they forwarded you a Credit Note later closing out their account. Yet you will observe that the Memorandum of Debit, which I now am forwarding you, is dated December 30, 1930.\n\nNo purchases were made from Crane Limited during 1931 nor since, yet on October 29, 1931 or eight months after your account was balanced and closed out, they evidently discovered this unpaid freight bill of $1.24 due on the shipment of December 16, 1930, and forwarded the invoices under date of December 30, 1930, which invoice I now enclose. Upon receipt of the invoice I checked up with Crane Limited the history of the $1.24 and upon learning of the origin of the same explained that all accounts had been settled and as they could not produce any receipted freight bill as was required by the Department of Indian Affairs, I considered it good policy on their part to forget about the item entirely or else wait until such time as the account was re-opened. Apparently Crane Limited have not approved of my\n\nA. E. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nsuggestion and are putting themselves to considerable trouble to collect this item, as I understand they have written direct to your department at Ottawa regarding the matter.\n\nUnder the circumstances I dare say it would be advisable to pay this account, inasmuch as the expenditure was incurred and is a legitimate charge against the Department of Indian Affairs. Crane Limited are alone responsible for the account not being paid at the time the invoice was paid.\n\nWill you please advise me whether it is your intention to pay this invoice directly from Ottawa or whether you wish me to pay the same from monies advanced to the undersigned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\nOttawa, September 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 16958-M of the 22nd instant, regarding an account from Crane Limited, Winnipeg, to the amount of $1.24 covering freight charges for material supplied for use at the Birtle Indian Residential School.

In December, 1930, certain supplies were ordered to be shipped, freight prepaid, for use in connection with the water supply installation at this school. An account for these goods was received in the Department, and cheque No. 6758, to the amount of $18.06, was sent you. No freight was charged, and no receipted freight bill was attached.\n\nIn official letter of February 25, 1931, you were written regarding a statement received from Mr. D. B. Gow, District Chief Engineer for the above Bureau, covering payments made you in connection with supplies furnished for the above school. At that time there was a credit in your books in favour of this Department to the amount of $73.34, which amount you refunded. No mention was made at that time of any balance due for freight charges.\n\nAs our appropriation for the period in question has lapsed, I regret that the Department will be unable to make payment of the above mentioned account now submitted. It is being returned, and the District Chief Engineer of the above Bureau is being informed in accordance with the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Lazenby Esqr.,\nIndian Agent\nBirtle\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe my account against the Indian School at Birtle for extra work done; I beg to state that I took the matter up with Mr Gow in Winnipeg, he says that you are the one to O.K. the bill as he has nothing further to do with it. I think that you were under the impression that the work I did at the school was contract but it was all day labour with 10% added, and I also worked under the instructions of the Clerk of Works, Mr Henderson.\n\nTrusting that you will O.K. my account for $113.15 as soon as possible, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned;\u2014 H.S. Stead.\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter I have received from Mr H.S. Stead of Neepawa Man, in connection with his account for $113.15 for extra work done at the Birtle Indian Residential School, on the water system in 1931.\n\nMr Stead had charge of the installing of the water system when the new school was being built, and after he and his men had completed the job, most of the pipe connections were leaking badly, with the result that he had to send two men back again to dismantle the pipes, particularly those connected to the filter, and do the work over again. The above mentioned account for $113.15 was sent in by Mr Stead to cover this extra work.\n\nOn January 6th 1932 I forwarded Mr Stead's account to the Department with a covering letter in which I stated that the details of the account were correct, but that I did not feel that the charge was justified, as Mr Stead was only making good his own defective work, and in this connection, I quoted the Department's letter to Mr D.B. Gow of the Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Branch at Winnipeg, No; 106-1-15 dated May 4th 1931. Mr Gow sent me a copy of the Department's letter to him, stating that Mr Stead had been instructed to do the work, and requesting me to superintend the job, and approve of his account when rendered and forward it to the Department for payment.\n\nAccording to Mr Stead's letter, he was not engaged.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\nengaged originally under a specific contract, but on a cost plus basis. Whether or not this should make any difference in the matter in question, I do not know, but in any case one would naturally expect the work to be properly done in the first place.\n\nI may also add that some time ago, I received a letter from the Crane Company, asking for settlement of Mr Stead's account for $113.15 as he had assigned the account to them. I replied to the Crane Company's letter advising them of the facts in the case, and stating why I had not recommended payment of the account.\n\nWill you please advise me as to whether or not the Department will agree to the payment of Mr Stead's account.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Legenby,\nIndian Agent.\nJan. 6, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th with reference to the account sent you by Mr. H. S.

White, of the Birtle Presbyterian Church, requesting permission to remove the classroom located on the site of the old Birtle Indian Residential School property and to reconstruct it for use as a place of worship.\n\nThis building was erected by the Department in 1924, to provide classroom facilities for the pupils at the old Birtle Residential School. The expenditure in this connection - which was paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year 1924-25 - was as follows:-\n\n| Item     | Amount   |\n|----------|----------|\n| Plans    | $ 65.75  |\n| Material | 3,416.97 |\n| Labour   | 1,245.06 |\n| **Total**| **$4,725.78** |\n\nI am writing the local Indian Agent, asking him to discuss the matter with the Principal of the Birtle School and let the Department have a report and recommendation. A copy of my letter is attached. In due course, I shall communicate with you again. I would suggest that, in the meantime, the Reverend Mr. White be informed that enquiry is being made regarding his request.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nP.G. Lazenby Esqr.,\nIndian Agent\nBirtle Man.,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th inst and note that the Secretary of the department is of the opinion that I should do the extra work of installing air bumpers on the pump lines as per my bill. I think that this is not fair to me as a pump is supposed to have a large enough air chambers on it, but in your case it did not work and the system hammered causing the joints to leak and did not find this out at the time we were at the school on account of the pressure system not being used at that time. After the school was finished Mr Gow wrote me and told me to go to Birtle and do what I thought necessary, and we put two air chambers on each side of the pump this extra work was no fault of mine and I can prove it by the Wholesale people.\n\nAnother thing I would like to mention to the Secretary is that I finished my work there on Jan 6th and got a letter from him on February 20th #106-145 stating that they could not pay me for some time as they got this money amounting to over $500.00 in April and it cost me in Bank interest $104.50 and I certainly think that if the Secretary does not want to pay my account he should pay this $104.50 interest that I had to pay. And also I had to pay my own car expenses on the School work from Neepawa to Birtle a distance of 180 miles and I had to take these trips four or five times on account of not having the fittings and this was not my fault as I had nothing to do with the material, if I had have been getting a commission on the material it would have been different.\n\nI will be glad if you will forward a copy of this letter to the Secretary of Indian Affairs, and oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:- H.S. Stead.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter to you of the 28th December 1932 in connection with the claim of Mr H.S.Stead of Neepawa Man; for $113.15 for extra work done on the water system at the new Birtle Residential School; and your reply thereto dated 5th January 1933, No; 106-1-5, I beg to say that on receipt of your letter, I wrote to Mr Stead advising him that the Department was of the opinion that he should make good his faulty work without any cost to the Department.\n\nI received yesterday, a further communication from Mr Stead in connection with the matter, a copy of which I am forwarding herewith at his request.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Basenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nDr. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome time ago, in a conversation which I had with the former Deputy Superintendent General, it was understood that the old building at Birtle, which is in a most dilapidated condition, was to be demolished. We fear it may become a sort of hang-out for undesirables and the building itself is in such condition that no use can be made of it. May I have permission to write to Mr. Currie to have it demolished as was the intention? Perhaps I have been at fault in not taking the verbal order and passing it on to Mr. Currie, but I was waiting for something definite in writing. The building to which I refer is the old main building owned by the Presbyterian Church, and which is of such a nature as not to be fit for use in any way. It was condemned long before the new building was made, and before your appointment to office, Sir, we had to close the school and send the children home on account of the conditions, both throughout the building itself, and in the basement. I would like to have this attended to before the spring work opens up.\n\nMay I also inquire as to whether orders have ever been given to have the former school rooms fitted up for residence use in connection with the school. It was thought wise to have them fitted up as quarters for the engineer or farmer, or any other of the help. I have also had a dream of a cottage, where perhaps ten or twelve boys and girls could be taken for a month at a time, and where they could live under such conditions as would be found in a normal home, learning to do small family washings, small family bakings, etc., and perhaps teaching them more of home life. I know the Department had been considering also this method of use of this building. May I ask if anything definite has been done.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nFebruary 4, 1933.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the removal of the old building on the former site of the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, while this building is now of no further use, it contains a quantity of good, solid dimension lumber, which could be utilized, and also that there is, on the outside of the classroom portion of this building, a good grade of drop siding. If this old building were to be dismantled, much of this material could be profitably sold. Further information is being obtained, and you will be informed when a decision is arrived at, regarding the action that will be taken to dismantle the building.\n\nRelative to the fitting up of the former classroom building, where a number of boys and girls could live under home conditions, I have to say that Mr. Currie, Principal of the Birtle School, and also the local Indian Agent have requested that one-half of this building be made into a residence for the school farming instructor. The Department is disposed to have this arrangement carried out. In any event, we would have no funds to have this building fitted up as a residence where boys and girls could be trained in home life.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D.

Moreover, it is very doubtful if one could sell it at the present time, for what it is really worth.\n\nPrincipal Currie's wish is, and has been for some time past, to convert one half of this building into a residence for the school farming instructor, which would mean the erection in the interior, of some partitions &c;, and Mr Currie stated this morning that if the Department would make a grant of $200.00 for this purpose, he would add sufficient to that to complete this work. By having the farming instructor live on the premises, a saving of at least $100.00 per year would be made, in wages, and the initial expense incurred in converting the building into a residence for this purpose would result in ultimate saving. The building itself would also be taken care of, if used as a residence for the farming instructor.\n\nHarold W McGill Esq;\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Probably the writer of the request for the new class room building could make use of this material, which would no doubt serve his purpose just as well, and the ultimate cost to him would no doubt be less.\n\nWith reference to Principal Currie's proposal to convert one half of the classroom building into a residence for the school farming instructor, I beg to say that at the present time, this member of the school staff has to live in town and consequently pay rent.

It is noted that the Principal and yourself are both of the opinion that this building should be put to use for school purposes, and that one-half be converted into a residence for the school farm instructor. The Department will be pleased to approve of this building being used as requested by the Principal.\n\nIt is noted that it will require an expenditure of approximately $200 to erect some partitions and fit up the building and that, if the farm instructor lives on the premises, a savings would be made in wages and the initial expense incurred in converting the building into a residence would result in an ultimate saving. We have no funds available to erect partitions, etc., and the school authorities should defray the necessary expense from their per capita allowance or other receipts. You should so inform the Reverend Principal. If the school authorities arrange to have the partition erected and part of the building fitted up, the Department will approve of it being used as living quarters for the farm instructor. You might inform the Department if the school authorities will fit up the building, defraying the cost, and if same will be used by the farm instructor.\n\nYou will be advised at a later date regarding the disposal of the old school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

On the above date at 10:00 A.M. a phone message was received at this detachment from P. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Birtle, to the effect that the Indian School at Birtle, which is now vacant, had been broken and entered and a quantity of bedding etc. gone therefrom. Mr. Lazenby stated he had been informed of this by H.B. Currie, the principal of the School.\n\n1-2-33.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. On this date at 5:00 A.M. I left this detachment and patrolled by C.P.H.Y. to Birtle, where at 9:00 A.M. I interviewed Mr. H.B. Currie with reference to this complaint, and he informed me as follows:-- The old Indian School was abandoned about 18 months ago, and some of the furniture was moved to the new school, and some was left in the old building. On each floor every door was locked and all windows fastened. As the new school is nearly a quarter of a mile from the old one, Mr. Currie very seldom had occasion to visit it, but almost every week the janitor of the new school went to the old building to get some small article which might be needed in the way of repairs for the heating plant etc. On many of these trips he would report to Mr. Currie that several windows were broken out of the vacant building, and then about 6 months ago he commenced reporting that some of the old articles were missing. Mr. Currie made inspections on several occasions and said that the building had been entered apparently through the broken window on the ground floor as the locks on the doors were always intact. He did not report this to the Police as had no information to give them as to who the guilty parties might be so the contents of the building continued to disappear.\n\nLast week, about January 24th, Mr. Currie had his man Mr. Ingram (janitor) make an estimate of the missing articles, and the following are the articles gone from the three dormitories:- 4 large mattresses, for double bed, badly worn; about 20 small mattresses, child's for single bed, all used and badly worn; about 22 patchwork quilts, all badly worn; 2 yard lengths and colours, some of these quilts were wrapped around large bundles of wool, and the wool was left in the building.\n\nOn January 30th, Mr. Currie again sent his man to the vacant school, and he came back and reported that the door on a building used as a store room was broken in, and the footprints of a man were seen around the door in the snow. Mr. Currie went to investigate, and on examining the interior of the building, missed a small square nickel clock about 7 x 4 x 6 inches, which played a tune when running, he stated that other articles might\n\nFile numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nbe missing from this building, as it contains various odds and ends such as bits of chain, stove pipes, water pipes, broken chairs, etc.\n\n3. Accompanied by Mr. Robert Ingram, I made a thorough examination of the vacant school, and the outbuildings, and to me it appeared as if things in the main building were very much out of order, nearly every window glass in the building was broken, some it appeared had been broken by stones at a distance, and others looked as if they had been broken at close range with something object. Several mattresses in the building had apparently been opened and the filling taken out, left on the floor, and the covering taken away, beds had been taken apart and were strewn about the floors, and a large quantity of wool was also thrown about the floor; this old piano stand was stripped up in some of the missing quilts, small kind organ was in the dining room, and this had the back boards taken in and some of the keys damaged. An examination of the storeroom referred to in this report showed that the panel door had been split in two by some heavy object, perhaps an axe, and things were also strewn about inside. A set of footprints were visible at the door outside, these were the footprints of a man, wearing about a size 7 shoe covered by a new rubber, other footprints were about the buildings but were very indistinct, and it would be impossible to ascertain whether they had been made by the culprit or by Mr. Ingram on some of his visits. Clear of the two footprints made by the new rubber, I could find no other clue which was of any value, so returned to Mr. Currie's office.\n\n4. I again interviewed Mr. Currie, and he stated that he thought that some of the quilts had been taken by some of the Indians from the Waywayseecappo Reserve at Rossburn, as many of them were in the habit of coming to Birtle weekly to see their children at the School, and he, Mr. Currie, had fitted out a room in the old school with old mattresses and quilts for their benefit on these visits, this room was locked however and only opened when necessary. Regarding the other missing articles Mr. Currie stated he had no idea as to who had taken it, but was sure that the Indians did not do so.\n\n5. I might mention at this point that the vacant school is sort of shut off from view from the new school, and could be looted in daytime without much danger of discovery, as there are no houses within sight of it, and it is about a mile from the main part of the town of Birtle, and the damage done to the windows according to Mr. Currie was in the vicinity of $100.00 as about 50 large panes of glass were broken, this of course could have been done by some of the Indian pupils at the new school, as they have a playground not far from the vacant building, and easily within stone throwing distance. The bedding which is missing Mr. Currie stated he could not put a price on, but was not of great value and was left there with a view of selling it.\n\n6. I asked Mr. Currie if he suspected anyone in the town of Birtle for taking these articles, and he said he had no reason to do so, but it appeared to him that it had not gone far out of the town.\n\n7. The janitor Mr. Ingram it appears to me is out of the question of suspicion, as he is a single man, and lives in quarters in the new school and appears to be a very reliable sort of a fellow.\n\n8. Failing to get any further information from either Mr. Currie or Mr. Ingram I proceeded to the office of the Indian Agent Mr. P. Lazenby in the town of Birtle, and interviewed him, but he unfortunately was unable to give me any\ninformation, but stated that he did not think that the Indians were responsible for taking this bedding, as they were in need of bedding all they had to do was come and see him, Mr. Isenby, and he would see that they were looked after.\n\n9. I interviewed Sam Tompkins, Town Constable of Birtle, and he was unable to give me much information, but stated that a half breed family named Vive who lived on the road allowance a short distance from town might have taken some of it, as they were in very poor circumstances, and no doubt would need bedding.\n\n10. Thinking that it might be well to see this Pat Vive, I engaged livery team and patrolled to his home, just a few miles from Birtle, but was not in possession of a Search Warrant to search his place and held him so, but he stated he could search it if he liked, there was no necessity however as he lives in a one-room shack and at a glance one could see that he could have no bedding concealed in it; neither had he any outbuildings. This man and his family are in very poor circumstances, and have very little bedding except old coats etc.\n\n11. I returned to Birtle and spent the entire day in making enquiries regarding the disappearance of the bedding, but could gather no information of any value.\n\n12. It appears to me as if the windows in the school have been broken by the pupils, and the fact that the windows were cut sort of invited some person or persons to enter the school and take the bedding, and one would imagine that it was taken by a number of persons, as a large amount of bedding such was taken would not be of any value to one party unless they intended to sell it.\n\n13. Failing to get any further information, I returned to this detachment by C.P.R., at 1-20 A.M., February 2nd, 1933.\n\n14. In view of the lack of information in this case I respectfully suggest that this file be considered closed.\n\n15. Expense statement submitted.\n\n(Sgd.) A.B.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lazenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 6th with reference to Mr H.S. Stead's account for $113.15 submitted to you in December 1931, covering repair work at the Birtle Indian School.\n\nI think that the correspondence referred to in the first paragraph of your letter will show that Mr Stead was instructed to proceed to Birtle and repair the leaky joints etc., and was given to understand that he was to submit an account to you covering such work. Inasmuch as the arrangement made with Mr Stead, when called upon to carry out the installation of the water supply system to the Birtle Indian School, was that he was to receive ten percent profit on the proven cost of the work, I do not see any justification for the Department of Indian Affairs withholding payment of Mr Stead's account, provided you are satisfied that the amount charged is reasonable and just.\n\nReferring to Mr Stead's letter to you under date of January 14th, I wish to take exception to his statement that the leaks that occurred were due to improper action of the pump. I may say that identical installations were made at the Indian Schools at Brandon, Kenora, and McIntosh and no trouble was experienced whatsoever in connection with the pipe connections, and in no case was it necessary to add the so-called air chambers to the pump. Furthermore, at the time final settlement was being made with Mr Stead covering the cost of the original work, it was explained to him by the writer that no investigation whatever would be given by the undersigned to the matter of interest charges levied against him by the bank. It was pointed out that such charges were the liability of the contractor in every instance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned;-\n\nD.B.Gow\nActing District Chief Engineer\n\nP.G. Lazenby Esq;\nIndian Agent\nBirtle Manitoba.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No; 106-105 of the 1st February, having further reference to the account of Mr H.S. Stead of Neepawa, for extra work done in connection with the water system at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nAs suggested in your letter, I wrote very fully to Mr Gow at Winnipeg, in the matter, and asked him for his recommendation, and enclose herewith a copy of his reply. For his information, I forwarded to Mr Gow, a copy of Mr Stead's last letter to me, written under date of the 14th January. A copy of this letter of Mr Stead's was also forwarded to the Department on the 20th January.\n\nIt will be seen from Mr Gow's letter, that he is of the opinion that there is no justification for the Department withholding payment of Mr Stead's account, as the original agreement was that he be paid on a cost plus 10% basis for his work. In this, however, I am at variance with Mr Gow. It may possibly be that technically, the Department may be liable for payment of the account, seeing that Mr Stead was not under a specific form of contract. It stands to reason, however, that if he had done the work properly in the first instance, the second account, for making good the defective work, would have been totally unnecessary.\n\nIt will be also seen from Mr Gow's letter, that he takes exception to Mr Stead's statement that the leaks he was called upon to repair, were caused by the fact that the pump did not have large enough air chambers on it. These leaks, in my opinion, were due to inefficient pipe-fitting in the first place, and this inefficiency was, to my mind conclusively.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nconclusively proven later on, when we were called upon to repair a break in the pipe line, and it was found that the pipes were only holding in the connections by two threads.\n\nThe Claydon Company, who of course were under a definite contract, had to send their men from Winnipeg to Birtle several times, to make good defects in the work for which they were responsible; and at no extra cost to the Department. Is Mr Stead, under an agreement to do certain work on a cost plus 10% basis, justified in charging the Department for extra work done in making good defects that would not have occurred if his work in the first instance had been properly done? My opinion is that he is not, and I therefore cannot feel justified in recommending that such account be paid.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.G.

Much of this material could be profitably sold.\n\nIf you approve, the local Indian Agent will be requested to furnish a recommendation regarding advertising the work of demolishing the building, the sale of the materials contained therein and the levelling of the site, under appropriate terms and conditions. It may be that the materials contained in the building would cover all costs in having this work performed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nBuilding should be advertised for sale, and the successful tenderer required to have all material, debris etc removed, and the ground levelled within a reasonable time from the date of purchase.\n\nJ.G.M.\n\nOld\n(Re/Birtle Indian Residential School)\nApr. 5/33\nRef: F/15A\n\nBirtle Manitoba,\n19th April 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that one of the water sections on the top of the Jacket Heater at the Birtle Residential School cracked a few days ago, causing a bad leak, due to corrosion which plugged up this particular section and stopping the flow of the water.\n\nThis is the heater that furnishes hot water to all the bath rooms and wash basins all over the school building.\n\nI took the matter up with the Claydon Company at Winnipeg, and they advise me that they can furnish a new section to replace the broken one, at approximately $33.00 F.O.B.

I may say that Principal Currie is prepared to pay the $100.00 in cash from the school's funds, and is anxious to make this deal.\n\nI beg to recommend that the Department approve of the above action being taken, and should be glad to be advised of the Department's decision in the matter as quickly as convenient, so that the owner of the tractor may not dispose of it to some other person.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

All materials in these cottages should be removed; any that is not of value should be destroyed and all rubbish moved from the site. It is to be understood that the $100 required in the purchase of the tractor, in excess of the material from the two old buildings, is to be paid by the school authorities from their per capita allowances or other receipts.

W. Magill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Indian School, Birtle. Your file 106-1-15.\n\nWhen our final account on contract for the above school was being paid, a deduction of $1,114.77 was made from it. $225.00 of this is in order, but the balance of $989.77., should, we believe, have been paid to us.\n\nThe above amount is made up of items No. 10 and 23, of our account of February 28th, 1931., copies of each being attached hereto.\n\nIt is possible a further explanation of our position may result in your deciding to pay the amount to us.\n\nIt has been previously stated why we made the charges. Item No. 10, $102.21, is for facings etc. only, for fireplace and hearth in superintendent's residence. They were not indicated on plan or mentioned in the specifications. We made no charge for the rough brickwork or flue, as these were implied by drawings, though not specified. A verbal order for the items charged was given to us by Mr. Henderson, the Inspector, who later wrote us under date of October 20th, 1930., telling us what to supply, and after giving our foreman his verbal order, wrote us on November 5th, asking for a price, but we had by that time ordered the material. We purchased, and paid for the material by special order.\n\nRegarding item No. 23, $787.56. This is an expense that could not possibly have been foreseen unless the exact location of the school was indicated to us before the contract was let. We did examine the site, and had the school been placed on 50 to 60 feet further North, no difficulty in excavating would have been encountered. As it was, we found boulders in hardpan, which next to rock, is the most difficult material to dig. All we charged...\nadditional was the bare freight on our machine, the cost of loading and unloading (which cost at least $150.00) being borne by ourselves.\n\nThe general details regarding this item are covered in our letter to Mr. Scott, dated March 20th, 1931. We also wrote to the Hon. T. C. Murphy who replied under date of April 13th, 1931. His concluding paragraph was, \"However I will be glad to consider the matter a little later on\".\n\nIf we are allowed the same latitude as is given on railway construction, a classification would be given. The railway classifications for dry excavation are as follows. 1, earth. 2, clay. 3, hardpan and boulders. 4, rock.\n\nThe extra work was confined to the main portion of the building, the rear annex, chapel etc., being clay formation only. The yardage in basement of main building is about 1260 yds., and for this small amount an additional allowance of say 70\u00a2 per yard is an extremely low differential.\n\nWe request that you take special note of the fact that after our tender for the building was mailed, we received a lower price on a few items, notably brick and tile. We immediately wired Mr. Scott a credit of $2094.00. This was deducted from our tender although, without counting the credit, it was the lowest received. What we are asking is a very moderate charge for the work done, and less than half the credit given as outlined above.\n\nWe were denied what is almost a general contractors right, to put in the water supply and sewage disposal systems, something the like of which we have never experienced, and while we can make every allowance for the circumstances which governed such procedure, it appears to us as an added reason why the adjustment we seek should be allowed us.\n\nWe believe it might be preferable to pay us by classification, and if you agree with this we suggest payment be made in accordance with statement enclosed herewith.\n\nEvery custom of the construction industry supports our claim, and we trust it may receive your favourable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nE.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lazenby, Esq., Indian Agent, Birtle, Man., dated 30th August, 1933, on File 106-1-1.\n\nThe damage to the flues is apparently just at the level at which the water rests when the boiler is in operation, and has evidently been caused by corrosion.\n\nMr. Dunn had taken one flue out, and replaced it with a new one. On examining the flue taken out, I found that it was extremely thin in the walls, just at the water level.\n\nMr. Principal Currie advised me that none of the boilers have been inspected by a boiler inspector since a year ago last spring. I therefore asked him to make arrangements to have them all inspected as soon as possible. It is compulsory that threshing engine boilers be inspected once a year, and these only operate for a short time each fall. The high pressure boiler at the school is in almost constant operation the whole year round, and in my opinion should, for safety's sake, have a proper inspection at least twice a year, particularly as the water used in it is chlorinated before reaching it.\n\nIn the boiler in question, there are 48 flues one of which is a new one, and before any use can be made of it, it will have to be practically re-flued throughout. What this would cost, I do not as yet know, though I am writing to the Vulcan Iron Works Ltd. of Winnipeg, the makers, to find out.\nRef: F/15\n\nBirtle Manitoba,\n8th September 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr J. Cruickshank of Birtle Man; has asked to be allowed to purchase the following water pipe from the old Birtle Indian Residential School, for which he will pay $6.00 and take the pipe out himself;\n\n- 30 Feet - \u00bd\" Water Pipe\n- 40 \" - \u00be\" \"\n- 25 \" - 1\u00bc\" \"\n- 40 \" - 4\" Cast Iron Soil Pipe.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department will approve of the purchase of the above by Mr Cruickshank at the price named.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Currie, Principal\n\nBirtle, Manitoba\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nWe had the honor of a visit today from Mr. Sutherland, our Superintendent of Indian Education. I discussed with him several matters affecting the Birtle Indian Residential School, one of which was the disposal of the old Residential School. Being very recently appointed to the position of Principal, I have been informed that the building was originally erected by the Presbyterian Church for Indian Mission Work, and that after the erection of the new building, the church transferred the old one to the Indian Department; that later the church offered to remove the building on condition that all material and fixtures become the property of the school to be used in the interests of the school and the advancement of Indian work.\n\nThat nothing was done with regard to this offer. I am further informed that a few months ago the Department advertised this building for sale by tender, and that no tenders were received. After discussing the matter today with Mr. Sutherland, I am prepared to renew the offer on behalf of the school to remove the old building for...\nBirtle, Manitoba\n\nThe material therein and the fixtures and doors are in sight\ncleaned to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nI may say that this building has greatly deteriorated;\nwindows are broken, doors forced, material removed,\nsuch as wash basins, toilets, and more than one hundred\njoint cupboard doors. On two occasions the Canadian\nMounted Police have, at the request of the Indian Agent,\nendeavored to apprehend the culprit, but without success.\nThis goes to show that the sooner the building is disposed\nof the better.\n\nOur summer work being fairly well advanced, we would\nappreciate an early decision so that this work might be\ncommenced while the weather is good. Your request is\ngranted; we will engage a competent supervisor so that\nthere shall be no waste in the removal, and we will take\nsuch steps as will adequately protect the property\nin accordance with the requirements of the Workmen's\nCompensation Board.\n\nAfter hearing before Mr. Laidlaw what was offered\nto him in this matter, he said he was prepared to support\nthe favorable consideration of your offer.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nG. H. Lockhart\nSept. 18, 1935.\n\nMemorandum\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nWith further reference to the main building of the old Birtle Indian Residential School, I am attaching hereto for your information a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Reverend Principal. Will you please advise me if you approve of his request.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nFurther to my letter of the 30th August having reference to the Birtle Residential School, I beg to say that I wrote to Messrs Claydon Co; of Winnipeg, the Contractors who built the school, and put before them the particulars regarding the high pressure boiler, and asked them to find out the cost of re-fluing this boiler, and I have to-day received their reply.\n\nThey quote a price of $49.50 F.O.B. Birtle for the necessary flues for this boiler, and an extra $30.00 if a man is sent up from Winnipeg to put them in. This, however, I do not think is necessary, as the local blacksmith, Mr H.Greeves, is fully qualified to do this work, and his charge would be .75\u00a2 per hour, and he could complete the job in less than two days, or probably in one day, with the assistance of the engineer at the school.\n\nWill you please advise me if this work may be proceeded with, as the laundry work is under a considerable handicap without the use of this boiler.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.Wazenby,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nSir,\n\nIn reply to Mr R.G.Orr's letter of the 8th instant, regarding the claim being made upon the Department by Messrs Claydon, the Contractors who built the Birtle Residential School, on account of the heavy boulders encountered in the excavation, I beg to say that the exact site of the building was pointed out, both by Mr Currie and myself, to Mr Mitchell, who was the Contractors' representative in charge of the erection of the building, before any work was commenced.\n\nOn the 7th June 1930, Mr Currie and I chose the site on which the building now stands. On the 16th July 1930, Mr Swan and Mr Gow arrived at Birtle and approved of the site chosen, Mr Mitchell being present at that time. On the 17th July, I went to the site to see Mr Mitchell regarding the clearing of the brush from the site, and found that Mr Swan had already instructed Mr Mitchell in the matter. Mr Mitchell hired teams and scrapers to do the excavation at first but found that owing to the stones, the work could not be done by this method, and on the 28th July, the dragline had been sent for and was on the job.\n\nThe above particulars, with dates, are taken from my official diary.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.Lazenby,\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs.

I figure the time necessary or that I would require without too much labor cost being involved, would be about nine months, as our winter months here, as you probably know are exceedingly cold.\n\nI have read the specifications of your offer for tender which expired in May, and I understand from them that you are under the impression that\nconsiderable \"fixtures and fittings\" are in the building. I examined the building and regret to say that almost everything fittable has been taken out, there being only about a dozen wash-bowls, flush-toilets and bath-tubs left that could be realized on. The glass is almost all broken, the cupboards and doors are gone or broken, and part of the shelving is taken out. No electric wiring or fixtures at all are left. So you see that one must depend entirely on the lumber to be salvaged to recoup oneself for the labor-cost, which will be considerable.\n\nI am willing to carry out the levelling of the building in accordance with your specifications for the \"offer for tender,\" already mentioned.\n\nI would also say that to make the removal of the curbing stone and plaster, of which there will be a great deal, within\na reasonable cost to myself, that it would be as well to place such stone and plaster in a deep gully, which lies about 200 yds. north of the old school and south of the new one, the material to be placed in a manner to form a road over the gully, which would give the workmen from the department's school with their machinery, access to the fields to the south, without leaving the school property and would be much more convenient.\n\nIf you are at all interested in this offer, kindly communicate with your agent there and we can then make a definite agreement.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMartin A.

Lasenby\nIndian Agent.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith my report regarding my inspection today, of the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Rev. and Mrs. E.H. Lockhart came to the school on the 1st September last, to take charge as Principal and Matron, on the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. H.B. Currie. Mr. and Mrs. Currie however, remained at the school until the 12th October, to assist the new Principal and Matron in getting into the work.\n\nThere are seven new pupils in residence at the school, whose admission has not as yet been approved by the Department. Two of these were brought in on the 14th October, and the other five were brought in by the Principal in September. The latter five applications are being forwarded to the Department today, and the other two will be forwarded as soon as the candidates have been medically examined, which will be within a day or two.\n\nThe fire escapes and fire protection at the school are adequate, but the late Principal insisted on keeping the doors to the fire escapes locked, even though alarm bells had been fitted to these doors at the Department's expense, to give warning if they were opened by any of the pupils intending to escape from the building. Mr. Lockhart, however, the new Principal advised me that he intended to keep these doors unlocked. No fire drill had been held for some time, but Mr. Lockhart promised that he would have a fire drill held this week, and at fairly frequent intervals in the future.\n\nThe Chlorinator in the water system is not yet in operation. About the end of September, I advised that the company who installed the Chlorinator should be communicated with at once, and asked to send someone to the school to set it in operation, and instruct the engineer in the details of its operation. I was informed that this had been done, and that a man was to be at the school on the 6th October for this purpose. To date, however, no one has turned up. I therefore asked the Principal today to write again to the company, and take steps to get this Chlorinator into operation with the least possible delay, which he promised to do.\n\nThe two drinking fountains, one of which stands\u2014\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nstands at each of the play room doors, are both out of commission. The plungers have both been either taken, or broken off. I would recommend that these be repaired and put in working order again.\n\nThe vertical high pressure boiler is in course of being repaired, having new flues installed in it, and will be again in operation shortly. The two large heating system boilers have been inspected by a Provincial boiler inspector and are both in good order and ready for the winter's operation.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Benson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 21, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, reporting on your inspection of the Birtle Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that Rev. E. H. Lockhart has now assumed full charge of the work as principal. It is hoped that he will meet with every success, and I would request that you give him any assistance you can.\n\nRegarding the fire escapes and fire protection, it is noted that the new Principal will keep the doors leading to the fire escapes unlocked. In view of the fact that alarm bells have been fitted to these doors\u2014which should give ample warning after opening\u2014the Department is pleased that the Principal will conform with requirements in keeping the doors unlocked. The Principal should hold regular fire drills in future, as it is of the utmost importance, in the event of fire, that the pupils and staff are thoroughly familiar with their duties and stations, in order that they can leave the building without loss of time.\n\nWith reference to the chlorinator, the Principal should take steps at the earliest possible date to have this chlorinator placed in operation. The engineer in charge should become thoroughly familiar with its operation and he should see that no damage is incurred in handling same.\n\nConcerning the two drinking fountains, you may arrange to have the plungers replaced and these fountains placed in good condition.\n\nIt is noted that the vertical high pressure boiler is being repaired.\n\nThe Department would request that you keep a close check-up on the work at the school, at least until the new Principal becomes familiar with his duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir:\n\nI would draw the Department's attention to the paragraph in Mr. Lazenby's report on the Birtle Residential School dated October 16th, in which he points out that the chlorinator is still not in operation.\n\nAt the time the demand was made that a chlorinator be installed, the need was pointed out as being very urgent and of an absolute necessity in the safe-guarding of the children's health. I am quite sure that the need is just as urgent today, and I think the Department should insist that it be placed in operation at once.\n\nOn September 19th, Rev. E.H. Lockhart wrote the Claydon Co. Ltd., Contractors, Winnipeg, stating that when they constructed the Birtle Indian Residential School, part of the equipment consisted of a chlorinator. The Principal goes on to say that this is now out of commission and no one at the school has the knowledge to put it into operation. It is quite clear by this letter that Mr. Lockhart admits that the engineer is not capable of being in charge of the machinery. The above letter was handed to Mr. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Bureau, and he replied giving the name of the manufacturers from whom the chlorinator was purchased and instructing Mr. Lockhart that any further communications in connection with the system should be addressed to the firm mentioned, namely - Wallace & Tiernan Limited, 301 Bank of Hamilton Chambers, Winnipeg. On October 16th, Mr. Gow received a further letter from the Rev. Mr. Lockhart, again requesting that a man be sent up to instruct his engineer and in this letter he pointed out that there were about 130 people in residence and the outbreak of an epidemic of sickness.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nof sickness would mean a very serious situation. He closes his letter by adding, \"Our newly appointed engineer is an apt student. I am sure he will pick it up quite readily.\" Mr. Gow replied to this letter on October 17th, advising Mr. Lockhart that he must address his communications direct to the firm who installed the chlorinator.\n\nI think Mr. Lockhart is quite aware that Wallace & Tierman Limited are not prepared to send a man to Birtle free of charge and is avoiding making a direct request that an instructor be sent to the school by the firm.\n\nI would like to be advised what instructions the Department issue in connection with this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, October 31, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 201-11 of the 28th instant, with reference to the chlorinator at the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is noted that this chlorinator is still not in operation.\n\nYou should inform the Principal definitely that he is to arrange with the firm who installed this machinery to give the school engineer the necessary instructions for operating same. The former Principal, in conjunction with Rev. Mr. Lockhart, who is now in charge of the school, dismissed a capable engineer; and no satisfactory reasons were supplied for the dismissal. It is expected that the school authorities will have a competent engineer in charge of the equipment. The Principal should take immediate steps to have the present engineer become familiar with the operation of the chlorinator, in order that no damage is incurred in handling same.\n\nIt is expected that the school authorities will pay the costs of the firm in sending a man to the school to instruct the engineer. In this connection I have to say that a communication of a similar nature to yours was received from Mr. Agent Lazenby, and he, also, was informed to instruct the Principal that he should take steps, at the earliest possible date, to have this chlorinator placed in operation and that the engineer in charge should become thoroughly familiar with its operation. The Agent was requested, further, to keep a close check on the work of the school until the new Principal becomes familiar with his duties. The Principal should understand that there must be no further delay in the satisfactory operation of the chlorinator, in the interests of the health of the pupils.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you, later, concerning what action the Principal has taken regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nBirtle Manitoba,\n4th November 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that yesterday, the Principal of the Birtle Residential School reported that the top section of the jacket heater, which heats the water for the building, had cracked, and was leaking badly. I advised him to have the engineer remove the section, and have it welded, as a temporary measure, which was done last night.\n\nOn replacing this section this morning, and turning on the water again preparatory to putting on the fire, other leaks were discovered in the main body of the heater, the water from which was running into the fire box.\n\nOn examination, it appears that the whole inside of the heater is badly corroded.\n\nA new section for this heater was purchased last April, on account of it being badly cracked, but the one that cracked yesterday was not the new one.\n\nThe engineer states that this heater is done, and that a new heater is required. This would appear to be the case when the extent of corrosion is considered.\n\nI would strongly recommend that some method of treating the water before it enters the system be adopted.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\nadopted, either by the installation of a water softening apparatus, or by the use of some compound. The boiler inspector who was at the school a week or two ago, recommended that a water softener be installed, as it would be cheaper in the long run, considering the amount of water used, than to use one or other of the softening compounds that are on the market.\n\nIt is quite evident, from the recent experiences with the vertical boiler, and the jacket heater, that something should be done to counteract the corrosion, which is no doubt reaching throughout the whole of the water and heating systems; and after only two years of operation.\n\nThe jacket heater now in use is the \"Daisy\", manufactured by Warden King Ltd of Montreal, and the number is 5-22-W, 1930. I may say also, that the engineer is of the opinion that this size of heater is too small for what it is called upon to do, especially on such days as bath days, when a large amount of hot water is demanded.\n\nWill you please advise me as soon as possible what the Department decides to do in the above matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No; 106-1-5 of the 27th September last, authorizing the repair of the vertical high pressure boiler at the Birtle Residential School, I beg to say that to do this work it was necessary to take the boiler off its base, and lay it horizontal, with the result that the insulation, or lagging, of asbestos cement around the boiler was spoiled, and it will require three sacks of new cement to re-insulate the boiler, at a cost of $13.50.\n\nWill the Department please authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer M.F.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n8th November 1933.\n\nRef: F/15A\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 201-11A of the 3rd instant, and in reply, to say that I went to the residential school, and was informed that a man from the firm who supplied the Chlorinator had been to the school on the 25th October, and had started the Chlorinator working again, and it was in operation when I saw it. The engineer informed me, however, that this man had not spent more than 25 minutes at the outside, at the school giving him instructions as to the operating of the Chlorinator. There are two cylinders of compressed Chlorine Gas at the school, one of which is attached to the Chlorinator, and is in use. No one about the place knows whether the other cylinder is full or empty.\n\nIt seems to me that 25 minutes instruction in the operation of the Chlorinator is hardly sufficient to give one a complete grasp of all the details, particularly when one had never seen one before. However, the engineer assures me that he fully understands it now, and that there is \"really nothing much to it\".\n\nWith regard to the filter plant, the engineer informed me that nothing had been done with this since he came to the school three months ago. It had not been washed out, by reversing the flow of water through it into the sewer, in that length of time, and possibly longer. Just what condition the filter will be in now I do not know. There are no printed instructions at the school, apparently, in connection with the - care -\n\nA. G. Hamilton Esq;\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg Manitoba.\ncare and operation of the filter plant, and I think that it would be a good plan to have Mr. Gow send these to the school, if such could be obtained, for the use of the engineer. After such a length of time without being washed out, it may be that the filter requires a new alum foam on the top, and the engineer does not know anything about doing this.\n\nUnder date of 30th August last, I forwarded a full report regarding the newly appointed engineer, Mr. Dunn, giving his qualifications &c., to the Department.\n\nOn the 8th September, the Secretary addressed a letter to Mrs. D.T.L. McKerroll, of the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church at Toronto, quoting at length from my report, and concluding with the following paragraph:\n\n\"From the above report, the Department considers that Mr. Dunn is not fully qualified for the position of engineer at the Birtle School, and it is desired that the services of a fully qualified engineer be secured to take charge of the equipment at this school, as the Department could not be responsible for any damage that may occur to the plant while an incompetent man is in charge.\"\n\nMr. Dunn, however, still remains as engineer at the school.\n\nI may say further, that on the 3rd November, The Principal telephoned me stating that the top section of the jacket heater, which heats the water for the bath rooms and wash rooms, had cracked and was leaking badly. I went to the school to see what the trouble was, and suggested that this section be taken off and the crack welded, which was done. Since then another crack has developed in the main body of the heater, inside the fire box. The heater was again dismantled and the crack was plugged, but without stopping the leak. To weld this - crack -\ncrack locally is impossible, as it is too big a job to handle with the facilities that are available here.\n\nLast April, the middle one of the three top sections of the jacket heater cracked, and a new one was put in at a cost of nearly $40.00.\n\nLast month the high pressure boiler was entirely re-flued, which will cost about $75.00.\n\nThere is a great deal of corrosion from the water, which I believe is responsible for this trouble, as the flues of the high pressure boiler were corroded through at the water level.\n\nOn the 4th November, I forwarded a report to the Department regarding these matters, and recommended that some action should be taken to counteract the corrosion. I informed the Department that the boiler inspector who was at the school recently, recommended the installation of a water softening plant, which would be cheaper in the long run, considering the amount of water used, than using one or other of the many compounds that are on the market.\n\nThis equipment has been in use just a little over two years as yet, and is already beginning to cost considerable money for repairs. There is no doubt too, that the effect of corrosion will be reaching out through the whole of the water and heating systems, to a greater or less extent, and unless something is done to counteract the corrosion, considerable trouble may develop sometime in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) P. G. Lazenby\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter of October 31st, No. 106-1-5, I wish to state that I have been advised both by the Principal of the Birtle Residential School and Mr. Lazenby, the Indian Agent, that the chlorinator is now in operation. I am enclosing copy of a report made by Mr. Lazenby which deals with various matters in connection with the school.\n\nI have secured from Mr. Gow, of the Water Power Branch, instructions in connection with the operation of the filter plant and have forwarded same to Mr. Lazenby.\n\nThe Department's attention is drawn to the last paragraph on Page 2 of the report, dealing with the trouble which is being experienced in connection with the jacket heater.\n\nI note the suggestion that a softening plant be installed. This may be necessary, but the C.P.R. use the same water and, I believe, consider it quite satisfactory for their purpose. Mr. Gow states that the water is not particularly hard, and he cannot understand why so much trouble should be experienced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 201-LLA of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. Agent Lazenby, regarding the chlorinator and the water supply at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the chlorinator, it is noted that the Engineer of the School received brief instructions concerning its operation from an official of the firm who supplied the equipment. The Engineer should become thoroughly familiar with the operation of the chlorinator, in order that no damage will occur. It should be kept in constant operation. The school authorities should understand that the Department will not be responsible for any damage to this equipment if operated by a man who is not thoroughly familiar with same. It is hoped, however, that the instructions received by the Engineer will be sufficient to enable him to operate it satisfactorily.\n\nRegarding the jacket heater, I have to say Mr. Agent Lazenby was informed, by wire, that, if not practical, to repair the jacket heater, he might arrange for the installation of a new one.\n\nConcerning the installing of a water softening plant, the Department has requested the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch here to have Mr. Gow, of their Winnipeg office, investigate and report, with a recommendation as to what is necessary to overcome the present difficulty, as the water supply system was designed and installed under his supervision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mr. Paterson, of Elphinstone, re the matter. He has written to me for information as to ownership of the building. I presume that very little money can be received from these materials, and that, therefore, if the materials might be of use to other Indians the objection would not be so great. May I ask your consideration of this matter. Some of the Presbytery members are interested in the subject as it was with Church funds that the old building was erected, and we gladly and freely turned the farm, buildings etc., over to the Government for one dollar.\n\nWe would be glad to have a reply from you in this regard.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nDecember 11, 1933.\n\nDear Mrs. McKerroll:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the disposal of some of the material from the old school building now in process of wrecking at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Principal, Rev.

B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nIn response to the request of the Department of Indian Affairs, as contained in your letter of November 15th, Mr. J. T. Rose of this office and the writer visited the Birtle Indian School and made inquiries as to the trouble being experienced with the high pressure boiler, domestic water heater and heating system. An examination was made of the pumping installation, the chlorinator and the water filter. A sample of the water as used in the school after chlorination and filtration was taken and has been analyzed by the Milton-Hersey Company Limited. This analysis has been our basis for determining the probable causes of the trouble experienced and also for determining the most effective and cheapest method of eliminating the trouble experienced.\n\nTROUBLES EXPERIENCED:\n\nOur inspection showed the pumps, chlorinator, filter and cold water system functioning very satisfactorily. The heating system is giving no trouble, only one unit being in operation, although the day of our visit was quite cold. The heating system has been and is functioning satisfactorily, ever since the boiler room was properly drained two years ago.\n\nHowever, it was laundry day at the school and the inconvenience resulting from the failure of the high pressure steam boiler and the hot water supply boiler was only too evident. It was explained to us that the tubing in the high pressure steam boiler had corroded very badly.\nparticularly above the water line in the boiler and that the tubing had to be replaced. Pieces of the removed tubing shown us were badly corroded. The hot water supply heater became useless because of the cracking of the lining and upper sections. One of these sections shown us appeared to be badly burned away, rather than corroded.\n\nCAUSES OF TROUBLE:\n\nTo determine the cause of the trouble in these two units of the hot water supply system, it is necessary to study the chemical analysis of the water. This analysis shows 35.15 grains of hardness per imperial gallon - this hardness being composed of Calcium Carbonate, Calcium Sulphate and Magnesium Carbonate. The presence of these incrusting solids causes this water to be classed as hard water and are undoubtedly the cause of the trouble experienced with the hot water supply boiler. These two carbonates in solution in the water are deposited when subjected to heat under pressure, forming scale which may or may not be hard on the sides of the boiler. The scale thus formed is usually a good non-conductor of heat and accordingly diminishes the efficiency of the heater. With the decrease of efficiency, forcing of the heat applied becomes common practice and the unit is soon burned out. The incrustation of solids such as Calcium Sulphate, which is present in this water, is extremely hard and becomes firmly attached to the lining and prevents the cooling action of the water from protecting the metal against burning. Furthermore, the hot water supply boiler installed at Birtle was not designed to\noperate under pressure exceeding twenty to twenty-five pounds - at least so I am informed by the contractor who installed the unit.\n\nIn view of the analysis shown of the water in use it is difficult to decide what has caused the rapid corrosion experienced with the high pressure steam boiler. The analysis does not reveal the presence of any solids which by themselves are corrosive. Since even the purest of waters are corrosive, it is but natural that corrosion occurs throughout the water supply system at Birtle. The probable cause of the rapid rate of corrosion in this high pressure steam boiler has been taken up with several people connected with steam boilers in Winnipeg and various explanations were given. It is possible that the ordinary corrosive action of the water becomes intensified in the high pressure steam boiler and again it may be that the non-corrosive incrusting solids in this water, under high pressure heating, react with the non-incrusting solids to form acids or other corrosive agencies.\n\n**ELIMINATION OF TROUBLE:**\n\nI understand a new hot water supply boiler is being installed at the school and that it is designed to operate under the pressure prevailing there. Such being the case, softening of the water supply sufficiently to remove the incrusting solids, should prevent a repetition of the trouble experienced up to date with the hot water supply boiler.\n\nHowever, the writer is not prepared to say that such a process will eliminate the trouble experienced with the high pressure steam boiler. If the rapid corrosion is\nentirely due to the reaction between the incrusting solids and other elements in the water under the process of being heated and converted into steam, then the removal of these incrusting solids should materially, if not entirely, eliminate corrosion. If these solids have little or no action in causing the rapid corrosion, then their removal would not materially lessen the corrosive action experienced.\n\nI would suggest that a water softening plant be installed in the school of sufficient capacity to provide a softened water supply for the following services in the Institution:\n\n(1) Steam heating system.\n(2) High pressure steam boiler system.\n(3) Hot Water Supply boiler system.\n(4) Limited supply of cold water to laundry and kitchen.\n\nThe advantages to the Department of Indian Affairs would be elimination of repairs to and a prolongation of the usefulness of the heating system and the hot water supply system and a probability of greatly decreased repair bills in connection with the high pressure steam boiler. The advantages to the operators of the school are obvious and the savings effected in clothing, use of soap etc., greatly offsets the cost of the operation of the water softener.\n\nPROPOSED INSTALLATION:\n\nThe quantity of water supplied daily to the water supply system of the Birtle School varies considerably. 7,700 gallons - the average daily supply for February, 1933 - being the maximum and 2,500 gallons - the average daily supply for July, 1933 - being the minimum recorded during the period September, 1932 to date. The average daily use for the year ending September 31st, 1933 was 5,700 gallons.\nIt is impossible to estimate offhand the average daily use of water in this school for purposes which it is most desirable that softened water be supplied. On general wash-day and laundry-day, the quantity of water used would be large. The new hot water supply boiler is only capable of heating 250 gallons of water 100\u00b0 Fah. in one hour. The school heating system uses a very small amount of water and the high pressure steam boiler is only operated occasionally and utilizes little water as compared with the hot water boiler. Accordingly, it is proposed to install a water softener that will provide 500 gallons of water with zero hardness per hour with 2,500 to 3,000 gallons capacity between regenerations. While it is expected that the school authorities will limit the average daily use of softened water to less than 1,000 gallons in any month, yet it is advisable to install a unit that will provide for a maximum washday use of 2,500 gallons without requiring regeneration. The cost of operation will probably discourage the school authorities from extravagant use of softened water.\n\nIt is proposed that the water softener be installed in the boiler room at the Birtle Indian School and along the north wall adjacent to the stairway. Installation is simple as the feed pipe to the hot water supply boiler and high pressure steam boiler can be cut at this position. Some extra one inch piping will be necessary to supply soft water to the laundry and kitchen. The drain from the boiler room is immediately available and will adequately care for the water wasted during the regeneration process.\nManufacturers' Agents in Winnipeg have been requested to submit proposals with quotations for a water softener delivered F.O.B. Birtle, to provide 500 gallons of water at zero hardness with capacity for 2,500 to 3,000 gallons between regenerations and based upon a total hardness of 35 grains per imperial gallon in the water to be softened. It is anticipated that all proposals will provide for a double unit utilizing the zeolite method of softening and also Delcaso Mineral or Synthetic Mineral.\n\nESTIMATES OF COST:\n\nThe cost of a water softener at the Birtle Indian School depends almost entirely upon the capacity of the unit between regenerations, since all manufacturers using the zeolite process are subject to the same patent restrictions. The cost of installation would be practically the same regardless of the capacity within the limits outlined of course.\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 1.\n\nSingle Unit. Capacity between regenerations on 36 grain water, 1,300 gallons - - - - - - - $300.00\n\nCost of Installation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 25.00\n\nTotal Cost- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $325.00\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 2.\n\nDouble Unit. Capacity between regenerations on 36 grain water, 2,500 gallons - - - - - - - $580.00\n\nCost of Installation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 45.00\n\nTotal Cost- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $625.00\n\nThese two estimates of cost cover about the cheapest installation that can be considered. Proposal No. 1 requires approximately twenty-four pounds of salt per regeneration, while Proposal No. 2 would require\nforty-seven pounds of salt per regeneration - the cost of salt for each regeneration in each case being approximately .35\u00a2 and .70\u00a2 respectively.\n\nSUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nI would recommend the installation of a double unit water softener in the Birtle Indian School with a total capacity on 36 grain water of not less than 2,500 imperial gallons between regenerations. If such a softener is installed, I would suggest that the water supply feed line piping be slightly rearranged so as to provide soft unheated water to the laundry and kitchen.\n\nI believe the water softener will eliminate the trouble experienced with the hot water supply boiler and will possibly decrease the rapid rate of erosion in the high pressure steam boiler.\n\nShould the water softener be installed the operators of the school must expect some trouble for some months from scale being released from the piping etc., possibly causing blocking of feed lines and also causing annoyance with the water supply.\n\nD.

An examination was also made in Brandon of water softeners, inasmuch as a large number are in operation in that city, due to the extreme hardness of the water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Under existing regulations the Principal cannot sell to any person any of the materials taken from the old building, but they may be used in the best interests of the school work and the Indians. There is no objection to some of these materials being given to the Indians to assist in the building of a Church for them on the Rossburn Reserve.\n\nI am today writing to our Indian Agent at Birtle instructing him to advise the Principal along the lines above mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. D.

The jacket heater was rendered useless owing to cracks caused by corrosion. This will be remedied within a short time by the installation of a new heater. The water supply from the C.P. Railway water tank stopped three times within two weeks, leaving the school without water. The agent was interviewed in the matter and arrangements made with him to see that the supply of water was kept continuous. Mr. D. B. Gow and Mr. Rose of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Winnipeg were at the school on the 23rd inspecting the water system, with a view of eliminating if possible, the trouble of corrosion in the system. Some time was also spent on the 29th in figuring out just what portion of the school property was standing on the road allowance, and estimating the value of this portion. This information was required by the District Registrar, in connection with obtaining for the Department, title to the portion of the road allowance that has been closed for the school's purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. G. Lazenby.\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 2, 1934.\n\nMemorandum: Doctor McGill,\n\nPrices were obtained by the office of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Winnipeg on behalf of this department for the furnishing of a water softening apparatus, which is required in connection with the heating system at the Birtle Indian Residential School, at Birtle, Man. The installation of this apparatus has been found necessary on account of the high degree of hardness of the water which supplies the School, namely 35.15 grains of incrusting solids per Imperial gallon, according to chemical analysis made of it lately. The presence of these solids is responsible for constant corroding of the boilers and the entire system of piping.\n\nThe apparatus most affected by the existing condition of the water is as follows:\n\n1. The high pressure boiler used in connection with the laundry.\n2. The two low pressure tubular boilers of the heating system.\n3. The Jacket heater supplying hot water for domestic purposes.\n\nOwing to the above mentioned condition of the water it was found necessary last year to replace the tubes in the high pressure boiler and the jacket heater, which is quite an expensive job. It would be advisable, for this reason, that conditions be remedied as early as possible, there being funds available.\n\nThe prices submitted are all from dependable dealers and the apparatus figured on would answer the requirements of the system. These were as follows:\n\nMacKay-Horton Ltd., Winnipeg, representing the Permutit Co. Ltd. of Canada, Montreal, Que. - Capacity 2852 Imperial gallons between regenerations; f.o.b.

On account of the absence of Mr. Layton on a visit to Regina my reply has been delayed. I will endeavor to give you an idea of the situation and the causes that have ensued, and which I thought I was at liberty to take.\n\nMy duties as principal of this Birtle Indian School commenced on Sept. 1st, 1933. Kerr and I were joint inspectors for the month of September. I was informed when on a visit to the school during the summer that the Department had decided on the removal of the old school, and had called for tenders. The conditions inherent being that all material become the property of the person whose offer was accepted. I was told that a tender was received, but not accepted. I thought surely when I looked over carefully I thought surely as I could in the interests of the farm, from some account that building which is serving no purpose; which is deteriorating and will in time tumble down. I feared that a building like that costing many thousands of dollars for labor in its erection would cost at least\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6252, File 575-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\n$100.00 for labor for the demolishing of it; that is taken down carefully so that much of the material could be returned to some account. In addition to this $500.00 there would be considerable premium to be paid to remove the same in accordance with the requirements of the Western Conference Board. There would also be the hauling of 350 cubic yards of earth to cover the old foundation. Then on the erection of buildings labor would have to be had for. Where would all this money come from? I had in mind from the outset that in order to take down this building in the interests of the town I would be allowed to sell material with which to pay all expenses; as a last consideration, of course, selling such material as would not in any case be used for the erection of new buildings as are required here. And here let me say that we have many hundreds of dollars worth of material that would be of use whatever in these buildings required such as washboards, bathtubs, doors, furnaces, radiators, stoves, piping etc. And as for lumber we have a few thousand feet of 3 in by 12 in 24 feet long valuable material for bridge building. Also a few thousand feet of maple flooring.\n\nWe had a very welcome visit from a member of your Board, Mr. Sutherland, Superintendent of Indian Education. Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Lagendy, Mr. Currie and I went through...\nThe old school discussing the question of demolishing it.\n\nI told Mr. Sutherland I would help to take it down in the interests of the farm. That the farm was getting too good from it and that I felt sure there would be something to the good after paying all expenses. The matter of selling material with which to pay for labor was touched to the forefront in our conversation. In the course of this conversation Mr. Sutherland referred to regarding the mechanism that I should get $2.50 a week for them.\n\nMr. Currie at once said \"I'll give you $3.00 a week for three of them.\" When I received word through Mr. Layton that my offer was accepted I sold 3 barns to Mr. Currie for $7.00 and a toilet bowl for $5.00.\n\nI have sold approximately $300.00 worth of material most of which would not be used in our buildings and what else I have sold would be a portion of the surplus material after all our buildings would be completed.\n\nI have paid for labor for the taking down of the building $147.73. Blacksmithing $28.00. Insurance premium will amount to $53.00. There is still a little work to be done at the foundation and then the covering of the foundation with earth; the latter an item not included when you called for tenders. About $200.00 in all should leave the sight as if there had never been a\nBuilding. We have landed away and greatly liked the dress of stock. It should sell for a small sum for building purposes. The most valuable lumber is stored in a nearby barn. Class-room building. I have cut 7,000 feet of lumber. The remainder of the lumber is stored in the vicinity of our barns where we keep sale against the winter. In my figures for labor, I have not reckoned anything for the sale of our horses.\n\nThis farm has no implement shed; the implements are outside winter and summer. We have no hog pen; our few hogs are at present finding shelter in whatever a granary. We have no hen house; a very few hens are housed in a building 12' by 12'.\n\nAs I see the material we have taken from the old school, I offer to build an implement shed, a hog pen, and a hen house. My suggestion is for an implement shed 30' by 40', a hog pen 10' by 80', a hen house 16' by 80'. Also a garage for two accommodation for two cars and a truck, and a shop for house in which to crush grain. This can be allowed to sell material to pay for the labor of demolishing and erection.\n\nRespectfully ask you if this does not look like a worth while undertaking in the interests of the farm especially in the light of the fact that no one would offer you...\nany money whatever for the building during the time you\nare here for tender.\nI enclose by mail tomorrow this letter to you accompanied\nby a letter which I will write you.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nE. H. Lockhart\n\nP.S. I promise you not to add one dollar to the\nregular funds from school from the sale of materials\nand hope in the erection of these buildings and to\ndiminish the funds a dollar.\n\nE. H. L.\nBirtle Manitoba.\n27th December 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No; 106-1-5 of the 14th December, I beg to advise you that I wrote to the Rev; E.H.Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle Residential School immediately on receipt of it, and forwarded him a copy of it, drawing his attention especially to the final paragraph, regarding the selling of any of the materials from the old school building, and asking him to allow any action in the matter to remain in abeyance until I had opportunity to consult with him on the 26th December.\n\nI went to the school yesterday as arranged, and talked over the matter with him, of the disposal of the materials salvaged from the razing of the old school building, and asked him to give me a statement in brief, of how matters stood in this regard. He gave me the figures showing his expenditure, and the revenue he has derived from some of the materials he has already sold.\n\nI asked him to address a letter to the Department, and incorporate all these particulars therein, which he has done, and which I enclose herewith.\n\nBefore any work was commenced on the demolishing of the old school building, Mr Lockhart told me that he did not intend to increase the school funds by a single dollar through the sale of materials from the building, and hoped that he need not decrease the fund by a dollar. His object was to sell enough of such material as he would have no use for in the erection -\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\n\nIndian Affairs.

Such was Mr Lockhart's intention from the beginning. What Mr Lockhart is aiming at, is using materials from the old school for the erection of an implement shed, hog pen, chicken house, and garage, and chop house for the crushing of grain for feed, and have the school's fund break even in the matter of outlay for the labour involved. This seems to be a laudable object, and would preclude the necessity of the Department providing these very necessary buildings at some future date.\n\nMr Lockhart has kept strict account of every detail in the matter to date, however small it might be, and I beg to recommend that what he has done so far, and what he proposes to do, as stated in his letter, receive the approval of the Department, as he has not, nor does he intend, to commercialize the undertaking in any way.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 5, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication addressed to the Department from Rev. E. H.

Naturally the water could not circulate around the steam coils.\n\nFurthermore, about a week ago, the engineer disconnected a pipe from one of the registers, or rather, radiators; and the inside of the pipe was so full of corrosion that a lead pencil could not be inserted in it.\n\nIt would appear that unless something is done very shortly to remedy the situation, the whole system will get into such a condition that it will cost a great deal of money to put it right.\n\nWhen Mr. Gow was here some time ago, he took a sample of the water back to Winnipeg with him for analysis, to find out if possible, what might be the cause of all this corrosion, but as yet I have had no word from him, in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) P.

It will be noted by this letter that unless some action is taken in connection with the water situation, before very long we will no doubt be faced with a serious condition regarding the radiators and water pipes. I discussed this matter with Mr. Gow, of the Dominion Water Power Branch, and he is of the opinion that if a water softener were installed, the soft water would gradually dissolve the substance which has collected and hardened inside the pipes.

It is worth more\u2014finds a readier market and has an increased selling value. Realtors would rather sell a property equipped with a WESTAWAY Water Softener\u2014it satisfies the purchaser better.\n\nWith all the hardness removed from the water supply in your home you daily enjoy the service rendered by a WESTAWAY Water Softener. When shampooing, shaving, bathing, dishwashing or laundering, the use of soft water is a constant satisfaction.\n\nIn the preparation and serving of meals, water from a WESTAWAY Water Softener gives greater pleasure. In fact from every faucet in your home\u2014for every purpose, softened water brings a great service at very low outlay, and a minimum of maintenance.\n\nGuests always appreciate the thoughtfulness of a host and hostess whose home has a WESTAWAY Water Softener.\n\nIt's a Delight to Shave with Softened Water\n\nThe delicate lather of shaving soaps is largely destroyed by hard water. With WESTAWAY Water soft water a creamy, rich lather is easily obtained, and the face, after shaving, is left cool and refreshed by the softened water.\n\nShampooing in Softened Water is a Real Joy\n\nA feeling of absolute cleanliness is produced when hair is shampooed in pure, clean, softened water. The scalp is refreshed, the hair left smooth, soft, supple, oil, dandruff and dust is removed, and the hair is left fluffy and brilliant.\n\nWESTAWAY Water Softeners are used by all high-grade Beauty Parlors.\n\nSoftened Water is the Only Water for Bathing Tender Delicate Skins\n\nA bath in softened water is very refreshing and invigorating because the softened water penetrates the pores of the skin and allows the soap to penetrate every one of them. It opens pores and extracts the dirt and foreign matter. Your water supply often is very harsh and hard, curdling soap and leaving the skin tense after bathing. WESTAWAY Water Softener takes away this undesirable element and the water is caressing to the skin.\n\nSoftened Water for the Laundry has no Equal\n\nClothes washed and rinsed in WESTAWAY softened water will be fresher, softer and cleaner, and will wear longer because the soft water penetrates the material and loosens the dirt more freely. The soap does not settle in softened water. All the larger laundries are equipped with WESTAWAY Water Softeners. They use them for better results, less expense and less labor. You can have these results in your own home.\n\nBecause there is no lime in the softened water no deposits can form to clog hot water pipes. Boilers, heaters and hot water lines become absolutely clean inside and stay that way. Softened water means less money spent for fuel and a very large reduction in repair bills to the entire plumbing system.\n\nIn the Kitchen\n\nSoftened Water Makes Dish Washing Easy\n\nGrease and dirt is more easily removed from dishes, pots and pans. This is one reason why large restaurants install these Softeners for dish washing machines.\n\nWater softened by a WESTAWAY Water Softener is delightful to drink. Foods prepared with this zero water have better flavor, and cooking is more palatable and digestible. Better tea and coffee is made with softened water; fruits and vegetables canned in it retain their natural flavor.\n\nThey Give the Greatest Satisfaction\n\nWESTAWAY Automatic Regenerating WATER SOFTENER\n\n\"Softer than Rain Water\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Depending on the size, the closed Salt Tanks hold from 250 to 500 pounds of salt.\n\nWESTAWAY SOFTENING MINERAL: The softening mineral used in all WESTAWAY Softeners is a hard granular natural Zeolite, correctly and scientifically processed, which softens perfectly, grows even harder with use, and it will deliver its high water softening capacity for many years without diminution.\n\nAll WESTAWAY Water Softeners contain a very liberal amount of this mineral, sufficient to remove all the lime and magnesium from hard water and reduce to zero hardness.\n\nChoosing the Proper Size Approximate Soft Water Usage Per Week\n\n| Persons in Family | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Approximate Gallons of Soft Water Used | 350 | 500 | 625 | 700 | 775 | 850 | 925 |\n\nPRICES AND CAPACITIES\n\n| Type | Size | Cap.

After the Softener reaches the limit of its capacity, the starting of the regeneration at a convenient time takes but two to four minutes; the regeneration and returning the Softener into service is then entirely automatic.\n\nHaving no diaphragms, unreliable water meters, or delicately-operated mechanism used for motive power, there is nothing to get out of order; therefore there is no upkeep expense, and because of the simple form of mechanism involved, which does not rely on water pressure, no new expensive water service line from the street is necessary, and they can be used on water with low pressure or high pressure.\n\nTYPE C\nLever Control\nHand Operating\nWestaway Water Softener\n\nType C meets the needs for such a Softener in thousands of average homes, and is the same popular model of which so many have been sold.\nJanuary 10, 1934\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWATER SOFTENER:\n\nIn our letter to you some time ago we gave you some information on a Water Softener which was quoted to you through Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd., of Winnipeg. We would be interested in knowing if there are any details we can give you regarding our Water Softener. We have not been informed as to what use you intend to make of the softened water, and it occurred to us that a double unit Softener may be what you require to insure you of an uninterrupted flow of soft water.\n\nIf it were desired you could use two C-24 Softeners, which could be regenerated alternately and give you any capacity. The price of these Softeners would be $440.00, f.o.b. Hamilton.\n\nWe would appreciate knowing if we have given you sufficient information.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nW. J.

G. Murphy\n\nE. Claydon, Esq.,\nClaydon Company Limited,\n250 St. Anne's Road,\nSt. Vital,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nSir,\n\nThe Water Softener to be installed in the Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba, has arrived in Winnipeg and is being transshipped to Birtle. Arrangements have been made for the installation of the Water Softener in the school and it is expected that the installation will be complete within the next two or three weeks.\n\nAs I understand the situation, the primary reason for the installation of the water softener was to secure softened water for use in the heating plant of the school, in the water supply system and also in the high pressure steam boiler, in order to eliminate the rapid rate of erosion that is taking place throughout these installations. It is true that a limited amount of softened water will be made available for the use of the operators of the school. It is estimated that each regeneration of the water softener will utilize approximately forty-seven pounds of salt, with a water hardness of 57 grains per imperial gallon; the cost of the salt being about .70\u00a2 for each regeneration.\n\nBefore putting this unit into operation, it is necessary to have a supply of salt available. The question arises who is responsible for the cost of the salt? I might point out that this question has not been discussed with the Principal of the School or with any of the officials connected with that institution and no salt has been ordered until such time as the Department of Indian Affairs can advise us as to who is to be responsible for supplying salt for use in the water softener.\n\nIt is desired to order one ton of salt for delivery at the earliest possible date and it would be appreciated if this matter could be taken up with the Department of Indian Affairs and a reply forwarded at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n*SGD* D.B.Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nJ.T.Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFebruary 13, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the water softener now being installed at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 8th instant from Mr. Grew regarding the salt to be used for regenerating purposes, and in particular as to who is to pay for the cost of the salt.\n\nI shall be glad to have a letter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFebruary 14, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 15th with reference to the operating of the water softener which is being installed at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I would ask you to kindly advise Mr. Gow that the school authorities are required to pay for the salt and all other operating costs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man., enclosing his report on his visit to the BIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on February 28th, 1934. - Original on File 106-1-7.\n\nWith the materials salvaged from the old school building, the Principal has had built a poultry house large enough to accommodate 350 hens; a hog pen for at least 50 or 60 hogs, and will shortly be starting the erection of an implement shed large enough to house all the school's farming implements, including threshing outfit. The Principal has recently purchased a second hand thresher in very good shape, and a Ford truck, trading the old car, belonging to the school, in as part payment on the latter. A garage large enough for two cars has also been built.\n\nAt the time of writing, Mr. W. H. Dalton of Neepawa is installing a water softener in the boiler room of the school, which, it is hoped, will entirely do away with the trouble recently experienced, of excessive corrosion in the steam and water systems of the school.\n| HEATING | PLUMBING |\n|---------|----------|\n|         |          |\n\nInstalling Water softening plant at the Birtle Residential Indian School.\n\nSabot\n\nFeb 19 17 hrs\n\n27 5\n\n28 8\n\nMar 1 8\n\n2 8\n\n3 8\n\n5 8\n\n6 8\n\n7 5\n\n75 hrs @ 1.35/hr = 101.25\n\nMar 5 small fittings = 1.60\n\nTotal = 102.85\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo: Mr. H.

MCGILL:\n\nWater pipe line, Birtle School.\n\nThe Minister has received the following from Mr. H.S. Stead, Neepawa -\n\n\"When you were in Neepawa the last time I was talking to you about an account of $113.15 for extra work I did on the Birtle Indian School. I may state that when I put this work in in the first place, I worked under a Clerk of Works and a set of plans and the above amount is for putting in air chambers to stop the water hammer which caused the leaks. These air lines were not on the plan, but I do not blame the one who drew the plan for installation as they would not have been necessary under ordinary conditions, which I could prove by Crane Ltd., Engineers, Winnipeg, but here there was a pressure of 20 lbs on the pump in the school from the height of the C.F. tank which supplied it. I do not think it is up to me to lose the money for this work as I would think your Engineers would know as much as me and they did not show it on the plan.\"\n\nWhat view is taken by the Department with regard to this claim for extra payment.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nApril 8, 1934.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Daskard,\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 27th ultimo with reference to the water supply pipe line at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I beg to say that this work was carried out from plans prepared by engineers of the Dominion Water Power Branch and also under their supervision.

I am attaching herewith copies of letters received from the Indian Agent at Birtle, with reference to Mr. Stead's account.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nApril 18, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the amount of $112.50 still owing to Mr. H. S. Stead of Neepawa, for the installation of the water supply system at the Birtle Indian Residential School I would ask you to kindly submit a voucher to the department in the regular way for the payment of this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. G. Lasenby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that at about 10 a.m. on the morning of the 16th April, the poultry house recently erected at the Birtle Residential School from materials salvaged from the old school building, was destroyed by fire, through the exploding of a coal heated chicken brooder.\n\nThis building was just recently completed, and the Principal had purchased a large brooder, second hand, and had ordered 1,000 chicks. The brooder was placed in the building and was being tried out by one of the men of the staff, using small soft coal for the fire. The fire had been going for two days, and on the morning of the 16th the fire was made up, and left as usual, when shortly afterwards the building was seen to be in flames. It is supposed that gas had accumulated in the stove of the brooder, and had exploded, scattering the red hot coals about, which started the fire.\n\nThe building was 18 feet wide, and 66 feet long, well built, with floors, partitions, double walls with building paper between, trap nests &c; and the labour cost was $177.25, for the erection; the materials used, as stated above, were taken from the old school building.\n\nIn considering the replacing of this building, on which no insurance was carried, the school still has a quantity of good material that can be used. However, they lack drop siding for the walls, shingles for the roof, windows, cement for the foundation, a quantity of\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.,\ncommon boards for sheathing, and a quantity of dimension stuff for plates and studding.\n\nThe Principal had his carpenter estimate the materials required in addition to what they have on hand, and then had the local lumber dealer estimate the cost, which amounts to approximately $400.00.\n\nThey have purchased two new brooders as the 1,000 chicks arrived the morning after the fire, and have fixed up two temporary sheds for them in the meantime.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department will provide the material required, at a cost of $400.00, for the erection of a new poultry house.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 1st, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your F/15A of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the destruction, by fire, of the poultry house at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nNo provision was made in our Appropriation for the amount that would be required to replace the poultry house. Would it be possible to make some other provision for the care of the poultry?

E. H. LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nDear P.G. Lavenby,\nBirtle, June 23, 1937\n\nI am enclosing statement of material and cost thereof for the erection of a new house also for the painting of the interior of the school. I hope that this associated with your appeal in our behalf will meet with a full and complete response.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nE.H. Lockhart\nI placed no insurance on the buildings erected. If it had been my responsibility I certainly would have attended to it, as in the case of the buildings the loss by fire is not only material but also the cost of labor for erection.\n\nIf you require it I am prepared to give you a detailed statement of all the material required.\n\nI hope your Department will come to my assistance.\n\nOur chickens are growing fast and we cannot keep them cooped up in very small makeshift accommodation much longer.\n\nI am very sincerely yours,\n\nG. H. Lockhart, Principal\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nAs you have already learned from Mr. Layenby, the Indian Agent, we suffered by fire, the loss of a hen house which we had just erected. The building was 26 feet long by 16 feet wide; built with 2 by 4 studs and rafters, double boarded with paper between, single glass windows along the entire front of 8 feet. Four partitions making five apartments well equipped with beds, cooking pots etc., tidy beds in two apartments. The material was taken from the old school. $500.00 would not replace what we lost. The cost for labor was $77.25.\n\nAs we have still on hand some of the material that will do for the erection of another building, I am therefore willing to undertake the building of another house if your Department will provide one half the cost, or the matter of $500.00.\n\nA building 8 x 4 by 16 ft. will accommodate 350 hens. We have about 500 young chickens and therefore hope to have at least 350 hens to house next winter.\n\nI took upon myself to insure some material\u2014maple flooring etc.\u2014which I have stored in a part of what was the classroom building for the old school. But learning that the Department cannot dispose of the buildings,\nBirtle Manitoba,\n9th July 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to say that on receipt of your letter No. 106-1-5 of the 1st May last, in connection with the loss by fire of the newly erected poultry house at the Birtle Residential School, I consulted with the Principal in the matter, as to what other provision, if any might be made for the housing of the poultry.\n\nWe have discussed this matter several times since that date, without arriving at anything very definite.\n\nI finally requested the Principal to put in the form of a letter, his views regarding the whole situation, and he has handed me the attached letter addressed to the Department.\n\nIn addition to this, I also asked the Principal to let me have a list of the materials that would have to be bought, to add to that that still remains on hand from the demolition of the old school building, to erect another building of sufficient size to accommodate his flock of poultry, and I am also attaching hereto the list he has provided, with the estimate of the cost.\n\nAs stated in previous correspondence, the Principal purchased 1,000 live chicks just before the poultry house was burned, and these were temporarily accommodated in two small out houses on their arrival. The number of chicks now left is approximately 800, and their size now precludes them being cared for in these small places, and it is necessary that proper housing be provided.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.;\nprovided for this large flock, unless the greater portion of them are to be sacrificed.\n\nThe Principal, since he took over the management of the school last September has done some splendid work in the providing of outbuildings, such as a large implement shed, hog pen, &c; as well as the poultry house which was destroyed by fire, and I would recommend that the Department give as favourable consideration as it possibly can to the Principal's request for assistance to build another poultry house.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G. Laundy,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing communication from the Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, requesting authority to purchase materials for painting the interior of the school.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize any expenditure in this regard.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department does not see the necessity for as large a number of hens as mentioned in the Principal's letter, and, consequently, it is considered that a smaller building than the one proposed should be adequate.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of May first, last, no provision was made in the current year's Appropriation for any amount to replace the poultry house that was destroyed by fire. However, it is found possible to provide a sum not exceeding $275. You should confer with the Principal and arrange for the expenditure of this amount to the best possible advantage.

Water is charged to this school by the gallonage from C.P.R.\n\nI have ordered an excavation to be made at the point of flooding and trust the damage will not be too serious, however, I cannot fully state damage until the pipe line is uncovered, as pipe line is down fourteen feet and excavation difficult at this time of the year, it will be about 28th before an estimate of damage can be made.\n\nProviding the trouble is centered at a poor joint or faulty coupling where the condition can be looked after locally, will you authorize me to go ahead at the least possible expense, or, would you rather I called in the firm who contracted for the installation of the system.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I.A.\nOttawa, January 3, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, reporting on the condition of the water main between the school building and the barn at the Birtle Indian Residential School, stating that a break has occurred and that there is considerable flooding. As this is a condition which should receive immediate attention, the following night lettergram was sent to you yesterday, authorizing the necessary repairs:\n\n\"Reference your letter twenty-sixth, may have water main, Birtle School, repaired, least possible expense. School should provide greater part of labour. Be guided by approved list purchase of any pipe and materials required, also extra labour.\"\n\nIt is hoped that it will be possible to locate the break in the pipe without having to undertake considerable excavation. It is considered that the school authorities should be able to provide the greater part of the labour, without cost to the Department, and that the expense involved will only be to replace any broken pipe in the water main or to repair a poor joint or faulty coupling. In any event, I would request that you keep all expense in placing the water main in a satisfactory condition as low as possible. When the work is finished to your satisfaction, please forward a certified account, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H.

To overcome the heavy leakages an excavation sixty feet long and fifteen feet deep had to be made and about forty feet of pipe installed.\n\nThere is a possibility that the whole line of piping will have to be renewed, for there is still a slight leakage east of the excavation, however, it is too expensive to excavate under present weather conditions, so I halted the work until conditions are more favourable. The heavy leakage is now checked and wastage at present time will not exceed twenty gallons per day.\n\nI have thoroughly examined the corroded piping, it is 2\" black iron, the corrosion is external not internal, all corrosion is confined to the lower portion of pipe as laid on ground. I am at a loss to understand this condition as piping has only been installed a matter of four years. I note for some reason the pipe is wrapped in tar paper, the object of same I do not understand, it is possible a chemical reaction from tar paper, clay and moist iron has been created, this, however, is supposition only, but there must be some cause for this piping to corrode in this manner within the period of four years. Replacements have been made of galvanized malleable iron piping.\n\nExcavation is now being filled in and on completion vouchers will go forward for material and labour. Condition will be watched and a report sent about the month of June.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nG.H. Lavender,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                                      | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Jan 7  | 45ft 1\u00bd galvanized pipe @ 35\u00a2                 |               | 15.75        |\n|        | 3 couplings @ 40\u00a2                            |               | 1.20         |\n|        | 1 union @ 55\u00a2                                |               | 55           |\n|        | Labor pipefitter 8 hours at 75\u00a2               |               | 6.00         |\n|        | Laborer 9 hours at 30\u00a2                       |               | 2.70         |\n\nIndian Affairs.

This voucher covers labour costs for excavating at the Birtle Residential School, for replacement of broken water piping, and was authorized by Departmental Telegram Jan 2nd, 1935, subsequent to my report of Dec 26th, 1934.\n\nWhen excavation was commenced I arranged with the School Principal to pay three men at the rate of 25\u00a2 per hour, two of his employees put in part time and he promised to look after time etc. On the presentation of Labour return he quotes 30\u00a2 per hour as rate of pay. On drawing his attention to the increase of 5\u00a2 per hour he stated that the men informed him that they had seen published in the press that labour on work undertaken by the Government was to be paid at a minimum rate of 30\u00a2 per hour.\n\nMay I suggest that an appropriation of $85.00 be made to the School Principal to cover payment of the 340 hours of labour at 25\u00a2 per hour, he could disburse the payment of wages as a school job, not necessarily as work undertaken by the Government.\n\nPresentation of voucher is herewith submitted for payment as the Department deems most advisable.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nG.H.

I found three broke on the girls side and one on the boys. One is completely broke, and the other three at the bases which causes flooding.\n\nIt is requested that they be supplied with four new ones, and the estimated cost would be about $20. a piece, a total of $80. dollars.\n\nThey are the Regent Emco water closet bowel, plain wash down syphon and without the \"pud.\" Are fastened to the floor by four bolts and connected by 1\u00bd inch pipe.\n\nHe also drew to my attention the condition of one bath tub on which the drain pipe is either broke or disconnected under the cement floor.\n\nThis has no doubt been caused by the way the bath tubs are installed, as they are not stationery, and the children slide them around causing an excessive strain on the pipes.\n\nI would suggest that the engineer be authorized to cut the cement away from around the pipe, in order to find out where the trouble is.

We have no funds provided for the carrying out of these repairs, and it is believed that the school authorities should undertake the renewing of the closet bowls and the repairs required to one of the bath tubs, on which the drain pipe is broken, and they should be responsible for payment of the cost involved.

The leakage has not caused any flooding as yet, but it is noticeable in the amount of water being used.\n\nI have examined the pipes that were taken out in January, and would consider all of the remaining distance to the barn should be excavated, as no doubt all the remaining pipes will be rusted through.\n\nThis would necessitate a heavy expense, but I would consider it would be cheaper than to fix it in sections.\n\nThe condition of the pipes was drawn to your attention by Indian Agent Lavender's letter dated January 10th, 1935.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. C. Benson,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 13, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent, Birtle, Man., reports that the water main between the school and barn at the Indian Residential School, Birtle (Electoral District of Marquette), Man., is leaking. The Agent states the ground over the pipeline is saturated and starting to cave in. He recommends that the pipeline be excavated and new water pipe installed. The Agent is unable to give any estimate of the cost but states that it will likely necessitate heavy expense.\n\nThere are certain funds available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, for repairs at this school.\n\nIt will be necessary to engage the services of several labourers to excavate the pipeline and, after new pipe is laid, refill the excavation. New pipe will also be necessary and the services of a plumber to install the pipe. I would request the names of the men who should be employed in the work and also the name of the plumber to supply and lay the pipe.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 10th, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe your memorandum of May 13th, your file 106-1-5, please advise the Acting Indian Agent at Birtle to consult Mr. Frank Manwaring, the Mayor of Birtle, both as to local labour to be employed on the repairing of the water main at the Residential School, and also with reference to the purchase of materials.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, June 13, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd ultimo, reporting on the condition of the water main between the school and barn at the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is noted that it appears necessary, owing to heavy leakage, to excavate the present pipe line and renew the whole line of piping.\n\nThe Department will approve of the expenditure required in having the work done. You should consult Mr. Frank Manwaring, Mayor of Birtle, as to local labour to be employed on the repairing of the water main and also with reference to the purchase of materials.\n\nYou should keep proper time sheets, in triplicate, of the labour employed. These should show the number of days each man was employed and the rate paid per hour or per day. They should be signed by the individual labourers, certified by you and forwarded for payment. A certified account, in triplicate, should also be forwarded covering the cost of any new piping required.\n\nThe new pipe should be of sufficient size to carry the flow of water required. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed, and at the lowest possible cost, and the work should be carried out at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. C. Benson, Esq.,\n1/c Indian Office,\nBirtle, Man.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the inquiry from the Birtle \"Eye-Witness\" submitted by Dr. Mullins, M. P., I would state as follows:\n\n(1) The old buildings at the Birtle Indian Residential School were erected by the Presbyterian Church authorities. All capital costs were provided by the Church. The Department, from time to time, provided certain costs in connection with repairs to buildings and in supplying equipment. During the fiscal year 1924-25, the Department provided the cost of alterations to the school to the amount of $2,000 and erected a two-roomed classroom building at a cost of $4,663.03.\n\n(2) The present new school building was erected during the fiscal years 1930-31 and 1931-32. The cost of the buildings and equipment for each of the fiscal years mentioned is shown in detail, as follows:\n\n| Year | Description                                      | Cost   |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1930-31 | Progress payment on contract ($130,000) for building school - Clowdon Co.

You should deposit this cheque in your agency account and issue cheques to each of the labourers for the amount due them. At the same time, you should have them sign the paylist, in triplicate, and, when accounting for the advance, you should attach to your voucher the receipted paylists.\n\nThe above cheque should be sufficient to cover the cost of the labour in having the work of excavating and filling the drain completed.\n\nI am returning herewith the voucher which you submitted, dated the 8th instant, in order that you can pay the labourers whose names are mentioned thereon.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department, as soon as possible, the further length of time it will take to complete this work, as the costs are larger than was anticipated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He was instructed to consult Mr. Frank Manning, Mayor of Birtle, as to the local labour to be employed.\n\nTo date, the Acting Agent has forwarded vouchers in payment for the labour to the amount of $281.85. An accountable cheque, to the amount of $320, has been sent him to pay the labour.\n\nThe Department has no information concerning the further cost that will be involved in payment of labour in excavating and refilling. I would request that you ascertain the additional work required, or, if convenient, that you visit the school and see if the work has been satisfactorily completed. At the time this job was undertaken, no estimate could be given regarding the work that would be required. It is now considered that the cost is more than was anticipated. While the Department desires that the water main will be properly installed, it is expected that the cost will be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\nAugust 18th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to reply to your letter No. 106-1-5 dated August 9th with Vouchers No. 330 and 331 enclosed, for which you ask for an explanation. I would refer you to your letter No. 106-1-5 dated June 15th, 1935 which instructed that proper time sheets be kept and that the individual labourers sign them. This was done as I understood the Department would require their receipts before issuing cheques to them.\n\nI would advise you that I have this date received cheques in favour of the individual labourers named in Voucher No. 321.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.C. Benson,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 19, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, returning your vouchers Nos. 330 and 331, covering payment of the labour employed in the excavation and refilling of the water main at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you were informed by official letter of the 15th instant, an accountable cheque to the amount of $320 was sent you to pay the labour.\n\nIt is considered that the vouchers which you now submit should be returned, as you may require them in making payment. You should keep all labour returns and your vouchers until the work is completed, when you should return same in accounting for the expenditure of the cheque which was sent you. If there should be any funds on hand from the cheque, after you have paid the wages, you should return same to the Department. It may be, however, that you will require a further advance. We are not aware of the additional time that will be necessary to complete the work, and we are, therefore, unable to calculate the full amount that will be required for the purpose. However, should you require a further advance, you should make a request for same, stating the amount required to complete the work, over and above the cheque for $320 which has been sent you. The Treasury Branch requested that, instead of having individual cheques sent in payment for the labour, an advance be sent you for the purpose and that you make the payments.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Benson Acting Indian Agent.\n\nAttached you will find the voucher, which I have signed.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nPhilip Phean Esq.\nc/o The Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the occasion of the installation of Mr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, I visited the Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal, the Rev. E. Lockhart, was greatly worried because ten pupils had run away. I made careful enquiries and am of the opinion that the children were homesick. They had only returned from holidays and it usually takes a few weeks before they settle down. The children are well treated and receive plenty of well prepared food. They are also well clothed and the boys are certainly not overworked.\n\nThe school building was in excellent condition. A painter was busy decorating the Principal's suite. He has been working inside the school for nearly two months. Almost the entire building has been painted inside. The paint used comprises light shades, consequently the building is quite bright and cheerful. This work has all been paid for without extra assistance from the Department. I consider Mr. Lockhart deserves great credit for the splendid condition of the school residence.\n\nThe women in charge of the various departments appear capable and interested in their work.\n\nThe children were in good health and appeared happy. A graduate nurse is kept and I understand from the doctor that she is very observant and watches carefully.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nover the health of the pupils.\n\nThe machinery all appeared to be in good condition and I found the furnace room tidy. The chlorinator, filter, and water softener were all in good working order.\n\nSince the repair of the water line from the school to the barn, the consumption has been reduced by about half. The pipe was almost completely destroyed, allowing a great waste of water.\n\nThe barns and other outbuildings are in good repair. These buildings all need painting. I understand the construction of the buildings was completed late in the fall and, although the lumber was not dry, they were immediately painted. The result is that the paint has all peeled off, leaving the buildings in bad condition. The Rev. Principal is willing to do the work if the Department will supply the paint, oil, etc. In view of the painting already done by the Principal, I feel the Department should, if possible, supply the paint in connection with the outbuildings. The amount required to make a complete job will be approximately $300.00. The work perhaps could not be completed this year, but could be carried on and completed early next spring.\n\nThe farm consists of 840 acres and this year the land cropped amounted to 300 acres. Threshing was not completed at the time of my visit, but the returns will be small, due largely to rust conditions.\n\nThe stock was all in excellent condition and is as follows:\n\n- 42 head purebred Shorthorn cattle\n- 16 horses\n- 25 sheep\n- 40 pigs\n- 100 chickens\n\nThe farm\nThe farm land is mostly new breaking and, if Mr. Lockhart is fortunate in obtaining a couple of good years, he should be able to find it quite easy to finance. He is familiar with farming and a hard, persistent worker. He is fond of the children and, if anything, too lenient. Unfortunately, he is not popular with the Indians, due largely to the fact that he has restricted their visiting days and will not allow them to camp on the school property for indefinite periods.\n\nMrs. Lockhart is Matron and I consider her an efficient member of the staff. She is fairly strong on discipline, but certainly not unreasonable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, November 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 201-11 of the 2nd instant, reporting on your visit of inspection of the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that general conditions at this school are satisfactory, that the school building was in excellent condition and that the Principal, without expense to the Department, has carried out considerable redecorating in his living quarters. It is noted, further, that all machinery was in good condition and working satisfactorily.\n\nRegarding the painting of the buildings, I have to say that, when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an amount of approximately $300 to purchase the paint and other materials required. It is noted the Principal is willing to do the work if the Department supplies the material.\n\nWith reference to the complaint of the Indians, that the Principal has restricted their visiting days, I would say, for your information, that the Department has had correspondence with the Principal in this regard. It appears that the Indians were imposing on the school staff by their frequent visits and the length of their stay. The Principal was instructed that, while giving the parents opportunity to see their children, he should not permit them to unnecessarily impose on the routine of the school and he was to set down definite visiting hours, when the parents could see their children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWINNIPEG, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, February 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn official letter dated August 19th, last, the Department wrote Mr. A. C. Benson, Acting Indian Agent, Birtle, returning his vouchers, Nos. 331, to the amount of $31.60, and 347, to the amount of $34.60, covering payment of the labour employed in the excavation and refilling of the water main at the Birtle Indian Residential School. An accountable advance, to the amount of $320, was sent him to pay the labour. These vouchers were returned to him, as it was thought he would require them in making payment to the men who did the work. He was requested to keep the vouchers, together with labour returns, until the work was completed and then he was to return the vouchers and labour returns to the Department in accounting for the expenditure of the advances which were sent him.\n\nAt the beginning of October, Mr. Benson returned the unused balance of the funds which had been sent him to pay the labour, but he neglected to return the vouchers and labour returns referred to above. No doubt, these will be on file in your office, and I would request that you forward them to the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nF. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n| Name       | No. of Hours | Price | Total |\n|------------|--------------|-------|-------|\n| T.

A number of the buildings have been erected during the last two years and have never been painted. The main horse barn and cow barn, I understand, was painted in December of 1931, but the lumber was not seasoned and the paint has all peeled off.\n\nI am quite sure that the material required will cost approximately $250, and in view of the work which Mr. Lockhart has done in connection with the erection of these buildings I trust the expenditure necessary will be authorized.\n\nI would appreciate having the Department's instructions as soon as possible in order that the work may be completed before cold weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McKerroll, Missionary Secretary of the Presbyterian Woman's Missionary Society, for purchase of certain equipment for use at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI may say that the Department has no record that any special grant was promised. Should you be in need of certain equipment, to a cost of approximately $100, I would request that you forward, through the office of your local Indian Agent, a requisition for the equipment required, stating, if possible, the approximate cost of each item. When this is received, consideration will be given regarding the supplying of same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. B. H.

The one which you sent recently for the boys is now beyond repair although the girls' ball is still in use. We think that a football known as a T-ball might last longer and have included one in the list.\n\nA striking bag also deteriorates quickly for it is strenuously used. The\nONE WE HAD LASTED FOUR MONTHS AND BECAUSE OF THIS ONE THINKS THE BEST PURCHASE OF A STRIKING BAG FOR THIS SCHOOL WOULD BE MADE BY BUYING THE STRONGEST THAT CAN BE BOUGHT.\n\nTHE HOCKEY EQUIPMENT IS A NECESSARY SAFEGUARD. HOCKEY HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE VERY POPULAR WITH THE BOYS AND PADS ARE OF COURSE NECESSARY FOR A REAL TEAM.\n\nWITH THE HOPE THAT THIS LIST WILL MEET WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT WHOSE CONSIDERATION IS APPRECIATED.\n\nYOURS TRULY,\n\nE.

It would be appreciated, therefore, if we could have your advice as to what we are to do with the samples that have been received from the school and what action is to be taken with respect to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

It has been like this since the river has got so low and also since the river has frozen up. Now it appears to me there is a lot more foreign matter in it now than there was a while back. What makes me think so is, if any water gets on the floor of the pump room and dries up, you would think white wash had been dumped down. I am softening the same as usual, only two or three regenerations after one another as the rules call for if one regeneration is not enough. And we are also going through twice as much salt as we should do. I have had the screens out at different times and cleaned them good. It is in good working order.\n\nWe are sending in a length of pipe which I took out from the jacket heater which is eaten away with corrosion. This is just part of pipe I had to take out. Why we are sending pipe is to find out what is causing this corrosion to form or what the lumps in the pipe are composed of. There must be something which is making this form so bad. I know a lot of the smaller pipes are completely eaten away with it. I have had several like that.\n\nWe are sending a sample of salt for test, just to find out what it is composed of. If the same elements are in it we are trying to take out and I know this is so if the salt is not pure. Will you let us know Mr. Gow what can be done about this as soon as possible please.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sg'd.) \"J. W. DUNN\" (Engineer)\n\n\"E. H.

In addition to the above the water also contains 84.55 grains per imperial gallon of non-incrusting solids, or a total of 161.68 grains per imperial gallon of solid matter. We are particularly interested, however, in the 77.13 grains of incrusting solids as these are the ones that must be removed by water softening.\n\nThe 77.13 grains of hardness corresponds with 35.15 grains as shown by the previous chemical analysis, taken under date of November 28, 1933. Accordingly at the present time it will take about twice the amount of salt to render this water soft. The amount of non-incrusting solids in 1933 was only 25.14 grains as compared with 84.55 found at the present time accordingly. This amounts for the deposit which is reported by the Principal of the School. There is nothing that can be done at present to render this water less difficult to soften. It will be necessary for the school authorities to re-generate twice as often as formerly and to use twice the amount of salt.\n\nThis condition of the water is undoubtedly due to the very low flow being experienced in the Birdtail Creek at the present time and to the lack of pondage facilities as a result of the washing away of the dam last spring. It is anticipated that with the spring break-up, this excessive hardness of the water will disappear and the present trouble will be eliminated.\n\nWe are today writing to the Principal of the School, giving him the results of the chemical analysis and pointing out that there is nothing in particular that can be done at the present time to eliminate his difficulties but that we anticipate that with the opening up of the spring run-off, these difficulties will have disappeared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. MacInnes:\n\nThe Town Council of Birtle, in my constituency, requested a meeting to discuss the question of supplies to the Indian School at Birtle. I saw them last week and they informed me that practically no supplies are purchased in the Town for the Indian School. As you know, there are quite a large number of pupils in the school and they must do a lot of business, which would be a distinct advantage to the town. I received a petition signed by all the Merchants in the town, undertaking to give supplies to the school at 10% above cost price. If necessary, I will send you the Petition.\n\nI presume that your Department has their own policy with regard to the purchase of supplies but the offer made by the Merchants seems to me to be reasonable.\n\nI may point out that the school property is free from taxation and the residents of the school have the use of the roads and all public conveniences at no cost to the school or the Department. They also mention the fact that the school had made large purchases of timber in the community, depleting a very small reserve of timber in that locality. The thought was that the timber might be purchased from some place where there is a surplus. I understand that this matter was brought to your attention a year ago.\nI would be obliged if you would look into the matter and let me know if something can be done along the lines indicated.\n\nWhile I am writing, I may as well mention another matter which the Council discussed. Apparently the officials at the Indian School carry a fence parallel with the Railway to the boundary of the school property. This fence prevents ingress & egress to a farm immediately west of the Indian School property. I enclose a rough plan showing the fence and in red ink across the extreme West point a line is drawn showing what is required to give access to the house.\n\nI am also informed, and I know the property sufficiently well to say that there is no value in the small corner through which the proposed fence would go. I should be obliged if you would take the matter up with the Superintendent at the school and see if it is not possible to accede to the wishes of the Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. Allison Glen,\nM.P. for Marquette.\n\nJAG/RB\nEnc.\nOttawa, October 29, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Lockhart,\n\nMr. J. Allison Glen, M.P., for Marquette, in a letter to the Department, states among other things as follows:\n\n\"The officials at the Indian school carry a fence parallel with the railway to the boundary of the school property.

It is my hope that this matter can be settled in a way that will prove satisfactory to you and the citizens on whose behalf Mr. Glen has written.\n\nEncl.\n\nI note, also, that Mr. Glen refers to a large purchase.\n\nRev. E. H. Lockhart,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\npurchase of timber made by the school recently, which purchase depleted a very small reserve of timber in the locality. The position is taken that the timber might have been purchased from some place where it is more abundant or where there is a surplus. You might, in your reply, let me have whatever comments you may care to make on this statement.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 30, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nYour letter of the 20th instant, addressed to Mr. MacInnes, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI may state by way of comment that the residential school at Birtle is conducted by the Government, in cooperation with the Presbyterian Church. In actual practice, this means that the Department allows this school an annual per capita grant of $170.00, on the understanding that the enrolment is not to exceed 115 pupils. The last audit statement received from this school by the Treasury Branch indicates that the cost per pupil last year amounted to $234.80.\n\nIn addition to these grants, the Government provides for certain repairs and supplies, from time to time, textbooks, etc. The responsibility for the management of this school, the employment of teachers and the purchase of supplies is one assumed by the Church. The Government has never at any time suggested the source or sources from which these supplies should be purchased. May I point out, however, that the major portion of the food supplies necessary at the school is obtained from the farm. This means that about the only supplies required consist of clothing. I do not know what the practice is at Birtle, but I have been informed that supplies of clothing have been sent out to\n\nJ. Allison Glen, Esq., M.P.,\nRussell,\nMan.\nother residential schools by the Missionary Societies or the Home Mission Board of the churches to which the schools are attached.\n\nI shall be glad to communicate with the Principal in respect to the suggestion contained in the last two paragraphs of your latter. I feel confident that the problems about which you have written can be settled in a manner satisfactory to the people of the town and the officials in charge of the school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nBIRTLE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n(PRESBYTERIAN)\nREV. E. H. LOCKHART, PRINCIPAL\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey\nDept. of Welfare & Training\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of Oct. 29, 1937, is in hand.\n\nAnd I must say that I appreciate very much the courtesy and kindly tone that is evidenced in all your correspondence. And I well remember that in one of your letters you stated that you would like to help in any way you could the superintendents of the Indian schools. I will certainly appreciate all the help you can give for these responsibilities and cares of such institutions are very great.\n\nWhen people write you about our affairs and doing here, I do wish they would not omit important facts. And as important facts have evidently been omitted, I am glad you gave me an opportunity to state them.\n\nI wish you would write to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as to provision made by ingress and egress to the latter occupied by Mr. Ryder. Please note a dotted line I have made on the sketch for sentence. That indicates an ingress and egress for the occupant of that particular farm with a regular railway crossing provided, and out by that road I can bring my load within reason.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\ncan without our little horse team bring out a hundred bushels of wheat in a load moving at a snail's pace and without stopping to rest. I am with auto driving fifteen miles per hour over the road from the highway to Mr. Bryden's house without being at all reckless. This road is as good as the road he would like to have across the schoolhouse. In using this road which he has been using for several weeks, and which certainly thinks he should continue to use, he is not half the distance from the elevators and railroad station as is the next nearest farmer.\n\nNow as for no value in the small corner through which the proposed fence would go and which is marked \"no pasture,\" I am obliged to say that if that be the case then the entire quarter section is of no value except for the timber that is on it. And this quarter section is of no value for pasture, for I am making very good use of it for that purpose and before did my fencing on this quarter land with no pasture and of no value!\n\nThere was, before my coming here about one half of a quarter enclosed which Mr. Bryden was using and for which he had no lease. You could hear me feeding stock on land with no pasture and of no value!\n\nDoes suppose I bought a farm and after two years of ownership I decided to put a fence around it? And for several years before fencing a neighbor had been shortening his trips to town by driving across a corner of my pasture in violation of any fence with attached. Who would for one moment think I would build any fence other than to take in the entire acreage? I submit that my neighbor would\nbe most selfish and unreasonable if he expected me to run my fence across corner so as to allow him to continue on that shortcut across the corner. Anybody in charge of the school property had not the slightest thought that I should do otherwise than I have done in the building of this fence. I certainly would have expected criticism if I had done as he proposed. I have expected the Department to have said such as this \"Who is the friend of yours that you are so considerate there is no ingress and egress provided for him and there is no occasion or special provision for his property belonging to other.\"\n\nI have never had the slightest clash with any member of the Board Council members there have expressed appreciation for work I have provided for men who would otherwise have been on their hands for relief. I am very much surprised that they would make such an approach to you as they evidently have done. I am willing to do anything within reason. But Board Council can exact me to do anything so unreasonable as proposed. I can understand I consider it simply housekeeping to walk by a mat on the floor with a corner turned up and just straighten it out. Thousands upon thousands of farms in these mining countries have had trails across them that border how many cases can be found where farmers interfering their property have made their fence along the line of those trails and have thus deprived their property and left a portion of it open to the public. People would say such farmers lacked common sense.\nMy idea of handling this farm is to try to get everything into an orderly condition. It will take some years to get all things in order. But I certainly have these in mind.\n\nRe a large purchase of timber\u2014several men have approached me as to buying wood from them, some wishing to sell it to be delivered at the school, others in the town, too much a cord; others in the field, and I think it. I have bought in each of the three ways. By burning wood and not coal I am doing more to help the local situation. And especially when I buy in the trees and provide labor for men living in the village & Birtle.\n\nLast winter I bought about six hundred cords of wood in the tree on a farm lying east of Birtle. My idea has been that a man could sell off his farm without raising the permission of each and every individual of the residents of Birtle or even the Council. Another man with a farm between the farm I have mentioned and Birtle asked me if I would buy from him. I am sure he does not consider that the people of the village or any other person has any right to interfere with him doing business of this kind. If a farmer is trying to pay his debts, taxes, etc., let him be left alone. He should be left alone. If there is anyone who may choose to tell him that he must sell wood, I think he would feel like telling them that he was not living in Russia.\n\nBy purchasing wood not too far from Birtle I have provided labor for men who otherwise would have had to get relief from Birtle Council. In fact, there were two men with families whom I employed for about three months last winter cutting wood, who, when the work was completed...\nin February had to get work almost immediately from the town and could do so until April employed them only from April. These two men have been working for me with the greatest care and this evening they got their last cheque and it is indefinite as to any further work for them here. I needed some time ago that I would not buy wood in the spring this winter. I feel sorry for these men who are good truthful workers. They will likely be very lucky to get work immediately. Last year I go this fall then undertook the building of the old school my average of extra men for the two months required would be about fifteen. Then started the erection of buildings and the clearing & land in preparation for breaking and cultivation. There has been an immense amount of labor required in converting the forest into a fruitful field, the removal of stumps and especially rocks. Gradually that work has lessened, and gradually the town has had its burden increased.\n\nI must say that I consider it very small on the part of the council of Birtle to approach the Department of Indian Affairs in answer to a very selfish request from Mr. Ryder. After all that I have been instrumental in doing there that has greatly relieved them in the matter of providing relief stuff another matter I think should be mentioned. It has been reported to me that a letter was in circulation among the businessmen of Birtle asking that the Department request me to spend more money in Birtle and send less orders for goods etc elsewhere. I don't know whether such a petition has reached you or not. Now, in this connection let me say that I have never had an unpleasant word with any of the businessmen of Birtle. But I am convinced that in the interests of this Institution I must purchase even less than...\nin Butte than I have done in the east.\n\nYou will understand that when one hundred measures of any commodity are required and I can afford to buy this amount by adjusting my order, and only seventy-five measures can be purchased with the same amount of money in Butte, that I must get the required amount and not deny these children a sufficient amount of food, clothing, and other essentials and comforts. When buying one hundred pairs of running shoes and have $5.00 with which to buy them and can get them for that money and I pay $1.25 a pair for shoes in Butte, thus getting for $5.00, only sixty-eight pairs and let thirty-two children go without shoes?\n\nPlease note the following\u2014\n\nIn the erection of buildings that I have added to the school property, I purchased many hundreds pounds of nails. A hardware man here started charging me 6\u00a2 a lb. He soon discovered that I was getting my nails elsewhere. He then came to see me and said he could sell them to me in large quantities at 5\u00a2 & 4\u00a2 a lb. I have bought all my nails from him since.\n\nEconomy is particularly necessary at this time because of the well-nigh complete crop failure. We had less potatoes off fifteen acres of good new land than what would be just a fair crop to one acre, and all other crops equally tight. The Butte and Ringwood sections of Manitoba has been reported the driest part of Manitoba this year.\n\nYour very truly,\n\nH. & Rockhart\nI feel obliged to tell you that there are some thieves in this vicinity whom it would be well if I could have carefully watched. This particular quarter section of land had been robbed of many loads of wood before my coming. To my great surprise I found that during the last winter the principalship several loads of wood were taken. These have been removed since.\n\nWhen I discovered this removal I hastened to Agent Layenby to come and see. He at once asked me if I suspected Blyden. I said I did. In conversation I had with Blyden at one time he admitted that a team of his was used for the removal of stolen wood from the school property. I am prepared to make further statements if necessary along this line.\n\nIt was rumored that he was leaving this fall, and I had hoped it was true. However, it appears otherwise now. It would be a big relief to me if he left. If there are other things requiring watching here, I must ask you in all earnestness to help me keep this man off the premises.\n\nE. H.

I then started the erection of buildings and the clearing of land in preparation for breaking and cultivation. There has been an immense amount of labor required in converting the forest into a fruitful field; the removal of stones and especially roots.

He then came to see me and said he could sell them to me in large quantities at 6\u00bd\u00a2 a lb. I have bought all my nails from him since.\n\nEconomy is particularly necessary at this time because of the well nigh complete crop failure. We had less potatoes off of five acres of good, new land than what would be just a fair crop for one acre and all other crops equally light. The Birtle and Binscarth section of Manitoba has been reported the driest part of Manitoba this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) E. H. Lockhart.\nOttawa, November 13, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Reverend E. H. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School, in which he discusses in detail and at considerable length certain matters referred to him by the Department immediately following the receipt of your letter of a few weeks ago.\n\nThe thought has occurred to me that a number of these matters might be taken up and discussed with you when you arrive for the next Session of Parliament. If you are willing to do this, I feel confident a great deal of unnecessary correspondence can be avoided. If, however, you are anxious to have Mr. Lockhart's comments on the subject matter of your letter, I shall be glad to send a summary of them on to you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Allison Glen, Esq., M.P.,\nRussell,\nMan.\nDear Mr. Lockhart:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is my opinion that if you could meet a committee representing the Town Council of Birtle and discuss with them very frankly the problems to which you refer in your communication, this act in itself would go a long way to clear up any misunderstanding that may exist. I am aware, of course, that there are always a few unreasonable people in every community, but I feel confident the majority of the citizens will be kindly disposed toward you in the attempts you are making to administer affairs at the residential school.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Birtle Indian School\n\nI have your letter of 13th instant. Perhaps you would send me a summary of Mr. Lockhart's comments so that I may take the matter up with the parties interested and get their viewpoint. I would then be in a position to more intelligently discuss any differences of opinion and perhaps we can both save time by doing so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAG/RB\nOttawa, November 22, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Glen:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by me from Reverend E.

This letter, of course, is for your personal use. I am still of the opinion that, if a committee, representing the Birtle Council, could meet Mr. Lockhart and have a frank discussion with him, a great many of the problems with which he deals could be adjusted to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR.

As funds are limited necessary work only should be considered.\"\n\nYesterday two plumbers from the firm of Yates and Meale, Brandon, worked at the school, and have located the stoppage in the drain right under the basement floor. To do this the concrete floor had to be broken up for a few feet. As soon as I can form an estimate of the cost of necessary repairs I will communicate with you. Some new iron pipe and tile will be necessary.\n\nTo delay doing this work until I received further authority would mean additional expenditure; therefore I am proceeding to do what work is essential at once, and I hope that no further expense will be necessary. The washing water is backing up into the school basement, and the smell is abominable, and to delay would mean sending the children home or running the risk of an epidemic. I will supervise this work myself, and will see that no expenditure is incurred which is not necessary immediately, to preserve the health of the children.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of May 1938.\n\nTrouble with the drainage system has developed at the Residential school and we are trying to find the cause of same.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent.\nThe cost of this with use of slush Pump etc would be ...........................................$135.00\n\nEvery Septic Tank in Institutions of this kind should be cleaned out and inspected every five years.\n\nWhile we have some that have been working for eleven years without cleaning, they are working only at half capacity.\n\nIn one case we removed 35 wagon loads of heavy sludge and debris after eleven years.\n\nWe would also draw your attention to the fact that the only access to either drain in the building is from the bottom of each stack, the long drain having no cleanouts except the one we installed.\n\nThis report we respectfully submit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nYates Neale & Co.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 5)\nThe type of Grease Trap at the Kitchen Sink where, we feel sure most of the grease comes from, is not adequate for an Institution of this size, and should be replaced with one having a water jacket the cold water in which would congeal the grease. As it is now when large quantities of Hot Water are used it is impossible to keep the grease out of the Drain.\n\nWe would recommend as the most important, that a new 12\" Dia Cast Iron Flushing Cleanout Water Jacketed Grease Trap with removable top be installed at the Kitchen Sink at a cost of;-\n\nONE HUNDRED & FIFTY DOLLARS........................................$150.00\n\nAlso that eleven new copper wire cages or baskets be installed at the roof outlets at a cost of....$33.00\n\nFor your information, we found that on both Drains, there is what is known as a House Trap installed with fresh air inlet, while this will allow the ventilating of the Drain and Stacks in the Building, it provides no ventilation for the outside drain or the Septic Tank.\n\nWe have known of cement Septic Tanks being badly damaged above the water line for want of Ventilation. We have also had men overcome by gas in cleaning these Septic Tanks out, because they had not been properly ventilated.\n\nWhere House Traps are not installed it is an easy matter to ventilate the Septic Tank, and drains through the Stacks to the roof, being careful not to cause freezing or chilling by too much ventilation.\n\nIf you decide to remove these Traps and make the drain straight, repairs to floor, excavating etc., it would cost.................................................................$76.00\n\nWe would recommend that this Septic Tank, having now been in about 5 years be cleaned out and inspected for faults.\nJune 30th 1938.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\n518 Dom Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Drains, Indian School, Birtle, Man.\n\nWe have only now been able to assemble the necessary information to form an intelligent report. Some of our Staff being absent.\n\nOn being called to Birtle to clear the main drains our Plumber found that there had accumulated a stoppage, not in the drain that goes through the Septic Tank, but on that drain which is connected to the Laundry Machinery, the Kitchen Sink, floor drains in Laundry and the Drinking Fountains. This drain also takes all the rain water from the Roof.\n\nThe stoppage was composed of Grease, some Lint and broken half rusted wires from the roof cages showed in two places.\n\nThe waste stoppage was between the Boys Recreation Room and the Dining Room, and in this case about 25 ft of the Drain was plugged solid with grease. At this point, the cold water from the Boys Drinking Fountain enters this drain, contributing to a large extent on hardening the grease. At this point, the drain is 6\" cast iron and had to be taken up to be cleaned, and some new pipe put in. We also installed a cleanout here to help in case of future trouble.\n\nThe lesser stoppage was in the same Drain but in the Tile Pipe near the Septic Tank where an offset in the Drain occurs. The average depth of this Drain is approximately 7 feet and was dug up in three places and eleven lengths of tile pipe had to be replaced.\n\nThe accumulation of rubbish, helped out by the broken rusted wires from the roof cages were the cause of the plug here.\n\nWe might suggest that all roof cages protecting the outlets of rainwater pipes should be made of copper.\n\nWhile this drain was plugged, a severe rain storm occurred, causing considerable inconvenience and some damage.\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from Yates, Neale & Company, Branch in connection with conditions at the Birtle Indian Residential school. The invoices for the work already carried out have no doubt been submitted by Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent. Consequently I do not know the amount of the bill. However, I am of the impression that it entailed considerable expense and if a repetition of this can be avoided by the installation of a grease trap, I would recommend that one be installed even though the price appears exceptionally high.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Yates makes certain recommendations. No doubt all of them would be an improvement but will entail considerable expense totalling almost $400.00. In my opinion the copper wire cages or baskets should be installed, especially on the lower parts of the building where waste material is liable to accumulate.\n\nI would like to be advised if funds are available to carry out any of this work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

E. H. Lockhart, Principal, Indian Residential School at Birtle, Manitoba, which he asked me to forward to the Department.\n\nWhen Mr. Lockhart was in Toronto, he spoke of the unfinished condition of the floors in the Birtle School. The condition of the floors will not help in the fight against tuberculosis, which is being carried on, and we would greatly appreciate the attention of the Department to this matter. Would it be possible to have this improvement made during the summer holidays, so that when the children return in the Fall the floors will be properly finished?\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated June 29th, and thank you very much for the information contained, re grants for furthering the education of Mary Green and Mary Bees.\n\nI would like to say here too, how much I appreciated your coming to Toronto, and I feel that our conference will help very much in our Indian School work.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa, July 12, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing communication received by you from the Reverend Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School.

Recently, the Department received an account for $95.37 covering repairs to the sewer and drain, and, on the recommendation of Inspector Hamilton, we have authorized an additional expenditure of $183.00 in connection with the water system. These amounts practically exhaust the sum specifically provided for this school, but, if Inspector Hamilton reports that the other improvements requested can be done for a reasonable figure, I shall endeavour to obtain the necessary funds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, July 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn June first, last, I was in Toronto to interview the executive officers of the Women's Missionary Society, Presbyterian Church in Canada. Reverend Mr. Lockhart, Principal of the Birtle School, was present at the interview. At that time he brought up the question of the condition of the floors in the Birtle School and also the question of the grounds around the school. He did not give any specific information regarding the expenditure that he considered necessary in connection with the floors, but, in our conversation, he mentioned a very large sum for putting the grounds in good condition. At the time I expressed the opinion that I could not see the necessity of expending as much as he mentioned.\n\nWhile you were advised in my letter of the 9th instant that the amount specifically provided for this school has been practically expended, at the same time I may say, for your personal information, that we might be able to secure an additional amount from the funds that are unallotted. I would therefore appreciate it if you would visit the Birtle School within the next few weeks and let me have an estimate of the expenditure that you would consider reasonable, both to improve the floors and to place the grounds around the school in a fair condition.\n\nI thought you might be interested to read\n\n- the enclosed\n\nA.

These are not made of copper but should last for two or three years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 12th instant, file 106-1-5, I wish to report that I visited the Birtle School on July 28th, in company with Agent Smith.\n\nWe went carefully through the whole building and the floors are certainly badly cracked and, in many cases, very unlevel. The fault, I am convinced, has nothing to do with the foundation of the building because there is scarcely a crack in any of the walls. In my opinion, the steel work on which the cement floor was laid, was of too weak a structure and the floor settled in the areas between the main supports. I am not in a position to recommend what action should be taken, but would suggest that this matter be given over to the Engineering Department for their advice. I think it would be useless to attempt to lay another floor without first putting down the steel work to carry it, and this, along with the weight of the cement, would perhaps be too heavy for the building. It might be possible to clean out the cracks and fill them in with something and then cover the halls and some of the main rooms with battleship linoleum. I am sure this latter suggestion would be the cheaper and probably the most satisfactory.\n\nA lot of work is required to fix the front grounds, and it will be necessary to put down some walks and a certain amount of cement cribbing. The cement, lumber and gravel required will cost at least $125.00. In addition to this, it will be necessary to haul at least 250 yds. of good soil and 100 yds. of gravel and before any of the work is started, labour will be required for the levelling of the present yard. It will take at least\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n$225.00 for labour. In estimating the amount required as $350.00, I want to make it clear that this will not in any way give a complete job, but will fix up the portion of the grounds in front of the school, after which, I think the principal should be able to add further improvements from year to year.\n\nThe horses and machinery required will be furnished by the school. I would recommend that Mr. Smith be given an accountable advance, as the men engaged in this work will expect their pay every Saturday.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

In my opinion, the steel work on which the cement floor was laid, was of too weak a structure and the floor settled in the areas between the main supports. I am not in a position to recommend what action should be taken, but would suggest that this matter be given over to the Engineering Department for their advice. I think it would be useless to attempt to lay another floor without first putting down the steel work to carry it, and this, along with the weight of the cement, would perhaps be too heavy for the building. It might be possible to clean out the cracks and fill them in with something and then cover the halls and some of the main rooms with battleship linoleum. I am sure this latter suggestion would be the cheaper and probably the most satisfactory.\"\n\nI would appreciate if you could arrange to have one of your engineers visit the Birtle Residential School and inspect the floors and advise me what he considers is the best action to take regarding them.\n\nActing Director.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 9th instant, I may say that instructions have been issued for the inspection and report on the above school as requested by you.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS | FOLIO | TIME AND MATERIAL | CR. | TOTAL |\n|------|-------------|-------|------------------|-----|-------|\n| Aug. | To installing at Kitchen |       |                  |     |       |\n|      | Sink, 1 - 12\u00bd\" Dia., cast iron |       |                  |     |       |\n|      | Flushing Cleanout water |       |                  |     |       |\n|      | Jacketed Grease Trap with removable top |       |                  | 150.00 |       |\n|      | as per our letter |       |                  |     |       |\n|      | June 30/38 |       |                  |     |       |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSince the meeting we had in Toronto at which Mr. Phelan and the principals of our two Indian Schools were present, we have been trying to lower the cost per pupil in our schools.\n\nMr. Lockhart of Birtle has, we consider, done good work in putting up buildings and in clearing the farm. He expects to have good returns this year and we feel sure that he will make every effort to carry on according to instructions. He has worked very hard and has not spared himself in any way.\n\nOur Board understands that most of the schools are provided with a night watchman, and we think that Mr. Lockhart should have some assistance in the matter. His day is a long one, and under present conditions he has to be up several times during the night to see that everything is right. We would be glad if some arrangement could be made to relieve him of the night duty.\n\nOur Treasurer, Mrs. D. Strachan, has asked me to say that the cheque for the April, May, June quarter was not received till August 2nd. Is it possible to have the cheques sent any earlier? We, like all other Church Societies, are finding it increasingly difficult to get money and if we could have the quarterly cheques at the end of the quarter, it would be a great help.\n\nThanking you for your kindly consideration,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\nSeptember 19, 1936.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in which you state that the Principal of the Birtle Residential School requests a grant for a night watchman.\n\nThe Department only allows a grant for night watchman at those Residential Schools where there is a very serious fire hazard. We do not consider that the Birtle School can be included in this category and consequently no provision has been made in our current year's appropriation for the amount required to allow a grant for the services of a night watchman.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndian Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 11th ultimo with regard to the above, a report has now been received from Mr. Atkinson who made an inspection recently of the above school.\n\nFrom Mr. Atkinson's report it would seem that he made as careful an inspection as was possible under the circumstances, taking at the same time actual floor levels in order to ascertain whether there had been any structural changes in the building. Mr. Atkinson was not, however, able to procure copy of the specifications for materials etc., used in the original construction of this school. He did, however, examine files available, from which he observed that in February, 1931, one letter stated: \"Several cracks in floors throughout the building will want filling up and levelling off\". This would appear to indicate that there was early trouble in connection with floor cracks. Mr. Atkinson was further advised that the cracks in the floor are worse now than they were five years ago, from which it would seem that these cracks first appeared shortly after construction of the building in 1931 and have since widened somewhat.\n\nFrom levels taken and a general examination of the walls etc., it does not appear, however, that the cracks in question are results of unequal settlement of the building.\n\nIn view of the evidence of the same type of checking in all floors throughout the structure including basement floors, it is Mr. Atkinson's opinion that these cracks are a result of the method used in laying and finishing the concrete surface. In any case it is evident from Mr. Atkinson's report that whatever may be the actual cause, there is no serious structural condition at this school and, therefore, that it is merely a matter of the method to be used in remedying the conditions which now exist. In this connection, however, Mr. Atkinson does make the further suggestion that if it is thought advisable to do anything further to assure that there are no structural defects, this might be done by taking the matter up with Mr. Govt. of Winnipeg and Mr. W. Swan, Architect, Punnichy, Saskatchewan, who it would appear were interested in the actual construction of the building in question.\n\nAs regards repairs, it would appear that with few exceptions the cracks are so very slight that a filling\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nof any kind would be practically useless and could not be generally applied to any advantage. It is, therefore, suggested that a mastic cement finish might be applied on the floors or the situation might be met by covering all main floors throughout the building with felt and battleship linoleum. In Mr. Atkinson's opinion this would appear to be necessary even though the floors were in good shape as according to his report the building is a very cold structure with no floor covering whatsoever in any part.\n\nWe have no cost estimate for any of the above suggestions for handling the trouble, but same could be secured if the Indian Affairs Branch desire such information.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT. O. Miller\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 5)\n21st September, 1938.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School, Birtle, Man.\n\nWith reference to Mr. MacInnes' memorandum of August 9th, our Engineer, Mr. Atkinson, has made an inspection of the above school and has now submitted his report. A copy of the Chief Engineer's memorandum is attached from which Mr. Atkinson's findings will be noted.\n\nIt would appear that the cracks showing in the floor are of long standing and must have occurred shortly after construction of the building; also that it was not possible for Mr. Atkinson to say just what the causes of the unevenness and cracks in the floor were but that some information on this might be obtained from Mr. Gow, of Winnipeg, and Mr. W. Swan, Architect at Punnichy, Saskatchewan, who apparently were interested in the construction of the building. It will be further noted that Mr. Atkinson recommends that the floor should be covered with a mastic cement or the situation might be improved by covering all the main floors throughout the building with felt and battleship linoleum.\n\nIf you would like an estimate of the cost of carrying out Mr. Atkinson's suggestions we shall be glad to obtain it for you.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 30 with reference to the floors in the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Surveys & Engineering Branch arranged to have one of their officials -- Mr. Atkinson -- visit this school and he states that the cracks showing in the floor are of long standing and must have occurred shortly after the construction of the building. From the levels taken by him in a general examination of the walls etc., it does not appear that the cracks in question are results of unequal settlement of the building.\n\nMr. Atkinson suggests that a mastic cement finish might be applied on all the floors. Please make inquiries and let me have an estimate of the cost of doing this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G.

E.H.Lockhart,\nPrincipal, Indian School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nDear Reverend Sir:\n\nAttached to this letter you will find copies of the boiler inspection reports on your heating and high pressure boilers.\n\nI may say that the high pressure boiler will have to be retubed, as the tubes are about pitted through at the water line. I was informed by your engineer that it had only been about four years since this boiler had been re-tubed, and I consider that it has done very well to not need re-tubing before this date.\n\nA vertical boiler of this type is very unsuited for the work that it is doing in your Residential School, as in constant use, tubes will not last more than two or three years at the outside.\n\nIf possible, it would be far more economical to replace this boiler with a horizontal type, in which the tubes would last for at least twenty years. If the vertical boiler is still kept in use, you can look forward to the renewing of the tubes in it about every two or three years, which is rather a costly operation, as it has to be dismantled entirely and laid in a horizontal position to re-tube.\n\nHowever, the boiler will in good shape for another season or two if it's re-tubed.\n\nSgd.

Fuller's remarks on the Low Pressure furnaces\n\n\"I would advise providing means of feeding lime wash into this boiler, as tubes show signs of pitting.\"\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter sent to the Principal of the Birtle Indian Residential School from the Provincial Boiler Inspector, regarding the condition of the high pressure boiler at the School. This boiler will either have to be replaced with a horizontal boiler or be re-tubed.\n\nFour years ago Mr H. Greeves of Birtle put new tubes in this boiler, and his work must have been very satisfactory or the tubes would not have lasted for four years. Mr Greeves will do a complete job on this boiler for $135.00, including the new tubes and other material required, or will put in new tubes at a cost of $75.00 for labour. If the Department do not desire to replace this boiler with a horizontal one I would suggest that Mr Greeves tender on a complete job be accepted.\n\nIn the vertical boiler part of the flues are not submerged, and that is where they become pitted. In a horizontal boiler the whole flue is submerged, hence they last for years with proper care. The advantage in a vertical boiler is that hot water may be had in 30 minutes, whereas in a horizontal boiler it would take two hours. The engineer at the school informs me that a horizontal boiler would be satisfactory, as they could put in a fire at night; it would soon steam up in the morning. I think this boiler should be attended to as soon as possible, as it is not safe in its present condition.\n\nRegarding the low pressure boilers at the school, Mr Fuller the Provincial boiler Inspector reports that the boilers are in good condition, but the tubes show signs of pitting on account of using softened water only. Mr Fuller recommends that a lime wash be fed to the boilers every two weeks or that hard water be used for a season. The engineer at the school\ninformed me that a lime wash can only be fed when the boilers are cooled down. During the winter months the boilers are never cooled, so it is impossible to use a lime wash regularly.\n\nTo connect the boilers to the hard water line a certain amount of piping, connections, and fittings are necessary, which can be purchased from Mr. Ross Brown of Birtle for $26.80. The engineer at the school can do the work himself without cost.\n\nI am enclosing a list of material required for this connection, and as this small expenditure will save the tubing in the boilers according to information received, I recommend that the material be supplied.\n\nYours truly\n\nA.G.

Doig, Birtle, Manitoba, furnished the Indian Affairs Branch with an estimate of $5,500.00 for the resurfacing of the cement floors with a mastic cement.\n\nAs noted in my memorandum of the 12th ultimo, no information regarding the amount of work involved, that is, the number of square yards of floor to be refinished, has been furnished and, therefore, it is not possible to compute a unit cost for comparison with other types of flooring.\n\nFrom information submitted by our local engineer, it would appear that the maximum floor area to be covered, namely, all floors in the building with the exception of cupboards, storerooms, etc., would be 1,920.08 square yards. The question of minimum area which might be covered was also discussed with the representatives of the Indian Affairs Branch at the school, and the absolute minimum area would be 625 sq. yards.\n\nRegarding the costs of various types of flooring, the following costs have been estimated from information obtained from our engineers in Manitoba and from information obtained in Ottawa.\n\nLinoleum - Considering a medium grade battleship linoleum, 1/4\" thick, the unit cost covering material and labour is estimated at approximately $2.50 per sq. yard, f.o.b. Birtle, Manitoba.\nMinimum cost = 625 sq.yds. $1,590.00\nMaximum cost = 1,920 \" \" 4,800.00\n\nOur local engineer has, however, estimated the total costs as approximately $1,500.00 and $4,420.00, which reductions might be considered possible on the volume of work involved.\n\nAsphalt Tile - The average unit cost, for estimating purposes, based on Ottawa prices, would be approximately $2.50 or $2.60 per sq. yd., f.o.b. Birtle, Man.\n\nThis type...\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThis type of flooring, therefore, would be equal or slightly higher in cost compared to battleship linoleum.\n\nMinimum cost 636 sq.yds. $1,590.00 to $1,650.00\nMaximum \" 1920 \" \" 4,800.00 to 4,990.00\n\nMastic Flooring (black hot mastic type only). The average unit cost for estimating purposes, based on Ottawa prices, would be approximately $1.60 to $1.80 per sq. yd. This type of flooring should, in comparison with the battleship linoleum be more economical.\n\nMinimum cost 636 sq.yds. $1,015.00 to $1,145.00\nMaximum \" 1920 \" \" 3,075.00 to 3,450.00\n\nIn regard to the use of the above types of flooring, it is considered that the battleship linoleum is the most desirable and practical for use in a residential school. The mastic flooring is considered purely as an economical flooring.\n\nIn view of the above cost and assuming that Mr. Doig has submitted his estimate on the maximum flooring requirements, namely, 1,920 sq.yds., it would appear that this cost is excessive for the type of flooring being provided. However, before any definite statement can be made in this respect, it would be necessary to know the exact amount of flooring on which Mr. Doig based his estimate. This information, no doubt, could be secured by the Indian Affairs Branch before the final decision is made regarding this work.\n\nIt is felt, however, that the use of battleship linoleum would be more desirable and practical at this school. The entire refinishing work could be carried out at a maximum cost of about $4,800.00; or the minimum refinishing work could be undertaken at a cost of about $1,800.00.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Milly\n13th January, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School, Birtle, Man.\n\nFurther to the above, we have now a report from our Engineer as to the estimated cost of covering the floors of the above school. A summary of the report is given in a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, a copy of which is attached.\n\nIt will appear from this report that there is some doubt as to the extent of area which should be covered ranging from a minimum of 636 square yards to a maximum of 1920.08 square yards. Estimated costs are given for three types of covering - linoleum, asphalt tile, and mastic flooring - estimated costs in each case being,-\n\n| Minimum | Maximum |\n|---------|---------|\n| Linoleum $1,590 | $4,800 |\n| Asphalt Tile 1,620 | 4,895 |\n| Mastic Flooring 1,080 | 3,255 |\n\nIn view of these figures it would appear that Mr. Doig's estimate of $5,500 is high even for the maximum requirement of floor space to be covered. Before any definite statement can be made, however, it would be necessary to know the exact amount of flooring on which Mr. Doig's estimate is based. You can probably obtain this figure from your agent.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE   | ARTICLES                  | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|--------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| Dec 14 | 56 ft 1\" pipe, 5 tees, 8 elbows, 3 nipples, 4 unions, 6 couplings, 2 globe valves |               |              | 26.80   |\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should appreciate it if you would wire Mr. Atkinson and have him make an inspection of the pipe at the Birtle school, just as soon as he can conveniently do so.\n\nActing Director.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the leak in the water main in the Birtle Residential School, Mr. J.T. Rose of the Water Power Bureau, Surveys and Engineering Branch, has investigated the matter and in due course you will have his report on same. Mr. Rose found the iron pipe pitted, and will recommend the replacement of same with a more durable pipe.\n\nIf this should be done by day labour I request that Indian labour be given the preference, though white labour will also have to be employed, as the work would require to be done in good time for the re-opening of the school after the summer vacation, and there will not be sufficient Indian labour available.\n\nIt would also be necessary to employ a competent foreman who is quite familiar with laying pipe.\n\nI request an accountable advance of $34.50 in order to complete payment of the work done to date, and on receipt a credit voucher will be forwarded.\n\nThe work of excavating was considerably hampered by water leaking as the school tank was filling each evening. Mr. Rose recommends that the trenches be pumped out in about a week's time, in order to allow it to dry up for better digging. I would request that further advance of $10.00 be forwarded for this work. Meanwhile, the pipe line is shut off at the C.P.R. tank, and the school engineer has arranged for the water to be supplied by tanks. The excavations made, except for possible caving in, are all to the good, and care has been taken to safeguard the holes.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nWinnipeg, June 29, 1939.\n\nMemorandum Re - Birtle Indian School Water Supply Line.\n\nGeneral Description.\n\nA gravity water supply line was laid from Birtle C.P.R. station water tank to the Birtle Residential School in October, 1930. The line was of 2\u00bd inch pipes and totalled nearly 1,400 feet in length and was placed in a trench at an average depth of about ten feet. As there was much cinder fill in the station yard under which the pipe had to be laid 500 feet of the pipe leading away from the tank was supplied in galvanized iron specially wrapped with treated paper. The remaining 1,100 feet was wrought iron wrapped pipe, laid through brush covered and open field.\n\nIt might be noted that a 1\u00bd inch wrought iron pressure line laid for a distance of about 600 feet between the school and barns had to be replaced after six years' use. This pipe was badly pitted on the underside, particularly, with some deterioration along the top. No pitting appeared to affect the seam of the pipe or the inside, particularly.\n\nLeakage Repairs.\n\nThis spring unusual flooding was noticed in the bush adjacent to the line at a distance of about 150 to 300 feet from the school. In May the metered water supply leaving the C.P.R. tank was noted to be much higher than for the previous year, being 53,610 cubic feet, as compared to 37,530 cubic feet for the previous year. Welling up of water occurred at a spot about 150 feet from the school and overflow into the bush went on when the C.P.R. tank was full and pressure had built up in the line by the gravity pressure of nearly 30 feet of water. It was thought the welling up might indicate a point where repairs could be effected, so in the middle of June digging was done and two definite leaks in one 20 foot length 135 to 135 feet from the school were located and temporarily repaired. However, flow of water coming out either the pipe at either end of the sections excavated indicated further leakage. Each section uncovered was badly pitted all along the bottom of the pipe. Holes were difficult to find as there was no pressure in the line when the supply was shut off to facilitate excavation each day work was carried on. However, in one length two leaks were found 3 feet apart, one about 1/16\" by 3/4\" and another 1/16\" in diameter, while a third in the same 20 foot length was shown later by pressure. Other sections, totalling 90 feet of trench, were opened up and further leakage was indicated and pipe was found to be rough and pitted in representative lengths extending for a distance of 350 feet from the school.\n\nPersonal Inspection.\n\nThe writer visited the work on the 27th of June. It was noted with the gravity line and school tank full and closed the full gravity pressure from the C.P.R. tank caused an apparent metered leakage of nearly one cubic...\nfoot per minute. This would account for a charge of about $22.50 per month on leakage alone, which might be expected to soon increase to equal the ordinary charges.\n\nOn the 28th pumping and excavation was done so that the pipe was bared and the clay cleared from below for a length of 30 feet. Beside the two repaired sections the whole length of a 20 foot pipe was found to be pitted underneath, one place when measured with calipers was shown to be 1/8\" deep. In an adjoining pipe length of ten feet there were indentations or pitting on the top of the pipe, with marks as if an attempt had been made to make nail holes. This pipe was also rough and a hole measuring 1/8\" in depth was found. Other lengths had formerly been examined and found pitted.\n\nConclusions.\n\nIt is considered that the whole of the wrought iron section requires replacement by a type of pipe more resistant to the deteriorating action of soil occurring in the district. Transite (Asbestos-Cement) pipe is recommended.\n\nIt is believed the galvanized specially wrapped pipe laid for a distance of 300 feet from the tank will prove resistant for some years, as a section of this examined along the line in the station yard showed little, if any, deterioration. A length of 7\u00bd feet of pipe was uncovered on the 28th and personally examined by the writer. The wrapping appeared to be intact and while water was found to be running around the pipe, probably from tank overflow, the pipe surface showed very little evidence of rust, and only one or two slightly rough places could be detected on the under side, and there was no pitting such as was so noticeable on the wrought iron pipe.\n\nExcavation on this line varies greatly from fine sand and cinders at the station to heavy clay and layers of boulders. Of course it may not be necessary to use picks on any of the old trench in redigging; but all the line is deeply buried, mostly over 8\u00bd feet.\n\nEstimates of Cost.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of replacement of the section of the pipe line as outlined above would be as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1,100 feet of 2\u00bd\" Transite, asbestos-Cement, Class 50 pipe @ 43\u00a2 per foot F.O.B.

Rose.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Water Supply Line, Birtle Indian Residential School, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 23rd ultimo to which was attached correspondence you had received from the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch regarding the above, I beg to advise that I am attaching copy of a report prepared by Mr. Rose of Mr. Gow's office at Winnipeg.\n\nFrom Mr. Rose's report, it will be noted that with the exception of some 300 feet of the pipeline between the C.P.R. water tank and the school, he recommends that the remaining 1,100 feet should be replaced with some type of pipe more resistant to the deteriorating action of soil occurring in the district, and suggests that 4 inch Transite (Asbestos-Cement) Class 50 pipe would be satisfactory. Mr. Rose's estimated cost for material and labour renewing 1,100 feet of pipe in question is $1,600.00.\n\nFrom the attached report, it is certain that there is a major loss of water occurring in the pipe at present, and that this loss can only increase as the pipe further deteriorates. While not so stated in any information we have on this matter, it is probable that as this water is being taken from a railway tank, the C.P.R. Company may be said to be liable, but it is on information of charges made that Mr. Rose bases his statement in his report that the loss checked by him would amount to a charge of $22.50 per month. As a matter of economy, it would therefore appear essential that this repair work be undertaken. There is also of course the factor of reduced water supply and pressure at the outlet. It is, therefore, recommended that if Indian Affairs Branch have the funds available that repairs to this system should be undertaken along the lines of Mr. Rose's report.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

Rose of our Winnipeg office, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, together with a covering memorandum from the Chief Engineer.\n\nFrom Mr. Rose's examination it appears that it will be necessary to replace all except the 300 feet of galvanized pipe as the other, by the action of the ground, appears to be in very bad shape. It is noted that the cost of replacing the remaining 1,100 feet of pipe of material more likely to withstand the action of the soil is estimated at $1,600.\n\nThis information is forwarded for your consideration. In view of the fact that there is apparently a loss by leakage which would cost $22.50 per month, it would appear that the line should be replaced as early as possible.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJuly 18, 1939.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo and previous correspondence in regard to the water main at the Birtle residential school the Surveys & Engineering Branch have recently submitted a report estimating the expenditure required at $1600.00.\n\nOf this amount $1100.00 is stated to be required for excavation, laying and refilling.\n\nPlease let me know at once if Indians will be available to do this work or if it will be necessary to employ white men.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

I understand, however, that a certain amount of delay took place in the transfer of the funds necessary to complete this project. These funds have now been transferred and there is no reason why the work should not be undertaken at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. G. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\nBirtle Manitoba\n15th August 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr D.B.Gow, Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Surveys and Engineering Branch, Winnipeg, regarding the repairs to the water main at the Birtle Residential School.\n\nFrom your letter of July 28th, I understood that you were transferring $1600.00 to the Surveys and Engineering Branch to be disbursed by them on the work to be undertaken. According to Mr Gow, the money is to be transferred back to the Indian Affairs Branch, Birtle Agency, to be disbursed from here.\n\nWe will be very busy threshing about that time and will not be able to give this work supervision, so it will be necessary to employ a thoroughly competent foreman, who can lay pipe and also keep the men's time. Mr Ross Brown of Birtle is the only local man available who understands the work.\n\nPlease advise me if I am to proceed to select the personnel as Mr Gow requests.\n\nYou will note that Mr Gow states that the work will not start until August 22nd, which means that it will not be completed until at least two weeks later. The School should open about the 25th of August but it is impossible to care for the pupils until the water main is in order, so that they will have to remain at home on the Reserves until then, as I stated in my letters to you of June 28th and Aug. 5th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\nWe have been authorized from Ottawa to proceed with the placing of a new pipe line to replace the cast iron pipe line now in place between the C.P.R tank and the reservoir at the school.\n\nAn order was placed about ten days ago with Johns-Manville Ltd. for the shipment of the necessary pipe to Birtle. In all probability this pipe will arrive at Birtle early this week and it will be quite in order for you to take delivery of the same.\n\nHowever, there is some slight delay at Ottawa in having the funds necessary for this work transferred from the Indian Affairs Branch to the Engineering and Construction Service, and until such time as the money is made available, it will not be advisable to commence with the excavation work.\n\nAs soon as the money is made available and an engineer is available here, I will have him proceed to Birtle to initiate the work and to transfer to you the funds necessary for the carrying out the job. It is not the intention of this office to maintain a member of the staff on the job, but it is our idea to leave the selection of personnel engaged on the work to you and would also ask that you make arrangements for paying such labour as is hired. The general supervision of the work, however, will be under the direction of this office.\n\nYou will be advised later when our engineer will be at the site. We trust, however, that it will not be later than August 22nd.\n\nSgd. D.B.Gow.\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nOttawa,\nAugust 19, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI am attaching, hereto, for your information and for whatever action you may deem necessary, copy of a letter received by this Branch from Indian Agent A.G. Smith, Birtle, Manitoba, and also copy of a letter received by the Indian Agent from D.B. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Winnipeg.\n\nThe records here indicate that you were authorized to proceed with the installation of the water main at the Birtle Indian residential school in a memorandum dated July 26, 1939, at an estimated cost of $1600.00.\n\nIt is my understanding that there was some delay in the transfer of the funds but that this transfer has now been completed. In my judgment it is of the utmost importance that this project should be undertaken and completed by your Branch. I hesitate, therefore, to issue instructions to the Indian Agent in respect to the selection of personnel as suggested by Mr. Gow. It is just possible that a great deal of the delay might have been avoided if the money necessary for this work had been sent direct to our Indian Agent. In any event it is important that the work should be completed at the earliest possible date. You will note from the last paragraph of Mr. Smith's letter that it will not be possible to re-open this school for class room work until the work is completed. This will mean a re-adjustment in the per capita grants and a substantial financial loss to the Presbyterian Church, the Church responsible for the operation of this school.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nI have your memorandum of August 19th, with enclosures, in regard to the installation of the water main at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nApparently, Mr. Gow has been very busy in connection with his work on the Winnipeg River flood claims committee and his own staff has been correspondingly rushed. It was not our intention, however, that he should pass on any of his responsibility in the undertaking of this work to Indian Agent Smith. Consequently, Mr. Gow was wired on the 22nd instant that all the details of the work were to be handled by his engineer, including the payment of men, etc.\n\nWhen funds are transferred to this Branch, our usual policy is to assume full responsibility for all phases of the work.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle River Indian Residential School, Man.\n\nIn a report from Mr. Gow on the above we are advised that with the exception of some 280 feet of the pipeline from the Canadian Pacific Railway water tank towards the school which was galvanized iron pipe, the remaining 1,100 feet have been replaced.\n\nIn removing the old pipe it was found to be badly corroded outside and tuberculated inside all along the line, deep pitting being most extensive along the bottom.\n\nNinety-seven feet of Transite Pipe in 10-foot lengths and couplings have been stored inside to be available for any repair work and a quantity of discarded pipe piled on the school property.\n\nWe are asking Mr. Gow for a statement of costs and when this is received a copy will be forwarded to you.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 21, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of November 17 in connection with the replacement of the pipeline from the Canadian Pacific Railway water tank to the Birtle school.\n\nI note that you will later forward a statement of the cost of the work done.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle River Indian Residential School, Manitoba, water supply.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of the 17th instant, Mr. Gow has reported the following costs in connection with laying new pipe for the above water supply:\n\nLabour ................ $748.99\nMaterials (including Transite Pipe) $562.09\n$1,311.08\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 29, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School Water Supply\n\nI have your memorandum of November 21 in which you state that the cost in connection with the above was $1311.08. As an amount of $1600.00 was transferred to you for the above purpose you have a balance on hand of $288.92. I should appreciate your transferring this amount to this Branch as it can be used for repairs and improvements at other schools.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School water supply system.\n\nWith further reference to the above, the Chief Engineer advises that in addition to the $1,311.08 reported as the costs for labour and materials, there is a sum of $53.55 chargeable to this item to cover motor mileage of 1,071 at 5 cents per mile. There is consequently an unexpended balance of $235.37. Our Treasury Officer is being asked to arrange for the transfer of this amount to your Branch.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 13, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School water supply system\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of December 9 in which you advise that an unexpended balance of $335.37 in connection with the above is being returned to this Branch.\n\nDirector.\nApril 24th, 1940\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nThere are some requests for the Schools which we feel should be granted, and we hope that there will be something done very soon.\n\nFirst, at Birtle, Mrs. Lockhart has asked for twenty-seven new beds and mattresses for the Senior girls' dormitories. I know that these are badly needed because when I was in Birtle in October many of the children had no mattresses and were sleeping on pads.\n\nWe are going to try to get the grounds at Birtle fixed up this year and hope to improve the outside appearance.\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey was in Toronto recently, we spoke of the condition of the floors in both schools, and we hope that you will be able to devise some means of improving this. With regard to the Cecilia Jeffrey School, as we are expecting to have a new principal go in, we would very much appreciate your consideration of allowing us something to fix up the building. It certainly needs paint very badly. With regard to the stove at Cecilia Jeffrey, I understand that it is not in very satisfactory condition.

I have been informed verbally by a Departmental Official that it was not required, as a sufficient sum was provided to look after the needs of all schools for equipment and ordinary repairs annually.\n\nPlease advise me if school requirements for Residential Schools should be provided for in the Agency Estimates.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nBirtle Manitoba\nMay 2nd 1940\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.106-1-5 of the 26th of April, regarding a request for new beds for the Birtle Indian Residential School, I beg to state that this matter was not brought to my attention, and I thought the beds at the school were in fair condition.\n\nThis morning I visited the school and looked over the beds. Some of the springs and mattresses are in poor condition, and some beds are rather unsightly having rods missing. The Matron requests that new beds be supplied for one dormitory, and that the old ones be used for replacing poor beds in the other dormitories. If the Department have funds available 27 new beds for the senior girls dormitory would certainly be an improvement to that dormitory, but if funds are not available twelve new beds would be satisfactory at the present time. The beds in use at present are 27 inches wide and 72 inches long. Springs and mattresses will be necessary for all the new beds supplied.\n\nIf new beds are supplied I request that some of the old ones be turned over to me for distribution to old and sick Indians on the Reserves.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

When these are received you can arrange to have some of the old ones turned over to you for distribution to old and sick Indians on the Reserve.\n\nIn view of the fact that we are supplying the beds our funds will not permit ordering the paint that would be necessary for painting the barns.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The playroom walls are plastered with grey cement. I suggested these walls be whitewashed with lime or some suitable preparation. This would tend to destroy any germs and would greatly brighten the rooms. On the boys' side these rooms were also clean but the playroom walls needed some repair.

The equipment appears in good condition. Some repair is needed on the outlet provided for taking the ashes from the furnace room. The cordwood has been thrown in at this opening, which is in front of the furnace, instead of dropping it into the fuel room proper. To repair this outlet will require six or eight bags of cement and considerable labour. The repair work should be done this summer and in the future, this outlet should only be used for taking out the ashes. The hoist for lifting the ashes is located in this opening, and sooner or later it will be destroyed if they continue to throw the cordwood in against it. The wood should be put in through the fuel room.\n\nThe barns and outbuildings are in good repair but badly in need of painting. Mr. Lockhart stated he had a considerable amount of money to the credit of his school in Toronto. If such is the case, I think some should be used to paint the two main barns. Mr. Lockhart has had no big crops so apparently this accumulation is from the school grant. Other principals do repair work and I see no reason why Mr. Lockhart can not do some too.\nOttawa,\nJune 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReporting on his inspection of the Birtle Residential School on the 14th instant Inspector Hamilton writes as follows:\n\n\"The playroom and washroom on the girls' side was clean and all plumbing in good condition.

About ten days ago I was up there and although the Chlorinator seemed to be working, I could not taste the chloride in the water. I requested Dr. Edwards, the Medical Officer to send a sample of water to the Provincial Board of Health to be tested. Dr Edwards did this and the water contained Colon Bacilli. Dr Edwards immediately sent for a supply of Anti Typhoid serum to treat all the pupils, and this will be done as soon as the serum arrives.\n\nI went up to the School yesterday and found that the chlorinator was not working at all, and in all probability the pupils and staff have been drinking river water for two weeks which has not been chlorinated. Mr Lockhart, the Principal telephoned to Wallace and Tierman, Winnipeg, requesting them to send up a service man immediately, but they were unable to do so for some days; this firm supplied the chlorinator. As no other man was to be had who understood the plant, I took Mr Dunn, the last engineer, to the School today and had him put the chlorinator in working order, and also adjust other parts of the plant, such as the air compressor, water pump, filter, etc. The Kelvinator is not working but as the Compressor is out of order, Mr Dunn could not repair same. I paid Mr Dunn $5.00 for this work and will send in a voucher for a refund. Owing to some disagreement with the Principal Mr Dunn did not wish to work for the School again.\n\nMr Beaton the present engineer is leaving in a month and a new man is to take over. Very few engineers understand a plant similar to the one at the school, as chlorinators are not at all common, and though an engineer is quite competent to look after the steam plant, he might do a lot of damage to other parts. A new man should be instructed in such things, before he takes complete charge, or serious damage might take place.\nMany changes take place in the staff at this school, though Mr Dunn the late engineer, was there for eight years, and was the oldest member of the staff. If they are to change engineers as often as other members of the staff change, it will be very unsatisfactory.\n\nYours truly\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 5, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you refer to certain repairs that were necessary to the chlorinating plant at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is to this Branch a matter of regret to learn that a change of engineers has been found necessary at this school. I am anxious that you should discuss this matter very fully and very frankly with the Principal. The Birtle School is a comparatively modern plant with up-to-date equipment. In view of this fact and in view of the departmental investment in the school, the Principal is expected to employ men with qualifications necessary to keep the machinery installed functioning economically and effectively. In view of the critical times in which we are living, the Government has not at its disposal the funds required to undertake or carry out repairs that may be necessary owing to the inexperience or neglect of the employees engaged at residential schools throughout the Dominion. It might be well if the Principal discussed with you the qualifications of the applicants before a definite decision is reached with respect to Mr. Beston's successor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn May 30, 1940, we forwarded to you a copy of purchase order No. 2208 for beds, springs and mattresses ordered from the Parkhill Bedding Company, Winnipeg, for the Birtle Residential School.\n\nAt the time the order was placed the firm was directed to send the account to you.

A. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, in connection with an invoice of ours of June 6th, 1940, advising us that the account was certified by the Principal of the Birtle Residential School, but that there was an item of $21.44 freight charges, and asking us to forward a receipt from the Railway Company to cover this amount.\n\nIt seems unusual that an invoice of June 6th, 1940, should be just referred to us on February 28th, 1941, a matter of nine months afterwards.\n\nIn response to your letter, and under date of March 6th, we wrote enclosing the original receipted expense bill to cover the freight charges. In addition, five copies of the invoice were forwarded to E. H.

The Company will have to send a man to repair same, as there is no local man available who can do this work. I do not know what repairs are required, but think it will cost between $100.00 and $150.00 to put it in good order.\n\nTwo new toilet bowls are required, and eight wooden toilet seats. These replacements have always been supplied by the School, but the Principal would like the Department to assume the cost this time.\n\nI would like to be advised what repairs the Department have to assume responsibility for in the School buildings and plant, and what repairs the School have to do at their own expense.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

In view of the fact that we only have an Acting Principal there at the present time it is expected that you will give personal attention to this repair in order to keep the cost as much below $150.00 as is possible.\n\nYou may also purchase 2 new toilet bowls at a total cost of $40.00.\n\nThe expenditures authorized in this letter for repairs and improvements at the Birtle School, plus the expenditures already made at this school during the current fiscal year, exhaust the amount provided in the current year's appropriation and it will not be possible to consider any further amount for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment between now and the end of March.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I have a quotation from the local plumber, Mr. Ross Brown, on this work which is as follows:\n\n- 20 ft. of 3\" pipe, 9 nipples, 6 elbows, tees, and cutting and threading $53.00\n- Labour taking down and installing $18.00\n- Total $71.00\n\nThis quotation just covers any visible breakdown, and it is quite possible that other replacements may be necessary when the pipes are taken down and examined.\n\nAt the outlet of the septic tank, the soil pipe has also broken down, and is quite useless. Mr. Brown's quotation on this work is as follows:\n\n- 15 feet of soil pipe, elbows, lead and oakum $18.00, labour installing $6.50, Total $24.50.\n\nThis work should be done immediately, when the children are on vacation, and it is possible that it may take some time to obtain the necessary pipe.\n\nWill you please advise me as soon as possible regarding authority to proceed with this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

Repair flow pipes between the two boilers - material and labour ---------------- $68.00\n\n2. Repair soil pipe at the outlet of the septic tank - material and labour ------- 24.50\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs requested, I have again inspected the Birtle School and submit the following short report in connection with the school and the Acting Principal, Mr. Candy.\n\nMr. Candy advised me he had resigned and expected to leave the school not later than July 31st. I would, however, point out certain improvements since my last visit.\n\nThe pupils are more content and appear much happier. The staff has been improved by a new cook, a senior male teacher and a boys' supervisor. The new staff members appear well qualified to do their work and the school discipline has greatly improved.\n\nThe frigidaire was not operating. A service man had been to the school twice and made certain repairs but the plant only operated a short time and then stopped. I have made enquiries here concerning the condition of this equipment and the possible cost of putting it in working order. This information when received will be forwarded, and I am hopeful the present unit can be repaired and made ready for use.\n\nThe man-hole on the filer broke loose due to the rusting of the rim over which the cover sits. Mr. Candy expected the necessary repairs could be made by the local blacksmith. The repair would necessitate the welding on of a new rim.\n\nRepair work is also needed on the boiler and the local tinsmith and plumber, Mr. Brown, has been requested to submit an estimate on the possible cost of repair parts and the cost of labor.\n\nThe old classroom building is now used as a duplex house to accommodate two married members of the staff. The building is very cold in winter and I would recommend that the ceiling be insulated and the walls covered with heavy paper and stuccoed. This would then give comfortable accommodation for two families and the building certainly justifies this extra expense.\n\nThe farm work is well along and the crop looks good; but the garden was weedy. Excessive rains made it difficult to get on the land and the weeds got a real start.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 6)\nThe carragana and shrubs supplied by Mr. Leslie from the Morden Experimental Farm are doing well and should in time improve the surroundings.\n\nIn closing I would simply add that Mr. Candy has made some improvements, yet in spite of this I think he used splendid judgment in submitting his resignation as acting principal. He is a fine young man but in my opinion he is lacking in experience for this type of work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nJuly 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on a recent inspection of the Birtle Residential School Inspector Hamilton writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"The frigidaire was not operating.

Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nFor your information I may say that an amount of $400.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Birtle Residential School. We have already expended $207.50; namely, $115.00 for the water chlorinator and $92.50 authorized in official letter of July 8. This leaves a balance of $192.50 available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy of letter from Marshall-Wells Co., Ltd., Winnipeg to A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Manitoba.\n\n\"July 20, 1942\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of a letter from the Ace Service Station, Brandon, authorized Kelvinator Service Agency, also from Refrigeration and Appliance Service Co. Kelvinator Service Agency in Winnipeg.\n\nThe approximate price for replacement of present equipment at Birtle with the new Kelvinator equipment would be $500.00, which includes the removal of the present equipment.\n\nSgd. R.A. Browse,\nCommercial Refrigeration Dept.\n\nCopy of letter from Refrigeration and Appliance Service Co. to Marshall-Wells Co.\n\n\"July 3, 1942\n\nRe the trouble you are having with this equipment, I understand from the report of the Service man at Brandon, the trouble is due to dirt and sludge in system. I am familiar with this equipment, having serviced it some years ago and even at that time the system was dirty.\n\nThe remedy for this trouble would be to have the local man take out all coils and condensing units and ship them in to us when we will overhaul, clean out and dehydrate all float valves, coils and unit and recharge with fresh gas and oil. When this goes back it should be hooked up with new tubing.\n\nThe cost of doing the work we would have to do after the equipment is shipped in to us, would run approx. $100.00. Under the circumstances, not having seen the job recently, it would be impossible to tender a definite figure.\n\nSgd. Frank Chance Manager.\"\nJune 30, 1942\n\nRe your letter of the 29th regarding the Indian School at Birtle.\n\nI told Mr. Candy we would not guarantee the job as I knew the history of the unit, as follows:\n\nThis machine has been patched up and had everyone working on it and is still not in good shape. The trouble at present is plugging up with sludge. This spring I overhauled compressor which we had to make two trips, as it developed a leak at a coil a few days after I had repaired the compressor, and the trip up there in itself costs considerable. At the same time I put on a larger dryer on the suction line and a filter on liquid line as sludge is caused by air or moisture.\n\nOn the last trip the 1\" line had plugged from radiator to receiver, also changed small line filter. Once sludge gets in a unit you just have to work it out by dryers and filters unless you have the receiver cut apart and then you are not sure of your coils and lines etc,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. F.G. Collins.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n23rd July, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Dept. letter No. 106-1-5, 15th July.\nInspector's report, Birtle Ind. School.\n\nI have for reply and comment Department letter No. 106-1-5, dated 15th July, regarding various repairs and improvements to Birtle Residential School.\n\nFrigidaire. I am enclosing letters from Marshall-Wells' service men giving their opinion of the trouble. You will note that the price of a new unit would be $500.00. The quotation given for the repair of the unit is only approximate, and the ultimate cost would, in my opinion, considerably exceed the figure quoted, and would be without any guarantee of satisfaction.\n\nI would recommend that a new unit be installed.\n\nFilter. The manhole had been fastened to the filter by a \"skin weld\". The blacksmith assures me that the manhole is now fused to the filter and is better than it ever was.\n\nPlumbing. The local plumber informs me that the material is now at hand for the repairs contemplated.

I have obtained a rough estimate of the cost of making improvements to the old school classroom, with the view of rendering it more comfortable to the two families occupying it. The material required\u2014stucco wire cement, heavy paper, insulating wool and its installation, sand etc.\u2014would approximate $275.00 and labour $100.00.\n\nGeneral. It is noted that $400.00 had been appropriated for repairs and improvements at the school, and that the sum of $192.50 was still available. Repairs to Kelvinator amount $42.90 were sent to Ottawa per Agency voucher No. 55, presumably reducing the balance still further. I was informed by the Winnipeg office that the Department would consider the construction of a root cellar, the material to cost approximately $150.00. It has also been suggested that the driveway from the school to the highway be gravelled, and that the Department would consider an expenditure of approximately $75.00 on this project. I should be pleased to be advised whether the Department wishes either or both of these projects to be paid for out of current appropriation, or placed on the estimates for next fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.G.

A similar request was received from another residential school recently and officials in the Minister's office expressed the opinion that such purchases should not be made at the present time.\n\nIt is noted that the filter has been repaired. It is expected that you will keep the cost of the plumbing as low as possible.\n\nIt is difficult for us to decide which of the other expenditures mentioned in your letter is most necessary. However, I am inclined to feel that possibly the repairs to the cottage should be made this year. We are prepared to consider supplying the material, if the school management will be responsible for the labour. In that event, you should forward to me detailed information regarding the material required so that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The unit will have to be shipped to Winnipeg and will possibly cost more than $100.00 to repair, as they would not quote on the work definitely. The frigidaire is very necessary as soon as the pupils come back from vacation as there is no cellar at the school, and no supply of ice. Will you please authorize this work by telegram, as time is getting short to have the work done?\n\nRegarding the other repairs, the plumbing will cost considerably more than the amount authorized, as other defective pipes are found as the work is done. The plumber will not give an estimate of the total cost, as more damage shows up all the time. I will however keep the cost as low as possible, and see that no unnecessary work is done.\n\nThe garden at the school, and also the potato crop are very poor and I think they can fix up the old root house for another year, and graveling the road to the school can also wait over, though they may be able to do some of it themselves this fall.\n\nI have spoken to the Principal about the School providing the labour for stuccoing the cottage, and he will take the matter up with the Church authorities immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n\nA.G.

If such a requisition had come forward, the Purchasing Branch would have become responsible for the extension of the priority rating, etc. As it is, and with the limited information at our disposal, they naturally hesitated to supply us with the information. The fact that they did so should be kept in mind when Indian Agents or School Principals are making purchases or sending forward such requisitions in the future.\n\nIn view of the fact, however, that the chlorinator should be repaired prior to the opening of the school on September 1, I ultimately succeeded in securing the following information:\n\nPreference Rating P-100-A-10\nSerial No. C A 10661\nAllocation Symbols D P 17.20\n\nIt is only fair to the officials of the Welfare & Training Division to state that we are wholly unfamiliar with these codes and with these priority ratings and we have not at our disposal at this time, nor are we likely to have at our disposal at any time in the future, the staff necessary to take these matters up with other branches of the service.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G.

Mr. Doig informs me that stucco wire is practically unobtainable. In that event I would suggest insulating the walls as well as the ceiling with wood wool, using fire-proof insulation where it comes into contact with the wiring. This would cost considerably less for labour, and somewhat less for material, but it would not preserve the exterior of the cottage as stucco would, though I am confident that it would make it much warmer.\n\nI also request authority to have two hangers made for the new fire-hose supplied to the school this year. The hose is entirely different to the old hose, and the old hangers are of no use. I cannot obtain a price on hangers made for this hose, but can have them made by the local blacksmith, at a cost not exceeding $15.00.\n\nIn addition to the repairs already authorized for the School, a new hot water tank may have to be installed, as the present one sprung a leak yesterday.

Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe water pump at the Birtle Residential School will not lift water when the storage tank water level gets down. The pump was sent to Winnipeg for overhauling and is in good condition. It works well until the water gets down to a certain level, and then starts to pump air, which means that there must be a leak in the pipe leading from the storage tank to the school, or possibly in the storage tank, though I think it will likely be in the pipe line.\n\nWe will have to excavate to find the leak, and may have to go down 15 or 20 feet to find and repair the leak. It is quite possible that the pipe is pitted and it may require new pipe altogether. It is impossible to tell the extent of the damage until the excavating is done.\n\nAs the children are coming back to school now after the vacation this will have to be done immediately, and I have started on the excavation. They cannot get a proper water supply until the work is done.\n\nI therefore request an accountable advance of $25.00 for labour excavating, and authority by wire to have the necessary repairs made in a satisfactory manner incurring as little expense as possible. If a new tank should be required I will of course wire you, as it is a big tank and would be expensive.\n\nThe water seems to have damaged all the piping and tanks at the school, and they all seem to be going at the present time. I am afraid we may have further trouble of the sort before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

This tank sprung a leak a week ago. The leak has been welded, and the tank is in operation again, but I do not think we should start the winter without a new tank, as the old one is badly pitted inside. It is an overhead hot water tank, heated by the tank heater, and if it sprung a leak when any person was under it, they might get badly scalded.\n\nPossibly three quarters of the tank, which is continually under water, is quite good, but I do not think it would be advisable to have the tank shipped to a boiler plant to be rebuilt. It would be quite costly and then we would still have an old tank. Rebuilding such a tank would not be suggested in peace time of course.\n\nI may say that Mr. Gow, the Engineer in charge of the Water Power Bureau, Surveys and Engineering Branch, in Winnipeg, who I think was in charge of putting in the plant in the Birtle School, informed Mr. Webb, the Principal, that both this tank and the pressure tank in the pump room would give trouble any time now, and should both be renewed. I am requesting Inspector Hamilton to include in my estimates for 1943-44, a sum sufficient to install a new pressure tank next year.\n\nI am afraid that the plant at this school will cost a good deal of money to maintain during the next year or two. We have installed a lot of new pipe in the engine room, and thought all the poor pipe had been renewed, but yesterday another pipe sprung a leak and will have to be renewed.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nBirtle Manitoba  \n4th September 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received your letter No.106-1-5 of Aug. 29th regarding the repairs to the piping and plant at the Birtle Residential School, in which you ask me to explain why the water has damaged the piping and tanks.\n\nI am afraid that I cannot explain this in a satisfactory manner, except to state that the chemical action of the hard water and corrosion have pitted the metal.\n\nIn 1935 the pipe line from the school to the barns was partially renewed, and in 1939 the water line from the C.P.R. water tank to the school was renewed. The water pipes in the building seem to be going in the same way and also the tanks, and the outside pipes which have not been replaced. When I am next in Winnipeg I will consult Mr Gow, the engineer in charge of the Dominion Water Power Board, who was in charge of installing the plant at the school, about the present condition of the plant.\n\nTo-day I was at the school looking over the work done excavating at the storage tank. The pipe from the outside storage tank to the pump room will have to be renewed, and I will have the local plumber do this. I also found that the iron pipe leading from the pump room to the barn is quite rotten. One of the men excavating struck it with a shovel, and it went to pieces. This was the line that was partially renewed in 1935. I cannot find out just how much iron pipe was left at that time, but I think it was all renewed with the exception of two or three lengths, one of which we have bared.\n\nThis will require further excavation to get to the end of the old iron pipe, and it will have to be replaced with galvanized pipe. I request a further accountable advance of $100.00 to proceed with this work. It is impossible to estimate the total cost, as I cannot find out accurately how much old pipe was left in this line; but if it is only two or three lengths, as I am told, this sum should cover it. It would be folly to fill in our present excavation without renewing this pipe, as we would likely have to do it over again at an early date.\n\nI will certainly keep the cost as low as possible, as I do not like spending so much money on such repairs at the present time. The account for plumbing will be over $200.00 when the work is finished, and the Kelvinator repairs will likely amount to $175.00. Repairs to the pump and motor done by the Fairbanks Morse Co. will likely be about $75.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

I would appreciate it if you could procure this rating and forward it to Wallace and Tiernan, Winnipeg.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter No.106-1-5,21 the 19th inst requesting a full statement as to why the expenditure on plumbing reached the amount of $169.30, when the sum of $92.50 only was authorized by Mr Phelan in his letter of July 8th 1942.\n\nMr Brown's original quotation was to repair visible damage to flow pipes between the two boilers, material and labour $68.00, and to replace soil pipe from septic tank, material and labour $24.50. This only covered damage which was visible from the outside of pipes, and when the pipes were taken down it was found that the damage was much more extensive, and other pipes and fittings had to be replaced. Three small leaks were also repaired in the steam pipes. This account does not cover replacing the water line from the storage tank to the boiler room, or the water line leading to the barns.\n\nIn my letter of July 4th requesting the authority I stated that Mr Brown's quotation just covered any visible damage, and that it was quite possible that other replacements might be necessary, when the pipes were taken down and examined. In my letter to you of August 5th I advised you that the plumbing would cost considerable more than the amount authorized.\n\nAll the pipes leading out of the Septic tank were completely gone and had to be replaced, in addition to the other damage found in the boiler room.\n\nI trust that this explanation is satisfactory\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

In this connection it would be deeply appreciated by the officials here if supplies such as this were included in a larger list, so that purchase could be made by the Purchasing Division. I make this suggestion for the simple reason that we are being inundated with such requests. We have spent hours today in an attempt to secure a priority rating not only for this mask but for the hot water tank at the Birtle School. The officials here - and there are only two of us at this time directing the Welfare and Training Divisions,- are making a sincere attempt to remain rational, but I am afraid this attempt will prove abortive unless we can secure the active co-operation of our Indian agents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

These accounts will be paid, but I would point out that the total of the accounts already paid for repairs and improvements at this school, plus authorizations given for other expenditures, greatly exceeds the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for this school. Under the circumstances it will be necessary for us to pay part of the accounts from a very small unallotted amount which is included in our appropriation. It will, therefore, be impossible for the Department to consider any further expenditures at this school this year, other than those already authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.G.

He suggested that our Department contact Mr. Evans, of the Steel Controller's Office, and emphasize the need of the tank; otherwise, he fears the request from them will be refused.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) A.G.Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing voucher No.132, amount $48.21, in favour of Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd. Winnipeg, for repairs to the motor that operates the pump at the Residential School.\n\nA severe electric storm resulted in the neighbouring Hydro wires being struck, causing either an overload or an underload of current through the motor. The engineer at the school went to the engine room when he heard the crash and found the motor glowing with heat, severely damaged.\n\nThe Hydro engineer states that the damage might have been much worse, and recommends for safety in the future that a new switch be installed controlling the motor. The description of such a switch is: 3 pole, 3 phase, 220v magnetic starting switch, with overload release for 3 h.p., 3 phase, 220v motor. The cost would be in the neighbourhood of $15.00.\n\nThe repairs were treated as emergent and no authority was obtained from Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, the Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 132. The charge of $47.50 on the Fairbanks-Morse account should be itemized to show the number of hours and the rate per hour, also the cost of the materials used.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

After\nre-installation the pump still did not give full\nservice and it was returned to the Fairbanks company\nfor another checkup. They gave the assurance that\nit was in perfect working order, as it would lift\nwater from a barrel when turned over slowly by hand.\n\nHowever, it still would not work when connected\nwith the water main. Excavation was done exposing the\npipe leading from the school to the reserve tank, in\nhope of finding a leak allowing the pump to suck air\nafter it had lowered the level of the water in the tank.\n\nA small leak was found, and pipe and\nconnection replacements were made, but the pump would\nonly draw a limited amount of water. It was then\ndissembled and the valves found to be badly in need of\ntrueing. This work was done at the local machine\nshop. The Fairbanks Company are allowing a credit\nfor the cost of the repairs done in Birtle.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

I do not think it probable that a hole will blow out in this tank, but it is possible, and as the tank is overhead in the boiler room, it would be a dangerous thing if it did so, as some of the boys working there might get very badly scalded. There is no manhole in the tank, so that a thorough examination of same is impossible from the inside. I would suggest having the Provincial Boiler Inspector examine this tank and subject it to considerable pressure to make sure that it is not dangerous.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter No.196-1-5 of the 7th inst. advising me that you cannot consider any further expenditures for repairs at the Birtle Indian School this year.\n\nThere is an account for plumbing outstanding amounting to $30.95, which will be forwarded at an early date, and I am afraid further expenditures will be necessary in this line before the end of the fiscal year, though if no money is available I suppose the Church will have to bear the cost.\n\nThe compensator of the chlorinator was sent to Winnipeg a few days ago, and was forwarded to Toronto for repairs by Wallace and Tiernan. I informed the Principal however that I would not be responsible for this expenditure, although it is simply wear and tear and no fault of the school staff.\n\nAlso there are other hot water pipes with rubber patches on them where they leak, and the cost of replacing them with new pipe will be approximately $35.00. This work will also have to be done as the pipes are not safe as they are.\n\nThe water line to the stable still has at least one length of old pipe in it, possibly two. The last length which we took out was not in bad shape, and as we could not get further help to excavate we decided to let it go for the present. Some of the pipes were almost eaten through from the outside.\n\nPlease advise me if the necessary hot water pipes can be replaced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa\n| DATE | ARTICLES                        | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|------|--------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n|      | 6 ft. 8 ft.

Subsequently the Steel Controller rejected the request and suggested that this tank should be replaced with a wooden stave tank. For your information I quote from a letter which has just been received from the Indian Agent:\n\n\"As the school tank is for hot water and carries pressure a wooden stave tank would be useless.\n\n\"The present tank is pitted inside, and has developed leaks through pin holes, which are of course welded at once.

Account of $30.95 for plumbing;\n2. Expenditure of $35.00 to repair hot water pipes.\n\nI note that you have advised the school management that they will have to be responsible for the repairs to the chlorinator.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

We have spent about $300.00 on repairs for this refrigerator during the summer months, and it is necessary to get a repair man up from Brandon again, which will likely cost $50.00 or more. The people who have repaired same will not guarantee the job, as they have recommended a new unit, which cannot be obtained at present.\n\nPlease advise me if the Presbyterian Church will have to bear the cost of the present repairs, as you advised me that the Department have no more funds available for repairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

However, it was noted that the thickness of the shell was to be reduced to 1/4\" and the heads to 5/16\". The application form with the above changes in weight was made on the approval of Mr. Vincent of the Welfare & Training Department of Indian Agencies, and therefore, will reduce the price from $577.00 to $552.00.\n\nA drawing of the tank is being issued to our shops for construction and the work will be proceeded with and completed as promptly as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED\n\nPer:\n\"E.

Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n10th December, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI understand from a remark passed by Mr. Yates, of the Brandon firm of plumbers, Yates, Neale & Co., who installed the new hot water tank at the Birtle Residential School recently, that a similar tank at Brandon Residential School has been extensively repaired and in the near future might have to be replaced by a new one. Mr. Yates states that over fifty holes have been welded in the Brandon tank, and that this work was possible only because there was a manhole, enabling the welder to work from the inside. (Neither the old nor the new tank at Birtle is fitted with a manhole.)\n\nMr. Yates estimates that if one-third of the old tank from the Birtle School was covered with second hand plate, and a manhole installed, the tank would be tight. The cost would be in the neighbourhood of $200.00 which would include transportation charges to Brandon for the necessary repairs. Shipping charges from Brandon to destination would have to be assumed by the Department.\n\nThe above is passed to you for information and guidance.\n\nA.G.

I am not exactly clear from this letter for what it is intended to use the old tank, even if it is repaired.

Subsequently the Steel Controller rejected the request and suggested that this tank should be replaced with a wooden stave tank. For your information I quote from a letter which has just been received from the Indian Agent:\n\n\"As the school tank is for hot water and carries pressure a wooden stave tank would be useless.\n\n\"The present tank is pitted inside, and has developed leaks through pin holes, which are of course welded at once. I do not think it probable that a hole will blow out in this tank, but it is possible, and as the tank is overhead in the boiler room, it would be a dangerous thing if it did so, as some of the boys working there might get very badly scalded. There is no manhole in the tank, so that a thorough examination of same is impossible, from the inside.\"\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\n\nI have your letter together with the enclosure from Mr. Smith, re the old hot water tank at Birtle, file 106-1-5.\n\nMr. Smith merely wrote this letter because of the information he received from Mr. Yates, of Brandon, re the pressure tank at the Brandon School. He felt that if a tank was needed and in view of the shortage of steel, the old one from Birtle might be repaired and would perhaps last for the \"duration\".\n\nThe Principal of the Brandon School was in yesterday and stated that the pressure tank at his school has been repaired several times but at present is all right. He hopes it will last until after the War.\n\nIn view of the information given by Mr. Chapin, I do not think any expense should be incurred at present to repair the old tank. If at a later date a tank is required, the matter can be given further consideration.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1942.\n\nEX'D\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, suggesting that the old hot water tank at the Birtle School be repaired at a cost of approximately $200.00, we wrote to Inspector Hamilton. He advises us that the Principal of the Brandon School hopes their present pressure tank will last for the duration of the war. Under the circumstances Mr. Hamilton does not consider it necessary to incur any expense at the present time to repair the old tank at the Birtle School. However, this tank should be stored in a safe place and repairs can be made later if necessary.\n\nR.A.

The water meter in the C.P.R. tank is out of order and had either to be replaced or repaired, and the Company state that the school are responsible for the cost of the meter, which seems unreasonable.\n\nI have looked through the Agency files, but cannot find a copy of any agreement made by the Department with the C.P.R. about supplying the school with water. An agreement would likely be made in 1931 when the new school was built.\n\nThe water supply has been very unsatisfactory lately.\n\nIf there is an agreement regarding this water supply with the C.P.R., I would like to have a copy of same. The C.P.R. tank is in operation all the time and the only additional cost to them in supplying water to the school is the extra gas and oil used in pumping, and the school pay them about $60.00 per month.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nExtract from memorandum of Mr. R.G. Orr, Departmental Architect, addressed to Dr. Scott and approved by him on September 4, 1930.\n\nWith reference to the water supply system for the building it has been recommended that the Department utilize the pumping plant of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. Mr. Gow has been in communication with the Railway authorities and advises that they are prepared to supply the school with water at the rate of 25\u00a2 per thousand gallons, the Department to provide all piping, etc., to connect up with their water tanks. As the consumption of water in the school will be approximately 5000 gallons, this will make the daily cost $1.25, which will be more economical than any system of pumping the Department could install. I beg to recommend that Mr. Gow be authorized to proceed with the plans for the installation of the pipe lines and connections to the C.P.R. water tanks. This will be submitted to the Department at a later date with an estimate of the cost.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 12, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the Department has been unable to locate any trace indicating who paid for the water meter at the C.P.R. water tank. You might let me know what it would cost to either repair the present meter or to replace it. Under present conditions would it be possible to secure a new meter?\n\nI have noted your statement that the water supply recently has been unsatisfactory. I should appreciate your stating more definitely exactly what you mean by that statement.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBirtle Manitoba\n18th January 1943\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th inst. regarding the water meter and water supply at the Birtle Indian School, I have to inform you that I have advised the C.P.R. that we consider that they should install a new meter free of charge, as they are selling the water to the school. They have advised me that the old meter is beyond repair, and at present they are using one which is borrowed from the city of Brandon. I am also making enquiries regarding the cost of a new meter in case we have to purchase one.\n\nRegarding my statement that the water supply has not been satisfactory recently. Traffic on the railway has been heavy and freight engines use more water, with the result that the C.P.R. tank is low every morning, and the school reserve tank is often almost empty before the C.P.R. tank is again pumped up. This condition has improved however as the pump man gets busy earlier in the morning since he found that the School were complaining to the C.P.R. about the supply.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nBirtle Manitoba\n26th January 1943\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter of the 12th inst. No. 106-1-5 regarding the water meter used to gauge the water supplied by the C.P.R. to the Birtle Residential School.\n\nI am advised by the C.P.R. at Brandon that this meter was taken to the City of Brandon meter repair man, who advised that it could not be repaired. The C.P.R. have now forwarded the meter to their stores Department Winnipeg, with the request that it be repaired and returned. If it cannot be repaired it will be necessary to secure a new one as the City of Brandon is pressing for the return of the meter which they loaned to the C.P.R. for use at Birtle.\n\nThe C.P.R. also advise me that the agreement between them and the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service reads that the meter would be installed by the Government, and the Government would absorb total cost of any change to make connection. The cost of a new meter is approximately $40.00.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 30, 1943.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, you may arrange for the purchase of the water meter used to gauge the water supplied by the C.P.R. to the Birtle Residential School. It is noted that the cost of this meter will be approximately $40.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBirtle Manitoba\n28th January 1943\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of\nthe 26th inst regarding the water meter used to\nmeasure the water supplied by the C.P.R. to the Birtle\nResidential School.\n\nI am advised by Mr D.B.Gow, District\nChief Engineer, of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau,\nWinnipeg, that the C.P.R. were paid $140.42 for connecting\nthe school water supply to their system. Of this\ntotal cost the cost of the meter was $34.88. Mr Gow\nstates that no arrangements were made with reference\nto the replacement of the meter or any part of the\nwater connection. Mr Gow considers that if the railroad\nis willing to maintain the pipes and connections, that\nthe cost of the meter would be a legitimate charge\nagainst the Indian Affairs Branch or the school.\n\nA.G.

They have no warning until the bigger boys who come up from the 2nd floor where their dormitory is located, and through the 3rd floor little boys dormitory to the fire escape, arrive. Because they have no warning until the big boys arrive, the little boys become quite frightened at the sudden insurge and the little boys Matron has a difficult task getting them out.\n\nNight drills from the dormitories take far longer than they should because of the fear of the pupils of the dark fire escape. Often a little girl or a little boy gets so frightened that he or she is afraid to take a step and there is danger that those behind may pile up and a dangerous situation result.\n\nA fire bell, two flood lights for the escapes, necessary connecting material, and labour can be procured for $35.00.\n\nYours truly\n\nSigned: R. Webb\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr. R. Webb, the principal of the Birtle Indian School, concerning the need of an electric fire bell in the small boys dormitory at the school and also flood lights for the fire escapes.\n\nI have looked into the matter and agree with Mr. Webb that these facilities should be provided.\n\nMr. Walker is the only man in Birtle who does electric wiring, and he will provide both material and labour for $35.00.\n\nIf the Department approve of providing these safeguards, Mr. Walker will require a priority rating to get one A.C.

This is a long pipe-line and we cannot locate the stoppage. I think the only way to do so will be to excavate until one length of pipe is bared, and then have a 1-inch rod run through until the stoppage is found. The pipe may have burst where frozen and it is impossible to estimate the cost. If it is the Department's desire to repair this line, and they have to have water at the barns, I request an accountable advance of $200.00 to proceed with this work. Labour is very scarce, and any available men will have to be used to excavate, rods will be borrowed to find the break, but it is quite probable that they will have to be welded together until the break is found.

Work has been done on the pipe line which carries water from the school to the barn and the break has been found. The pipe line was frozen in several places which is not to be wondered as in places it is only six feet below the ground level, and in some spots the frost had penetrated to 7\u00bd feet.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nBirtle, Manitoba,\n30th, Sept. 1943\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing voucher No.132 amount $48.21, in favour of Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd Winnipeg for repairs to the motor that operates the pump at the Residential School.\n\nA severe electric storm resulted in the neighbouring Hydro wires being struck, causing either an overload or an underload of current through the motor. The engineer at the School went to the engine room when he heard the crash and found the motor glowing with heat, severely damaged.\n\nThe Hydro engineer states that the damage might have been much worse, and recommends for safety in future that a new switch be installed controlling the motor. The description of such a switch is, 3 pole, 3 phase, 220v magnetic starting switch, with overload release for 3 h.p., 3 phase, 220v motor. The cost would be in the neighbourhood of $15.00.\n\nThe repairs were treated as emergent and no authority was obtained from Department.\n\nA.G. Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of Agency letter 24-1-3249, dated 30th Sept. 1942, attached originally to a voucher for repairs to the motor operating the water pump at the Residential School.\n\nLetter contains a recommendation from the Hydro engineer for the installation of a new switch, therein described. No formal application for the purchase was made and possibly because of that, Department made no comment.\n\nHowever, during an electric storm last week, the system was again struck by lightning, fortunately, to a lesser degree. The motor absorbed part of the charge, was smoking and not quite red hot, when a nearby attendant pulled the switch. Damage must have resulted although it is not apparent, as the motor continues to function. It should be noted that the estimated cost of the suggested protective switch is $15.00, and if such can be procured, I recommend that it be installed.\n\nA.G.

Presumably it covers the transportation of pillows from No. 7 Equipment Depot to the Birtle Residential School. In the first place Indian Agent Smith should not have issued a warrant. In the second place it is felt that, in view of the fact that the Birtle School obtained a large number of pillows which would not ordinarily be supplied by the Department, the least they could do was pay the transportation. If, however, a definite promise was made by you that the Department would pay the transportation, we are prepared to do so, but, in that event, Mr. Smith should have issued a voucher and given us some information.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Birtle Residential School\n\nVOTE 74 ALLOTMENT 09 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS 622\n\nSHIP TO Birtle Indian Residential School, Birtle, Manitoba\n\nPurpose for which required: Replacing worn out pipes in heating system\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 120 feet | 1\u00bd inch pipe |       |\n| 5        | unions for same |       |\n| 12       | elbows for same |       |\n| 5        | tees for same |       |\n| 30 feet  | 1\u00bd inch pipe |       |\n| 3        | elbows for same |       |\n| 1 union  | for same |       |\n\nPrice quoted on above material by Mr Ross Brown, Birtle $67.55.

This work was not done as stucco wire could not be obtained, and I advised you a year ago that the money would not be used for that work during that fiscal year.\n\nStucco wire is still very hard to obtain, but this building could be covered with Insul Brick Siding at a cost of approximately $300.00 for material. This siding is, I am told, very durable and excellent insulation. The school would supply the labour from their funds.\n\nI know that at present there is no money available for repairs to the Birtle School from last years appropriation, but thought it possible that you might at this time have unexpended money available from other accounts.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church would like to get this work done as it would make the cottage much more presentable and comfortable. If funds were available I could send in a requisition for material at once.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1944.\n\nEXD.\nA.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to applying a coat of stucco to the employees' cottage at the Birtle School.\n\nI am not certain that we will have the funds available between now and the end of the fiscal year to purchase the material, but I would like you to give me detailed information regarding the amount of material required and at the same time state if this can be secured locally. In the latter event you should state the approximate cost and the name and address of the firm from whom the material can be secured. When this information is received the matter will be kept in mind and, if at all possible, purchase will be made before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nR.A.

The only purchase made during the 1942-43 fiscal year was the wood wool insulation, covered by voucher No.305, March 31, amount $85.50, since it was not at all certain that stucco wire could be purchased, and without the wire the remaining items on the order could not be used.\n\nI advised the Department on 25th June 1943 that in my opinion the completion of the cottage should be deferred, and that a roothouse should be constructed. (The funds available had been reduced on account of pipeline repairs.)\n\nAgency letter of 25th January, 1944 suggests the use of Insul Brick siding for the cottage, since stucco wire is not now available. The cost of the siding is more than the stucco job, but I think would give better satisfaction. In accordance with Department reply 106-1-5, 29th January, 1944, a requisition covering the material required, is being prepared and will be forwarded at an early date. The material can be purchased locally from Mr. H.M.Delg, Birtle.\n\nA.G.Smith,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRequisition attached A.F.W.\n\nIndian Affairs.

About two years ago he recommended installing a new refrigerator at the school, as he will not guarantee the old one to give satisfactory service even after he overhauled same. However the old one has given fair service for a year until it went wrong a week ago. The attached voucher covers Mr Collins trip and service.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nRegarding the plumbing to be renewed at the Birtle Residential School. The return lines from the radiators are both giving out and it will be an expensive job to renew them. The present pipes are black iron and possibly galvanized pipe would last better, and be less costly in the long run. The plumber here thinks it might be possible to use one main pipe for this purpose instead of two as at present. This would mean putting in a larger pipe and fitting the radiators with escape valves. I am writing to the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Winnipeg, for their advice.\n\nThe water line from the School building to the barn is also leaking again, though it did not freeze. This whole line was renewed in 1932, and we had trouble with it last spring through frost. The pipe at the barn looked all right when we excavated last spring but we put in some new pipe near the school where there was frost damage. The only thing we can do is to excavate and see what the trouble is. It may just be a faulty union or the damage may be extensive. I request an accountable advance of $150.00 for this work. It may easily cost half of that sum or it might cost much more than the $150.00 requested.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nApril 12, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.

Smith\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter No.15 of 8th April this year, regarding the plumbing at the Birtle Residential School. The return lines from the radiators will have to be renewed. The bottom of the horizontal part of the pipes is eaten and grooved through the action of free oxygen. Last April I wrote to Mr Gow, of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, Winnipeg, asking for his advice regarding this matter. Recently one of his men called in and looked over the piping, and took a sample of the pipe to Winnipeg. On the 4th inst. I was in Winnipeg and consulted Mr Gow about same. Mr Gow advises replacing the pipe line with galvanized pipe if it is possible to obtain same, and the extra cost is not excessive, but if that is not possible to replace with black iron pipe. To estimate the cost of replacing this pipe is a lot of work, and I can hardly ask the plumber to do so unless we are requesting a tender on the work. I imagine it will cost about $500.00 but that is only a guess of course.\n\nKindly advise me if the Department are willing to have this work done, and I will then prepare a requisition of material required, and get an estimate of the cost of material and labour from the plumber.\n\nOn July 3rd I wrote to you requesting authority to do some work replacing cement around the coping stones and flashing on the roof. Mr Gow advises the use of plastic cement for this work as it will be more durable, though the initial cost will be more. Mr Gow also advised me that the roof would have to be replaced soon, as it was a ten year roof, and was put on fourteen years ago. He also stated that he thought that the large underground water storage tank would soon go, as he did not think it would last more than ten years when it was put in. P.T.O.\nThe same applies to the filter, some of the water piping, and the pressure water tank in the school.\n\nI will allow for some of this work in the estimates for the coming fiscal year in case it has to be done.\n\nA.G.

However, you may submit a requisition for the materials required to repair the plumbing, as it is felt that it is important that this should receive immediate attention.\n\nIn addition to the expenditure that will be necessary with regard to the above, we have purchased material costing $128.50 for repairs to the piggery and in official letter of the 7th instant we authorized an expenditure of $125.00 for repairing the coping stones and flashing on the roof.\n\nWe are not arranging at the present time for the purchase of the paint requested in your letter of the 7th instant.

Some of the pipes leading to and from this line will likely go when tampered with, so more pipe and fittings will likely have to be purchased locally as required. This however should not amount to much, but it is impossible to requisition for the possible amount required.\n\nMr Ross Brown the local plumber, will not give me an estimate of the cost of the labour required, as he cannot tell how long the work would take, but he charges .80\u00a2 per hour.\n\nThis work should be undertaken at once when the children are at home on holiday.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nJuly 19, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, we are requesting the Purchasing Branch to secure the materials required to repair the return flow pipe from the radiators to the boiler room at the Birtle Residential School. As soon as the material arrives you may employ the local plumber to do the necessary work.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nI have your letter of the 11th inst. No. 106-1-5 with reference to the repairs to be done at the Birtle Residential School. On April 22nd I received an advance of $150.00 to pay for repairing the pipe line from the school to the stables. We were very fortunate in finding this leak at once, and then it was just a loose connection so that the total cost of this work was only $15.60, which leaves a balance in the Agency account of $134.40. On the 7th inst you authorized an expenditure of $125.00 from this account to have repairs made to the coping stone work, the flashing, and the brick work at the school, and there are also minor repairs to do to the roof. I hope that this sum will cover the work needed.\n\nYou will see from the above that the plumbing to be done is in addition to the advance of $150.00 which I received. A requisition for the material for the plumbing will be sent immediately.\n\nA.G.

Smith,  \nIndian Agent,  \nBirtle, Man.  \n\nDear Sir:  \n\nIt has been recommended by the Hydro Service Manitoba that the School be checked over for deteriorating wiring. There are an undue number of fuses blowing out, which are due to \"wear and tear\". He points out that the electrical wiring plans for the building would need to be in the hands of the checking electrician.\n\nWould you look into this matter, please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. R. Webb. Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have received from Mr Webb the Principal of the Indian School here regarding the electrical wiring in the building.\n\nI have just interviewed the Hydro Service Man here about the matter, and he states that likely many of the switches are worn and will have to be replaced, but that the actual wiring in the building should be good for years to come. He informs me that Mr W. Walker of Birtle could do this work and that he should have a plan of the wiring. We have no such plan here.\n\nLast year two flood lights were supposed to be installed over the fire escapes but material could not be obtained at that time.\n\nMr Cruickshanks the Hydro man, could not give me any idea of the possible cost of repairs, but I think $100.00 would cover same and also install the flood lights if material is available.\n\nOn the 25th inst I wrote to you regarding the purchase of paint for decorating the school. If funds are not available for purchasing paint and attending to the wiring I think the wiring should come first.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves an expenditure of $100 for repairing the wiring at the Birtle Indian Residential School. It is noted that you can obtain the services of Mr. Walker of Birtle and you should have him do the work at the earliest possible date.\n\nR.A.

HAMILTON, Inspector of INDIAN AGENCIES, dated December 16, 1944, following his inspection of Birtle Residential School, December 6, 1944.\n\nThe furnace room was tidy and the equipment all in working condition. The filter, cold water pressure tank and the underground outside tank have given good service; but at any time renewals may be required. These tanks are all badly pitted and just how much longer they will last is a question. The renewal of any one will cost in the neighborhood of five hundred dollars.\n\nThe boys half of the infirmary is dark, as there is only one window. This room could be improved if the walls and ceiling were painted a light shade. Mr. Webb planned a special scheme of color for both rooms in the infirmary and had purchased special wall stencils, hoping the Department would furnish the paint; but for some reason the paint specified for this work was omitted. I would recommend that it be supplied, as sick rooms, especially for children, should be bright and cheerful. The requirements are:\n\n5 gals. turquoise, flat wall #10 Silkstone shell pink, #11\n\nThe Principal's residence should be repapered downstairs. There is a large hall, a dining-room and a large living room. The paper and labor will cost approximately $75.00. I would recommend Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent at Birtle, be allowed authority to proceed with the work.\n\nThe two main barns have been painted and are in good repair. The hog barn, chicken house and machine shed remain to be painted and the paint required will cost about $75.00. This work should be done next year without fail.\nOttawa, December 28, 1944.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 16th instant, regarding your inspection of the Birtle Residential School, you may authorize local purchase of the following:\n\n5 gals. turquoise, flat wall #10 Silkstone,\n1 \" shell pink \" \" #11 \"\n\nApproval is granted for an expenditure of $75.00 for material and labour in repapering the downstairs part of the Principal's residence.\n\nA requisition for the paint required for the barn, chicken house and machine shed should be forwarded to this office early in April.\n\nI note the condition of the pressure tank and also the outside tank. Funds are not available for their renewal at the present time, but, if you consider it necessary to renew them within the next year, full particulars should be forwarded in April, next.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nBirtle Manitoba\n27th December 1944\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nMr Eugene Fouillard of St. Lazara Manitoba has offered me .05\u00a2 per foot for old 3\" pipe which has been replaced in the Birtle Residential School. This pipe is of no use on the Agency or at the School, and as there must be 500 or 600 feet of it, it might as well be sold.\n\nKindly advise me if I can dispose of same to Mr Fouillard, and remit the proceeds to the Receiver General.\n\nA.G.

The supply is both very unsatisfactory and costly. The water is unfit to drink during most of the winter months, though of course being chlorinated it is safe. The school is at the mercy of the C.P.R. for its water supply as they have given no guarantee that the supply will continue indefinitely. The school pays about $1,000.00 per annum for water I am informed by the Principal, and the Department have paid out large sums to have the water piped from the C.P.R. tank to the school, and to renew the pipe line a few years ago. The water is also very hard on the plumbing and in that way is also costly.\n\nI would suggest that the Department consider the advisability of drilling a deep well sometime after the war, and trying to secure a supply of good water. Since the present school was opened in 1931 I think that the water supply has cost the Church authorities and the Department approximately $15,000.00.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nDominion Public Building, Winnipeg\n\nI beg to refer you to your letter No. 201-11A of January 3rd, with a copy of a letter from Ottawa enclosed regarding the outside storage tank and the pressure tank at the Birtle Residential School, on which you desired a report in April.\n\nThe outside tank should be cleaned out next summer during the holidays, and I would recommend having the boiler inspector examine it then and test it by hammer. These tanks might have to be renewed any time or they might last for years. I do not like to make any recommendation regarding these tanks until they are examined by the inspector, and he cannot examine the outside one until it is empty in summer.\n\nI think that the outside tank should be placed in an addition to the boiler room where it, and the piping connected to it could be examined at any time. It is unsatisfactory underground and very expensive to excavate every time we have any trouble with it. The piping connected to the tank, which has been renewed, was all pitted on the outside, which was caused by chemicals in the clay, and not by the water. The same thing may apply to the tank itself.\n\nA.G.

Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, April 10, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the pressure tank and outside tanks at the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may authorize Agent Smith to have the outside tank cleaned during the summer holidays and at that time you should arrange to have the Boiler Inspector examine and test it.\n\nWith reference to the suggestion that the outside tank should be placed in an addition to the boiler room, you should request Agent Smith to ascertain the expenditure required to erect this addition and to install the outside tank in it. Detailed information should be supplied in this regard, and when we receive it the Agent's suggestion will have further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nThis will confirm my telegram to you of the 5th inst. regarding the water pump at the Birtle Residential School which read as follows:\n\n\"Fairbanks Morse Winnipeg advise that Birtle Indian School water pump is beyond repair. Only pump available is 2500 gal per hour pump, approx. price $290.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg. Pump required immediately as water and sewage system depend on same.\"\n\nRepairs were purchased for the old pump and the engineer at the school did his best to make it work without success. We then shipped it in to Fairbanks Morse Winnipeg. They will allow us for most of the repairs purchased, which have not yet been paid for.\n\nI trust that the new pump will be sent immediately as it is not safe from a health standpoint to operate without it.\n\nA.G.

Or, if water was found an outside storage tank an outside tank might not be necessary.\n\nJudging by the cost of the hot-water tank which was renewed two years ago, I think that a new outside tank would cost about $1500.00, to $2000.00, and if it was enclosed the cost might be $3,000.00.\n\nIn view of the expenditure involved, and the possibility that changes might be made in the system shortly, I would recommend that an engineer be sent to look into the proposition.\n\nA.G.

Smith,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 1st, 1945.\n\nRe: INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nBIRTLE, MANITOBA\n\nReferring to your notation on copy of a telegraph dated May 10th from the Acting Director of Indian Affairs, we are in receipt of the following letter dated May 29th from Mr. Cow, which appears to be self-explanatory:\n\n\"We have for acknowledgment and attention your letter of May 15th with enclosures relating to the water supply situation at the above-mentioned institution.\n\nAn inspection of the water supply situation at this school would not appear necessary at this time but very shortly one of our engineers will be in that district in connection with our regular work and will visit the institution and examine the situation there.\n\nWe have no information to the effect that trouble has been experienced with either the storage tank or the pressure tank at the school, rather there is anticipation of trouble particularly in connection with the underground storage tank. This storage tank is 25' long, 78\" diameter with heads of 1/8\" and shell 1/4\" steel, seams stitched, riveted and welded and supplied with a manhole in the shell. Such storage was necessary because of the conditions of the contract for water supply as imposed by the Canadian Pacific Railway from whom the water is obtained. The tank was placed underground for economical reasons after full consideration had been given to the construction of reinforced structure underground and also to the placing of the tank above ground in a suitable enclosed and heated structure. It was estimated that the probable life of the underground tank would be ten years - it has now served for fifteen years. The pressure inside the tank probably never exceeds 10 lbs. The original cost of the storage tank FOR Birtle in 1930 was $660. It is possible that there is now some leakage from the tank without there being any evidence of the same above ground.\n\nThe correspondence indicates that the Indian Agent at Birtle has been informed that his Department intends to provide for the drilling of a well at the school in their pasteur programme. Should this drilling be proceeded with and a dependable source of suitable water be obtained, there would appear to be no necessity for the storage reservoir. Under the circumstances it would be advantageous to have the well-drilling programme carried out now and before the reconstruction of the storage reservoir. The present water supply at the school is not only unsatisfactory but expensive and a good supply from a drilled well would offer many advantages over the present supply. However, the Provincial Government records show that very little success has been realised with deep well drilling in the Birtle area and the prospect of securing an adequate source of suitable water in the vicinity of this school must be considered very remote. Even so, we would like to have official notice from the Indian Affairs branch with regard to their plans with respect to the drilling of this well before proceeding with a rather expensive replacement of the storage tank.\"\n\nYou will note that one of the engineers on Mr. Cow's staff will visit the school shortly while engaged on one of his regular trips through that part of the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Cow would like to have more information.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq., Director,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIn connection with the plans of the Indian Affairs regarding the drilling of a well which would not appear to have a reasonable chance of success in obtaining a suitable supply of water.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\nJune 4th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Water Supply, Indian Residential School, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of May 10th last, I am enclosing for your information a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated June 1st, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Gow is of the opinion that the prospects of securing an adequate water supply in the vicinity of this school, by deep well drilling, is remote. One of his engineers, however, will look into the situation at the school at an early date.\n\nIn the meantime, it would be appreciated if you would advise us of your plans with regard to well drilling at this point.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 12, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nIn a letter dated May 2, Inspector Hamilton forwarded to us a copy of your letter to him dated April 23, with reference to the outside tank at the Birtle Indian Residential School. As suggested in the last paragraph of your letter, we requested the Surveys and Engineering Branch to have one of their officers visit the school and, for your information, I enclose copy of their report.\n\nYou will note they consider it unlikely that water could be secured. In this regard I may say that it is inferred from your letter of February 27 that it might be possible to secure water by drilling a deep well. Please let me hear further from you in this regard.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nMr. A. G. Smith,\nIndian Agent,\nBirtle, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe water bowls for the cattle in the cow barn have been causing trouble for some time. The barn equipment representative was consulted. He recommended that the new style bowls be installed. The old piping in the barn is nearly rusted through. It is imbedded in the cement floor. The new equipment is installed overhead where it can be repaired. The new bowls eliminate the flooding of the mangers and stalls which has been so detrimental to the cattle.\n\nThe cracks in the floors of the rooms are getting worse. The stairways are in poor shape. In some measure this is due to the cement flooring and stairs crumbling away; and, to settling of the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Webb.\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI am enclosing a letter which I have received from Mr. R. Webb regarding repairs to the Birtle Residential School floors and barn. The floors are badly cracked in places. In the Estimates for the current fiscal year I requested that the sum of $360.00 be spent on applying a mastic finish to the main hallway. Many of the treads in the stairs are cracking badly and some have bad holes in them and will have to be repaired during the vacation. The concrete is going in them. I have had some of them filled with concrete but it does not stay in. I am of the opinion that they should also be repaired with some mastic material, but I do not know much about same and am not prepared to make any recommendation without investigating further. I would suggest that Inspector Hamilton take the matter up with Mr. Gow, the Engineer in Winnipeg, or if he has not time or is not in the city, I could do so myself and get an estimate on the job.\n\nRegarding the water bowls in the barn. They flood at times due to variations in the water pressure, which is caused by the amount of water in the C.P.R. tank. Beatty Bros have given Mr. Webb an estimate on new bowls which would do away with that. The cost would be $107.05 for the bowls and connections, plus possibly $75.00 for new overhead piping and labour installing. The present piping in the barn is under the concrete floor. When it has to be renewed we should install new bowls and overhead piping, but the present bowls and piping will last for a year or two yet if necessary.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 19, 1945.\n\nMr. A. G. Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to repairs required to the Birtle Indian Residential School. I understand that Inspector Hamilton is on an extended inspection trip, and it is therefore in order for you to see Mr. Gow in Winnipeg and obtain advice on the best manner to repair the floors to which you refer in your letter.\n\nIf it is necessary to purchase material, you will have to forward a requisition so that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch. However, if you can secure a quotation from some reliable firm to supply the material and install the new floor, you may forward this for our consideration.\n\nWith reference to the new water bowls required in the barn, it is noted you state that these can be secured for $107.05. Please let me have a tender from the firm from whom you have secured this price. It is noted that in addition to the purchase of the bowls it will be necessary to incur an expenditure of possibly $75.00 for new overhead piping and labour.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\n18th June 1945\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Indian Affairs Branch\n\nBirtle Indian Agency\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 09-623\n\nSHIP TO: Principal, Indian Residential School, Birtle, Manitoba\n\nPurpose for which required: Repairing plumbing in School\n\nNOTE: Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n\"consumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|------------|-------|\n| 24       |                     |            |       |\n| 1 inch Globe valves, Jenkins Interchangeable | Approx. $1.75 | $48.00 |\n| 12       |                     |            |       |\n| \u00bd inch do do do do | $2.00 | $24.00 |\n| 12       |                     |            |       |\n| 1 inch do do do do | $2.25 | $27.00 |\n| 4        |                     |            |       |\n| 2\u00bd inch Gate valves for water filter | $7.00 | $28.00 |\n| 6        |                     |            |       |\n| \u00be inch hot water radiator valves | $1.50 | $9.00 |\n| 6        |                     |            |       |\n| 1 do do do do do | $2.00 | $12.00 |\n| 24       |                     |            |       |\n| \u00bd in. basin faucets | $1.25 | $30.00 |\n| 24       |                     |            |       |\n| \u00bc in. zinc faucets Screw top | $2.00 | $48.00 |\n| 8        |                     |            |       |\n| \u00bd inch bath faucets Double unit | $4.00 | $32.00 |\n| 2        |                     |            |       |\n| Two way valves on Duro-Water Softener | not known |\n| which have to be duplicated | | |\n| Nipples, unions, and piping to connect up above fixtures as required to be purchased locally | Approx. $50.00 |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

If the Provincial Government records show that there is little possibility of obtaining water by drilling, I have no reason to doubt it whatever. I did not know that deep wells had been tried in this vicinity, but I have no doubt that the matter was considered when the school was built. The water supply is not only very expensive at present, but the quality of the water for drinking is very poor, and in spring when the river is low the children simply do not drink enough water, as it both looks and tastes bad, however on account of chlorination it should be safe to drink. I note that one of Mr Gow's staff of engineers will visit the school shortly, and I presume we had better leave the matter of replacing the storage tank in abeyance until he looks into the matter, though the repairs should really be done in the vacation months.\n\nA.G.

The floors are badly cracked in places and much more linoleum could be used to advantage if funds are available. When on vacation I looked over floors with a mastic finish in the Cecelia Jeffries school at Kenora, and did not think much of that, as it is unsightly and is not standing up well.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 4th referring to the water supply at the above-mentioned institution, and asking for a report on the water supply accompanied by recommendations as requested in your letter of May 16th last.\n\nSince writing you on May 29th last with reference to the water supply, we have had a visit from the Indian Agent, Mr. Smith, and the water supply situation was discussed with him. As mentioned in our letter of May 29th, we still have no information to the effect that the leak has been caused in connection with either the pressure tank or the outside storage tank and so do not consider that either need any repla cement. While the storage tank is 5 feet below ground level, a access to the inside of the tank is readily available by manhole without the necessity of any excavation, thus permitting examination and cleaning when the tank is empty, and the tank can be emptied by gravity at any time.\n\nIf and when this storage tank shows signs of becoming unserviceable, it will be advisable to abandon it and erect a new one in a suitably enclosed and heated structure adjacent to the present school building. This would not improve the quality of the water supply but will eliminate some of the difficulty of operation when leaking pipes are discovered or when they must be replaced. However, I think Mr. Smith will agree that this work can be postponed until such time as materials and labour become more plentiful. We will, however, arrange to visit the school in the near future to note the conditions, select a favourable site for the new tank and also examine the conditions of the school in general. Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent, appears to be considerably worried about the cracks throughout many of the floors.\n\n(Sgd) D. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nT. S.

B. Gow\n\nRe:- Birtle Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, an inspection was carried out at the above mentioned institution on October 4, 1945. The Indian Agent, Mr. Smith, accompanied the writer during his inspection.\n\nWater Supply System\n\nThe school's water supply is obtained from the C.P.R. elevated tank, flowing by gravity to an underground storage tank at the school. This underground storage tank, erected in 1931, is 78 inches in diameter, 25 feet long and was fabricated from 1/4\" steel plate with rivetted seams. At the time of erection the tank was estimated to have a life of at least ten years. As the tank is now 14 years old, Mr. Smith thought it might be in need of replacement, although there has been no indication of incipient failure. The exterior of the tank is exposed only at the manhole and shows very little deterioration except only a thin scale of rust is apparent. The engineer of the school had the tank emptied and cleaned it out about a year ago. He said that he tested it all with a hammer then and found no evidence of weakness. It is my opinion that there is no need to replace this tank for some years yet. It would be advisable to have the tank emptied and an inspection made about every two years.\n\nThere is no dissatisfaction with the operation of the other elements of the water supply system.\n\nSchool Roof\n\nThere have been no leaks reported in the roof over the school. An inspection was made however and a section of the flashing, about 20 feet long, has separated from the parapet wall about 1/4 inch. The engineer of the school is going to try to repair this section.\n\nInterior Finish\n\nThe walls and ceilings are in very good condition, generally. The plaster has spilled off the walls in a few places in the basement but not to any extent and is not due to cracks in the wall structure.\n\nThe floors throughout the building are a cement or cement grout finish applied directly to the concrete floor slabs. The cement finish has cracked in all the floors throughout the building. The cracks appear at fairly regular intervals 6' to 8' apart in both directions, making a square pattern.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Bldg., WINNIPEG.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThey are probably shrinkage cracks and probably made their appearance shortly after construction. There is no evidence of any cracking in the plaster ceilings which would occur if the concrete floor slabs themselves had cracked. The school's floors have been cracked as long as anyone now at the school can remember so they are probably due to faulty construction in the first instance.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe condition of the equipment and structure of the school appears to be in a fairly satisfactory condition and there is no immediate necessity for any repairs or replacement.\n\n(Sgd.) G. M. Lyon,\n\nG. M. Lyon.\nFurther to our memorandum of June 4 and Mr. Mills of July 25th and for your information, Copy of Mr. Lyon's report herewith.\n\n15/10/45.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School,\nBirtle, Manitoba.\n\nOctober 16th, 1945.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of September 13th we are now in receipt of the following from Mr. Gow dated October 6th:\n\n\"In our letter to you of May 29th and July 17th we gave it as our view that there was no work required in connection with the water supply system at the school. We had further indicated that a visit would be paid to the school if and when one of our engineers happened to be in the vicinity. The matter of these inspections was overlooked. We have now, however, had Mr. G. M. Lyon of this staff visit the school and he inspected the same on October 4th. He has prepared a memorandum with respect to the conditions as found by him at the school - a copy of the memorandum is enclosed. You will note from his memorandum that there is no need to replace any part of the water supply system and that there is no dissatisfaction on the school with the operation of any of the elements of the water supply system. You will also note that he reports on the condition of the school roof and also the interior finish but that in his conclusions he states that there is no necessity of repairs or replacement of any of the structure or equipment at the school at this time.\"\n\nDuplicate copies of the report by Mr. Lyon are attached.\n\nYou will note that there is no necessity for repairs or replacements at the school for the present.\n\nT.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated\n\nVoucher No. 187\n\nDATE 26th October 1945 Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nThree years ago we had a new hot water tank installed in the Birtle Residential School to replace the old one which was done. This tank is 48\" in diameter and 10' long on the shell. The shell of the new tank was 1/4\" plate and the heads 5/16\". This tank has given some trouble all summer and has been welded several times. It cost $552.00 installed, and was bought by the purchasing Agent. At that time the sketch supplied with the requisition called for a tank with 3/8\" boiler plate, whereas a tank with 1/4\" plate was supplied. On Tuesday the head of this tank blew out, and there was a hole a foot long round the foot of same. Yesterday I had the tank welded so as they would have hot water in the building, but it is not at all safe and will have to be replaced, as it still leaks and may go out again any time. I have warned the Principal to keep all the boys away from it in the meantime. I phoned to Inspector Hamilton about it and he advised me to take it up with the Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg. They advise a new tank, and will supply one constructed of 5/16\" shell, 3/8\" heads, and provided with a manhole, which will permit them to weld the heads to the shell both inside and outside. Also with a manhole the tank can be inspected annually for corrosion. They will also put an extra opening in the tank and supply a relief valve set, which would do away with any danger of having too much pressure in the tank if the cut-out failed to function.\n\nThe price they quote on this tank is $330.00 F.O.B. Birtle, Dominion Government Sales Tax of 8% included. The tank can be installed by a local plumber, and I do not think the cost should exceed $75.00.\n\nI think that the tank suggested by the Vulcan Iron\nWorks Winnipeg would be satisfactory and should give good service, and recommend that same be purchased immediately by telegram.\n\nThe present tank had no manhole and was therefore only welded on the outside, and it is the welding and not the plate that is causing the trouble.\n\nI have on hand an accountable advance of $175.00 to pay for painting the school windows, less $3.25 which I paid a man for helping the engineer at the school do some repairs on the roof. I have been unable to get a painter to do this work all summer and it is now too late to have it done until spring. I would suggest using some of this money to have the new tank installed, and returning the balance to the Receiver General for use elsewhere.\n\nA.G.

They stated they have a new tank 5/16\" shell, 3/8\" heads, and provided with a manhole which will permit them to weld the head to the shell both inside and outside. The manhole in the tank will allow annual inspection. An extra opening will also be put in the tank and a relief valve set supplied, which would avoid danger of having too much pressure in the tank if the cut-out failed to function.\n\nThe Vulcan Iron Works quote a price of $330.00 f.o.b., Birtle, sales tax included, on this tank.\n\nIt is essential that the school should have hot water and as the pressure tank is practically useless we would like to secure the new tank at the earliest possible date.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Our file indicates that both the Purchasing Branch and ourselves were obliged to interview a large number of Controllers and others before we could even obtain permission to purchase a tank, and when we did, the type of tank was very light, but it was the best we could do at that time.\n\nI have submitted to the Purchasing Branch the recommendation in your letter regarding the tank which can be secured from the Vulcan Iron Works, and I am requesting the Purchasing Agent to give the matter immediate attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date   | PARTICULARS                                      | Folio | Debit Amount | Credit Amount | Balance |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| Oct. 30 | Trip to Residential school re weld tank         |       |              |               |         |\n|        | Weld tank at School 4 hrs. labour @ 1.50        |       |              |               |         |\n|        | welding material $4.00                          |       | 10.00        |               |         |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Most of the old staff are still there which is a big help to him. I have not yet been able to get a man to paint the school windows and fire escapes and doubt if I will be able to do so this fall.\n\nBattleship linoleum has been purchased for the dining room which will improve the floor there when laid. It is hard to get recruits into the school, as the Indians are clamouring for day schools on the Reserves, and I am very reluctant to use force, though I am afraid this will have to be done.\n\nA.G.

I have men excavating but have not yet got down to the pipe which is burst, and it may mean a lot of work and expense before they find the right place where the trouble is.\n\nIn recent years we have had this trouble almost every winter, when it is most expensive to excavate. Whether it is due to poor piping supplied during the war or not I do not know.\n\nI intend to crib in the piping near to the storage tank so as it will not be so hard to get at it when necessary, and I think that in the end this will prove economical. This will cost about $75.00 or $100.00 for plank. Some plank had to be purchased to crib up the sides on the hole so as to make it safe for the men to work in, as it is so wet and caves in badly.

At the Birtle Residential School the new Principal seems to be doing well. He is to start teaching wood-work as soon as tools can be obtained, to the older boys. There has been no truancy during the quarter, which is very fortunate in the severe weather. The Indians were bound to take their children home for a Christmas holiday, but due to the fact that there were two cases of chicken pox at the school at the time, they made no trouble about it. They are all keen on having day schools on the Reserve. The children at the school look very healthy and are well clothed, considering the shortage of boots etc. A new boiler was installed at the school to replace one that was put in three years ago, which blew out.\nOttawa, February 22, 1946.\n\nMr. J.

The children are doing well in class-room work, as they spend four and a half days a week in studies. The Principal has had a lot of painting done by the boys with excellent results, and this is brightening up the building a lot. Battle-ship linoleum has been laid in the hospital which is also an improvement. There have only been two truants during the quarter. The children are well clothed considering the shortage of clothing and material, and are well fed, though the parents are continually complaining about the food.

I will have this repaired with asphalt or pitch as soon as possible, without further authority. I do not think the cost will exceed $100.00.\n\nThere was some plumbing authorized a year ago which has not yet been done as material has not been available, and Mike Yates of Brandon is supposed to do this work when he can procure the material. There is no authority for this work during the present fiscal year. The cost will possibly be about $100.00.\n\nThe tracks and hangers of the barn doors are done, and unless they were replaced immediately, damage would be done to the heavy doors in a wind, so I have ordered new tracks and hangers from the Marshall Wells Co.

(RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa\n\nI have received your letter No.106-1-5 (WT 1) of the 5th inst. regarding vouchers No.350 and 352 which are enclosed.\n\nMy intentions were to write a letter of explanation to forward with the vouchers in the first place, and I regret that I neglected doing this.\n\nThe root house has cost more for material and labour than I figured on. The site turned out to be very stony when the sod was taken off, and it has cost $52.00 for excavation; the gravel pit where I figured on obtaining gravel at a reasonable cost was full of water and I had to have the gravel hauled 12 miles at a cost of $2.75 per yard. Gravel cost $85.24, which was paid from the advance of $300.00, and $52.00 for excavation, was also paid from the advance, in addition to the $50.00 paid for labour and deducted from the amount of the enclosed vouchers. This leaves a balance of $67.76 left in the Agency account to the credit of the advance. I have still to pay for filling in around the root house and other sundry accounts from the advance, hence the enclosed vouchers.\n\nThe actual carpenter work also cost more than I expected. This is the first root house that I have ever had built, and I certainly did not allow enough for labour, gravel etc.\n\nA.G. Smith  \nIndian Agent\nBirtle Manitoba\n10th November 1947\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa\n\nThere was a class-room at the old Birtle Residential School, which was built about 1924-25. When the new school was built this class-room was converted into a cottage for employees of the school, and now two families live in same. One side was made into four rooms which are comfortable, and well laid out. The other side was divided very poorly, as there is a lot of waste room, and no door at the back for the family residing in that portion of the building. Some of the rooms are more or less fire traps on that account.\n\nFor a sum not exceeding two hundred dollars, the partitions could be moved, utilizing the waste room, and providing a back door and porch. A certain amount of material would be required, but it is impossible to requisition for the exact amount, as it would depend on circumstances. I do not think that the material would cost over $50.00.\n\nOne employee is moving out of the house soon, as he is leaving the staff, and the work should be done before the new occupant moves in.\n\nKindly advise me if you have money available to proceed with the alterations, and approve of same.\n\nA.G. Smith\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 30, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nBirtle Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to building material for the root house at the Birtle Indian Residential School, I attach account covering the cost of materials.\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that it can be paid.

Smith, Indian Agent, Birtle, Manitoba.\n\nBirtle Indian Residential School.\n\nReference your 15-10th November.\n\nIf you will check your files of this school from the beginning of this fiscal year, you will find that we have already spent a large sum of money at the above residential school. In fact, we have exceeded our estimates considerably. Our files show that the following accounts have been paid for various items at this school:\n\n(a) Paint $297.50\n(b) Desks 172.90\n(c) Linoleum 282.57\n(d) Track for barn door $76.46\n(e) Painting roof and out buildings $200.\n(f) Rugs 215.90\n(g) Roof repairs 39.28\n(h) Repairs to Chlorinator 124.64\n(i) Repairs to refrigerator 200.00\n(j) Repairs for pump 28.14\n(k) Floor rugs 84.55\n(l) Fluorescent fixtures 94.35\n(m) Fluorescent fixtures 203.81\n(n) Labour for root house 162.50\n(o) Labour for root house 120.00 Total: $2,302.80\n\nThere are also smaller accounts and outstanding accounts still to be paid. Therefore, I feel confident that you will agree that we have been very reasonable and fair in our action with Mr. Rusaw's requests. I feel that the repairs to the staff buildings will have to wait until the next fiscal year. However, if this is an emergency, we are prepared to hear further from you.\n\nBernard F.

From our Treasurer's office we have been notified that the night watchman's salary was last received for July, 1943; and the manual training teacher's salary was paid to the end of June.\n\nLast week the salary cheque for the night watchman was received amounting to $180.00 and on the enclosure with it was the note that it was for October to December. The night watchman's salary is at the rate of $40.00 per month.\n\nAs far as Birtle is concerned we have received the manual training teacher's salary to the end of October and are hoping that the balance will be received before too long.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would give us what information you have concerning these salaries and the months for which you consider they are paid so that we may pass it on to our Treasurer's Department.\n\nMay I say that I am sorry to trouble you about this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Freida E.

The cheque which you recently received for $180.00 covered the allowance for the night watchman at the rate of $60.00 per month for the period October, November and December, 1948. This year we have increased the allowance from $40.00 to $60.00 a month.\n\nWith reference to the allowance for the manual training instructor, we have been in communication with our Superintendent, and it has finally been decided to allow an amount of $150.00 towards his salary, effective 1st September, 1948. Mr. Paterson has recently been requested to forward a Voucher.\n\nWith reference to the Birtle Residential School, our file shows that we forwarded payment for the month of November to the Principal of the Birtle School. The allowance for the month of December has gone forward to the Principal. It is regretted that these 2 payments were made to the Principal. We overlooked the fact that these cheques should have been forwarded to you.\n\nWe are notifying our Superintendent accordingly, and we trust that there will be no further mistakes in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

They were unable to determine the source of the leakage but were satisfied that it was of substantial proportion and necessitated immediate repairs. Accordingly, this office advised the Regional Supervisor of the Indian Affairs Branch at Winnipeg as to the conditions at the school and suggested that the firm of Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon be instructed to send laborers and pipe fitters to Birtle to locate the source of leakage and make the necessary repairs. The work was to be done on a cost basis plus 10%. Our engineers had contacted the firm of Neale, Stothard and Chapman and ascertained that the firm was in a position to carry out this work with labor from Brandon. The Indian Agent at Birtle had advised this office that there was no labor at Birtle for the carrying out of the work and that outside labor would be necessary for all work involved.\"\n\nIt would appear from the above that the Regional Supervisor of the Indian Affairs Branch at Winnipeg has the matter in hand.\n\nR.

It was in the steel storage tank under the ground. This job entailed a great deal of labor as we spent all of the time digging. Due to the severe weather we could not open the ground up as would have been possible in the Summer, due to the danger of freezing the tank and lines, etc.\n\nHowever, we wish to say the repair we have made is in the nature of a temporary one as the steel storage tank is over 50% badly pitted and will have to be replaced this Summer.\n\nThe 1\u00bd\" line from the school to the barn should be renewed; it is in real bad shape and has been repaired twice in the last two years. We would suggest that this be run in with 1\u00be\" service copper pipe.\n\nIf it would meet with your approval we would be pleased to submit an estimate of the above replacements.

MILLS,\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nRe: Water System, Birtle Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nI am enclosing copies of radiogram and letter received from the Engineering and Construction Division of our department at Ottawa with respect to the water system at the Birtle Indian Residential School. It will be noted from this correspondence that this office was asked to co-operate with advice in connection with any repair work which should be carried out at the institution.\n\nTwo engineers of this office have just returned from an inspection of conditions at the Birtle Indian School and they discussed the situation there with Messrs. Hamilton and Russell and also the engineer of the school. It was impossible to locate the source of the leakage and it may necessitate considerable excavation work in order to locate the exact spot of leakage so that the defective parts can be replaced. There is no labour supply at Birtle or in the immediate vicinity for the carrying out of such work. Our engineers report that the school authorities have been compelled to seep into the drain in the pump room down to the drain in the boiler room. It is also reported that water is seeping up through the floor of the boiler room into the ash pits of the furnace and it is this aspect of the situation which is considered most serious. The cost of water is reported to have increased from a monthly average of about $45.00 to a monthly average of $90.00 for the month of January. Our engineers are of the opinion that it is advisable to proceed immediately with repairs so as to overcome the excessive leakage which is now occurring.\n\nThey were instructed to and did discuss with Messrs. Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon as to whether or not that firm could undertake the necessary repair work. Mr. Stothard informed our engineers that they were able to undertake this work at once and could arrange to send up laborers and pipe fitters to do the necessary excavation and repair work. I understand accommodation for the men is available at the Birtle Indian School. Mr. Hamilton also advised our engineers that he had authority to proceed on any repair work which was considered necessary. The writer would suggest, therefore, that you write to Messrs. Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon instructing them to proceed to Birtle with such laborers and pipe fitters as may be considered necessary to locate the source of the leak and to make effective repairs. It is also suggested that work should be carried out on a cost-plus basis, presumably 10% above cost of all material, labor and administrative expense, and that accounts should be made out and forwarded to you for certification. The work will be carried out under the general supervision of the engineer at the school and the Agent at Birtle.\n\nWe are enclosing plans which show the general layout of the water installation from the C.P.R. tank to the school and from the school to the barns. It is possible that since the original plans were prepared, there have been alterations made in the pipes which will not show on these plans. However, they will give Messrs. Neale, Stothard and Chapman some indication as to what the system really is and where danger points might occur so as to cause excessive leakage.\n\nD. B.

I was unable to contact Mr. Hamilton, Superintendent at Portage la Prairie, because of the fact that he was away paying interest money. I have, therefore, authorized Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon to proceed with this work immediately, and have concurred with the Engineering Department insofar as this work should be carried out on a cost plus basis, presumably 10% above cost of all material, labour and administrative expense. I trust this action will meet with your approval.\"\n\nAttached please find a copy of our reply to Mr. Davis' letter.\n\nWe have now received the account amounting to $656.49. The account was certified by our official and we also have a report from Mr. D.B. Gow, District Chief Engineer, Mines, Forests and Scientific Services Branch, Winnipeg, Manitoba. The work has been satisfactorily completed. It was necessary to have it...\ncarried out immediately, and in view of the information contained in this memorandum we would appreciate it if the Minister would approve payment of $656.49 to Neale, Stothard and Chapman of Brandon, Manitoba, whom Mr. Davis engaged to do the work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAttach.\n\nDirector.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**Indian Affairs Branch**\n\n**NOTE:** This slip to be used for passing correspondence when the main file is charged out or is not required, and must not be removed but will be attached to the main file as soon as possible.\n\n**Records Service Division**\n\n| Slip No. | Indian Affairs File No. |\n|----------|-------------------------|\n| 1737     | 575-5                   |\n\n**Subject of File:** Butte Res.

G. Smith, Assistant, Indian Agency, Birtle, Manitoba, regarding repairs required at the Birtle Indian Residential School, which letter I think you will find self-explanatory. You will also find enclosed his requisition for the items required together with price quotations from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Winnipeg.\n\nI concur with Mr. Smith's request as it is quite evident that these repairs are necessary and I would, therefore, request that you grant the necessary authorization for this expenditure.\n\nR.

Hamilton,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Repairs Birtle Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing a list of repairs to order from the Fairbanks Morse Co. for the water pump at the school. There is no authority for this but it is an emergent repair and they should be ordered at once.\n\nThe leak in the water system was in the big storage tank, in a place where it was fitted inside and out. The local blacksmith has put a patch on same. This tank will have to be renewed during the summer I think. It is too expensive to repair when it takes so long to locate the leak, and you cannot tell how long it will be before it goes through some other place, and it all has to be done again.\n\nThe flues in the horizontal boiler are leaking and will likely have to be renewed. It is possible that they might last for a while if rolled, but very doubtful. To install new flues will cost approximately $225.00. The local blacksmith put new flues in this boiler ten years ago, so they have lasted well. Before that time they were renewed every three or four years. He put in heavy locomotive flues. He would not give me a definite price on same as he does not know the cost of flues at present. Authority should be obtained to have this work done immediately as the boiler cannot be used now.\n\nI should have stated that there is also a leak in the water line to the barn but they have not located it. In June that line should be renewed. There is no use digging anymore at present as two men might dig for a month and then not find it. The main leak was in the tank.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) A.G. Smith.\nAsst.

The fireman advised Mr. Perrie that while the boiler was easy to stoke, it was always difficult to maintain a satisfactory operating pressure.\n\nFrom data supplied in Mr. Perrie's report, it can be deduced that the boiler is approximately 6 horsepower. The theoretical requirements to serve the washer and drier do not exceed 6 horsepower, but it is not practicable to size a boiler of this kind within such close limits. There is very little reserve steam storage space and as soon as the steam is turned on, the pressure drops to a point where it is ineffective.\n\nAfter fully considering the requirements, it is recommended that a new vertical high pressure boiler having a capacity of at least 12 horsepower and built for 100 lbs. per square inch working pressure, be purchased and installed. It is also recommended that a condensation barrel of approximately 75 gallon capacity be provided, together with a return line with inverted bucket trap from the drier. This return line to be extended to the condensation barrel; the object being to avoid the use of 100% raw make-up water. A new injector should be supplied as part of this equipment.\n\nThe new high pressure boiler should be a vertical type, equal to that made by E. Leonard and Sons, rated at 13 horsepower, complete with mountings and base. The approximate cost of this installation will be $1,200.00.\n\nWhen approval is given, we will prepare a detailed list of the equipment from which a purchase order can be made.\n\nMr. Perrie was also asked to report on the water situation at this school. When this report has been received and analyzed, you will be further advised.\n\nR.A.

The Lands & Development Services Branch are preparing a detailed list of the equipment required, and as soon as this is received, we will submit it to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe Water System, Birtle Indian Residential School, Birtle, Man.\n\nReferring to the memorandum from Indian Affairs dated April 30, 1949, on the above subject, we are now in receipt of the following from Mr. Perrie:\n\n\"In accordance with your letter of May 5, 1949, an investigation of the water supply system at this school has been made and I have to report as follows:\n\nThe source of the school water supply is the nearby elevated water tank of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. From this tank the water flows by gravity to an underground storage tank which is located just outside the school building and adjacent to the boiler room. The water is pumped from the supply tank through the school water system and to the barn.\n\nThe gravity supply line from the C.P.R. tank is reported to have been renewed last year and it can be assumed that this line is now in good condition but leaks have developed in the underground storage tank at the school and it is suspected that the supply line from the pump to the barn is also leaking.\n\nThe supply tank at the school is 25' in length with a diameter of 78\" and was fabricated from 4\" steel plate. It was erected in 1931 and its expected life when buried underground would be not more than ten years from the time of its installation. This tank was leaking last year and was presumed to have been repaired when a steel plate was welded over the area through which the water was leaking at the time the repair was made.\n\nAt the time of my inspection the tank was full of water and it was not convenient to drain the tank at that time in order to inspect its interior. However, it is my experience that once a tank of this kind, with the life that this one has had, develops one leak it can safely be concluded that more will follow and it is a waste of time and money to begin patching the holes as they develop. This tank should therefore be replaced immediately.\n\nI am unable to furnish you with an estimate covering the cost of a new tank but this information can no doubt be readily obtained from the Architectural Branch of the Division, which branch is likely installing\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-5, part 9)\nsimilar tanks in new schools as they are built. A blueprint copy of a plan, prepared in the Winnipeg District Office, showing the tank dimensions is attached hereto. In the event that a new tank is to be installed in accordance with the old plan, the cost of transportation, installation and the reconstruction of the timber manhole would be approximately $1,000.00.\n\nAlthough the initial cost would be higher, I am of the opinion that instead of burying the new tank in the ground as at present it would, over a period of years, be more economical to install the tank in a chamber of its own immediately adjacent to the school boiler room. This would place the tank where it would be open to inspection at all times and by keeping the exterior painted the life of the tank would be prolonged indefinitely. Such a chamber could no doubt be readily designed by the Architectural Branch of the Division.\n\nIn order to determine the extent, if any, of the leaks in the line from the school to the barn, it will be necessary to dig up the present line at considerable expense. I am of the opinion that it may be found that the suspicion that this line is leaking may prove to be unfounded when a new supply tank is installed and the leaks stopped at that point. It is therefore recommended that the matter of digging up the supply line to the barn be left until the new tank is installed.\"\n\nFrom the above we estimate that the cost of replacing the tank would amount to approximately $2,750.00 if buried in the same manner as the present tank. However, if we decide to place the new tank in a special chamber, it is likely that the cost might reach an additional $750.00.\n\nBefore we can decide definitely whether to put the tank into a separate chamber, we need more local information. In the meantime, if Indian Affairs will transfer $3,500.00, we will arrange to proceed with the project.\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Chief, Engineering & Construction Division.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School,\nYour File L.A. 1456-9\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of July 22nd regarding the water system at the above school.\n\nWe agree with your recommendation that it would be advisable to install the water tank in a chamber of its own immediately adjacent to the school boiler room.

Neary,\nPP/ST\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Col. B. F. Neary.\n\nWhile visiting the Birtle Residential School recently, Mr. Rusaw, the Principal, took up the matter with me, regarding some parts he had received for a washing machine, from The Canadian Laundry Machinery Co. Limited, Toronto. The parts received are as follows:\n\n1 New Wood Cylinder, complete with trimmings.\n1 Set of Bolts & Nuts.\n2 Brass Transmitter Rings.\n\nThe above are for 36 x 54\" Globe Washer 1215 M 7216, and I can find no record in this office of when this was ordered. However, what is needed at the Birtle School is a complete new machine, as the present washer is in such condition that these repair parts will be of no use to it.\n\nMr. Rusaw and Mr. Hamilton advise me that they did not order these parts, but had requested a small washer for the school. I wish you would check your files and advise me. Also, if possible, place an order for a new machine to be shipped to the Birtle School and these repair parts could be returned.\n\nR. S.

Russell\nSuperintendent.\n\nC.C. Mr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nColonel B.F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHaving just visited Birtle Indian Residential School, I am writing you regarding some matters which are causing me great concern. I know they are matters, not directly in your department and yet because they have to do with the welfare of the children, I feel they should be of concern to you too.\n\nFor some months Mr. Rusaw has been trying to get some attention and action regarding certain necessary repairs and replacements:\n1. Replacement of the outside water supply storage tank.\n2. Renewal of waterline to the barn from the main building.\n3. Replacement of the large washing machine.\n\nMr. Rusaw is of the opinion that all of these replacements should be made immediately and I heartily agree with him. The large washing machine is completely broken down and the laundry is being done in a small machine which is the size used in the ordinary home. Yesterday, the lady in charge of the laundry, told me that she had had to do 28 washings in the little machine in order to wash the sheets from the children's beds. This of course cannot continue. The little machine is not built for this type of work, neither can we expect to keep a laundry matron in our employ under these conditions.\n\nSo far as the replacements to the water supply storage tank and the renewal of the waterline are concerned, these repairs were recommended after a survey in May by Mr. Perrie, Regional Engineer at Regina, Lands and Development Service Branch. Mr. Davis, Regional Supervisor of Manitoba and Mr. Hamilton, Superintendent at Portage la Prairie, are both aware of these very much needed repairs. We are at a loss to understand why no action has been taken. Mr. Rusaw and Mr. Findlay, the engineer, are greatly disturbed and are anxious that all repair work be done before winter.\nWould you be good enough, Colonel Neary, to see that some immediate action be taken. As I mentioned at the beginning of this letter, I am concerned not only for the sake of the staff but for the welfare of the children and I do think these repairs and replacements are most necessary.\n\nHoping to have a favourable reply, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNational Executive Secretary\nSeptember 26, 1949.\n\nMiss Frieda Matthews,\nNational Executive Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society of the\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nRoom 800 - 100 Adelaide Street W.,\nToronto 1, Ontario.\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nIn the absence of Colonel Neary on a business trip, I desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 22 with regard to the above school.\n\nThe Lands and Development Services are arranging to carry out the improvements required to the outside water supply and also the renewal of the water line to the barn and the main building. I am writing to them today, requesting them to give the matter immediate attention so that the work will be completed at an early date.\n\nWe are wiring to our Regional Supervisor to forward full particulars regarding the size and type of washing machine that should be supplied. We will have this information in the next few days and the Departmental Purchasing Agent will be requested to place the order at once.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 26, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT,\n\nRe: Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nOn September 8 we forwarded you a requisition for a high pressure tubular boiler for the above school.

I had telephoned the Winnipeg office four times, each call costing $1.40 about this machine. These men knew the condition of our machine as they have both seen it since it collapsed and I believe their intentions were sincere but somewhere the appeal was lost along the way.\n\nThe size of the machine is immaterial but this year we have an increased enrollment of 30 pupils, and an increase of 25 to former years. It was suggested that there might not be much difference in the cost of the two between the 64\" and the 72\" so after measuring up the laundry space and drain etc., we find that it would install satisfactorily.

The road allowance between the two properties has never been used and as the cost of a good grade would be very great it is not likely to be used for many years to come. The property is therefore conveniently situated to the school site. The Bird Tail river runs almost through the centre of the property giving it a plentiful water supply. A considerable portion is wooded with poplar, at the present time about six hundred cords could be cut on it. The value of this standing is about $600. What is not wooded has good grass and makes good natural pasture. This is about all that can be said in favor of this land. The hillsides on the north are steep and cut with deep ravines and besides this are very stony. The south side is not so steep but is very stony. While some small fields could be broken up we do not think this land could be brought under cultivation without costing more than it is worth. By using this land in its natural state it should pasture about thirty head of cattle and should be worth for our purposes from one hundred to two hundred dollars per year. The land if placed on the market would not sell.\nreadily and probably would not bring ten dollars an acre but I should think that being free from taxes as the property of the government it should be worth about fifteen for this purpose.\n\nThe lots lying north of the school site have little value for building or agriculture. The ground is very stony. It would have some value for us as it would give the whole block which we could improve of $165 as suited our purposes.\n\nThe nearest land good for cultivation is the south west quarter of section eight lying just north of the quarter section described above. The C.P.R. runs through this.\n\nThe part south of the track is stony. The part north of the track consisting of about one hundred acres is first class land.\n\nIt is fenced but not otherwise improved. It has no surface water. The arable land is about half a mile from the school, by an easy road. This land belongs to Mr. John Patterson Birtle and can be bought at from thirty five to forty dollars an acre.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\n[Signature]\nFarm-Instructor\nSir,\n\nYour letter No.116,624-1 of date the 2nd.instant,received and in reply. On Monday the 7th.I went up to Birtle and have returned this morning,after looking fully into the subject of your communication. The Presbyterian Church have a very large amount of money invested in the Birtle Indian School,and no suitable land for farming adjacent to the school. The 28 acres mentioned in my letter of the 16th.ultimo does not help them out very much as they have had the use of it for years. This school being so far away from a good vegetable market can not make very much from a small farm,and must have some good arable land close to the school if they wish to farm on a large scale and make institution profitable.\n\nAfter looking carefully into the matter,and talking over everything in connection,with the Principal,and Farmer,of the Birtle School,I have come to the conclusion that the best solution would be the purchase of a half section which can be bought,and which adjoin the present school grounds.\n\nThe north west quarter of section 5 is not suitable for grain or root farming,and its use to the school would be for the pasture of sheep,cattle,& horses. I went over a large part of this quarter section with Mr.Iverach,on the afternoon of the 7th.and as there is no snow in this part of Manitoba at the present time there was no obstacle to our making an estimate as to the value of the property. On the morning of the 8th. I got Mr.Iverach and the farmer Mr.Perry,who is a practical farmer to go all over the quarter again and I send you their signed report on same. This is a very rough and broken quarter section,the north half is about 150 feet higher than the south 80 acres,and with a steep hill. The whole quarter is covered thickly with stone &\nand the south half is very bad. The main value to the school is its proximity and its use as a pasture for sheep, cattle, and horses, and the never failing supply of water in the river. There is also say about 5 or 600 cords of small standing poplar wood worth at least $1.00 a cord in the bush. I would estimate the value of this property to the school at $15.00 per acre. I drove over the S.W. \u00bc of section 8 which immediately adjoins the \u00bd in 5 on the north, and for the purpose of grain and root farming it would be just what the school wants, as there is about 100 acres of virgin soil without stone. There is some bush and brush on this 100 acres, but it could all be broken up with a small expense. The portion of this \u00bd south of the C.P.R. and adjoining 5 is of little use except for pasture. This quarter can be bought for about $35.00 an acre, or a trade might be made for the quarter section owned by the Presbyterian Church at say a difference of fifteen dollars an acre, this Church owned land is too far away from the school for profitable working. The lots shown on the sketch sent me 211 to 214 belonging to the Railway Co. are of no particular value except to square up the property, as they are a bed of surface stone, and I would advise that no higher than $20.00 an acre be paid for these blocks and streets. In any event the 28 acres to the west of the school site should be bought at the price of 40\u00a2 an acre, as it should be owned by the school.

McLean,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nYour letter of December 30th received. I regret exceedingly that you could not find it convenient to purchase the land that is necessary for the carrying on of the work among the children at the Birtle School. Of course it must be distinctly understood that these Indians are wards of the Government, and, if you insist on large buildings, institutional work and farming as conditions connected with these schools, the Government will have to furnish the equipment that is necessary, as we are not going to do this any longer. So that, if we cannot get the land, it simply means that we cannot do the work, and this department will have to be neglected.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nGeneral Superintendent of Home Missions\nPresbyterian Church in Canada.\nEXTRACT.\n\nReport of Inspector S.J. Jackson on the Birtle Boarding School.\n\nThere is also the question of buying the 26 acres that lies to the west of the school and that is now owned by Mr. Crawford. This land is now held on a yearly lease and it should be purchased at once for $40.00 per acre. The new playground for the girls is situated partly on this property and nearly all the school garden is also on this land. If this property should be sold by the owner to some other person, this school would have to go out of business.\n\nReport dated, May 27th, 1915.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe have an Agent at Syracuse, N.Y., Mr. J. S. Crawford, who keeps writing me at intervals about the disposal of some land, a lot of about 28\u00bd acres, which appears to be near Birtle, Man. I do not know anything whatever about this land, but Mr. Crawford, who is now well up in years and does not always make himself plain, says that the Women's Presbyterian Board of Canada has purchased this block of land, either for an Indian School or on which an Indian School now stands; he says that the matter of sale and payment has been dealt with by your Department and he is asking that a cheque be sent to him soon.\n\nI wonder if you would be good enough to have some member of your staff send me a little history of this particular case so that I will be in a position to reply to Mr. Crawford.\n\nD. C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent of Immigration.\nJuly 20, 1915.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,-\n\nI have your note of the 17th instant, with reference to the property at Birtle owned by Mr. J. S. Crawford; we had some recommendations that this piece of land should be purchased for the Birtle industrial school property; this school is owned by the Presbyterian Church and the Department merely pays for the management at a per capita grant for the Indian pupils in attendance.\n\nMr. Crawford called upon me some time ago and asked for a decision in the matter of the purchase: it does not seem to be advisable to buy the land, and, so far as we are concerned, the matter is closed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. D. Scott, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Immigration,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. J. S. Crawford, who is referred to in the letter from the Superintendent of Immigration, is the reputed owner of 25 acres of land which adjoins the Birtle Boarding School property on the north and west sides. Mr. Crawford's land has been leased by the school authorities for a number of years and the Presbyterian church is very anxious that the Department should purchase it for the use of the school. Mr. Inspector Jackson, in his last report on this school, states that the new play-ground for the girls is partly situated on this property as well as nearly all of the school garden and if it should be sold to some other person the school would have to go out of business. The correspondence shows that Mr. Crawford is willing to dispose of the land for $40.00 an acre. I am sending you the Birtle school file and have turned out a sketch which shows the location of Mr. Crawford's land. A good deal of correspondence has taken place in regard to this land and on the 30th of December, last, Rev. Dr. Grant was told that the Department regrets that it has no funds available for the purchasing of any land for this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just had an interview with Mr. Crawford, and I understand that he has offered you the twenty-eight acres adjoining the Birtle Indian School at $40.00 per acre, and that your Inspector has reported on it. Now, this property is necessary for our work there, and it seems to me that the Government ought to purchase these acres. Our Committee has recommended, and our Principal has asked that the land be secured in the interests of the work. We are using the land at the present time. Now, I wrote you sometime ago about this matter, but you decided that the Government would not buy it. I am wondering if they would do so now. If Mr. Crawford should sell this land to anybody else, it might hamper our work there very much.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMrs. Scott,\n\nIn further reference to the request of the Presbyterian Church authorities for the purchase of 28 acres of land owned by Mr. J. S. Crawford, which bounds the Birtle Boarding School property on the north and east sides, I beg to say that for the past twenty-four years Mr. Crawford has been trying to dispose of this property to the Department for the use of the Birtle School. On the 16th of January, 1891, he was told that \"as the Presbyterians are managing the institution at Birtle and as they have acquired land at other points in connection with their schools, possibly you might effect an arrangement with them.\"\n\nThe Birtle school has rented the property during this time and, as Mr. Crawford now wishes to dispose of it, they wish the Department to assume the cost of purchase. Mr. Crawford offers to sell at $40.00 an acre.\n\nMr. Inspector Jackson, who has reported on this matter, states that the new playground for the\ngirls is partly situated on this property, as well as nearly all of the school garden, and, if it should be sold to some other person, the school would have to go out of business. The water supply for this school is obtained from the pumping station of the C. P. R. and the pipe line runs along the Crawford property on the west side and, when opposite the school, crosses this property to connect with the main building. There is also a well on the property and the whole of the water supply of the school is had on the property or passes through it.\n\nThe school would be badly hampered if they lost control of this property, but, as it is to their interest to secure it, they should furnish the funds. The Birtle School is owned by the Presbyterian Church and it is a question for the Department to say whether it would be prepared to purchase this property. Up to the present it has refused to do so.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would you please let me have a report on suitable properties in the immediate vicinity of Birtle. I hope that the Department can secure an appropriation for new buildings next year.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, No. 106-1-9, and I am pleased to know that you have in view the building of a new school at Birtle. I am of the opinion, however, that it would be a mistake to build this school on any of the reserves in this agency, as they are widely scattered, and a school situated on any one of them would be off to one side. Besides, it is much easier to run a school that is located near a town - easier to keep a staff and to keep supplies on hand, and also to look after the pupils medically.\n\nIn conversation with the Hon. Mr. Prefontaine, Minister of Agriculture in the Manitoba Government, the other day, I was surprised to find that he was more or less disposed to consider the selling of the Experimental Station, at Birtle. However, he did not give me any definite promise that he would do this, but asked me to take the matter up with him the next time I was in Winnipeg, which I promised to do. If this property could be purchased at a reasonable price we would have a complete set of buildings ready for our work, with the exception of the main building for the school proper.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M.

As I am desirous of having an early decision in this connection, I should be grateful if you would correspond with the Manitoba Minister of Agriculture without delay, if it is not your intention to be in Winnipeg in the near future. You will please keep me informed concerning the results of your negotiations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M.

I am motoring to Elkhorn today and will stay there tonight and go over to Birtle in the morning. I expect to be back here Sunday night and on Monday will send you a report. Of course, I shall merely report as to the suitability of the property for our purposes; the matter of price will be taken up with Mr. Prefontaine personally at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

NOV. 5th, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 16th October, No. 106-1-9, and my letter to you of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that I have just returned from Birtle where I made a thorough examination of the Dominion Government Experimental Station, which consists of 320 acres of land, quite suitable for the purposes of an Indian Boarding School.\n\nOf the 320 acres, 120 are under cultivation. This area is divided into six plots where different rotation crops are grown. I saw samples of the grain grown this year, which were of the very best, and the yield per acre has been high. The outside of the farm is fenced with page wire, and the six sub-divisions are also fenced with page wire on cedar posts.\n\nThe buildings consist of the following,-\n\nHouse 24 x 28, divided into four rooms.\nThis would not be suitable for a Principal's residence, but would be quite satisfactory for the residence of a farm foreman.\nCottage, small and of little value, with two bedrooms and a lean-to kitchen.\nBarn, 60 x 24, divided off to make accommodation for 10 horses and 12 cows, in addition to two box stalls.\nImplement Shed, 42 x 50 - well built. This building is not floored but would be suitable for our purposes.\nGranary, 26 x 28, in poor shape.\nPoultry House, 16 x 32, in poor condition but could be put into good shape at little expense.\nSheep Shed, 40 x 40, built of rough lumber.\nOutside feeding pen built of rough lumber.\nPig sty and house 36 x 16, in splendid shape.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nThere is a well 240 feet deep, with 5-5/8\" iron casing, in which I am told there is an unlimited supply of water. This water seems to me to be just fair, but it is fit for domestic purposes. There is a little taste of iron in it but not much.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned equipment there are 8 horses, 21 cattle, 12 sheep and 10 hogs, which I do not think the Department would be called upon to buy.\n\nNo price has yet been mentioned by the Provincial Government for the Station. My own opinion, which is given for your own private information, is that the buildings are worth about $12,000.00, the fence perhaps $3000.00, and the land $35.00 an acre. However, this is just my estimate, and it might be worth a little more. Of course, I would not mention these figures to the Government. I am waiting to have an interview with Mr. Prefontaine to find out what valuation they put on the property. I will be in Winnipeg some time in the near future and will take the matter up and make a final report to you.\n\nIf this property were taken over the Department would be called upon to build a main school house and a Principal's residence, and this would be all.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M.

In addition to the price on the buildings, property and fencing, they have submitted prices on the implements, stock, lighting plant, etc., and the total amounts to $38,856.85. This also includes a quantity of feed and seed of a high grade, which in itself amounts to $5619.00.\n\nMy own opinion is that it would be a wonderful thing for our Department if we could take over this stock in the event of a purchase of the property being made. The price which has been placed on the stock is just about what we would expect to pay for ordinary grade cattle, and these are by no means grade cattle, three of them being pedigreed and the others eligible for pedigree. Details in connection with the farm were fully set out in my report of the 8th November. I may say that the machinery is all in good shape.\n\n-I believe-\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nI believe that the services of the man who has been operating this farm could be retained at a reasonable figure, and he could carry on under the supervision of the School Principal, or in other words, act as Farming Instructor.\n\nThe Department would be called upon to erect the main school building, and if it were felt that funds could not be found to provide a Principal's residence just now, I believe that the existing house could be utilized for that purpose for a year or two.\n\nIn my opinion, this is an excellent opportunity to obtain a splendid property, and if we could obtain it for between $35,000 and $35,000 the price I consider would be low. Mr. Prefontaine is very anxious to get this transaction closed if the Department has any idea of purchasing, so that he will be able to bring the matter before the next session of the legislature, which opens in about a month's time. Of course, the session will continue for some time after it is opened.\n\nI should be glad if you would give this matter your consideration. I think I have given you all the information I possibly can in regard to it. An Inventory of the property and equipment is herewith enclosed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nJanuary 11, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nRE: New Site for Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nI have read Mr. Commissioner Graham's letter concerning the Manitoba Government's offer to sell their demonstration farm near Birtle, and I have studied the inventory showing the land, buildings, live stock, implements and other chattels. At the outset, I wish to concur in Mr. Graham's remarks that here is an excellent opportunity to obtain a splendid property.\n\nThe selection of the farm by the Manitoba Government for an experimental station is sufficient evidence of the quality of the land. The size of the property - 320 acres - is suitable for our purpose. The buildings, stock, implements, etc., are very similar to what is required for an Indian residential school. No doubt, a suitable site can be found for a main building. There is nothing to indicate that the water supply would be inadequate for our purposes; but I recommend enquiries in this regard be made at once.\n\nThe price set by the Manitoba Government is divisible as follows:\n\n- Land (320 a.) $9,590.00\n- Buildings $10,545.00\n- Live stock $5,096.75\n- Agricultural implements $4,808.50\n- Light and water supply $1,345.00\n- Fence $1,625.00\n- Crop and seed $5,619.50\n- Miscellaneous $260.00\n\nTotal: $38,886.85\n\nThe inventory shows that there are more agricultural implements, live stock and seed grain on the property than the Department needs for the Birtle Indian Residential School. The prices placed on these items total nearly $16,000.00. I believe the following are surplus to our requirements and should either not be acquired or sold after purchase:\n\n- Live stock:\n  - 4 horses $500\n  - 4 steers and 5 cows $500\n  - 4 calves \" 1 bull $400\n  - 94 sheep $1,200\n  - 18 hogs $250\n  - Agricultural implements (estimated) $1,000.00\n- Crop (estimated) $4,000.00\n- Lighting plant $500.00\n- Miscellaneous equipment (the apiary) $80.00\n\nTotal: $8,550.00\n\nThis suggests...\nThis suggests that the net cost of the property to this Department would be approximately $30,000.00, which leads me to urge that the Manitoba Government's offer be favourably considered.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this figure with the cost of establishing the Chapleau and Portage Indian Residential Schools. In the case of these institutions, property was purchased and outbuildings, live stock and agricultural equipment were provided. In neither case is there a special residence for the principal. Over $27,000 has been expended at Chapleau for these purposes and the farm is not nearly as desirable as the one now under consideration. The farm, the outbuildings and agricultural equipment at the Portage School have cost the Department over $49,000.\n\nThe property offered by the Manitoba Government appears to be very suitable for the Birtle Indian Residential School. The farm is a going concern\u2014a big asset to the school management. The cost is well within the expenditure usually necessary in similar cases, and I wish to recommend the purchase to your favourable consideration.\n\nRussell Heirier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Charles Stewart -\n\nI beg to attach hereto a report of the Superintendent of Indian Education on the subject of a new site for the Birtle Indian residential school. The estimates for the current year provide funds for the erection of the building and I have been considering the location of the school. When I was in that district in 1927 I looked at various suggested sites. Mr. Graham, at that time, had heard a rumour that the Manitoba Government wished to sell the demonstration farm near Birtle, and I looked at this property which seemed to me very desirable. Mr. Graham has since quietly investigated and the subject matter of Mr. Ferrier's report shows the result.\n\nI am very much in favour of purchasing this property. It is admirably located, and in every way suits our purpose, and from a financial standpoint it is an economical purchase. It would not be in the best interests of our work to locate this school on an Indian reserve. This property is near the town of Birtle and is otherwise advantageously located.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\nJanuary 22, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have discussed your 201-11 of the 4th instant with Mr. Stewart, and, while we believe the Provincial Demonstration Farm at Birtle would be a fine site for the proposed new school, it is considered unnecessary to acquire the live stock, grain, implements, etc. The price set on the land and buildings, including the water supply and fencing, amounts to approximately $22,400. Would the Provincial Government make other arrangements for the disposal of the live stock, implements, equipment, lighting plant, apiary and crop and sell to us the farm and buildings. Please make enquiries and see if you cannot get an attractive proposal from the proper authorities.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. M.

I note that you do not desire to purchase the live stock, grain, implements, etc., at this point, but would probably be willing to purchase the land and buildings, including the water supply and fencing.

On the 4th instant, I wrote Mr. Commissioner Graham, of Regina, to make a report and recommendation regarding a building site and farm, and I informed him of Mrs. Patterson's offer. She had written direct to the Department a few weeks ago. I am sure Mr. Graham will give her offer the proper consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. Allison Glen, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 106-1-9 dated the 23rd ultimo, I have been giving the matter of the proposed new Birtle Indian Residential School site serious consideration and I believe that the Department would be well advised to build the new school on the Waywayseecappo Reserve where there is excellent farming, pasturage and hay lands. I am satisfied that there would be no difficulty in obtaining the consent of the Indians of the Waywayseecappo Band to set aside the necessary land required for school purposes. Placing the school on this reserve would bring it to a more central location for the Indians. The railway runs through the north east corner of the reserve and there would be direct railway connection with the Keesakowenin and Rolling River Reserves, and as it is hoped that we may in time induce these bands to amalgamate with and move to the Waywayseecappo Reserve, the arrangement would be very satisfactory for the future. Apart from this, I feel that the move would be a good one. There is no benefit to be derived by having the school located near the Town of Birtle, and I think the new location would be conducive to more efficient work. The only reserve affected would be the Birdtail and it would make very little difference to them. They are only a small band.\n\nI would be glad if you would give this matter consideration and, in the event of it receiving your approval, I would immediately take steps to have the location on the reserve selected and make arrangements with the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indians Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nApril 19, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 201-LIA of the 8th instant, with reference to a site for the proposed new Birtle Indian Residential School. Your recommendation commends itself to the Department, and I should be grateful if you would take early steps to select land on the Waywayseecappo Reserve, sufficient for the purposes of an Indian residential school. As Mr. Currie is very practical, he should accompany the officer who makes the selection. You should then take steps to make arrangements with the Indians for the setting aside of the land in question for school purposes. When you make your report, the Department would be grateful if you would comment on the possibility of securing an adequate supply of good water.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nApril 25, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the building programme for the Birtle Indian Residential School.\n\nA few days ago, Mr. Indian Commissioner Graham's recommendation, that a site be selected on the Saywayescappo Reserve, was approved and Mr. Graham was requested to have you accompany whatever officer made the selection of the farm and building site. I believe the opposition you anticipate from the other Indian reserves would be but temporary, and, if necessary, the Department would enforce the compulsory clauses of the Indian Act. The Saywayescappo Reserve, from the Department's standpoint, has many advantages. There would be practically no expenditure for the site and farm. It would be on the line of railway which has direct railway connection with the Keesekosomin and Rolling River Reserves. Further, excellent agricultural land can be secured. I may add, however, that no definite decision will be made until after the Department receives Mr. Graham's report.\n\nConcerning the changes in the Architect's plans, I have asked Mr. CYP to correspond with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have to acknowledge Departmental letter, or the 25th Inst., No. 106-1-15. Advising that it was approved, that a site be selected for the Birtle Residential New School on the Reserve at Waywayseecappo. The principal reason, apparently, for the selection of this site being, \"That practically there would be no expenditure for the site or farm.\" My opinion is that it is expensive at the price stated.\n\nI beg to point out a few facts. First, the portion of the Reserve where the Indians of that Band desire the new school located has not an acre of land under cultivation. It will take a lot of money and years of time to develop a farm there that will be revenue producing. Secondly, it is likely to cost hundreds of dollars to get a water supply, of questionable quality. In fact, there is no assurance that an adequate supply is obtainable. In the third place while the Ry. runs through the property giving a tri-weekly service there is no town of any size nearer than Birtle about 25 miles distant. True, the Birdtail Siding is only a mile away, it has one country store and two elevators, Rossburn and Angusville two tiny villages are each about seven miles distant. There the nearest Doctors live, to these places with mud roads over which for many months of every year an Auto cannot travel. This place is certainly out of the world, hid in a place where it will never be seen by the public. A place where it is going to be hard to retain a Staff. A Staff of an Indian School require a change after being with Indian Children.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\nday after day, when their half day off, or other times when off duty comes round, there should be some place where they might go to make a little change. Such a change is not to be found near the Reserve. In fact the vicinity of the Waywayseecappo Reserve is just a little \"Hell.\" It is only a pity the poor Indian has to associate and live in such surroundings. It is surrounded by a Galician settlement. And these people are a curse to our people. Peddling bootleg whiskey and every demoralizing evil you can think of. Court cases are constantly going on. As many as eight cases sometimes in an afternoon. The Mounted Police are never out of a job in that community. To my mind it will be a serious blunder if our new school is moved to such a place. It is only by getting our children away from such surroundings having them here, under our care and training until their character is developed that we can ever hope to uplift and improve the Race.\n\nAside from this foreign settlement, there is sure to be considerable trouble with young unmarried Indian men hanging about the school trying to make love to the girls. I found this difficulty at Alberni where the School was close to the Reserve. The price one must pay for safety is close constant vigilance night and day. As I mentioned in my former letter, the Indians of the Rolling River and the Keesekoonenin Reserve are strongly opposed to the new school being built on the Waywayseecappo Reserve and to this you say the Department will compel these Indians to send their children to the new school, quite so, but the coercion will only increase their bitterness and antagonism. We cannot forget that we are trying to do mission work with these people and to do effective work must have their friendship and everything that antagonizes only serves to make the work the harder. Their antagonism will tend to cause them to complain about any little thing, about the school, that displeases them. To my mind harmony will prevail if a site is chosen away from any of the Reserves. And as Birtle has for so long been their educational centre I see no cause for a change from this district.\n\nSince I have known that the deal we were trying to put thru with the Provincial Government for their Demonstration Farm had fallen through I have been looking about for a suitable site, to suggest to the Indian Department. Such a site I have found. It belongs to one Mr. T. Edmunson, it is four miles north of Birtle. The Demonstration Farm was three miles south. Mr. Edmunson has a section of land on the main Provincial Highway, Winnipeg to Edmonton. About half of the section is under cultivation, 87 acres summer fallowed last year. This is a good clean farm, well suited for mixed farming. Has a fine stone house with bath, a small house for his farmer, a barn fair condition, it will not meet our need but certainly has considerable value, there are about ten portable graineries. And this place has the four things I specially had in mind in looking for a good location. Plenty of good land for agriculture, a good building site, good drainage, and last and most important an abundant supply of good water. This water supply cannot be valued, for our purpose, less than $5000.00. It is of choice quality. This farm is as close to Foxwarren as it is to Birtle. Here we are on the C.P. Ry., Winnipeg -- Edmonton Br., and have two trains daily each way. Mr. Edmunson is asking $25.00 an acre for this property. To my mind for\nour purpose, this is a snap. This is a farm Mr Edmunson has made ample to retire on. And would be a revenue producer from the very start. This property is slightly rolling, and I have picked out a site that would be a commanding situation for the new school, slightly higher than the highway or any of the surrounding district, and would admirably lend itself to making the school on such a site an imposing structure. Something that would be a real attraction on this much travelled Provincial Highway.\n\nTaking into consideration, the over 300 acres under cultivation, the buildings, the water supply, the roads, the convenience of the Ry., the Doctor, and other advantages. This property is cheaper at Mr Edmunsons price than the Indian Reserve is as a gift, I have no doubt in the world if the Department will send out a man and let me show him over the two properties, Such a man will concur in what I have placed before you in this letter. I have carefully gone over both locations. What I tell you is no heresay. And I believe my experience both as Principal of an Indian School and as a farmer enables me to judge aright in this matter.\n\nOne matter \"I nearly overlooked, it is or slight consideration. Is High school opportunities for a few of our pupils At present we have one girl doing splendid in Birtle High school. Birtle is a consolidated school district. From the site I have suggested our Pupils might continue to attend Birtle High School and still reside in the Indian Residential School. This property is in the Birtle Consolidated School area, and the school vans convey pupils back and forth. This advantage does not exist at the proposed Reserve site.\n\nPerhaps I may appear to be putting my views rather strong. But I cannot help being interested in this matter. A year ago after the site had been chosen and the new school at Kenora, for our Church had been started, I was offered the Principalship of that new School. But I turned it down and prefered to wait just for the one reason that I wished to see the new Birtle School built such, that I would like to continue to carry on in.\n\nI remember Dr. Scott what you said in 1927 when you were at Birtle, \"That you did not want any mistake made in the site chosen\" I have always kept this in mind. I was satisfied had we secured the Demonstration Farm no mistake would have been made, I am just as satisfied now that Mr Edmunsons place will give perfect satisfaction.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to Department's letter of the 19th ultimo, and also to a telegram dated the 4th May with reference to a site for the proposed Indian Residential School to replace the one that is now at Birtle. I note from your telegram that the Church authorities and the Rev. Principal are opposed to the site on the reserve, and at your request I saw Mr. Currie in Regina and made arrangements with him to meet me at Birtle. Mr. Currie informed me that the opposition to building on the reserve came from Toronto, and that he, personally, was more or less indifferent about the matter. The reason for not wishing to have the school on the reserve is that it would be in too close proximity to the Indians. This to my mind is not a good and sufficient reason. As a matter of fact it has been the policy of the Department ever since I can remember to build most of the Indian schools on the reserves. Within the last four or five years we have built two schools on the Blood Reserve, two on the Blackfoot, one on Keesekoosne, two on Onion Lake, and are about to build another on Gordon's, so that as far as our policy is concerned we would only be adhering to it in building on the reserve. It rests entirely with the management of a school as to whether the Indians will be allowed to make themselves a nuisance by coming around the place. My contention is that we should have our work where the Indians are. While I was in the Birtle district I visited the Waywayseecappo reserve and procured authority from the Band to locate on any section of land where we might decide to build a school. A site could be selected within five or six miles of a good-sized town, and two miles from a railroad. The land, of course, is absolutely clean, as it has never been farmed, and the Indians are very anxious to have the school situated on the reserve. It is a question now as to whether the Department will agree to building it there, in view of the opposition that has been raised, and\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nif it is not built on the reserve we shall be put to the expense of buying a farm somewhere in the district, possibly halfway between Waywayseecappo and Riding Mountain, at or near Shoal Lake. Mr. Wurrie had already seen a farm that he thought might answer the purpose, but as I did not know what the attitude of the Department would be with regard to the matter, I, of course, did not see this farm. If it were decided to build on the reserve, water would first have to be found, and I am not at all sure whether a suitable supply can be obtained. There are lakes adjacent to several of the sites, but these are only small and shallow, and we might run up against the same difficulty as we have at Gordon's if we were to depend on lakes.\n\nI should be glad to have your advice in this matter, as I know the time is fast approaching when operations should begin. Farms with buildings on can be bought for $25.00 an acre, but I do not expect we would get clean land, which means a great deal. Mr. Currie is a cattle man and to my mind it would be a great advantage to have a school farm on the reserve where an abundance of hay could be procured from the Indians.\n\nThe surrender which I took from the Indians is attached hereto, in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE.\n\nREGINA, SASK., May 25th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, and have noted the contents. I will take steps at the earliest possible date to try and locate a suitable improved farm for the Birtle School.\n\nI would point out, however, that it is most dangerous to select a farm at this particular season. Manitoba, as you know, is, in some parts, infested with weeds; in fact, there are districts where the farmers are abandoning their farms, because they cannot make a living on them owing to the weeds, and to buy a farm on the word of any owner would be a great mistake. It would be most difficult, in fact, impossible, for a person to go this week, for instance, and see for himself whether the land is infested with weeds. The weeds have not all started to grow yet, and some of the worst infested farms in the country would look all right in the early spring. It is to avoid this that I am asking that I delay the matter of going to select a farm for at least two weeks. I appreciate thoroughly the fact that the season is advancing and that the choice must be made without delay. However, if you are satisfied that I should take a chance and proceed at once and not wait until the weeds develop, I will do so. I am merely suggesting that the other course be followed. I will try to select a farm closer to the town, probably between the Waywayseecappo's and Riding Mountain. However, this is not going to be a very easy task as I know the district is not free from weeds, and to put an institution there, such as we are likely to build, would mean that we would never get the weeds eradicated and we would come in for considerable criticism.\n\nDuncan C.

Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nMay 30th, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI have your note of May 25th regarding the site of the Birtle school. The Principal, Mr. Currie, reports as follows with reference to the Edmunson Farm:\n\n\"Since I have known that the deal we were trying to put thru with the Provincial Government for their Demonstration Farm had fallen through I have been looking about for a suitable site, to suggest to the Indian Department. Such a site I have found. It belongs to one Mr. T. Edmunson, it is four miles north of Birtle. The Demonstration Farm was three miles south. Mr. Edmunson has a section of land on the main Provincial Highway, Winnipeg to Edmonton. About half of the section is under cultivation, 87 acres summer fallowed last year. This is a good clean farm, well suited for mixed farming; has a fine stone house with bath; a small house for his farmer; a barn, fair condition. It will not meet our need but certainly has considerable value. There are about ten portable graineries. And this place has the four things I specially had in mind in looking for a good location; plenty of good land for agriculture; a good building site; good drainage; and last and most important an abundant supply of good water. This water supply cannot be valued for our purpose less than $5000. It is of choice quality. This farm is as close to Foxwarren as it is to Birtle. Here we are on the C.P.R., Winnipeg - Edmonton Br. and have two trains daily, each way. Mr. Edmunson is asking $25.00 an acre for this property. To my mind for our purpose this is a snap. This is a farm Mr. Edmunson has made ample to retire on. And would be a revenue producer from the very start. This property is slightly rolling and I have picked out a site that\n\nW. Mr. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nwould be a commanding situation for the new school,\nslightly higher than the highway or any of the surrounding\ndistrict, and would admirably lend itself to making the\nschool on such a site an imposing structure. Something\nthat would be a real attraction on this much travelled\nProvincial Highway.\"\n\nI note what you say about the weed\nsituation but I note also that Mr. Currie says that this is\na good, clean farm. I wish you had looked at this property\nwhen you were at Birtle and thus obviate the necessity\nof going back again, but I think you should, at the earliest\ndate possible, go over this property with the Principal.\nWe have lost a good deal of time now and I fail to under-\nstand why the decision that we had arrived at, that the\nschool should not be placed on the reserve, was ever\ndeparted from.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Currie and telling\nhim that you will examine the farm. If you are satisfied\nyou had better get an option on it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am instructing the Indian Commissioner to examine the Edmanson farm and have sent him a copy of that portion of your letter of April 29th, which describes the property. I am most anxious that progress should be made with the building without delay. Kindly let me hear from you again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. R. M. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nDear Dr Scott,\n\nIt is a week since I got your letter of 30 May. But I have no word yet from the Indian Commissioner\u2014I understand his inaction to mean just what he said \u201cBirtle will not get the school because they looked the purchase of the Birtle Demonstration Farm.\u201d\n\nIf it is left to the Indian Commissioner, I am expecting the Edmonson property\u2014or any other Birtle location\u2014turned down for some reason, and that inaction and delay to be, in order, long enough that little or nothing will be done this year.\n\nI took Indian Agent Lazenby over the Edmonson property\u2014his expression was\u2014\u201cI do not see how the Indian Commissioner can find fault with that property.\u201d\n\nI wish you could spare the time to come and look the property\u2014if you were in a hurry little time need be taken\u2014there is good train.\nBirtle, Man.\n\nService here from Winnipeg\u2014and the property is so conveniently located\u2014you can see it and catch the next train back to Winnipeg. One train leaves Winnipeg daily at 8:55 A.M., reaches Birtle 4:30 P.M., you can look over the property the same evening and catch the midnight train back to Winnipeg at 7:30 next morning.\n\nOr you can leave Winnipeg 11:15 P.M., be at Birtle 10 to 6 in the morning\u2014look over the property and catch 9:39 A.M. train, same day and be back to Winnipeg 4:40 P.M. Of course if you can give us a longer visit we will be very pleased. A longer visit would allow you to see \"Waywayseeappo Reserve.\"\n\nIt is most unpleasant to write such a letter, but I cannot rest seeing work deliberately held up\u2014simply because the Birtle Citizens wished to retain the Birtle Demonstration Farm.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, instructing me to proceed to Birtle with a view of selecting a suitable farm for the proposed new Indian Boarding School at that point.\n\nI think perhaps there has been some misunderstanding with regard to this matter. I was certainly under the impression that no definite decision had been arrived at in regard to not building on an Indian reserve. If I had a discussion with you in connection with such a decision I have no recollection of it - it has gone out of my mind entirely.\n\nIn your letter of the 16th ultimo you refer to a letter of mine written on the 8th October last, in which you state I expressed a preference to locating this institution at some central point, adjacent to a town, rather than on a reserve. I quite remember making this statement, but my idea was not that there was any disadvantage in having the school on a reserve, as nothing was further from my mind, but merely that we should endeavour to select a location that would be most convenient for the handling of the work, and in this connection I may say that the farm which I had selected on the reserve is about the same distance from a town as the land that is being offered for sale by Mr. Edmunson. As a matter of fact, Mr. Edmunson's farm will be taking us further away from the work than the location of the existing school, which is a disadvantage. The Waywayseecappo reserve is very close.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nclose to the town of Rossburn, as you will see, and this is almost as good a town as Birtle. There is also another town even closer. However, I am not writing this letter for the purpose of trying to induce you to change your mind in the matter, but merely to explain why I took the action which I did. You state you wish I had looked at the Edmunson property while at Birtle, thus obviating the necessity of going back again, but, as stated in my letter of the 25th ultimo, I would not consider buying land at that time of the year, as it would be impossible to judge as to whether it were clean or not. Then again, I cannot think that simply because Mr. Currie has recommended one farm the Department would decide to buy it without looking at any others.\n\nI may say that when at Birtle I found an ideal location on the reserve which the Indians would let us have gratis for a school site, and the possibility of the Department's refusing to locate on this section of land, which is perfectly clean, and nearer to town than the land which Mr. Currie has proposed we look at did not occur to me. I cannot see that I have done anything in the matter that has not been perfectly in order.\n\nI am going to Birtle this week and shall look at Mr. Edmunson's farm and others and report to you fully.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nIndian Residential School\n\"H. B. CURRIE, Principal\"\n\nBirtle, Man. 14 June 1929\n\nMr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nMr. Graham, Indian Commissioner, from Regina, his Inspector Mr. Christianson, Indian Agent Layton, myself today looked over Mr. Edmonson's farm also Mrs. Bragg's farm about four miles south of Kelso. The latter farm is about 13 miles east of Birtle, not in the Birtle Municipality.\n\nThis is the first time I looked over Mrs. Bragg's place. There is five quarter sections in this place. There is five quarter sections in this place.\n\n800 acres less 12 acres, deducted by a river, highway running through the farm, leaving the farm in two parts. About four hundred and fifty (450) acres has been cultivated. This year there is about 58 acres under grain crop and 400 in grass or hay. Some years this land is wet enough to cut hay (in part of it). The marsh land is dry enough to cut since 1922. Adjacent to this property is thousands of acres of marsh land and while Mrs. Bragg's is better than marsh, it is low, cold soil, I am sure will suffer from frosts.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIn fact, last week and early this we had some frost at night. Some garden stuff was touched, but on Mr. Brayshaw's place today was the first place I came across frozen grain. Their wheat was frozen - Mr. Brayshaw said about 8 bushel of what was all they could raise and said that their place was not suitable for wheat, but would raise good oats. My candid opinion is this is a good grass and stock farm. But to raise grain and garden truck so important in an Indian school, I believe you would meet with constant losses from frosts.\n\nThis property is about 9 miles west of Shoal Lake, and the nearest doctor. There is no high school available as we have at Birtle.\n\nThe Brayshaw farm is worn wire outside fencing, appears to have been well farmed. The buildings are old and not of much value. House is fair condition, large white brick.\n\nMrs. Brayshaw wants $30 an acre, which will cost about $25,000 as against about $16,000 for the Edmonson property, that I believe would suit us better. The Brayshaw water supply has to be ascertained - as against an assured ample supply of the choicest quality on the Edmonson place.\nBefore looking at the above properties today Mr Graham again said Birtle would lose the School. This confirms my former opinion that Mr Edmonson's place would have \"some defect.\" As Mrs Brayshaws place is fair, but only second best, I do not intend to oppose it. But if the school is to be started this year there must be no more delays\u2014And Mr Graham is ready to do anything if it is done outside of Birtle, while I say I will not oppose the Brayshaw place, I will not approve of it, as it is against my best judgment. I would not put my own money in the Brayshaw place for mixed farming\u2014and I would, in the Edmonson place.\n\nMr Graham asked me not to oppose the Brayshaw place\u2014and I will not\u2014but you have my judgment in the matter, and I will be free to say were it a stock farm only I were after Mrs Brayshaw's place, would well meet the need, but plenty of vegetables and garden produce are invaluable in maintaining health of pupils\u2014I believe I am able in saying vegetables on the Brayshaw place will be frozen five years out of ten.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI wrote you last night, telling you of our inspection of Edmonson and Brayshey farms. Today, quietly and alone, I made another trip to the Brayshey farm. Yesterday I got my bearings; today I got more detail. I like the Brayshey place today \"as a farm\" better than I did yesterday. But I have less use for it as a school site. Braysheys have shallow wells and a deep well 150 feet deep, yet from authentic information I obtained today, they catch rain water in tanks from the house roof and retain same for drinking and domestic use, and when they come to Birtle they bring a can along and take it back full of drinking water. When people will carry drinking water 12 or 13 miles, you may guess how much they appreciate their wells.\n\nLast evening when we parted with Mr. Graham he said he would make his report today. If the Department approved of the Brayshey place, Mr. Lazenby\u2014Indian Agent\u2014and I went to test for water. I let the place would not be bought unless there was plenty of good water.\n\nWith the information of the Brayshey water situation\u2014and other water conditions of others\u2014I fear good water will not be obtained. Considerable money will be expended and valuable time passing\u2014holding up building operations.\nurgently needed. Mr. Graham says \"there is no reason why the school should be at Birtle,\" I say \"when we get all we want in one site, at reasonable cost, at Birtle, why waste all summer trying to find something as good elsewhere,\" which is common sense! I am disgusted with all this obstinacy - and many day may bring my resignation.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

Edmonson, situated 4 miles north of Birtle on the main highway. I went to this place first, and I consider it most unsuitable. The farm is badly broken up with coulees and stone ridges, and 50% of the land is covered with bluffs, and above all, the land is, to say the least, dirty. When Mr. Currie stated that this was a clean farm he did not state facts. I doubt very much whether Mr. Edmonson made sufficient on this land to retire on, which he states he did. However, this does not matter. There is only one building on the place that might be used; the rest are unsuitable for our purpose. The stable was never completed although Mr. Edmonson lived there for years. The house Mr. Currie speaks about is a stone one and well built, but it could never be used for a Principal's residence as it is too far away from the well and building site. The highway would be half a mile away from the site that Mr. Currie suggests. To put buildings costing $80,000.00 on this land is the last thing in the world I would recommend. I do not think you could get any expert to pass this farm as being suitable. It has a good well, it is true, but this is all it has to recommend it.\n\nI next visited the farm of one Andrew Doig, situated near the location of the Birtle Experimental Farm. I saw sufficient there to satisfy me that this Duncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nfarm would not suit us and I also learned there was no water.\n\nI also heard of another farm and saw it from the road. I did not make a thorough examination of this farm, because it did not have a water supply and could not get one.\n\nI then went to a farm owned by Mrs. Brayshay, which is described as follows:\n\nN.1/2 & S.W.1/4 of Sec. 6, Township 17, Range 24 W.P.M.\nS.1/2 of Sec. 7, Township 17, Range 24 W.P.M.\n\nThis farm is on the same main highway as that which passes the site suggested by Mr. Currie, the only difference being that the building site is right on the highway where it should be, whereas, in the case of Mr. Edmunson's farm, the buildings would be half a mile from the road between bluffs. This farm consists of approximately 800 acres of land. 450 acres of this have been broken and farmed, but five years prior to the owner's death, which occurred last September, the land was sown down to grasses, and the son who assumed charge of the farm is re-breaking this land. It seems to me that this has been a splendid process for cleaning out any weeds that might have been on the land. This farm contains more hay than the school can possibly use. It is well fenced and has as much farming land as the school will ever use, as well as pastures. The corner of the farm is 2\u00bd miles from the Town of Kellos. The site which the buildings are on is 4 miles from Kellos. This is on the same railway line as the Edmunson farm and it passes through the Town of Birtle. I am told that the well is over 150 ft. deep and that water came within 30 ft. of the top; also, that it had been pumped continuously for four hours and there was no sign of any depreciation in the supply. However, this would not be sufficient for me to guarantee that there was water here. The pump was broken and they were using water from another well. If the Department would consider buying this farm we would have to test the well.\ntest the well and this could be done after I receive instructions from you.\n\nI may say that Mrs. Brayshay, the widow who owns the farm, gave me to understand that she would not reduce the price one dollar; she is asking $30.00 an acre for this land. I would say that if the Edmunson Farm is worth $25.00 per acre, this one is worth $50.00. My own opinion is that the Edmunson Farm is worth about $15.00 per acre and this one about $30.00 per acre.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a rough sketch showing the two farms, the Edmunson Farm and the Brayshay Farm. If you decide to buy this farm you will instruct me and I will have the Agent arrange to have a test of the well made. I am sorry that there was such a rush to have this site selected; it would have been of far greater advantage to me and the Department if the selection could have been left a couple of weeks. However, there seemed to be such urgency that I did the best I could and I feel that we are comparatively safe insofar as Mrs. Brayshay's farm is concerned, owing to the fact that the land was sown to grass which has grown on different parts of the land for two, three and four years.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

So sure is the owner of its unfailing supply that he is willing to bear the cost of any test to which the Government may wish to subject it. Also, too, the farm is on the same side of the village as the railway, which means that all hills would be avoided in the hauling of cattle from the station.\n\nThe site is on the motor highway which is being completed between Winnipeg and Edmonton with a fine building site overlooking this highway.

And we have had an eye on it since - Mr. Graham Christianson, Lagely and myself looked this place over and were not ready to give it serious consideration, for the following reasons:\n\nThis place is in a good locality - has plenty of agricultural land and a reasonably good site. The land is considerably cut up by \"sloughs\" and a portion in the front of the place is wet. But the great drawback is water, water in the Birdle district a first consideration. Mr. Dyke says \"plenty of water\" can be had on this place. This may be true but it is not there today. Mr. Dyke's place is about the same distance south of the Birdle station, that the Edmonson place is north. But to get to Mr. Dyke's place all freight must pass through the Birdtail valley. This means a long steep hill down from the Birdle station, into the valley, and up the other side. These hills are nearly a quarter of a mile in length, and when eight or\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott,\nBirtle, Man.\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nJust a short note to report progress. The Well Drillers are down 212 feet on the Fulton place with no prospects of water yet. There are several deep wells in that section, only one (The Demonstration Farm well) is satisfactory, and even it might be taxed beyond capacity to meet the needs of an Indian School. This well already has cost about $350.00 and by the time drilling is finished and a test made for quantity and quality, I do not expect the cost will be less than $500.00. With prospects 90% against success. And a second test, as proposed, if the present well is not a success, is as likely to be as great a failure as the present well. From the data I have obtained of the water situation in this community, my expectation or securing a suitable supply, is not strong.\n\nIn the meantime July will be gone before a site is chosen, and August will be gone before work is likely to be actually started. What chance is there of having much accomplished this year.\n\nI have had several of our Church people see the Edmonson place, and it is all we desire. As it is for us and we are abundantly satisfied with it. We cannot understand why we are to be defeated or delayed in securing it.\n\nWe want it, the Public or Birtle and vicinity have approved of the site as being a suitable one, and the names on that petition are old Residents, farmers, merchants, professional men of all walks and ranks. Surely we are not all in error as to our choice.\n\nOne man \"Cannot approve of the site.\" He never was on. He drove over part of the place in a car but would not go near the spot I had chosen as a site. The only reason he went near it was because he had to. You can lead a horse to water, but you can not make him drink. Because Birtle Citizens blocked his deal for the Demonstration Farm, sweet revenge, would take the school from Birtle Community. Because the Presbyterian Church Officials Opposed the, going elsewhere, sweet revenge, will keep us from getting what we want or make us wait another winter, where we are, before getting it.\n\nThe Churches interests and the Departments wishes are being blocked for REVENGE and the present action is only a show.\n\nThis is a strong condemnation, but time for dallying is past. I propose that you send someone to see the Edmonson Site and get work under way at once. Had this recommendation been agreed to the School might have been well under way. I still stick to my first suggestion, I am not afraid of any inspection the Edmonton place is put to. Its equal certainly cannot be found near Birtle.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie.\nWELL DRILLERS AT BIRTLE ARE DOWN THREE HUNDRED FEET AND NO INDICATIONS OF WATER ARE MOVING TO ANOTHER SITE ON THE SAME FARM\n\nWM GRAHAM.\n\nThis is a collect message, and will be charged to your account unless we are notified at once to the contrary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to confirm the following Night Letter of today's date,\n\n\"Well drillers at Birtle are down three hundred feet and no indications of water - Are moving to another site on the same farm.\"\n\nI may advise you that I expect to have great difficulty in finding water in the district immediately surrounding the town of Birtle. The information I gathered while there was that all the water used by the farmers in that vicinity was from shallow wells, which means, of course, that there is only a limited supply.\n\nI realize that it is the desire of the Department that a farm should be selected in the immediate vicinity of Birtle, but if water cannot be obtained there we will have to go elsewhere. I am absolutely opposed to building a school on the Edmunson farm, which is four miles out of Birtle, and I think every effort should be made to secure water on the farm that we have selected. I have a two months' option on this farm.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBy the end of July we should know the result of the present well being drilled, and I am asking you if it is a failure, to stop further delay\u2014and get the work under way on the Edmonson place, will you kindly wire me if you will do this.\n\nI am ready to co-operate and do everything I can to advance the building of the School\u2014where they are now drilling\u2014ample good water is secured at the present well\u2014I do this knowing it is not as good as the Edmonson place, but I want no more delay, prospecting for water elsewhere on the present property, or some new site.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nThe well on the Fulton place near Birtle was drilled to a depth of 30 feet, with no water, and has been abandoned. The drill moved to the Scantlebury Bros. place adjoining the Fulton place. These properties are located thus and are both held under a 60 day option from 1 July.\n\nThe abandoned well on the Fulton place must have cost close to $500. And I cannot see that there is much better chance of success where they are drilling now on the Scantlebury place. Water may be found but the chance of a well in this territory, with sufficient flow to meet our needs, is very meager. The very best known well in this territory is the demonstration farm well, and Mr. Graham...\nExpressed his doubts that even it would be sufficient for to meet our need.\n\nJuly 24, 1929.\n\nLast evening I was out to the well on the Scantlebury Bros. place, it was down 127 feet, and they are drilling about 35 feet a day. The drillers told me they had instructions to go 400 feet, if water was not sooner found. This drilling is sure to cost $1000. If no water is found in this well - will you insist on the Edmonson place being selected as the site, where we have water choice quality in abundance and everything else we need. And why waste all kinds of money and the whole summer prospecting to find something as good.\n\nSurely this is nothing but a studied attempt to defeat the Departments wishes - and the delay of our new school.\nREGINA SASK 31 1008A\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nHAVE DRILLED ONE HOLE THREE HUNDRED AND ONE FEET THIS HAD TO BE ABANDONED ACCOUNT SOAPSTONE STOP DRILLING ANOTHER HAVE GONE SO FAR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET STOP WELL AT ADJOINING DEMONSTRATION FARM TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET DEEP WILL NOTIFY IMMEDIATELY WE STRIKE WATER\n\nWM GRAHAM\n\n(Printed in Canada)\n\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\n\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD\n\nJ.

August 6th, 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have just had a long distance telephone call from Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who has been at Birtle on and off for the last two weeks in connection with the matter of locating water for the proposed new school at that point. It was necessary to have an officer of the Department there all the time to see that the work was properly carried on and that if water was struck it would be an ample supply. We have now drilled two holes on the farm that I hold options on, which is one mile from Birtle. Both of these holes proved to be dry, although we have gone down over 300 ft. On the same farm, however, we have located a well in a ravine, which is only 19 ft. deep. This well is in a gravel seam and I had Mr. Hamilton put a test on and he reports that he had a pump with a capacity of 900 gallons per hr. working on the well for an hour, and the 900 gals. pumped out in that length of time only reduced the water some 8\". There is a depth of 5\u00bd ft. of water in the well, and the 5\" pumped out comes back within an hour, so that the well should be capable of supplying the demands of the school and more too. The question is, will it supply a lasting demand? I think it will. The only thing that would cause me to question it at all is the fact that the well is only 19 ft. deep.\n\nI do not know that I can do anything further. Personally, I think it would be quite safe to go ahead and build here, but I want to put the matter clearly before you. There are no other farms in the district that have deep wells.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nThis afternoon I drove out to the Scantlebury Bros. place to see how drilling in No. 2 well was progressing. I found the drilling outfit gone, and the well abandoned, after a depth of two hundred and fifty some odd feet had been reached. Soapstone had been struck, and it is said water is not usually found after the soapstone is reached.\n\nThrough the Fulton place a ravine runs, and in this ravine a shallow well is dug\u201418 feet deep\u2014there is about 9 feet of water in this well now. Inspector Hamilton and Agent Lazenby had Jack and engine testing it for a pump, and as for the quality if it is good\u2014well and as for the quantity if it is good\u2014well to my mind it cannot be good out of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\nSlough that surrounds it especially in the spring. From this well they were drawing water to supply the drilling outfit while on the Scantlebury Bros. place. At that time you could at ten feet away smell the foul odor from the tank containing this water. At our present school we are using sewage water for all purposes, Morse all the staff brings a small can for personal use from the wells of the neighbors. This is a condition we must get away from. Mr. Graham's only fault with the Edmonson farm is it has one ridge of stony land running part way through it. This is quite true, but there is abundance of good agricultural land and we can do with a farm that has this one small defect for the sake of all the other choice qualities. Abundance of good agricultural land, this ridge of pasture land, good building site, good drainage, good water in abundance that is open for any test desired for quantity or quality. The crops this year...\nare not good. But Mr. Edmonsons are good, and they are clean, just now is the time when weeds show up\u2014and I was surprised just how clean this place is. And land that will produce crops as cover this place, just now, a year like this, must be soil of the very best.\n\nI am as sure Doctor Scott, as I can be of anything, that had I two hours with you on the Edmonson place, this site question would have been settled last April\u2014and our school would have been well under way today. As it is I fear we are doomed to spend another winter in our present quarters.\n\nI cannot find out what the next move is to be. But I still believe you will keep your feet on the brake and keep us from landing\u2014in an undesirable place\u2014And should our landing be on the Edmonson place\u2014with all my soul I can say\u2014\"Thank the Lord and Dr. Scott.\" Yours faithfully, H.B.C.\nOttawa, August 12, 1929.\n\nJ.

In this instance, the drill passed through gravel and reached quicksand when hope of securing a supply of water was abandoned. The suction of the quicksand and binding of the gravel made it impossible for the Driller to withdraw all the casing, and he was obliged to abandon 105 ft., which explains the charge for that item. The pump and cylinder were bought from him to test the wells, and he was also to be allowed $2.00 a day for the board of himself and one or more men who might be engaged with him in his drilling operations.

I have patiently waited to see what the next move was to be. So far I have no authentic information. I have heard -- but nothing to confirm the report -- that the Dominion Water Power Branch has been requested to have its engineers enquire into a water supply for the Birtle School.\n\nI have reliable data re water in the Birtle district. If you wish to keep to the Main Highway, I believe there are only two water supplies available, adequate to meet our need. If you want to go back from the Main Highway, I can find other supply. But good water is not plentiful. Farmers right now are driving cattle two and a half miles, twice daily, for water. It might interest you to know the well on the Edmonson place, that I recommended, is being used to meet the wants of neighbors. Mr. Edmonson has no objection as he has no fears or his supply failing.\n\nIf the report I hear of the Dominions Water Branches aid is being sought to find us water. My opinion is, the action is a mistake unless it means testing the Edmonson supply for quantity and quality. I believe no one dare question the Edmonson place, for water supply, drainage or building site. The only ground of question can be, \"As a farm.\" It may not be an \"Ideal\" farm, but it is considerably above the average, and abundantly good enough to make \"a profitable farm\". And if you have any doubts as to my judgment on this point.\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the first occasion, as you know, I went there for the purpose of examining the Experimental Farm, and on the third to look over a farm that had been highly recommended by Mr. Currie, but which, in my opinion, was quite unsuitable for our purposes. I may say, however, that I did not merely look at this farm and one other and then return to Regina; I looked over several places, but as a good water supply was one of the main considerations I was unable to make a choice. I knew perfectly well that the people in the Birtle district would expect to have the school situated near the town, but as the lands were not available there, there was nothing left for me to do but to go further afield, which I did. Immediately upon receipt of your telegram of the 25th instant in connection with this matter I wired Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was on his way to Griswold, to stop off at Birtle and drive through the district, making enquiries about all available farms.

McKilligan, Esq., B.S.A.,\nDean, Manitoba Agricultural College,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nREPORT\nON\nWATER SUPPLY\nFOR\nPROPOSED INDIAN SCHOOL\nAT\nBIRTLE, MANITOBA\n\nSir,\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of August 10th I got in touch with Mr. Graham, Indian Commissioner at Regina, and arranged to meet Inspector Hamilton of his office in Brandon on August 18th. An arranged I met Mr. Hamilton in Brandon on the evening of August 18th, and we reached Birtle the following morning. Mr. Hamilton outlined the situation they were confronted with in selecting a site for the new Indian School at Birtle. This situation is briefly as follows:\n\nIt is necessary to purchase a new site for the school and farm and 640 acres are required. Various properties were examined but the question of an adequate supply of water rather limited the choice of properties. Finally an option was secured on Section 30, Township 16, Range 27 West of the Principal Meridian. The section was suitable in every respect except for the dependability of an ample water supply. A well drilling outfit was obtained and a well drilled on the south east quarter section to a depth of 304 feet and a second well was drilled on the south west quarter section to a depth of 254 feet. Both holes passed through clay and quicksand to the soapstone and water was not obtained. A coulee runs across the south east quarter of the property and in this coulee two shallow wells had been dug years ago and a good flow of water obtained. It was reported that these wells had been found inexhaustible. Mr. Hamilton had installed a pump and engine at the deeper of these two wells and in preliminary tests it appeared as if this well might form a suitable source of supply for the new school. The option on the section expires on August 31st, and it is probable a renewal is only obtainable at considerably higher prices.\n\nJ.T. Johnson, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service\nDepartment of the Interior\nOttawa, Ontario.\nBefore proceeding to Birtle the writer examined the records of the Manitoba Government relating to their experience in well drilling around Birtle. Their record showed that within a ten mile radius of Birtle out of many holes drilled from 200 to 300 feet, only in two was water obtained, viz. in Section 19, Township 16, Range 27. These wells were 227 feet deep and the water rose seven feet, being rather unsatisfactory results. Accordingly it was no surprise to learn of Mr. Hamilton's lack of success in deep drilling.\n\nThis coulee extends for about five miles before joining Birdtail creek and many wells have been sunk along its course. Only a few good flows of water were obtained. The well tested by Mr. Hamilton was rated as one of the best obtained. The well is four feet in diameter and extends about 14 feet below the ground surface, which in turn is approximately 80 feet below the general plateau level. At noon on August 19th, there was about seven feet of water in the well. The writer decided to further test the well and a larger pump was secured and installed in the well. That evening the pump was run for two or three hours, discharging 1,200 gallons per hour. Next morning the pump was started at 8:50 a.m. and the water stood at elevation 64' 7\" assumed level. At 1:35 p.m. the pump was shut down as it was sucking air and there was only about six inches of water in the well. The following records were secured.\n\n| Time     | Water Level | Total Discharge |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| 6:50 a.m.| 64' 7\"      | 0 gals          |\n| 9:50 a.m.| 61' 10\"     | 1200            |\n| 10:50 a.m.| 60' 9\"      | 2400            |\n| 11:50 a.m.| 59' 11\"     | 3600            |\n| 12:50 p.m.| 59' 0\"      | 4800            |\n| 1:35 p.m.| 58' 6\"      | 5700            |\n|          | Pump shut down |                |\n| 2:10 p.m.| 60' 6\"      | 5700 \" Pump idle |\n| 2:50 p.m.| 61' 4\"      | 5700            |\n| 3:00 p.m.| 61' 4\"      | 5700 \" started |\n| 3:10 p.m.| 60' 4\"      | 5900            |\n| 3:40 p.m.| 59' 4\"      | 6500            |\n| 4:10 p.m.| 58' 7\"      | 7100            |\n| 4:55 p.m.| 58' 6\"      | 7550            |\n| 5:00 p.m.| 58' 5\"      | 7600 \" stopped |\n|          |              |                 |\n|          |              | At this time pump was discharging at rate of 750 gallons per hour, which was the inflow at that time. |\n| 5:10 p.m.| 58' 5\"      |                 |\n| 5:25 p.m.| 59' 1\"      |                 |\n| 5:40 p.m.| 60' 1\"      |                 |\n| 5:55 p.m.| 60' 1\"      |                 |\n| 7:35 p.m.| 61' 1\"      |                 |\n| 7:42 p.m.| 61' 2\"      |                 |\n| 7:50 p.m.| 60' 7\"      | 7600 \" Pump start |\n| 8:00 p.m.| 60' 0\"      | 7800            |\n| 8:10 p.m.| 59' 7\"      | 7960            |\n| 8:30 p.m.| 59' 0\"      | 8160            |\n| 8:50 p.m.| 58' 6\"      | 8560            |\n|          |              |                 |\n|          |              | Pump sucking air and shut down. |\n\nIndian Affairs.

A study of the above test reveals that we were rather rapidly depleting the reservoir which feeds the well, and if this reservoir were in close proximity to the well the conclusion would be that the reservoir was small and incapable of supplying an adequate water supply. On the other hand should the reservoir which feeds the well be located some considerable distance away such a conclusion is not warranted for it would naturally take more time to penetrate to the immediate vicinity of the well. However, should the well be left undisturbed for several days and the water not return to its former level as found before the pumping was commenced then it can be fairly well established that the reservoir is of limited capacity and not dependable for the purpose required. Engineers of the Manitoba Government and of the City of Winnipeg, experienced in water supply studies have been consulted and the conditions existing and the results of tests outlined to them. They are of the opinion that such surface wells should be thoroughly tested before any conclusions are made as to dependability.\n\nUpon the observations made to date it is impossible to state definitely whether this will or will not prove to be a dependable source of water supply for the proposed new school. Tests are still being carried out by Mr. Hamilton at the suggestion of the writer but it is impossible to thoroughly test a source of water supply before the expiration of the option on August 31st. The observations made to date most assuredly do not warrant the Department of Indian Affairs exercising their option on this land, but if the option can be extended one month fairly definite conclusions could be arrived at.\nI also examined a well on a farm about five miles north of Birtle, a well that has been reported to be most dependable. It was found to be located in a deep coulee in a natural watercourse. It was ten feet deep and contained four feet of water, the bottom being mud with no evidence of gravel. While no pumping tests were made on this well it is apparently only a surface well.\n\nThe site for the school, tentatively selected on Section 30, Township 16, Range 27, was examined and is about 1400 feet from the well being tested. The site offers favorable opportunities for sewage disposal without any danger of contamination to the source of water supply.\n\nD. B.

B. Gow, Assistant District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, Winnipeg, regarding water tests made on the two sites selected for a school at Birtle. The tests as shown in the report are quite unsatisfactory, and I am satisfied the Department would not attempt to build a school on a farm with a water supply of this kind.\n\nSince Mr. Gow left the district Mr. Hamilton, (whom I sent down to Birtle to be present during the progress of the test for the purpose of seeing that the work was carried out properly), has located another farm six miles from Birtle, which has on it a well 110 feet deep, with a 5\" hole. On Friday he operated a pump on this well for five hours, taking out 1560 gallons of water. Saturday he pumped 9 hours, taking out 3600 gallons, and also nine hours on Sunday, taking out 3500 gallons. You will note that the test covered a period of 2\u00bd days. This looks to me like a well that would meet our requirements. I have advised Mr. Hamilton that it will not be necessary for him to remain at Birtle any longer. I question whether the Water Power Branch could do any more than we are doing. The officer who was there just carried out the test that Mr. Hamilton did,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nin fact Mr. Hamilton was looking after the test in the presence of the representative of the Water Power Branch. However, if it is your opinion that this officer should go down and make a report he should be sent there at once.\n\nIt seems to me that this supply, if it holds out, will be ample for the school requirements, and apparently there would be no difficulty in sinking another well close by which would yield the same supply to look after the stock or the school as the case might be.\n\nI do not know if the site chosen will suit the citizens of Birtle or not, but you will note what Mr. Gow states in his report regarding the experience of the Manitoba Government in drilling for water in the Birtle district.\n\nI may inform you that not a single minute has been lost since instructions were received at this office to have the matter attended to. Drilling operations commenced a day after I was at Birtle and continued without interruption up to a few days ago, and I have had this third test made on the farm which has been located by Mr. Hamilton six miles from Birtle. If you have any instructions that you wish carried out immediately kindly wire me.\n\nThe question of just what size of a farm the Department intends to buy for this institution has never been clearly settled. We started out by buying the Birtle Experimental Farm, which contained 320 acres, then we were looking at a section farm. The farm that we are now looking at contains three quarter sections, but whether this would be all that is necessary and all that is desirable I do not know. We can obtain a section and a quarter in this block. This land is owned by two different parties and has two complete sets of buildings. Both have wells, one of them being only fair, but sufficient to carry on the farm requirements. Mr. Hamilton thinks that all the buildings could be worked in for the use of the school. There is a splendid house which could be used for a Principal's residence, and the other house would make a good Farmer's residence. I consider that this farm at $37.50 an acre, which is the price asked, is better valued than any of the farms we have looked at for $25.00 an acre.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have also arranged for other expert advice on the suitability of the land for a productive farm. It will not be necessary for Mr. Hamilton to check up the work of the Water Power Engineers as I have every confidence in their ability to report on the water supply system.\n\nI have today requested the Water Power Branch to instruct their District Engineer to investigate and report on the available water supply on the farm referred to in your letter of the 27th ultimo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

We have been trying to find a suitable property in the vicinity of the town - good farming land with an adequate supply of water. The Reverend Mr. Currie, Principal of our school at Birtle, has recommended a farm owned by Mr. Edmonson. The District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch is investigating the supply of water there. I should like to be sure that the Edmonson farm is productive and is suitable for the purposes of one of our schools. I should be very grateful if you would have the Superintendent of the Experimental Farm at Brandon examine the farm and let this Department have a report. Any expenses incurred will be paid. If your officer will communicate with Mr. Currie, he will give every assistance.\n\nAs the Department is desirous of commencing building operations this year, it would give us much satisfaction if the report is received at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nE.

I trust this will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.S. Archibald\nDirector.\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September 11th I received instructions from Dr. Archibald to inspect the farm of Mr. Edmunson at Birtle, and to report to you the kind of land and the water supply on this property. I drove to Birtle on the morning of the 12th and together with Rev. Currie and Mr. Edmunson went over the property and made borings with a four foot auger in a few places. That evening we arranged with the owner of the land to secure an engine and the necessary equipment and on the following morning we tested the well for water supply.\n\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nReporting first on the water supply I would say that the well now in use is located in a ravine. The bottom of the ravine is not more than 25 feet below the level of the surrounding parts of the farm. This well is five feet nine inches in diameter and is twelve feet six inches deep. When we commenced to pump at nine o'clock in the morning there was 42 inches of water in the well. We pumped until twelve o'clock noon. There was still twenty-seven of water and during the last hour and twenty minutes of pumping the water did not lower at all. We estimated that during the three hours we pumped between 2500 and 3000 gallons of water. Since this is one of the driest seasons experienced in many years and as this well has been in use for several years and neighbors are hauling from the well at the present time for their stock and for threshing it would seem reasonable to expect a permanent supply of water.\n\nRegarding the quality, I may say that it has no unpleasant taste and I am by mail this morning forwarding you two...\none quart sealers. One of the containers was boiled before being used. This is marked on the sealer, in case you wish to have the bacteriological test made. The other was well washed and rinsed with the well water before being filled.\n\nLAND.\n\nLocation: The property shown me consisted of the south half of 36-17-27 and the north half of 25-17-27. This is five miles north of the C.P.R. Depot at Birtle, and the Government highway to the northern towns is on the east side of the farm.\n\nSurface: This is a well-drained piece of land with several shallow water courses, some emptying into the main ravine previously mentioned. There are practically no indications of sloughs although poplar trees and some willow brush are dotted over the farm. I estimated about 150 acres of bluff. Poplar trees in many of the bluffs are from 1\u00bd\" to 3\u00bd\" in diameter, but there are a few areas where the trees are 5\" to 6\" in diameter. The farmer who has considerable financial resources has only worked the land in between the bluffs so that the property presents a rather ragged appearance but both to the north and to the south of the farm the land has been kept cleared and there is no reason why once a large number of these bluffs are ploughed up that the farm would not have a good appearance.\n\nStones: There are about seventy acres of land, mostly on the south-east quarter section but extending a short distance into the north-east that is quite stoney in places. There are some stones in some of the water courses but for the most part the stones appear to be on the seventy acres.\n\nSOIL.\n\nThere appeared to be about 18 inches of black sandy loam surface soil. In most places the solid clay soil appeared to be immediately below the black soil and other places we found a whitish gravelly clay between the black soil and the more solid clay below. The south-west quarter on which there appeared to be the most bluffs did not have as rich a vegetation as did the eastern and northern parts of the farm. We also observed on this quarter section a pit from which some material had been drawn to put on the roads. This\nwas just a small excavation. We noticed this white gravelly soil below the top subsoil. It is my opinion that the soil would be easy to work and because of being well-drained could be cultivated early in the spring. Excepting on the stoney part I believe the soil would be quite productive and would grow good crops of grain, grasses and leguminous crops.\n\nWEEDS.\n\nCanada Thistle is a predominating weed at the present time. The Wild Oats were also in evidence and one field appeared to have Stink Weed. We also found three patches of two or three acres each with Couch Grass and in one of the fields I noticed a number of patches of Couch Grass from six to ten feet long and three to four feet wide. There were a few plants of Sow Thistle. Given careful cultivation and proper crop rotation for a few years I believe that most of the weeds could be brought under control without too great an effort.\n\nBUILDING SITE.\n\nThe site Mr. Currie suggested as a possible location for buildings was about three hundred yards back from the highway. There was a shallow water-run which would take the drainage from the barn yards down to the south of the farm and with a shallow ditch down the road this would empty into the main ravine in which the well is located, about eighty rods below the well. The water courses referred to practically all have their source on the farm and it is only during the time of the spring floods when there would be any water in them, and there appears to be sufficient fall so that they would drain quickly. The main objections to my mind to this property are the stoney area in the centre and the fact that there is a road allowance between the two half sections. Another objection that might be raised are the bluffs that are dotted over the farm. Many of them should be cut out and brought under cultivation so as to have square fields which could be more cheaply operated.\n\nThe well being located in a ravine might also be thought unsafe. In this connection it would appear that the walls of the well could be made of cement as the water seems to come in from the bottom. To prevent water seeping in through the surface soil a flume could be\nbuilt to carry the greater part of the spring floods away. This flume could extend higher up the ravine than the well for 200 or 300 feet and a little below the well.\n\nI am enclosing a sketch which may help make this report a little clearer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September 11th I received instructions from Dr. Archibald to inspect the farm of Mr. Edmunson at Birtle, and to report to you the kind of land and the water supply on this property.

As arranged I met Mr. Hamilton in Brandon on the evening of August 18th and we reached Birtle the following morning. Mr. Hamilton outlined the situation they were confronted with in selecting a site for the new Indian School at Birtle. This situation is briefly as follows:\n\nIt is necessary to purchase a new site for the school and farm and 640 acres are required. Various properties were examined but the question of an adequate supply of water rather limited the choice of properties. Finally an option was secured on Section 30, Township 16, Range 27 West of the Principal Meridian. This section was suitable in every respect except for the dependability of an ample water supply. A well-drilling outfit was obtained and a well drilled on the south east quarter section to a depth of 504 feet, and a second well was drilled on the south west quarter section to a depth of 254 feet. Both holes passed through clay and quicksand to the soapstone and water was not obtained. A coulee runs across the south east quarter of the property and in this coulee two shallow wells had been dug years ago and a good flow of water obtained. It was reported that these wells had been found inexhaustible. Mr. Hamilton had installed a pump and engine at the depths of these two wells and in preliminary tests it appeared as if this well might form a suitable source of supply for the new school. The option on the section expires on August 31st and it is probable a renewal is only obtainable at considerably higher prices.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nBefore proceeding to Birtle the writer examined the records of the Manitoba Government relating to their experience in well drilling around Birtle. Their record showed that within a ten mile radius of Birtle out of many holes drilled the best was 300 feet; only in two was water obtained, viz., in Section 19, Township 16, Range 27. These wells were 225 feet deep and the water rose seven feet, being rather unsatisfactory results. Accordingly it was no surprise to learn of Mr. Hamilton's lack of success in deep drilling.\n\nThis coulee extends for about five miles before joining Birtail creek and many wells have been sunk along its course. Only a few good flows of water were obtained. The well tested by Mr. Hamilton was rated as one of the best obtained. It is four feet in diameter and extends about 14 feet below the ground surface, which in turn is approximately 40 feet below the general plateau level. At noon on August 19th there was about seven feet of water in the well. The writer decided to further test the well and a larger pump was secured and installed in the well. That evening the pump was run for two or three hours, discharging 1,800 gallons per hour. Next morning the pump was started at 9:50 a.m. and the water stood at elevation 54' 7\" assumed level.

A study of the above test reveals that we were rather rapidly depleting the reservoir which feeds the well, and if this reservoir were in close proximity to the well the conclusion would be that the reservoir was small and incapable of supplying an adequate water supply. On the other hand should the reservoir which feeds the well be located some considerable distance away such a conclusion is not warranted. As it would naturally take more time to penetrate to the immediate vicinity of the well. However should the well be left undisturbed for several days after the water not return to its former level and found before the pumping was commenced then it can be fairly well established that the reservoir is of limited capacity and not dependable for the purpose required. Engineers of the Manitoba Government and of the City of Winnipeg, experienced in water supply studies have been consulted and the conditions existing and the results of tests outlined to them. They are of the opinion that such surface wells should be thoroughly tested before any conclusions are made as to dependability.\n\nUpon the observations made to date it is impossible to state definitely whether this will or will not prove to be a dependable source of water supply for the proposed new school. Tests are still being carried out by Mr. Hamilton at the suggestion of the writer but it is impossible to thoroughly test this source of water supply before the expiration of the option on August 31st. The observations made to date most assuredly do not warrant the Department of Indian Affairs exercising their option on this land, but if the option can be extended one month fairly definite conclusions could be arrived at.\nI also examined a well on a farm about five miles north of Birtle, a well that has been reported to be most dependable. It was found to be located in a deep coulee in a natural watercourse. It was ten feet deep and contained four feet of water, the bottom being mud with no evidence of gravel. While no pumping tests were made on this well it is apparently only a surface well.\n\nThe site for the school, tentatively selected on Section 30, Township 16, Range 57, was examined and is about 1400 feet from the well being tested. The site offers favorable opportunities for sewage disposal without any danger of contamination to the source of water supply.\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer,\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nAugust 24th, 1932.\nOttawa, September 17th, 1929.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWould you be kind enough to let this Department have a bacteriological report on these two samples of water.\n\nIf it is in your line a chemical analysis on hardness and suitability for boiler use would also be appreciated.\n\nThe report may be sent to the undersigned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

Such as procuring seed grain, equipment or whatever may be necessary, and it is not too early to have all such in mind.\n\nTrusting you will soon be in a position to make a definite decision, and I do wish to thank you for having the Edmonson place inspected. If it is now turned down I shall feel my judgment is faulty. I believe Mr. Wilson was careful and will give you a fair report of what he found, and am ready to abide by that finding.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\n\nSamples of the Edmonson well water were taken for thorough analysis.\n\nH.B.C.\nBirtle, Man. 16 Sept. 1929\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nLast Thursday and Friday Mr. Penline, Superintendent of the Brandon Experimental Farm came in to inspect the Edmonson place. You will probably have his report by the time you receive this. I have no idea what that report will be, but I trust it is such that you will be led to give a favorable report consideration to the Edmonson property as the site for our new school. One thing I can say Mr. Penline gave the place a very careful inspection. Thursday afternoon we drove the place first just to get an idea, then we went on foot and made various tests as to surface soil, sub soil and etc. The whole of which I expect you will get in detail.\n\nI am convinced a favorable impression remained in Mr. Penline's mind, as\nto the building site, drainage and water. We had a pump - worked by gas engine - pumping three hours, and pumped over 2600 gallons. In the beginning the water in the well went down a little, but after pumping two hours we got down in the well, to the place where it was coming in as fast as we could pump it out. For the last hour pumping - we did not lower the water in the well, if anything it gained on us, and I am of the opinion we could have pumped indefinitely without lowering the water in the well. It acted just as Mr Edmonson has always told me it would do. Its standing up as it did under this test, in a year like this, when many wells are dry and 90% of the sloughs are dry and the river lower than the oldest resident ever remembers seeing it; so in itself, I think, ample to conclude we will never be short of water. After pumping three hours we went to lunch. On our return after lunch, in 1 hr and 20 min., the water in the well was back to within 8 inches, where it was in the morning before we began to pump.\nThe farm itself is only fair\u2014 but is good enough to make a profitable farm\u2014and under good farming can be improved 100% in five years. The fencing on it is poor barb wire. It should be re-fenced with woven wire, for stock and sheep farming.\n\nIt is too late for doing much this year, but this is my recommendation. If Mr. Andrews' report is favorable, buy Mr. Edmonson's place at once, for the following reasons. First, the contract can yet be let this fall; the contractor may get basement excavated and get his material on the ground during winter for an early start in spring\u2014and will most probably have the building ready for use by 15 Aug 1930 on return of pupils from summer vacation.\n\nMy second reason is, I do not know what to do with my stock this winter, my stables are tumbling down and are too small at any rate, I cannot get all my present stock inside\u2014I now have 8 horses and...\nBirtle, Man.\n\nI have 36 head of cattle. The cattle consist of 10 calves which will be killed soon, 3 grade cows, and one Pure Breed Dual Shorthorn Bull - bought from Mr Alexander MacLaren Buckingham, Zoe. 18 Pure Breed Shorthorn milking cows; 4 Pure Breed 2yr old heifers that will freshen before Christmas. 13 Pure Breed females under 2 years. 4 Bull calves, 3 for sale; to be retained to replace my present sire. This totals 33 Pure Breed Dual Shorthorns and 4 Grades.\n\nIf I get rid of the 4 grades, as I intend, there is 4 calves to be born in 1929 to take their place. My Shorthorn herd is easily worth $4000.00.\n\nI do not wish to dispose of my Shorthorns simply because I am crowded for room. If you buy the Edmonton place soon, the buildings on it, while not good will give us the necessary accommodation for this winter.\n\nAgain there is a feed problem for this season. The Edmonton place has ample good oat straw that should go with the place and will solve feed problem.\nONTARIO\n\nLaboratories of the Department of Health of Ontario\n\n428 Slater St.,\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL REPORT\n\nREPORT ON WATERS RECEIVED FROM Dr. E.L.

The sterilized jar shows contamination in a moderate degree and the unsterilized one in a marked degree. Neither of these samples of water would be suitable for drinking purposes without treatment.\n\nA test of this sort is of very little value by itself. If the well is open it is subject to contamination which would not occur if it were closed and protected. If the surroundings were bad the water would be polluted, but might be rendered safe by cleaning up the ground near the well removing possible manure piles etc. There is no information on these points, and it is therefore impossible to say whether the well, as distinct from the samples, is a safe well or not.\n\nThe test for hardness indicates that the water is soft and should be suitable for boiler use as water goes in the west.\n\nE.L.

Mr. Edmonson's farm is located about 5\u00bd miles in a northerly direction from Birtle. No examination was made for a satisfactory site for the school on this property.\n\nA rather deep coulee runs through the farm and along the bottom of this coulee I noticed two or three wells that were apparently abandoned and not in use. The well that is now the source of water supply for the farm is located in the bottom of the coulee and is in the path of a natural water course during the spring break-up. The well was found to be 6' diameter and 12' deep and contained 4 feet of water. The bottom appeared to be mud; no sounding weight showed no evidence of gravel. No tests were made of the capacity of this well and samples were taken for analysis at the time. The well is fitted with a pump and wind-mill and the covering is not substantial.\n\nFrom my examination of this well I am of the opinion that it is not fed from any spring but from seepage, that the water is very liable to be contaminated and that it is not a dependable source of water supply for the Indian School that it is proposed to build in the vicinity of Birtle.\n\nThe most satisfactory source of water supply for this proposed school would be a deep well, a flowing well if possible. In the district around Birtle no success appears to have been met by anyone in deep drilling. Shallow wells, unless fed by adequate springs, are not dependable for the purpose of this school. In the vicinity of Shoal Lake there are some flowing wells and it might be advisable for the Indian Department to consider the erection of their school in the vicinity of Shoal Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\n\nThe Director,\nDom.

CURRIE, Principal\n\nIndian Residential School\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nMr. Gow, of the Dominion Water Branch, Winnipeg was with me today testing the well on the Edmonson property. He is to continue the test tomorrow. But what I know of this well assures me, tomorrow will be a repetition of today\u2014Any well that will stand up under the drain, on this well, this season the driest in years (so the oldest residents say) and meet the needs of Mr. Edmonson and his many neighbors that are securing their supply therefrom will never fail in its supply of an Indian School of 150 pupils.\n\nCertainly if this one fails there is not one in the near Birtle district to equal it.\n\nThis morning at 9:00 this pump was started run by a gas engine, and pumped until 5:10 this evening 8 hours less one minute stop to make a slight repair. We were pumping 17 gallons per minute, or over 1000 gallons.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nper hour, or 8000 gallons from 9/10 A.M. to 5:10 P.M.\n\nThis well is shallow, only about 500 gallons in the well when we started. So over 7500 gallons came in the well today. It came in just about as fast as we could pump. We could only lower the well about 1 inch in each half hour pumping. After we quit pumping for the day at 5:10, the water rose in the well 15 inches in thirty seven minutes.\n\nWhen Mr. Bow started pumping this morning he had the idea, pumping it dry would be an easy job. At noon he said I expected it to be dry before this \u2014 as the afternoon wore on dry before this \u2014 as the afternoon wore on he said \"I do not believe we can pump it dry.\" At the time the well on the Fulton place was being tested, this Mr. Bow was there, and while on that job, Mr. Hamilton, Inspector, or Agent Laytonly, or both, had inspected, or Agent Laytonly, or both, had inspected, or Agent Laytonly, or both, had inspected, or Agent Laytonly, or both, had inspected against the well. So his report will be no more favorable than conditions warrant.\nMr. Gow has his assistant with him from Winnipeg\u2014The assistant is also testing a well on the \"Butcher property\" apparently for school use. I had no idea this Butcher property was under consideration before Mr. Gow arrived\u2014A great deal of information re proposed sites is carefully \"not told me.\" Now I can say little of the Butcher property yet, I will look at over the first opportunity\u2014But its location certainly is much too far out. The well on the Butcher place, is I understand a deep well over 100 feet, it is being tested with a pump that is only pumping 360 gallons an hour, with such a pump as that on the Edmonton well, you could pump for ever, as it is coming in twice as fast as that pump is taking it out.\n\nHowever Dr Scott, with this information of Mr Gow's test on the\nEdmonson well, and the report of Mr. Sinclair of Brandon Experimental Farm before you. I trust you will have ample information to close with Mr. Edmonson at once. I am right up against it for barn room and within two weeks it is very probable weather conditions may be such that stock should be stabled, and mine cannot stable until some provision is made.\n\nKindly let me the earliest possible moment, if you can, or cannot, do something to meet our immediate need.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B. Currie\n\nP.S. The Butten Property is about 5 miles from Selkirk Station, about 18 from Birtle Station.

(RG 10, Volume 6253, File 575-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES OF CANADA\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nand I took note of the mileage. From the Butcher place, to Birtle Station was just nine miles. Birtle Station will be the nearest point, for about half of the passenger traffic. The through trains only stop at Birtle & School Lake. The only train to stop at Salsgirth, is the local train, 9:35 A.M. & 4:15 P.M. Of course all freight; (were we located on the Butcher place) would come to Salsgirth 4\u00bd or 5 miles. But I am hoping only the Edmonton place will receive favorable consideration as I feel this water supply alone, is worth as much as any other property of the same size in the Birtle district. Besides it has choice building site, and Choice drainage.\n\nWe took measurements & elevations yesterday - the proposed building site is about 1/400 feet from the well, and the building site ground level is 30 feet above the ground level at the well. I asked Mr. Cow if it would be an expensive proposition to install...\nthe water system and drainage, he said\u2014not at all. He said, it would be comparative easy.\n\nI am most anxious that some definite action be taken be taken, say within 10 days\u2014so I may know what action to take re the housing of my stock this winter. I have 8 horses; 35 cattle, 31 hogs; and a flock of sheep.\n\nI did not say but in the two days yesterday and the day before we pumped 15,000 to 16,000 gallons out of the well on the Edmonson Place, and you will have the report no doubt of the samples sent in for analysis by Mr. Pinion.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.B.

I, too, am very disappointed that a decision has not been reached but I am writing today to see that Mr. Gow's latest report is expedited. As you are aware, the Department is trying to keep the school in the vicinity of Birtle but we must be satisfied before purchasing a site. An inadequate supply of water would be a continuous source of real trouble. That is why care must be taken. Then, of course, there are such questions as building site, drainage, sewage disposal and suitable land.\n\nYou may rest assured that no time will be lost as soon as a decision can be reached.

G. Lazenby, Indian Agent at Birtle, would be at hand to show me the location of the farm now being considered a suitable site for the Birtle Indian School. Arriving in Birtle on September 30th I accompanied Mr. Lazenby on an inspection of the well on the property and also the suggested location of the school building. Arrangements had previously been made for Mr. Lazenby to have a gasoline engine set up in readiness to pump the well. The well was subjected to pumping tests on October 1st and 2nd, and considerable data were gathered as to the conditions met with in drilling the well.\n\nThis well is located on the S.W. \u00bc, Sec. 7, Tp. 17, Rge. 25, West of the Principal Meridian, the property of Mr. Butcher. It is about four miles east and one mile north of the town of Birtle. The well was drilled in December, 1928, to a depth of approximately 111 feet. Blue clay was encountered to a depth of 94 feet, the remaining 18 feet being in slate or shale. Water was obtained in considerable volume and drilling was discontinued. A five-inch casing extends from the surface down into the shaft, and the well is fitted with a windmill-driven pump that extends down 69 feet from the top of the casing. The pump pipe line is \u00bd inch diameter and the cylinder is located approximately 68 feet below the surface. The well is utilized to supply water for the ordinary needs of the farm of 480 acres. On the morning of October 1st the water stood 22 feet below the top of the casing so that there was about 88 feet of water in the well and the water surface was about 45 feet above the cylinder. The well was pumped steadily that day from 8:50 a.m. until 3:30 p.m., when the pump broke down and repairs had to be made. The day's results are tabulated below:\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n| Time       | Rate of Discharge | Discharge for Interval | Total |\n|------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|\n| 6:50 a.m.  | 585 gals. per hour| 0 gals.                | 0 gals.|\n| 9:00       | 585               | 97                     | 97    |\n| 9:20       | 425               | 168                    | 265   |\n| 9:30       | 390               | 102                    | 367   |\n| 10:00      | 370               | 158                    | 535   |\n| 10:30      | 370               | 155                    | 710   |\n| 11:00      | 370               | 155                    | 995   |\n| 11:30      | 370               | 155                    | 1000  |\n| 12:30 p.m. | 360               | 365                    | 1445  |\n| 1:00       | 360               | 180                    | 1625  |\n| 1:30       | 350               | 180                    | 1805  |\n| 2:00       | 350               | 180                    | 1985  |\n| 2:30       | 350               | 177                    | 2162  |\n| 3:00       | 350               | 175                    | 2337  |\n| 3:30       | 350               | 175                    | 2512  |\n\nThe results of pumping on October 2nd were as follows:\n\n| Time       | Rate of Discharge | Discharge for Interval | Total |\n|------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------|\n| 10:00 a.m. | 520 gals. per hour| 0 gals.                | 0 gals.|\n| 10:30      | 370               | 300                    | 300   |\n| 11:00      | 370               | 185                    | 485   |\n| 11:30      | 354               | 181                    | 666   |\n| 12:00      | 349               | 175                    | 841   |\n| 1:00 p.m.  | 347               | 248                    | 1089  |\n| 2:30       | 341               | 516                    | 1705  |\n| 3:30       | 334               | 336                    | 2043  |\n| 4:30       | 334               | 334                    | 2377  |\n| 5:20       | 334               | 334                    | 2711  |\n\nOn the morning of October 3rd the water stood at the same level as on the morning of October 1st before pumping had commenced. The owner of the engine wanted it returned and the test was discontinued.\n\nThe amount of water pumped on each of these two days was not greatly in excess of the anticipated daily requirements of the proposed school. The pumping equipment of the well is inadequate to make a square pumping test. There was 40 feet of water in the well below the pump and it is altogether likely that with a pump extending to the bottom of the well the rate of discharge would have been considerably increased when pumping against inflow. The five-inch casing permits of much larger pumping equipment but of course the present installation is quite ample for ordinary farm needs.\n\nThe favorable features about this well are that it is not a shallow surface well, is free from the liability of contamination, extends some 17 feet into shale and the reservoir pressure is sufficient to raise the water some 90 feet in the casing. The water level returns to this same level after moderate pumping showing that there has been no\nlessening of the pressure from the underground reservoir. No definite conclusions as to the dependability of this well can be arrived at from the results of this test, but the writer is of the opinion that the well is adequate to supply the needs of the Indian School.\n\nA sample of the water from this well was taken and submitted for analysis to the Bacteriological Laboratory, Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba. Their report shows the water to be free from contamination and one of the best waters submitted to them for years.\n\nWhile no definite site has been considered for the proposed school on this property, there is a very favorable site available within 300 feet of the well and this site permits of perfect drainage conditions.\n\nD.

C. Edmunston. I agreed to carry out a pumping test on the well and made the same on October 2nd and 3rd in the presence of and with the assistance of Mr. Currie and Mr. Edmunston.\n\nMr. Edmunston owns the N. \u00bd of Section 25, and the S. \u00bd of Section 26, in Township 17, Range 27, West of the Principal Meridian. The well is located on the N.E. \u00bc of Section 25 and at the bottom of a fairly deep cut, the general elevation of the adjoining land being 25 feet higher. The well is about six feet in diameter and only 12 feet deep. There was slightly more than three feet of water in the well on the morning of October 2nd. The result of the pumping on October 2nd was as follows:\n\n| Time | Depth of Water | Rate of Discharge | Discharge for Interval | Total Discharge |\n|------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| 3.2 ft | 1040 gals. per hr. | 855 gals. | 855 gals. |\n| 1.2 \" | 1040 \" | 1040 \" | 1905 \" |\n| 1.7 \" | 1040 \" | 470 \" | 2375 \" |\n| 0.8 \" | 1040 \" | 0 \" | 2375 \" |\n| 0.7 \" | 1040 \" | 1440 \" | 3615 \" |\n| 0.6 \" | 1040 \" | 520 \" | 4335 \" |\n| 0.5 \" | 1040 \" | 520 \" | 4865 \" |\n| 0.4 \" | 1040 \" | 520 \" | 5375 \" |\n| 0.3 \" | 1040 \" | 520 \" | 5895 \" |\n| 0.2 \" | 1040 \" | 520 \" | 6415 \" |\n| 0.1 \" | 1040 \" | 1040 \" | 7465 \" |\n| 0.0 \" | 1040 \" | 680 \" | 8135 \" |\n\nPump shut down at 5:08 p.m.\n\nW.R.

An examination of the well showed that about 10 feet of clay overlaid the gravel and the well penetrated the gravel only two feet. The gravel appeared to continue two feet below the bottom of the well. The gravel was very fine. This well has been in existence many years and has never shown any signs of failure.\n\nThe pumping test carried out on this well was a rather severe one, some 15,650 gallons being pumped in two days, or sufficient to supply for one week the anticipated requirements of the proposed Indian School. This well is a shallow surface one located in a coulee and contrary to expectations appears to be fed from an ample reservoir. The water is pleasant to the taste and is comparatively soft. From the results of the pumping test I am of the opinion that this well will provide an ample water supply for the proposed Indian School. If utilized for this purpose however it will be necessary to tap the reservoir 25 to 30 feet away so as to get away from the bottom of the coulee.\n\nAn examination was made of the site tentatively suggested for the location of the school. It is 1,400 feet distant from the well and at an elevation 50 feet higher. Drainage from the school can be obtained.\nA sample of the water was taken from this well at noon on October 3rd after some 11,000 gallons had been pumped out, special care being taken in the handling of the sample. Within twenty-four hours it was in the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Department of Health and Public Welfare of the Province of Manitoba for analysis. Their report shows that no typhoid bacilli was present; the bacterial plate count per c.c. being 256. They report that the water is unsafe for drinking and unfit without treatment for the requirements of the proposed Indian School.\n\nD. B. Bowd,\nAssistant District Chief Engineer.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nOctober 8th, 1929.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 10th instant, I enclose herewith a report received from Mr. Attwood containing the results of Mr. Gow's inspection of the well on the property of Mr. T.C. Edmunston and that on the farm of Mr. Butcher in connection with the water supply for the proposed Indian school at Birtle, Manitoba. The net results of these examinations appears to be that the well on the Edmunston farm gives a sufficient water supply for the school but the water is unfit without treatment for the requirements of the proposed school. On the other hand, the well on Mr. Butcher's property gives a supply of water free from contamination and satisfactory for the school's purposes but the quantity available has not yet been definitely ascertained. I would suggest that it might be desirable to make a further test of the Butcher well which, if it is found to give a sufficient supply of water, appears to be well suited for the purposes of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 22, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing Mr. Gow's report on the Edmonton and Butcher properties, near Birtle, Man. I am not prepared to authorize a proper pumping test of the well on the Butcher farm, as the Reverend Principal of the Indian Residential School is far from satisfied with this property, for other reasons. I may ask you to investigate other properties at a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 24, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Currie:\n\nI have received the report of the Dominion Water Power Branch, and the net result of the investigation appears to be that the well on the Edmonton farm gives a sufficient supply, but that the water is unfit without treatment. Our technical officers have examined the reports with much care, and the Department is very hesitant about this water supply on the Edmonton farm. It does not appear to be fed by a flowing spring, and it might be extremely difficult to ascertain where the contamination takes place with a view to removing the cause.\n\nMr. Gow has reported also on the well on the Butcher property. This water is free from contamination, but the quantity available has not yet been definitely ascertained. I am not asking the Dominion Water Power Branch to proceed with a proper pumping test, because your letter of the 4th instant leads me to believe that, in other ways, the Butcher farm would not be a suitable location.\n\nThe delay in the selection of a site is to be regretted; but it is now too late in the year to make advantageous arrangements for a building contract. You will have to make temporary provision for the housing of your stock. If you learn of a likely looking farm in the meantime, do not hesitate to report to the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. B. Currie,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBirtle, Man.\nSuite 35 MacMillan Court\nWinnipeg, 19th Oct. 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nWhile looking after share of crops from our farms near Birtle this fall I heard that your department was meditating the establishment of an Indian Agricultural College in the Birtle district and looking for a good site (so that Indian students would forget about gathering senica root digging out wolves for a living soon as leaving old style schools.) I also heard that your investigators favored SW\u00bc 7-17-25 owned by Mr. Fred Butcher owing to superior quality of his land, abundance of the best kind of water in both a deep well also a shallow well dug into the quicksand and water, also a very fine, well-sheltered building site for a large set of buildings adjoining the good buildings now on this place with splendid drainage for both buildings and lands, etc. Hence this is to draw your attention to E\u00bd 7-17-25 which adjoins Mr. Fred Butcher's land on two sides about 230 acres of which is now under cultivation, besides 10 or 12 acres of good hay, some 62 acres of which is 1929 summerfallow ready for 1930 crop. The whole half section is arable but I think it would be a pity to destroy many of the fine poplar bluffs that has been nursed for say 30 years.\n\nClear Torrence title and all taxes paid to date. I enclose a township map with rough pencilled diagrams featuring topography and descriptions of E\u00bd 7-17-25, Man., and adjoining lands, trusting that it may help to give your department a better idea of these lands. You may remember that these farms had the reputation of being the most productive and richest land in the Birtle district, and still holds this up. If your department is still interested in such a location I take the liberty of submitting E\u00bd 7-17-25 for sale (along with Mr. Fred Butcher's lands) for your purposes and if you are interested in this I would gladly give you farther information about it at your request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)
