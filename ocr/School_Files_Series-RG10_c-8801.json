There is now only one teacher at the school, but the Department nurse makes the school her headquarters.\n\nI understand that the nurse's livery account on the Fairford Reserve runs around $35.00 per month. This amount added to the $25.00 per month would allow a full time caretaker and also allow the nurse livery at any time. I beg to recommend that a full time caretaker be employed at a wage of $60.00 per month.

The wood was cut free by the Indians, twenty cords in all, and the teacher asked me if I would apply for assistance to the Department to pay Starr for his work. I asked Starr what it was worth, but he said he had no idea, but would like to get 10 bushels of seed potatoes next spring if possible. Under the circumstances I beg to recommend to the Department that this be done.\n\nNext season this will not be necessary as I understand that the estimates provide for a team of oxen at this point. The potatoes would not cost more than $15.00.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 12, 1921.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the hauling of the wood required for the use of the Chumawawin Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may forward a voucher to the amount of $15.00 in payment of the charges of John James Starr for the hauling of the twenty cords of wood. As soon as this voucher is received payment to the above amount will be made and, when the cheque is received, it may be used by Starr in the purchase of seed potatoes, if he so desires. I shall be pleased if you will have this voucher forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

No horses to use to get their wood to school, the Chief said it was alright and would see to that, now when we were getting out treaty money they had to pay for not putting the wood at school. Now we spoke to the Chief about this and he said he had nothing to do with it, but the Indian Agent, and again the Indian Agent said he had nothing to do with it, the Indian Chief has the money and cheap money for him.\n\nNow the times are very hard and need every cent of the treaty now, hard times to feed their children.

No record was kept of who was working or the quantity of wood cut, but I understand sufficient was cut and hauled to last the School all winter.

This has not been so in my case. This is the picture here:-\n\n\"Winter 1942-3 - my fuel bill was $62.85. I received nothing.\n\"Winter 1943-4 - my fuel bill was $64.25. I received $25.00.\n\"So far this winter I have been using fuel left over from last year, supplemented with $19.00 worth that I have purchased. It has recently been below 40\u00b0 and even lower temperatures are not uncommon in winter in this locality. This is a very cold house - a contract job - and without proper insulation.\n\n\"Will you please state the policy of the Department so I shall be able to know if I have to budget my salary accordingly? I can get no satisfaction from the local Agency.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, I would refer you to Mr. Hoey's letter of September 16, 1942, part of which read as follows:-\n\n\"Your Indian agents should be instructed also to include in their annual estimates the amount of wood necessary for the heating of these residences.\"\n\nA review of our files does not show any request from Indian Agent Lovell for fuel for Mr. Waller's\n\nMr. A.

J. A. Doyle, D.D.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nBrandon, Man., April 21, 1941\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the list of graduates in the report which we are forwarding with this mail, James Taylor is listed. As you may see from a letter a year ago this boy is very lame, has had a very bad hip, and no doctor has given us any encouragement that anything can be done for him. He has been ambitious to do some kind of farm work successfully, but this handicap is too great. We have tried him at a number of things, and the only thing he is doing real well at is barbering. He has gone in some Saturday evenings to a barber in town who is a graduate of this school and helped him during the rush period, and this barber thinks he will make good. He cannot however be admitted to a shop in this province as an apprentice without having taken a term at the Barbers' College which is located in Winnipeg. The fee for this course is $60.00. It is quite likely that James has this amount or more to his credit in the Department as he has not been receiving Treaty money during the years that I have been in charge of this school. He comes from Nelson House. His mother's present name is Diana Linklater.\n\nI am therefore writing on behalf of James to see if the Department would consider making him a grant sufficient to pay for his board for the period required, probably 6 months, to take this course in Winnipeg. I am assuming that there is money enough to his credit to pay the necessary fees.\n\nAwaiting your reply, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Doyle\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to James Taylor. I note that you are under the impression that this boy has money to his credit in the Department. I have been unable to locate this and I am, therefore, communicating with Indian Agent Lovell. On receipt of his reply I will write to you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.A. Doyle,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Rev. J.A. Doyle, Principal of the Brandon Indian Residential School, requesting assistance for additional education for James Taylor, pupil No. 368 of the Brandon School. In his letter Dr. Doyle states:\n\n\"It is quite likely that James has this amount or more to his credit in the Department as he has not been receiving Treaty money during the years I have been in charge of this school.\"\n\nIn making inquiries from the Treasury Branch I have been unable to locate any savings account for James Taylor. The application form for this boy was dated July 3, 1927, and signed by yourself. It was stated that his father was dead and that his mother was No. 114, Dinah Primrose Taylor. On reviewing the pay list for the Nelson House Band No. 114 is shown as a man, \"Dinah Primrose\". Please let me hear from you at once in regard to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 103-128, dated the 28th ultimo, in connection with James Taylor.\n\nIt would appear that the money for this man or boy has been paid to James Linklater. What relation this man is to the boy, I could not say. I will make enquiries about the matter when I pay treaty at Nelson House and then give you a further report on the matter.\n\nIf the application for admittance for the boy was dated July 3rd, 1927, I could not have signed it, as I was not Indian Agent at that time. As that is fourteen years ago, it seems probable that July 3, 1927 is not correct.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 28th, No. 103-128.\n\nI took this matter up with Dinah Linklater at Nelson House during Treaty. I find that James Taylor pupil No. 368 Brandon School never was in Treaty because his father is a whiteman.\n\nNo. 114 Nelson House Band. D Primrose should read John Primrose son of Dinah. This Dinah has been married three times to Taylor, Primrose, and Linklater.\n\nTrusting this is the information you require I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nin this province unless he has attended the Barber School in Winnipeg, and he has not the funds for this. Fees for the School, I understand are $60.00 besides his board for the period of perhaps six months. If the Department could see their way clear to help him through this course, I think James would be in a position to care for himself. There is no lifting to it, and he is able to get about on his feet sufficiently for that. Otherwise I do not know what to do with the boy. In these busy times everybody wants a boy who can get about quicker than he can. Neither is a Reserve in the North the proper place for him where he has no kin to care for him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.T. Chopin\n\nRTC/TS\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., June 6, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have the problem here of a boy, James Taylor, age 19, who graduated in his 8th grade from this School a year ago. He went back to his reserve at Nelson House last fall after vainly endeavoring to get work of some kind that he could do. He spent a winter of sorts in there, and as far as I can learn it was a pretty hard winter for him. His father is dead and the man his mother married is a no-good. James is too lame to hunt or trap or do any of the work that he might find on the reserve. It seems his friends gave him a few furs, and in the early spring he started back with these, intending to sell them and take a course in a Barber School in Winnipeg. The furs were stolen from him on the Hudson Bay railway, and he landed here penniless. We have kept him in the school and have tried to find employment for him in Brandon and elsewhere, but no one will take him on because he is so lame. The work he likes is barbering. While in the School he had done a considerable amount of hair cutting. Barbers cannot take him on as an apprentice.\nin this province unless he has attended the Barber School in Winnipeg, and he has not the funds for this. Fees for the School, I understand are $50.00 besides his board for the period of perhaps six months. If the department could see their way clear to help him through this course, I think James would be in a position to care for himself. There is no lifting to it, and he is able to get about on his feet sufficiently for that. Otherwise I do not know what to do with the boy. In these busy times everybody wants a boy who can get about quicker than he can. Neither is a Reserve in the North the proper place for him where he has no kin to care for him.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.T. Chapin\n\nRTC/TS\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1948.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, recommending a grant for James Taylor to enable him to take a course at the Barber School in Winnipeg.\n\nFees and board would probably amount to $200.00 and, before making a final decision on allowing this sum, the Department requires some further assurances that the money would not be wasted.\n\nYou should have the boy medically examined by the school Doctor and we would like to have his opinion to the effect that the boy's present disability would not prevent his standing the strain of the work in which you suggest he be trained. You should also let us know if you consider that the boy's appearance and deportment are such that he would be able to hold a position if he took the suggested course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. R.T.

Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you back to your letter of June 11th, 103-128, re James Taylor. This boy was around the school during the summer. All summer long he tried to get work of some kind, but due to his handicap no one would use him, although, three or four tried. I got in touch with Inspector Hamilton and Dr. Ridge from Hodgson, and sent him to Hodgson Hospital for treatment where he could be under the Doctor's immediate attention.\n\nDr. Ridge now writes that he is ready for discharge, and waits for instructions of his disposal. Dr. Ridge, however, does not feel that the boy would stand up to the six months course in competition with the other workers.\n\nI doubt, myself, if he would make more than a second or third class worker, but do not see any other line of work that he could do in his condition. He is from the Nelson House Reserve of The Pas Agency. What shall I tell Dr. Ridge is to be done with the boy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42128-3, part 1)\nOttawa, September 21, 1948.\n\nRev. James Taylor\n\nDear Mr. Chapin:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant, in which you seek information in respect to provision that might be made for the above-noted Indian boy.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to know exactly what course this boy should be encouraged to take up, in view of his physical disabilities. I have this morning discussed the subject matter of your letter with Dr. Moore, our Acting Superintendent of Medical Services. Dr. Moore is not at all enthusiastic about the suggestion that this boy should become a barber. Indians, as a rule, have a poor reputation for cleanliness and with this handicap, coupled with his physical disabilities, Dr. Moore and I doubt very much if he could succeed in making a living as a barber. We are handicapped somewhat in that we do not know the extent of his disabilities. For example, Dr. Moore was anxious to know if this boy used crutches. Everything considered, we are inclined to think that he should be permitted to remain at the Brandon School for another year and perhaps encouraged to take up studies in Grade 9, possibly by correspondence. An attempt should be made also to improve his physical condition. It is noted Dr. Ridge is of the opinion that the boy would not stand up to a 6 months' course in competition with other workers.\n\nWould it be possible to have this boy enrolled as an apprentice in a boot and shoe repair establishment in Brandon? Should he prove successful in his Grade 9 studies, would it be possible for him to learn typing? In any event, I shall be glad to recommend an additional grant for the care of this boy for the present academic year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R. T. Chapin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIndian Residential School\n\nBrandon, Man., October 9, 1947\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference to your letter of September 21, 103-128 re; James Taylor. As I was in Hodgson this week, and James was ready to be discharged from the Hospital, I brought him back to the School with me. He is somewhat disappointed re; the Barber Course, but is taking a reasonable view of it.\n\nI took him with me on an interview with the Principal of the West City Business College in Brandon. In talking things over together we considered the Commercial Course, including bookkeeping and typing, would be a most practical course for him to take. This course will take five or six months, and James is quite ready and enthusiastic to get at it. He was within a month of completing his Grade X before he left school, so he has good groundwork. I would recommend, therefore, that James be enrolled in our Residential School, and allowed to attend Business College for the required time, and that a grant be authorized to cover his fees at the Business College. These fees are $16.00 a month.\n\nI might say that he was tried in a couple of the local shoe repair establishments but they could not keep him. They needed helpers who could step lively and just could not be bothered with James because he could not get around quickly. He uses a cane for walking but does not need crutches.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42128-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nOctober 15, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with further reference to James Taylor. I note that he can complete a commercial course within six months. Under these circumstances the Department approves his returning to the Brandon Residential School for that period. We will also allow a grant of $18.00 a month to pay his fees at the business college.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R.T.

Howey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare, and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nNo doubt you have received my letter to the Dept. of Education of Manitoba, my letter dated November 28, 1941. In this letter of mine dated Nov. 28, 1941, I have suggest or request to get an Indian higher education, on which I am quite depending on the Indian Dept. The reason I happen to come to consider this is there is only an Indian in this World of ours don't seem to know enough of the present conditions. But I would suggest and think so, an Indian has got same amount of brains in his head as any other person - like Chinaman, Japanese Black man. Right today these different people of different Countries are doing fine - they run their own machinery and their Government, and I am sure they were taught how to run these things. I don't say an Indian should try to get to run his own Government, but to get him to help out his country more through his studies.\n\nLike today for instance right at The Pas here Indian Boys tried to volunteer, but they come back almost for the same thing - not enough education - can't talk English or write English. They are healthy enough to be able to stand Army life, and of course there are others that are Medical unfit, to be in the Army.\n\nTherefore, I would humbly ask the Indian Dept. to consider this for us, and help to make our beloved Canada a better Country, through giving us Indians more education. I had a talk with the Principal of Elkhorn Indian School about this matter, and I found out that M.S.C.C. had quite a lot to do with the Indian education, and I point out to him.\n\nIf it would be possible if the Indian Dept. and M.S.C.C. would give us a separate High School just for Indians alone, so I would be very much obliged. If the Indian Dept. would consider this for us; also I have brought this up before several Indian Dept. Officials such as Indian Agent of The Pas, Indian Agency, but no one seems to shake a leg. But the reason I quite determined to put this through direct to you. I think I got right to ask for this as I am one of them that try to do what the Indian Dept wants an Indian to do to send their children to School. Although it is a grier sometimes in my heart knowing my children are far away from home. But I would say I don't want to grieve for nothing. I would like to see my children to be somebody when they get through their studies. Not only my children but the whole Indian Race of Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42128-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\n\nTherefore I would humbly ask the Indian Dept to reply direct to me, if possible, because you would probably hear some more from me in the near future, as I am going to work on this right here with my fellow Indians of The Pas Band. I would say a lot about this, but this ought to sound proper to understand my means and aims.\n\nHope to hear from you in the near future. Thank you Sir,\n\nFrom your obedient servant,\n\nM\u00b2 John William Harris\n\nTreaty Indian of The Pas Band.\nOttawa, June 15, 1943.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by the Department from John William Harris, who refers to himself as a member of The Pas Band.\n\nYou should inform Mr. Harris that his letter has been received by the Department but that his communication dated November 28, 1941, to which he refers, was not sent forward to this Branch.\n\nIt is somewhat difficult to learn from this letter what this Indian is actually advocating. The establishment of a high school for Indians would scarcely appear practicable, in view of the comparatively few Indian pupils who reach Grade 8. At schools where a certain percentage do reach Grade 8, provision is usually made for instruction in Grade 9. In addition to this, the Provincial Departments of Education provide high school instruction by correspondence. There is no reason why an ambitious pupil of The Pas Band should not take advantage of this offer. In any event, it is not at all likely that a high school for Indians will be established at any time in the immediate future.\n\nR. A.

O'Neill, Sec.-Treas.,\nBarrows S.D. #1667,\nBarrows, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will acknowledge your communication of November 15 re Treaty child attending Barrows S.D. #1667. I would advise in this connection that I think that if you were to take this matter up and present the case directly to the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, that payment would be made on behalf of the Treaty Indian child.\n\nI would advise that the best method of dealing with this matter would be for you, as secretary-treasurer of your district, to write direct to Mr. R. A. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, stating the circumstances surrounding the case. I feel certain that in such circumstances, consideration will be given.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAct. Chief Administrative Officer.\n\nGWFB/GWB\nBarrows, Man Nov. 29 1943\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nRe: Treaty child (Johnny McLeod)\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed you will find letters from the Dept. of Education asking that I write you about treaty child.\n\nThis treaty Indian Henry McLeod refused to pay a school fee of one dollar per month that each family that has children going to school pays its school board for the upkeep of our school, and they all do to do all work such as wood cutting and repairs free of charge to them.\n\nThis treaty states that the Indian Dept. should pay for this child schooling, and he will not help with the work, it makes it bad as the others has to pay and work and he does not, and his child get all school books and pencils free from the school.\n\nI think this Henry McLeod is from shell River Re., Man.\n\nThis child was of school age and started\nschool in October and to date has not payed, and as this treaty does not work for the school we will have to hire a man to work in his place and pay the man.\n\nI think if you see that the one dollar per month is pay and fifty cents for work a month ($1/50 one dollar and fifty cents per month) to be payed each month to me we will let him keep his child going to this school.\n\nOtherwise if he is not payed for we will have to turn his child out, and we do not want to do that, but if we do not it will mean lots of trouble for this school.\n\nHoping you will look into this matter at once.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nA F O'Neill\nsec-Treas S.D. 1667\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to a child of Henry McLeod who you state is a Treaty Indian. I understand from your letter that McLeod is not living on a reserve and, if he has been absent from a reserve for a period of 18 consecutive months, it is not the practice of this Department to pay for the education of his child or any costs for his maintenance.\n\nHowever, you were probably not aware previously of this regulation and consequently it has been decided to allow $1.50 a month for this child for the current academic year only. I note from your letter that the child entered your school on October 1 and consequently we will pay for him at the rate stated from October 1, 1943, to June 30, 1944.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Mr. O'Neill does not state to what band McLeod belongs, but he mentions that he thinks he is from Shoal River. For your information I enclose a copy of our reply to Mr. O'Neill.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter 103-128, dated the 3rd instant, I beg to advise that Henry McLeod does not belong to this Agency.

Moore R.C.M.P.\nWabowden Man.\n\nDear Mr. Board,\n\nI received information from the Dept. of Education this spring to the effect that arrangements had been made with the Indian Dept., whereby Treaty Indians would be accepted into the schools in this territory if they applied, and were recommended by you, and provided there was room etc.\n\nThe Indian Dept. we understand will bear a proportionate part of the expenses.\n\nWe have in our school one Treaty Indian girl, Flore Evans, daughter of Fred Evans. We have...\nhad her enrolled since January of this year. I have referred to the Annual Financial Report and find that the total expenditures for the school year 1944-45 were \u00a31181.25. As school did not open until December, the average monthly cost would amount to \u00a3168.75. The enrollment was 17.\n\nI trust that this is all the information that the Indian Dept. requires and that, with it, and your recommendation they can act immediately so that we may have the amount due us as soon as possible.\n\nWe have heard of two other Treaty Indian children who may be seeking admission after Christmas; namely, Alex Crate (or Craig) son of Alfred Crate, and Elejah Evans, son of Philip Evans. We shall be\na little short of seats, but if they apply and have your recommendation we shall accept them, and provide additional seats.\n\nAs you know, Mrs. Moore, one of our worst problems in these school is health conditions.

This rate is a great deal higher than we have allowed white schools previously. This is due, no doubt, to the comparatively small attendance at the school. Is there no other White school in the vicinity that Indian children could attend?

At our school at Spanish, besides the regular matriculation course each boy has an opportunity to learn several trades. The school is practically self-supporting and provides training in shoe-making, carpentry, tailoring, baking, cooking, farming in all its branches. The boy would also have an opportunity to obtain instruction in music.\n\nFor further information about the school at Spanish, please communicate with: Rev. J. R. Oliver, S.J., Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ont.\n\nIf, however, you prefer to send this boy here, please write again. This year the fee for board and tuition was $325, with laundry extra.

You will note that the cost of a year's board and tuition at this College would be a great deal less than that mentioned on the form.\n\nThe school to which they refer is the Indian residential school at Spanish, Ontario, which is conducted under the auspices of the Jesuit Order.

Mary\nSuperintendent of Education\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt seems that you did not receive my letter of Aug 24th. I was at Indian Lake, visiting my sister, when yours reached me. I immediately replied thanking you for the raise and accepting the salary indicated.\n\nAgain in Sept., I wrote to you in reply to your second letter. Regret to say that this one was\nwriting in a more familiar style and might have offended you. It was written when I was worrying myself sick of my adopted Emile Higher who was sent to (St Paul's) the Garnier School in Spanish Ont.\n\nThe boy's first letter was most pathetic and really he was shocked at the conditions of the place. He said that it reminded him of Dickens' selection \"Oliver Twist\". He is not very homesick but he is heart-broken because he wasn't sent to St Paul's. He had been working so hard to raise money for clothes also for a monthly allowance of five dollars.\n\nMusic is part of Emile and he taught himself a\n$5 dollar guitar and a violin of $7. He plays both quite well, and he expected to get lessons, but he can't touch his instruments. They're locked up until Xmas. He hasn't played once on them since he got there.\n\nHe was supposed to learn a trade; instead he says they're digging a trench of $4 \\times 2 \\times 6$. He doesn't say what it is for. After all he's only fifteen years old and he went there for an education not to be a galley slave.\n\nAs far as school work is concerned he finds it very easy in grade II. It doesn't surprise me as he was very good last year.\n\nAnother thing, Mr.\nHenry, the boy says he is not getting any mail from me. I can't understand that so I sent him a letter containing money which had registered also an insured parcel with some letters which some boys wrote to him. He got theirs but nothing from me.\n\nI raised the kid just like a white boy, I liked him just like a son and I am so worried that I can't work properly. I started taking a correspondence course and found it interesting but for the last two weeks I haven't done a thing. I am afraid of freeze-up which means a long isolation.\n\nThe place was grossly misrepresented. Please, Mr. Henry transfer him to\nSt Paul's. We'll be so well there with my sisters to visit him once in a while.\n\nOne of them is Mrs Blackburn who was at Island Lake for many years; he'd be quite at home with her.\n\nIf you have children Mr. Hearty you must know how much one can suffer and worry for them.\n\nIf you want to see Emile's letters Mr. Low has two of them which I sent to him.\n\nYours truly,\nRoland G. Laun\u00e9\nOctober 14, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant and have noted your remarks regarding Emile Hughes.\n\nWe are unable to agree with the statements that the boy has made to you regarding the Spanish Indian Residential School. Officials of the Department and the Ontario Department of Education Officials visit this school frequently and all of them report that every possible opportunity is being given to the pupils attending this school.\n\nIn view of the very large expenditure that would be necessary if the boy was transferred to the St. Paul's College, Winnipeg, we are not prepared to make any change during the current academic year.\n\nI also note your statement that certain letters that you have forwarded have not reached him. I suggest that in future communications, you address him c/o Reverend J.R. Oliver, S.J., Principal, Indian Residential School, Spanish, Ontario.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Yesterday I was checking over my accounts and I asked Tom if he knew any reason why these accounts had not been paid yet; it was then that he told me that he had typed out the statements in March and had put them in a cardboard box in my office for me to check over before mailing. Not knowing what was in this box, and believing that he had mailed the statements I did not enquire further until yesterday when I was making up the current statements.\n\nI am sorry that this has happened, it was a mistake on my part that I did not make sure at the time that the job was completed and a mistake on his part in putting them in a box and caching them away instead of leaving them on my desk for checking.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (rg 10 Volume 6488, file 42128-6, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Jan. 19| To goods supplied Catherine Umpherville and Maria Head for scrubbing Red Earth School Floors |        |\n| Feb. 2 | Goods supplied to the same women, for scrubbing Red Earth School floors | 1.00   |\n| Feb. 18| Goods supplied to the same women for janitor service                    | 1.00   |\n| Mar. 9 | Goods supplied Catherine Umpherville, also Lucy Daniels, for janitor service | 1.00   |\n| April 13| Goods supplied Maria Head and Catherine Umpherville for scrubbing school floors | 1.00   |\n| April 27| Goods supplied above women for janitor service at Red Earth School      | 1.00   |\n| May 11 | Goods supplied above women for janitor service at Red Earth School      | 1.00   |\n| June 1 | Goods supplied above women for janitor service at Red Earth School      | 1.00   |\n| June 13| Goods supplied above women for janitor service at Red Earth School      | 1.00   |\n|        | (Allot. 76-01-102)                                                      | 9.00   |\n| June 6 | To materials ordered by Red Earth School Teacher, for repair of school fence (Allot. 76-10-615) | 88     |\n| June 7 | To goods supplied to Louis Hawkeyes, for labor repairing Red Earth School fence and bell | 3.30   |\n|        | (Allot. 76-01-102)                                                      | 4.18   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I explained that the pupils should be taught to keep the place clean and tidy (Miss M's difficulty!) but not as a punishment. The only paid duty might well be lighting (not tending) the fire. Our teachers must try to get more Indians to abandon the notion that the school is a necessary evil related to family allowances and such other windfalls as can be engineered.\nOttawa, September 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. Samuel Lovell, Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Clark who recently visited the Big Eddy School, the Department has decided to allow the teacher an amount of $10.00 a month for janitor services, effective from September 1st, 1947.\n\nPayment will be made quarterly on receipt from you of the usual voucher.\n\nMiss Montgomery can then make her own arrangements for janitor services.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Waller employs various Indians for this service and on occasion charges have exceeded the amount he was reimbursed. Also Mr. Waller himself lights the school fires each morning as he has been unable to secure the services of a reliable Indian.\n\nI regret that I did not first obtain authority for increasing charges for janitor services at this school but believe the monthly increase justifiable and would request that same receive sympathetic consideration on the part of the Department.\n\nE.

Walsh, Esq.,\nAssistant Superintendent\nof Elementary Education,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nRe: Children of Arthur Elders, Sioux Narrows, Kenora District, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Walsh:\n\nI have for answer your letter of December 21, with regard to these children.\n\nFortunately, the Indian Act is very clear in such cases. Section 14 reads as follows:\n\n\"Any Indian woman who marries any person other than an Indian, or a non-treaty Indian, shall cease to be an Indian in every respect within the meaning of this Act, except that she shall be entitled to share equally with the members of the band to which she formerly belonged, in the annual or semi-annual distribution of their annuities, interest moneys and rents.........\"\n\nTherefore, the Regional Director of Family Allowances has acted quite correctly with regard to stopping the family allowances of these children. They are of non-Indian status and should attend your schools. In this regard you might be interested in the monthly report form now used in our Indian day schools. I\nam attaching a copy for your information. The perforated lower part goes to our own Supervisor of Family Allowances who takes action with regard to the payment of family allowances as indicated by the children's attendance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The eldest takes a Correspondence Course from our Ontario Department of Education.\n\nThe Regional Director of Family Allowances, 122 Front St. West, Toronto, has been sent the absentee reports in the case of these children and asked to take action to stop the family allowances to the mother. We are unaware in the Department of Education whether or not there may be some irregularity in our procedure in this regard in view of the fact that Mrs. Elders is a Treaty Indian.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Superintendent\nof Elementary Education.\n\nColonel B.

He also asked that he be allowed to reside at the school while attending High School.\n\nI was puzzled over his return, because I had been led to believe that he left school last year at his own request, and with his father's consent. However, after questioning Napoleon pretty carefully, I became convinced that he did really wish to continue his education. His father has also been to see me and has assured me that it is his wish also.\n\nI would have written you earlier about this matter, but felt that it was wise to try to get some more positive indication that Napoleon not only wished to continue his education, but had the will-power and stamina to start back to school, after being absent for over a year, and with several weeks of work to catch up on in all his classes.\n\nHe was allowed to start to High School on February 11th, and he has already shown good results. He is really applying himself. I understand that on his first test in French he had no mistakes. One evening last week I offered him the chance to attend a hockey game, but he preferred to continue working on his assignments in Mathematics and History. All this certainly seems to speak well for the boy's ability and interest in continuing his education.\n\nI feel that I am now warranted to apply for the grant paid for High School students to be paid for Napoleon Prince, and to request that he be again admitted as a resident pupil to this school. I firmly believe that he will continue his education, at least to the completion of High School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42129-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKenora, March 4th, 1949\n\nEducation Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Tuition Grants, Kenora Agency\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of the 5th ultimo, file 42129-3(E), in regard to the number of pupils attending Provincial or Private Schools.\n\nAs requested we are forwarding a list of children who are receiving tuition grants while attending the Kenora High School, and also a listing of pupils attending various Provincial Day Schools throughout the Agency, showing all the particulars requested wherever possible.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n### INDIAN CHILDREN ATTENDING PROVINCIAL OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n#### KENORA AGENCY\n\n| Acad.

The cost per student of books, athletic and other fees, instruments, and necessary incidental expenses was in excess of $100.00 per student. I have requested the amount of $100.00 per student.\n\nThe two students who completed their respective years in Kenora High School during the 1948-49 term made quite decent marks. Orpha Mandamin completed Grade IX obtaining second class honours. Sam Kopinesse completed Grade X obtaining third class honours. Both these students wish to continue their studies. I recommend that they be allowed to do so.\n\nThis year we will be faced with a very acute problem - that of accommodating all our pupils. The fact that several of our pupils expect to be returning to attend High School makes this situation even more than usually difficult. Of course, if we are to assist our better pupils - those who have passed their Entrance requirements - to stay here while continuing to attend High School, some provision should be made for separate space for them for study. That is almost impossible in this building where every nook and cranny has already been put to some necessary use. For that very reason I am very anxious to make some arrangement for some of these High School students to board in Kenora while attending High School.\n\nThe lack of adequate space to provide for them in this school is a sufficient reason for considering this course of procedure. Added to that is another reason which carries even more weight. At about the age that these young people are ready to begin attending High School, it is very important that they begin to mix socially with white people. Also it is important that they escape from the \"institutional\" atmosphere which of necessity permeates a residential school. They need to be allowed more freedom than can be permitted in a residential school containing younger children who must for obvious reasons be subjected to pretty rigid discipline. I believe that this can best be done by allowing them to board in white homes.\n\nIn spite of the fact that my experience with this race has been very limited, I can claim to have some evidence to support the view stated above. During our holidays my wife and I took two pupils from this school with us. When we visited friends of ours they accompanied us. In less than a month the extent to which they had begun to lose the sense of inferiority, and had begun to speak freely among white people, was truly amazing.\nIf we are to arrange for some of these students to board in Kenora while attending High School, then we are going to require more than the amount of the regular per capita grant to maintain them. No student can board in Kenora today for much less than $12.00 per week.\n\nI should very much like to arrange for a few of our students to board during the coming term. If it is felt that this is an experiment of doubtful value, may I suggest that I be authorized to make arrangements for not more than two of our pupils to board in Kenora this year. I have already discussed the possibility in one suitable home, but of course am unable to state definitely that there is a home available, until authorized to make necessary arrangements.\n\nMay I stress the necessity for giving this matter fair consideration. Even with much more space available than we have in this school, our High School students are not being given as good an opportunity to succeed as the average English-speaking student. They begin High School with many handicaps. If we are to expect them to succeed, then we must be prepared to make some additional expenditures. If our present students find things too difficult, we can hardly expect their followers to be enthusiastic.\n\nPlease give this matter the consideration which it seems to warrant.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKenora, August 9th, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Tuition Grants, Kenora Agency.\n\nAttached hereto please find application for tuition grant for each of the following - Josephine Crow, Isobel Redsky, Mary Celene Ross, Peter Crow, Donald Churchill (Port Arthur Agency), Robert Major and James Robert Green. These pupils were successful in passing their entrance examination this last Spring and will be in residence at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School while attending the Kenora High School.\n\nIt is recommended that these applications be approved as outlined in the attached letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nWe would also ask that tuition grant for Orpha Mandamin who passed her Grade IX examination and Sammy Kopinesse who completed his Grade X examinations, be authorized.\n\nMr. Ross has requested authority for the amount of $12.00 per week to be used to board his two senior pupils (Orpha Mandamin and Sammy Kopinesse) in private white homes in Kenora during the coming term, and we would recommend that this request as outlined in the attached letter be granted.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nEnclosed:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42129-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAugust 19th, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Peterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nRe: Tuition Grants - Pupils of Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School Attending Kenora High School\n\nJosephine Crowe Donald Churchill -\nIsobel Redsky (Pt. Arthur agency)\nMary Colene Ross Robert Major\nPeter Crowe Jas. Robt. Green\n\nTuition grants for the above named pupils for the school year 1949-50 are authorized, and the Department will pay the following amounts:\n\n(a) Per capita grants applicable to pupils of the Cecelia Jeffrey Residential School.\n(b) An extra grant of $75.00 a year.\n\nThese grants will be paid quarterly contingent upon the receipt at this office of reports certifying satisfactory attendance and progress.\n\nIt is noted that the Principal requests that the special maintenance grant be increased from $75.00 to $100.00. It is regretted that funds presently available do not permit this action. A request of this nature may, however, be considered if it is made when our main estimates are again under consideration.\n\nThe monetary arrangements suggested for Orpha Mandamin and Sammy Kopinase require further information.\nand consideration. It appears that the Principal is suggesting that in addition to the per capita grant and the special maintenance grant, the sum of $12.00 per week be allowed for each of these pupils. For a 36-week school year, this represents an additional amount of $432.00 a pupil. The total cost for each of these pupils would thus reach a figure ordinarily considered excessive. Alternative suggestions are, accordingly, requested.\n\nIn respect of the pupils named, it is desired that as soon as the information becomes available, the reports of the high school's educational and vocational counsellor be made available to this Division.\n\nBernard F. Barry,\nSept. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Tuition Grants - Orpha Mandamin &\nSam Kominesse\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of the 19th ultimo, file 42129-3(E3) in regard to tuition grants for the above noted pupils who are attending the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIn regard to the fourth paragraph of your letter, re the above noted and the arrangements suggested by Mr. Ross, Principal of the School, for the coming term, you will now find attached a copy of a letter from the principal which will clarify the situation.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be granted for the expenditure of $24.00 per month for each of these pupils during the coming school year, as a special maintenance grant.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora, Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe TUITION GRANTS.\n\nIn reply to your letter dated August 19th:\n\nIt would appear that my letter on this subject had been misunderstood. I did not suggest that a special maintenance of $12.00 per week be made for the High School students for whom I wished to arrange board, in addition to the per capita grant. I merely pointed out the impossibility of paying that amount from the per capita grant\u2014which is of course less than that amount. What I wish is a supplementary grant sufficient to allow me to pay $12.00 per week from the total of this grant and the per capita grant. This supplementary grant would need to be about $24.00 per month each.\n\nI trust that this may be considered.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nSeptember 9, 1949.\n\nMr. T.C. Ross,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Res., School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nThis refers to Sammy Kopinesse\nand Orpha Mandomin, two Indian High School students\nfrom Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nThe Department cannot give your\nproposition favourable consideration. It is felt\nthat arrangements should be made to place these\nchildren in the Residential School as grant-earning\npupils and have them attend High School similarly\nas other High School pupils. The Department is\nprepared to pay the school the additional $75. per\nannum as paid for other High School pupils in your\nschool and other Residential Schools operated by\nthe Department.\n\nIf this arrangement cannot be\ncarried out, the children should be discharged from\nthe Residential School and the Indian Superintendent\nadvised where he can proceed to make other necessary\narrangements and apply to the Department for a tuition\ngrant.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter\nto Mr. Paterson for his information.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nP.M.,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of copy of your letter addressed to Mr. T.G. Ross, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, file 42129-3 (RC), dated the 9th of September, in regard to Benny Kopinawka and Joseph Bandman two high school students from the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential school.\n\nIn this regard you will find attached a copy of a letter from Mr. Ross dated the 24th ultimo.\n\nMr. Ross the Principal of this school has taken a very great interest in the students with a view to fitting them to take a place in the white community as citizens, and this can only be accomplished by the children overcoming their inferiority complex. We feel the only way of overcoming this complex is to board the pupils attending high school in private white homes. This cannot be done on the per capita grant and the tuition grant alone, but with an additional $24.00 per month each or $240.00 per teaching year. Mr. Ross does not wish to have all the high school students boarded out, only the two. After the present school year has been finished we will be able to assess the benefit these children have derived.\n\nWe do not feel that it would be feasible from an administrative point of view to have these arrangements made through this office.\n\nWe would very strongly recommend that an additional maintenance grant of $240.00 each, for these two pupils be authorized.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe TUITION GRANT\n\nA letter received from the Chief of the Education Division suggests that my letter to you dated Aug 8, 1949, has been misunderstood. If this misunderstanding is due to lack of clarity on my part, I regret it. I was trying to suggest a solution to a problem which will soon become acute here: that of accommodating all our pupils, including those attending High School. The point of my letter appears to have been lost almost entirely.\n\nMr. Phelan suggests no alternative but that of discharging High School students from this school. I feel certain that if he had grasped the problem presented in my letter, some more considerate suggestion would have been put forward. I am certain that Mr. Phelan is just as interested as you or I in endeavouring to raise the standard of education reached by our Indian young people. May I ask that the problem presented in my letter of Aug 8 (not inferences deduced therefrom) be given the consideration warranted.\n\nIf further reason is needed to support the suggestion put forward, may I venture to remind those concerned that a vast expenditure is involved in educating Indian children. If we are unable to meet the needs of those who are capable of continuing their education and wish to do so, then much of our work must be wasted. Surely we do not wish to educate them so far and then stop. Surely to do so would be to adopt a very short-sighted point of view. Even my own very limited experience with your Department has convinced me that it is a very real concern for the welfare of the Indian people. May I ask for more careful consideration of this problem.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nT.C. Ross\nPrincipal.\nOctober 15th, 1949.\n\nMr. N. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of October 4th, your file 129/25-8, enclosing a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School with regard to Sammy Kopinesse and Orpha Mandamin, who are attending the Cecelia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nWe have carefully noted the contents of both letters, and we have no doubt that Mr. Ross is interested in the welfare of the two pupils mentioned. I feel that you should assure him that Departmental officials are also interested.\n\nWe showed our interest in these two children by the instructions contained in the 2nd paragraph of official letter of September 9th to Mr. Ross. Our experience, covering many years, proves that when a residential school is situated close to a high school, the best possible manner of having the Indian children attend the high school, is to have them reside at the residential school and attend the high school as day pupils. By doing so, the Department is assured that their leisure hours will be properly spent, as they will then come under the supervision of the residential school staff.\nWe cannot agree with you or Mr. Ross that for the purpose of overcoming the inferiority complex of Indian children, it is necessary to have them board with white people. I might add that it would simply be impossible to handle the matter as suggested by Mr. Ross from a financial standpoint. We inferred this in our letter of September 9th, in which it was stated that either the children remained in the residential school and the school management drew the grant plus an additional amount of $75.00, or the children were discharged from the school.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Ross will see the necessity for close supervision of the children during their leisure hours, and carry out the wishes of the Department by having the children reside at the Cecelia Jeffrey School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Principal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\nAddress: Kenora, Ontario\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov 4 | To advanced educational grant for Josephine Crow, Mary Celene Ross, Peter Crow, Robert Major, James Robert Green, Orpha Mandamin, Sammy Kopinesse and Napoleon Prince for the months of September and October 1949 at $7.50 per month each.

I appreciate greatly the good the kind fathers of the Juniorate and those of Stronard have done to me. I appreciate you especially for paying my school at the Juniorate.\n\nI do not think I will return to the Juniorate because the fathers, who always look for our good, have advised me not to, since they think that priesthood is not my vocation. I told them that I would like to continue my studies. They advised me to address myself to you since you are always looking for the good of the Indians.\n\nLast June I wrote three examinations from the University of Ottawa. I received my results lately. Here they are: French 55, Latin 58 and 62 for Greek. I also wrote the examinations of the department of Alberta. I did not receive my results yet. I am in Grade II. I will be in Grade III next year.\n\nIf the department is willing to pay for my school next year, I would greatly appreciate it, because I would like to com-\ntime till my studies are completed. I will do my best to be worthy of it. I would like to take a course in engineering, but this idea may change.\n\nI would be happy to continue my studies, if it were possible. For now, I am doing a little work here and there at the mission. I help the brother at the barn and do the work he gives me to do. I enjoy it, for it is not very hard.\n\nOnce more, I thank you very much for paying my school at the Juniorate.\n\nGoodbye and thank you.\n\nGratefully yours,\nJoseph Providence.\nMission St Bernard\nGrouard, Alberta\n\n5 ao\u00fbt 1941\n\nM.

Father Habay, formerly of Fort Vermilion who has known and looked after this boy since babyhood.\n\nAs you are probably aware of the fact, Joseph is an orphan and has been raised by the mission at Fort Vermilion. He has never lived on a Reserve and would feel entirely lost amongst his own people as he cannot even talk their language.\n\nIn view of these facts, and considering the boy's good behaviour in the past and good application at school, I would respectfully recommend that further assistance be granted to enable him to complete his Grade XII.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant with reference to Joseph Providence. Very careful consideration has been given to the correspondence which you forwarded and it is noted that while apparently Providence had decided to take a certain course he has now discontinued this and wants to change to another course.\n\nIt is extremely doubtful if this boy would ever complete any course and consequently the money expended on him would be wasted. I feel that the time has now arrived when he should get work. There should be no difficulty in doing this under present conditions. We are not prepared to make him any further grant and you should so advise him immediately.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you at once regarding Harry Thomas. Let me know this boy's age, what course he is following and the possible length of time it will take him to complete it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. N.P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nSeptember 26, 1941.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for acknowledgement your 103-131 of the 16th instant, re Joseph Providence, and I am extremely sorry to hear of the Department's decision in his case.\n\nIt is very unfortunate that this young man feels that he does not possess the required dispositions for priesthood, but he is most anxious to complete his Grade XII, at the Juniorate Edmonton, which would enable him to gain admittance to University or even to get better positions, should he not be able to continue his studies for lack of financial assistance. As it is, Joseph cannot get a position anywhere, as his standing is not high enough, and as for working on a farm or as a labourer he does not know the first thing about it. I consider that he will be a charge to us as he has no home and no people to go to.\n\nI wish that the Department would reconsider his case. The boy appears to me very serious and honest. He is quite clever too, he is only 17 yrs. old and has completed his grade XI. He talks good English and French and he is a very studious pupil, highly praised by all his teachers for his good conduct and excellent work at school.\n\nHarry Thomas is now 21 yrs. old. He is at present at Lebret, studying for priesthood under the auspices of the Oblate Fathers, and therefore, he will not require further financial assistance from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nN.P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 4, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to Joseph Providence.\n\nI note your suggestion that he be allowed to continue to take Grade 12 as this would enable him to gain admittance to a university. The Department cannot agree with you in this regard because it is not our intention to provide funds for a university course for this boy. As far as obtaining a position is concerned he is just as well qualified with Grade 11 as with Grade 12.\n\nHowever, in view of your appeal on his behalf, the Department is prepared to consider allowing him a tuition grant for one more year only provided he takes a vocational or business course. He might even consider a normal school course if his present standing permits him to enter normal school. You should discuss the matter with him again and let me know what course you consider he can take for the academic year 1941-42. It is understood, of course, that we will not favour an academic course for that year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. N.P.

This report covers this matter and since the Departmental reply was sent to Mr. C.P.

I am shipping cream and raising hogs, and also got 40 acres of wheat and oats in crop.\n\nHoping to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlfred Isiow\n\nThe above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\nJames Mack J.P.\nThe Indian Affairs Br., Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI again refer to the letter of the Supt. of Welfare and Training of the 24-9-43 and I wish to report that when I forwarded my reply to this letter on the 9th Inst.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent Child Welfare,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThis is just to tell you that our new building for the factory is still in process. The Indians here have the entire responsibility of the erection of this building. They have named a leader among themselves and the people deal entirely with him until the building is completed. It is not going as fast as I would like it to go, but we are working with the adults on the same principal as we were working with the children in the C.Y.C. They must take the initiative, the lead, and the responsibility. If we take into consideration, as it is so often said, that the Indians are children or minors, it is up to us to educate them into becoming adults. For this purpose, I know of no other method but to make them assume responsibilities. Really, they have been doing very well. The cellar 20 x 40 has been dug and cribbed. The logs for the building are all cut, partly hauled and peeled. They are now starting to hew them on 2 sides and soon they will be putting up the walls. They have also made cash donations towards the building.\n\nI was just telling the Bishop today that I wish we could be building all the time this way. They work together, they take the leadership, the responsibilities, and through trial and error, they are receiving the most wonderful education that they could possibly receive. This is just the objective that I was trying to attain when I first spoke of industries. Seeing these results of which I was sure before we ever started, I hope we will continue to find projects for them that they may keep on working collectively.\n\nI hope to be able to inform you before very long that our building is up. It would not be a monument suitable for the Ottawa city because I am afraid it is going to be a picture of primitive un-skilfulness. It will certainly be only a picture of the degree we have reached in the civilization of this population.\n\nThanking you kindly once again, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nP.S. The old pupils are on the war-path; they want Sr. Jean back here. They want to write the Mother General to this effect, begging her for the sake of this population, to bring Sr. Jean back to Grouard.\nDriftpile Alberta,\nNov. 17th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Kan.\n\nRe: Indian Children Attending Public Schools\n\nThe matter of Indian Children attending Public Schools has been brought to my attention, on different occasions, and before doing anything regarding this matter, I would refer you to Const. Skag's letters of 9-9-43, 9-10-43 and 21-9-43, our File 5-100-43-5 all relating to this matter. Owing to my not knowing exactly what to do in such cases, (as a beginner in this work) I would respectfully request that you send me definite instructions as to what to do in such cases.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nNovember 15th, 1943.\n\nDr. McGill,\nDepartment of Natural Resources\nand Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short time ago I was consulted by Paul Sound, a Treaty Indian who resides on a reserve near Kinuso, Alberta. Mr. Sound informs me that he is desirous of sending his children who are 10 and 8 years respectively, to the school in the town of Kinuso but that the town authorities refuse to permit his children to attend the said school by reason of the fact that he is a Treaty Indian and resides on a reserve where there is an Indian school. Mr. Sound purchased 3 lots in the town of Kinuso on the 2nd of November 1943 and would like to know whether or not it is possible for a Treaty Indian to send his children to a town school.\n\nIf it is not possible for you to give me this information I would be very much obliged if you would refer this letter to the legal office in your department.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPETER GRESZCHUK\n\nPG:J3\nOttawa, November 20, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. CORY,\n\nI am sending forward herewith a letter received by this Branch from Peter Greszchuk, Barrister, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nThe receipt of this letter has not been acknowledged.\n\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nAttached hereto please find letter from Peter Gresschuk, Solicitor of Edmonton, dated the 16th instant, re Paul Sound, a treaty Indian residing on a reserve near Kinuso, Alberta, who is desirous of sending his children who are 10 and 8 years respectively to the school in the town of Kinuso and he wishes to be advised as to whether it is possible for a treaty Indian to send his children to a town school.\n\nThe question submitted to the Department is difficult to answer and if answered at all must be in the broadest terms. An Indian living on the reserve is a denizen of the Province in which he resides and has all the rights and liabilities of a white person. There are, of course, definite restrictions under the Indian Act where an Indian is living within a reserve.\n\nIn so far as Paul Sound's children's school attendance is concerned it would seem that as he owns property in the town and it is assumed his taxes are paid, he should have the same school privileges as other property holders in the municipality. On the other hand it has been held in a British Columbia case that there is no duty cast upon a school board to receive within its schools children who are not resident within its own municipal district.\n\nAs the question Mr. Gresschuk asks is one that deals with Alberta law it is not felt that any information which we can give him would be very helpful other than the statement that an Indian within the Province has, for all practical purposes, the same rights as a white person.\n\nSolicitor.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1943.\n\nEX.D.\nA.\n\nMr. P.J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, referring to previous correspondence with reference to Indian children attending public schools. As you state in your letter, Inspector Schmidt looked into this matter very carefully when he was at the agency in October, but at that time he was particularly investigating the request of Alfred Giroux. In regard to this man's children, Mr. Schmidt expressed the opinion that following his conversation with him Giroux would be willing to send his children to the Joussard School and Mr. Schmidt added that it was unlikely the white school at Driftpile would be in operation this year.\n\nAs a general rule the Department prefers having Indian children attend our own residential schools where they receive every possible care and attention, as well as a good education. For varied or serious reasons an Indian might be permitted to send his children to an outside school, but in all such cases we require a definite recommendation from the Indian Agent or the Inspector of Indian Agencies and in addition we would only allow such procedure on the distinct understanding that the children would attend the white school regularly. We have found in many cases that parents use the excuse of wishing to send their children to a white school simply to avoid sending them to any school. In other words, if we give our permission to send them to a white school some Indian parents enroll the child at the white school and the child seldom, if ever, attends.\nIf you have any requests by Indians residing on a reserve to send their children to a white school rather than to the Indian residential schools provided for them, you should submit all cases to this office, giving full particulars and at the same time making a recommendation. Each case will have to be dealt with on its own merits.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOur Public Works are not progressing nearly as fast as I would desire. They are putting up the rafters today. Fortunately we have had marvellous weather and the men were able to keep up the work. They have made many a white man lie in this that they kept going. I doubt however that we will be able to use the building before next Spring.\n\nAs regards this building which is to be our Factory, our Store, our Warehouse and all, it is considered here as a very large building. It is large for a log house and it rather embarrassed the contractors... hence the delay. So far, it has cost the people $875.00 which they have been able to raise in this pitiful settlement of Grouard. The revenues have come from the profits of their Co-operative ($500.00). The balance was procured by them and from them through donations, socials and bingos. We have our weekly meetings of the Co-operative in which they discuss their problems (Indian way) but which is left entirely to them to find the means and ways by which they are to complete the project they have undertaken with considerable interest. At every meeting I propose to put off the completion of the building till next Spring at which time we may have more funds, but I am voted down every time. And that is the way it goes. May I add that this has been entirely an Indian enterprise. I have permitted no White Man to build in at any time nor under any consideration. There were some who would have gladly helped and the Indians would have gladly accepted their services but I strictly refused. The Indians would have been glad to shun the responsibility of the project, though, just as children, they would have been sorry to see anyone else but themselves get the credit of the same. If Indians are Minors, as we so often say, it is our job to educate them to become adults...and it is great time that we do so. This education can only be given by giving them responsibilities. The work is not as good and it has cost us more...but a thousand dollars is not much in education, surely. It appears to me that we have always treated them like babies and...babies they have remained to this day. In any case, this project has worked wonders amongst them. It has given them a sense of pride, honesty and sociability. It has given them a common interest which they feel now will be kept up in this environment as it keeps on developing. It has done away with a lot of grumbling that is bound to spring from idle minds. The workers have been criticized publicly at our meetings, by their own people for being just what we think they are: too slow, too easy-going, too careless...and perhaps, not tops in their business. The workers themselves realize it now. They say: \"if we were to start the building over again, we wouldn't do it that way or that...etc...etc.\" Yes, they have made mistakes...but White Men make mistakes also. In any case, they are quite happy about it all...and that's a lot.\n\nWe have no more funds however, and the workers will have to wait for their pay next Saturday. How is it going to turn out, I don't know. I really think they have been fleeced of all the pennies.\nthey had here in Grouard, so I don't know where the next funds are going to come from. It may be that finally we will have to stall the work till next Spring. I will certainly not allow them to take any more out of the Store. That is dangerously low as it is now. They spoke of borrowing some and I told them to go ahead if they wished but that they would have to back it up themselves staking their horses, wagons, houses etc., etc. They were not particularly fussy about doing that.\n\nMay I add that the Old Pupils are really the ones who are pushing this project. They see and say that their children may profit by it. That is quite a step. It also has given them an incentive to better their homes. Three buildings are actually going up here now and four or five families have had the ambition to get Wall Paper to decorate their houses. In some cases this Wall Paper had to be pasted on logs. It wasn't bad at that. I had the privilege to help some of them out in putting up this paper and develop a very sore back. They are quite proud of their work.\n\nI don't want you to think, Mr. Hoey, that Grouard has become a Paradise, however. There is a lot of corruption among the people yet though these activities have helped to correct some of it. But I do hope that the Mounted Police will help me with some of the hopeless cases. In any case, there is a lot of work to do yet and it will take more than a year to do it. What really matters, I feel, is that we try to do it and do it the right way.\n\nThe Old Pupils miss Sister Jean a great deal. They simply won't accept the idea that she is not to come back. She was really one \"of a thousand\" as far as they were concerned and they have reasons to think this treatment is not fair. Herein, a copy of a letter sent to the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence. It speaks for itself.\n\nPardon me for being so lengthy...yet much more could be said.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. G. Forcade, O.M.I.\nDear Mother General,\n\nAs we look at our school now, it has already changed to something of the past. And yet only a short while ago did we gather at its doors to see our dear old teacher whose heart carried many of our secrets, and whose love smile did lift many a weary heart, whose words of encouragement guided many a faltering step back to God's hard and narrow road. To her, we could always go; but now when we do so we find we are heavy of heart, only emptiness greets us.\n\nWith this in mind, we, her old pupils come to you, to ask if she can't return in our midst. Many of us are spread distances apart, in these northern districts as well as elsewhere and therefore know that this place needs her badly. Not only for ourselves but also for the sake of the younger generation who need her guidance, as well as some of our own children who now attend our old school. This younger generation needs her guidance as in our day how the world is ever changing we want to see them be an honor to their school and God, and for that we need Sister Jean Placidus. For without her, things could not and will not be the same again ever.\n\nOther sisters are very devoted and good in their own way, but Sister Jean, why, she has simply given her heart and soul into that work and understands so well, even the meanest can't help but be good, guided by her. She's given everything into all and everything that was concerned with the children. Even the singing in Church, you should just hear it now, it's a pity and a shame. The accompaniment for the singing, why even the best musician could not replace her. That reason is clear, she knows the children's singing and put her heart and soul into music and the children can't help but feel the effect. So we are now asking, begging you for the sake of these children, and our own to have her come back to our old school here.\n\nLook at the wonderful work of the C.Y.O. The very beginning of its existence is nothing now but a memory. The souls and bodies of these children were changed in so short a time, through the C.Y.O., those who have been there before and after this came into life could easily see the change. What we need in our day and age is good clean recreation for the younger ones, that was only the beginning and look now nothing but a failure. After having endured so many hardships to get onto a good working scale, it is now all lost. We don't want only the memory of Sister Jean Placidus, we want her in person.\n\nWe cannot see these children plunge right in the turmoils of badness without good sound weapons with which to combat them. And these weapons are what they receive in school, and which they accept readily if they are encouraged by one they know has their confidence and their interest at heart. No matter how good a person is, they are confronted with evil every way they turn and for that reason they must have goodness implanted in their souls, encouragement and good guidance, by their teachers to prepare them to face hardships and shun evil after they leave this school.\nThink also of all those old pupils far and wide, even in warring zones, who look forward to receive words of cheer and encouragement. They need that boosting of soul and spirit. Now where is that encouragement from her? Not from the old school as they would wish. Even so the Echoes keep on, it could never be the same, for Sister Jean is not at the helm. So we beg of you to consider this, and lend an ear to the plea of her old timers. Though not all can be present, their sole desire is this, that she may return to our old school.\n\nWe could keep on writing and writing, it could never be enough to give her credit, but we pray God daily to bring her back. For surely the work of a religious like her, especially in winning souls and bringing back strays to God are worth leaving where she can do most good and keep reaping, not only among the old timers, the younger people, but also among the peoples of this place and outlying districts. She's won their hearts and if by her kind words and works, bring these people to their church duties just when that was beating fruit, she had to leave.\n\nSo we hope that in the not far distant future our desire will be fulfilled. And when after this terrible war is over, some of her old timers who return and those who still live on may come back to a happy reunion with our dear friend and teacher Sister Jean Placidus, in our old school.\n\nSincerely, in the name of old timers,\n\n(signed) Mrs. J.B.Ciroux.\nDear Father Forcade:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nI was particularly anxious to learn of the progress made in the construction of your vocational building. It occurred to me that the actual time at which the building will be completed is not, after all, very important. The encouraging fact is that you have started in on what appears to me to be a worth-while project that will be finished in due course and will, I have no doubt, prove of great value to the Indian population.\n\nI was interested also in your reference to Sister Jean. A few months ago I wrote to the head of the Order expressing the hope that she would see her way clear to send Sister Jean back to Grouard. The letter in reply did not hold out much hope that such action would be taken. However, it is just possible that the pupils who have written requesting the return of this Sister may be more fortunate than I was.\n\nYou are doing really good work at Grouard and I do hope that you will not get discouraged by reason of the delays and other difficulties that are inseparable from Indian missionary work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. G. Forcade, O.M.I.,\nGrouard Indian Residential School,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, November 29, 1943.\n\nRe: Paul Sound.\n\nDear Mr. Greszchuk:\n\nYour letter of November 15, 1943, was immediately following its receipt here, sent forward to the Departmental Solicitor.\n\nI am today in receipt of a memorandum from the Solicitor, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The question submitted to the Department is difficult to answer and if answered at all must be in the broadest terms. An Indian living on the reserve is a denizen of the province in which he resides and has all the rights and liabilities of a white person. There are, of course, definite restrictions under the Indian Act where an Indian is living within a reserve.\n\n\"In so far as Paul Sound's children's school attendance is concerned it would seem that as he owns property in the town and it is assumed his taxes are paid, he should have the same school privileges as other property holders in the municipality. On the other hand it has been held in a British Columbia case that there is no duty cast upon a school board to receive within its schools children who are not resident within its own municipal district.\n\n\"As the question Mr. Greszchuk asks is one that deals with Alberta law it is not felt that any information which we can give him would be very helpful other than the statement that an Indian within the province has, for all practical purposes, the same rights as a white person.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPeter Greszchuk, Esq., B.A., LL.B.,\nBarrister, Solicitor and Notary Public,\n719 McLeod Building,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDirector.\nBrownvale Alberta.\nDec. 7th. 1943.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI was very glad to get your letter. The reasons why I did not send my kids to the Mission is I want them to be in health. Whenever they come home from the Mission, they either have scabs or itch. Already two of the kids that went to the Mission are not well and I believe I don't think you would like your children to be sick, and so do I, and the two kids that were in the Mission know how they were treated, so I just don't want my kids to come home sick every time they go to the Mission. There is all kinds of sickness and the Sisters don't look after the sick ones good. So from there you can tell how they are treated. Ever since I got the kids going to school here, they are lots better, lots of fresh air and exercises. I'd rather pay for the school here than to send my kids to the Mission. There's all kinds of sickness going around, and if you don't want to pay for them, I will pay myself. Well that is all.\n\nSigned Alex Lawrence.\nDriftpile Alberta\nDec. IIth. 1943.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Can.\n\nI am submitting an application from Mr. Alex Lawrence to have his children attend a public school, instead of the Indian Residential School, which in my opinion is not justified. The reasons given by Mr. Lawrence are not sound, as I have visited some of these Schools previous to being employed as Indian Agent, and I have visited the one at Joussard since being employed as Agent, and I have found out that all children are well cared for, as for food, clothing and cleanliness. From past experience, I would say that the children attending the Indian Residential Schools, are generally in an unhealthy condition at the opening of the school term, and it generally takes a little time before to improve their state of health.\n\nI do not recommend this application, but I am leaving this matter entirely for your decision, and will abide by it.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian agent,\nOttawa,\nDecember 17, 1943.\n\nMr. P.J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the application of Mr. Alex Lawrence to have his children attend a public school.\n\nOur policy in regard to such applications was outlined in official letter of November 25, 1943. In view of the information contained in your letter and also in the father's letter, the Department cannot see any reason why his children should not attend one of the Indian residential schools and we are not prepared to make any allowance for their attending a white school.\n\nIt is intimated by the father that he is prepared to pay for their tuition at a white school and, if he does so, the Department does not wish to interfere. However, in the event of his making such arrangements I should appreciate it if you would ascertain from time to time from the principal of the school if the children attend regularly. If not, you should report again to the Department and further instructions will be issued to you.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nJanuary 14th, 1946.\n\nBillie Beaton,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Paul Sound (or Sound).\n\nWhen I was at Kinsao on the 5th of November 1943, I was consulted by one Paul Sound in connection with his right to send his children to the Kinsao School at Kinsao Alberta.\n\nMr. Sound informed me that he is a Treaty Indian but that he had purchased a lot in the town of Kinsao and intended to move to Kinsao. I understand that since that date Mr. Sound has moved in with his family to Kinsao but that the Kinsao school refuses to admit his children.\n\nSince Mr. Sound no longer lives on the reserve and has purchased property in the town of Kinsao, it appears to me that he should have all the rights of a white person and that his children should be permitted to enter and attend the town school at Kinsao.\n\nI know that the Dominion Government has established schools for the education of the Treaty Indians' children but since Mr. Sound no longer resides on the reserve but in the town of Kinsao, his children should be permitted to attend the town school.\n\nI might say that I have written to the Department of Education at Edmonton and they take the stand by reason of the letter which you wrote to the Kinsao school or to Mr. James, the Indian Agent, that the provision of educational facilities for the children of Treaty Indians is the responsibility of the Ottawa Government, that the children of Paul Sound ought to be sent to the reserve school.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42131-3, part 1)\nPhilip Phelan, - 2\n\n1/14/44.\n\nI would be very much obliged therefore if you would review the whole situation in connection with the children of Paul Sound in view of the fact that he now resides in Kinuso and owns property there.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPETER [Signature]\n\nPG:JG\nOttawa,\nJanuary 21, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to Paul Sound.

I am told by the Secretary of that school that on being refused admittance of his children to attend that school, he moved his family back to the farm. As far as I can see, I believe that he is taking that course to gain an entry for his children at that school, as I do not think that he himself will quit the farm.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 14th ultimo and my reply of the 21st ultimo, with regard to the children of Paul Sewan.\n\nI am now advised by the Indian Agent that this man and his family are again residing on the Indian reserve and consequently it is thought that their children should attend an Indian school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI had always hoped that I would be getting pictures of the new building and send them along to you when writing, but these have not come yet and I do not wish to delay any longer to give you news of our project.\n\nThe new building is nearly completed though very roughly. We had hoped to move in on the first anniversary of our Co-Operative, i.e., on the 1st of February, but we have been unable to do so. In the meantime, we are still working in the basement of the school where we operate our store. There are 6 women at work in the leathercrafts down here; they, as well as the employees in the construction of the building, are all old pupils. I remember your stressing the importance of employing old pupils and I did not think at the time that that would be possible but I find that it works out very much to your satisfaction. Five of the girls who are now working here were at school last year. When we get well started, we hope to be able to train girls who are presently at school. We are producing right now under very unfavourable circumstances. The new building will afford us a much better opportunity to produce. Our greatest difficulty then will be to find sufficient funds to get raw material.\n\nAt our meeting last Saturday the yearly financial report of the Co-Operative was given. As compared to the $15.00 with which we started last February, we find we now have assets to the amount of $5000. Our liabilities including shares amount to $870, leaving us a net credit balance of $1330. Nevertheless we are short of cash owing to the construction in progress. The people, however, are very satisfied and beginning to understand that they might be able to do something if they stick together, save and work. All in all things are going very well with them. It will be a very tough pull for some months until such time as we have enough capital to purchase stocks in sufficient quantities, and in due time with their comprehension of the work I hope we will be able to manage.\n\nAs soon as I do get pictures of the building, I shall send them on to you.\n\nThanking you once again for the very kind assistance you have given us, I remain,\n\nyours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42131-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Father Forcade:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant, in which you express regret that you were unable, at the time of writing, to send forward snapshots of the new building.\n\nI can assure you that we shall look forward, with interest, to the receipt of these photographs, when it is convenient for you to send them forward. In the meantime, I want to congratulate you on the outstanding success of your co-operative organization. An organization that has grown from a small beginning, with $15.00 of actual assets, to an organization with $5,000.00 worth of assets, with only $2,870.00 of a liability, is indeed a worthwhile enterprise. I am very anxious that you should not become discouraged in this work. I have a feeling that this accomplishment at Grouard will some day stand out as an example to other Indian schools and to other groups of Indians throughout the Dominion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

If the Department allowed tuition fees for them at the white school, is there any definite assurance that they would attend regularly?

The nearest post office to this school is Goodfellow, Alberta. He wishes to know if any provisions have been made towards the education of these Indian children.\n\nSince you are about to embark upon a Treaty Trip, which will take you to Horse Lake Reserve on May 19th, I believe this would be a good opportunity to look into the education situation in that area. Failing this, you might get in touch with Mr. Galibois, who had similar problems at the Fort St. John Agency, and who might be able to handle this for you, provided he can find the time. A copy of this letter is going to Mr. Galibois for his information.\n\nIf you find that Indian children are attending the white school at Kelly Lake, you should find out what the enrollment is and what it could be if more of them were induced to attend.\n\nThe Department is quite prepared to make a per capita grant for each Indian child attending school.

For a long time we thought that he was going to die,\nbut he eventually improved and we amputated his left leg above\nthe knee to get him back to normal. Since then he has done\nvery well and has remained well for the past eight months.\n\nThis boy is anxious to try to increase his educational\nstandard and, if possible, obtain clerical work. He roughly\nhas a grade six standing and it was indicated by the Provincial\nRehabilitation Officer who saw him that he would require at\nleast a grade eight before much could be done to help him.\n\nWe wondered if the Department in Ottawa would deem\nit advisable to try to help this boy further his education and\ngive him training as a clerk so that he could carry on and earn\nhis own living in spite of his disability. If this cannot be\ndone this boy will be a public charge for the rest of his life\nand it would be rather tragic to feel that we couldn't do some-\nthing, at his age, to make him a worthwhile and respectable\nIndian.\n\nAnything that can be done for this boy will be very\nmuch appreciated as he is a very likeable lad and has shown some\nambition which is to his credit.\n\nThis boy is, at present, back home at the Lesser Slave Lake Agency.\n\nH.

Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nLeo has an attractive personality. He is better than average in appearance. If he could be persuaded to continue his formal education I believe he could become a very useful and happy citizen. The staff at the Charles Camsell Hospital Edmonton, has I believe, attempted to persuade Leo to continue his education but I believe that he has been persuaded against his will. His present ambition is to operate an elevator in an office building in Edmonton. He is very interested in the opposite sex; quite a natural urge considering he has no outlet in physical activity. His mother states that Leo would be happy as an elevator operator because he would see plenty of girls.\n\nLeo is very enamoured with city life. I suggested that he attend school at Canyon Creek or at St. Bruno's Residential School at Jouxard and that, when he had completed Grade 9 or Grade 10, he could attend a Business College in Edmonton. He showed little real interest in my suggestion. He said though, that he would work very hard at his studies if he were allowed to attend school in Edmonton. I told him that he would be much older and much taller than the children in a Grade 8 class in a city school and that he would feel rather out of place, but he seems determined to return to Edmonton regardless of the hardships.\n\nIn reply to my question regarding his interest in reading, Leo said that his eyes gave him considerable pain after he had read for any length of time.\n\nMy recommendation is that an attempt be made to find a position for Leo in Edmonton as elevator operator. Failing that, and if he could be persuaded, he might be enrolled in one of the Day or Residential School in this area.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nsuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Leo Sowan, Swan River Reserve.\n\nYour file 103-131 (E3)\n\nRecently I visited Leo Sowan at his home in Canyon Creek. The following is a summary of the information which I obtained.\n\nName of Parents: Father - Theophile Sowan.\nMother - Nancy Sowan\n\nEconomic Status: Subsistence level. Eight children younger than Leo.\n\nReligion: Roman Catholic\n\nSchooling: Claims to have finished Grade 7.\n\nVocational Experience: None\n\nFluency in English: Good\n\nFluency in French: Nil\n\nActivities since discharged from hospital: To use his own words \"Just loafing.\"\n\nDoes he wear an artificial limb: He was using crutches at the time I visited him. He stated that he had not yet become accustomed to the artificial limb which was supplied to him recently at the Charles Camell Hospital and that the uneven ground in Canyon Creek made the use of the\nOctober 19, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant with further reference to Leo Sowan.\n\nOn the occasion of your next visit to Edmonton you might interview Dr. Meltzor with a view to ascertaining if there is any position at the Charles Camell Hospital to which this boy could be appointed.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nMr. Lapp, Indian Agent,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAm writing you today regarding the question of the children.\n\nWe can't seem to any arrangements with Fr. Tessier; so am making a direct appeal to you, and see if you can make some suitable arrangements for us. You can see any Father or person around here regards to us, if you wish. We are honest and decent people striving to make a home and living for our children.\n\nBoth my husband and myself are opposed to the children being put in the Mission. He seems to think it's the only way and insists on our putting the children in. First off, despite the material gain and understanding all advantages, we feel that the children's place is at home. We are not rich, 'tis true, but we've managed to keep the family together so far and our ambition is to build a good home and provide a good education for the children. The children attend school regularly, with the exception of days of illness. We are living right at the very doorstep of the Mission, and don't see any sense of being forced to put them in. If we were any distance away for the children's schooling we'd never hesitate putting them there; but this way I can't see any point in it.\n\nIf you wish you may come and see us. We live directly across from the Co-op in a big house. We'd be glad to see you.\n\nThanking you in advance.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Signed) Mrs. J.B. Giroux.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMr. J.B. Giroux, Treaty Indian #45, of the Swan River Band, makes his home on property not more than 300 yards from the Grouard Roman Catholic Indian Residential School. Mr. Giroux has three children of school age. According to Father Tessier, Principal, these children attended school for three years as day pupils and the school received no remuneration for tuition. Again this year Mr. Giroux wishes to have his children attend the Grouard School as day pupils but the principal is of the opinion that the school should receive payments for tuition.\n\nI visited the Giroux home yesterday. The house is a frame building with insul-brick on the exterior. The interior is clean and well furnished. The Girouxs take much interest in their children's welfare, and the family life seems to be wholesome. The mother is well educated, as is shown by the enclosed copy of her letter which was written by Mrs. Giroux herself.\n\nI recommend that the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, pay the Grouard R.C. Indian Residential School $1.50 per day for the tuition of the Giroux children; the above amount being from the scale of tuition payments which has been adopted by the provincial Department of Education. Father Tessier, principal of the school, has stated that such a payment would be satisfactory to him and I see no\nwhy it should not be accepted by the Treasury branch, as it would, I believe, save funds.\n\nI have made it clear to Mr. and Mrs. Giroux that my recommendation to the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, would depend upon home conditions. Should the tuition of the Giroux children be paid by the Department, an incentive would be furnished to the parents of the children, to improve their home.\n\nG.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent.\nOctober 28, 1948.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the education of the children of Mr. J.B. Giroux.\n\nAs the academic year is advancing, the Department approves the Giroux children attending the Grouard Residential School as day pupils on the understanding that the charge of $1.50 per day means for all three children.\n\nIn view of this permission being granted, will there be other similar applications?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nNOV 6 1948\n\nA.M.\n\nReceipt is acknowledged of your letter of October 26, file 42131-3 (E.1) in which you state that the Department approves the admission of the three Giroux children to the Grouard Indian Residential School as day pupils.\n\nThe understanding is that the charge will be $1.50 per day for all three children.\n\nShould other similar applications come to this office during the 1948-49 school year, those applications will be refused.\n\nG.S.

At a recent meeting of the Divisional School Board it was decided that claim should be made to your Department for tuition fees on behalf of these pupils. We have traced back their attendance for the last three years only. The names of the pupils and their attendance are as follows:\n\n| Name          | 1946-47 | 1947-48 | 1948-49 |\n|---------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Harry Lawrence| 149 dys.| 126\u00bd dys.| 96\u00bd dys.|\n| Robert Testawich| 152\u00bd dys.| 149 dys.| 137 dys.|\n| Irwin Knott   | nil     | 130 dys.| 122 dys.|\n| Dorothy Knott | nil     | nil     | 112 dys.|\n\nThis means that Harry Lawrence has attended the last two and one half years, Robert Testawich the last three years, Irwin Knott the last two years and Dorothy Knott the last year. The fees ordinarily payable for pupils in these grades would amount to $30.00 per year. Therefore our claim is for $225.00. Will you please advise if your Department is prepared to pay these fees.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-Treasurer\nDecember 29th, 1949.\n\nMr. G.S. Lapp,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a letter received from the Peace River School Division No. 10.\n\nIf the pupils mentioned are recognized Indians, we are prepared to pay the amount requested by the School Division. In that event, you should forward a Voucher for the amount they request.\n\nThe Secretary Treasurer of the School Division should be informed that in future they should receive approval from this Department for the admission of Indian children to their school if they wish the Department to pay the fees. Such application should be made to you and in turn you can write to us.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n\nPP/ST Enc.\nDecember 29th, 1949.\n\nMr. P.R.

Lapp, Indian Superintendent, High Prairie, Alberta, in order that he can prepare a Voucher and forward to us for payment, provided the children mentioned are recognized as Indians.\n\nIn future if Indian children apply for admission to your school, it would be appreciated if you would communicate with Superintendent Lapp in order that we can have their admission regularized.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6488)\n\nFile 42127-6, part 2\nPortage la Prairie Agency Schools -\nBuilding Maintenance-Accounts.\n1943 - 1949\n\nFile 42128-2, part 1\nThe Pas Agency Schools -\nSupplies-Accounts. 1914 - 1945\n\nFile 42128-3, part 1\nThe Pas Agency Schools -\nTuition Payments. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 42128-6, part 4\nThe Pas Agency Schools -\nBuilding Maintenance-Accounts.\n1945 - 1949\n\nFile 42129-2, part 1\nKenora Agency-Whitefish Bay Day School -\nSupplies-Accounts.\n1946 - 1947\n\nFile 42129-3, part 1\nKenora Agency Schools -\nTuition Payments. 1947 - 1949\n\nFile 42131-3, part 1\nLesser Slave Lake Agency Schools-\nTuition Payments. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 42136-2, part 3\nFisher River Agency Schools -\nSupplies-Accounts. 1946 - 1949\n\nFile 42136-6, part 1\nFisher River Agency Schools -\nBuilding Maintenance-Accounts.\n1945 - 1949\n\nFile 42151-2, part 4\nBabine Agency Schools -\nSupplies-Accounts. 1946 - 1949\n\nFile 42151-3, part 1\nBabine Agency Schools -\nTuition Payments. 1941 - 1949\n\nFile 42151-6, part 5\nBabine Agency Schools -\nBuilding Maintenance-Accounts. 1940 - 1949\n\nFile 42153-2, part 3\nNew Westminster Agency Schools -\nSupplies-Accounts. 1946 - 1949\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 42136-2 VOLUME 3\n\nSUBJECT SCHOOL MATTERS\nFISHER RIVER\nFULL AND LIGHT\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM March 1946\nTO MAY 1949\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n42136-2 VOLUME 4\n| Central Register | P.A.

This was to be for the Peguis Schools, Fisher River and Jackhead. However, since installing 2 booker heaters at Peguis, and taking over the Schools on the Gypsumville line, where there is a Booker Heater, we will require additional funds to take care of the Booker Coal that will have to be purchased.\n\nWe estimate these Booker Heaters burn about a ton a month, and on this basis, we expect to require about 20 tons. The average laid down price runs around $8.00 for coal and about the same for delivery. The delivery price is high, as some of these roads are almost impassable for trucks, and coal may have to be hauled in with team.\n\nIt is expected here that we will require an additional advance of about $300.00 to take care of this item.\n\nThe Booker Heaters installed at the Peguis Schools are working satisfactorily. It appears they work better in cold weather.\n\nC.C. Mr. Davis, Winnipeg.\n12th January, 1949.\n\nMr. S.

The $500.00 forwarded last April has now been expended and a Credit Voucher is going forward covering this advance.\n\nIn connection with the $900.00 Fuel advance, this is for the Schools on the Gypsumville Line, and we have forwarded to Mr. Favelle, Assistant Indian Agency there, $250.00 for local purchase from the Indians. We still have a balance of $650.00 to forward to him as soon as he has expended the $250.00 already forwarded.\n\nIn passing, we wish to point out that Mr. Favelle is having difficulty in purchasing this fuel for the schools there, as this is the fishing season and the Indians are out on the Lakes fishing. He hopes to have this wood hauled in at the close of the fishing season about the end of January.\n\nS Boyne\nA/Supt\n\nc.c.

It is also expected that #1 Peguis School will require more lump coal this season.\n\nAs our Fuel account is about exhausted, and we have not purchased our regular wood fuel allowances for the other Peguis and Fisher River Schools, it is estimated that we will require another advance of $300.00 to carry us through this season.\n\nWe would be pleased therefore, to have an accountable advance to cover the necessary purchases.\n\nR L Bewell\nSuperintendent\n\nOT/\n\nc c Mr Davis, WINNIPEG.\n22nd February, 1949.\n\nMr. R.L.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\n538 Dominion Public Building,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Davis,\n\nReference is made to fuel requirements at Peguis #1 School. This is the new school built last fall with a coal furnace.\n\nThis school started December 1946 and we have purchased to date, 10 tons drumheller. Mr. Boyne visited this school yesterday and advised that another 5 tons of coal would be required before the end of the week. This means that this furnace is burning nearly 5 tons a month.\n\nThis does not seem possible, and when the teacher Mr. Marsh was questioned, he advised that he was only firing in the usual way, and keeping the building moderately warm. The weather has been cold, but it appears excessive, that this furnace should burn so much coal.\n\nWe would be pleased if you would phone the Campbell Heating Company and ascertain from them the fuel requirements under ordinary use, for this furnace. It would appear that we will require a carload of coal for this furnace for one season.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor R L Bewell\nSuperintendent\n\nOT/\nc.c. Dept.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPT MINES & RESOURCES, OTTAWA.\n\nFuel - Schools\n\nIn order to have a reasonable supply of wood on hand for Peguis and Fisher River schools burning wood, we will require another $100.00 in the way of an accountable advance. However, this will not take care of coal that has to be purchased for Peguis #1, #2 and #3.\n\nThe #1 Peguis Furnace coal consumption to date is 15 tons and it may not last through, while we will have to purchase another 5 tons of Booker for #2 and #3.\n\nThis is the first year that we have purchased coal, and our estimates of coal requirements have not been good, however, we would be pleased to have authority to voucher for our coal requirements, which, in any event, should not run over $225.00.\n\nThe Peguis #1 Furnace and the 2 booker heaters have used up much more coal that we had anticipated, as the Bookers are burning about 2 tons a month.\n\nR.L. Bewell\nSuperintendent\n\nc.c Mr. Davis, WPG.\n19th March, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe understand that approximately five tons of coal a month is being used in the furnace at the Peguis No. 1 School. Have you had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Campbell Heating Company, as we are inclined to feel that adequate heat should be provided with considerable less consumption of coal.\n\nThe booker heaters at the Peguis No. 2 and No. 3 schools are stated to be burning approximately two tons a month. This amount also seems excessive. Please let me have your views on the matter.\n\nBernard F.

F. Neary.\n\nFurther to your letter under file 42136-2 (E.l) dated 19th March, 1949, I have discussed this matter with Mr. Sewell, the Superintendent at Fisher River, and also with the Campbell Heating Company - the Contractors who installed the furnace.\n\nMr. Campbell also feels that the coal being burnt is excessive and I have advised Mr. Sewell that Mr. Marsh, the teacher, who is responsible for the heating of this school, should be instructed in the method of banking fires and looking after the heating equipment in a proper manner.\n\nRegarding the booker heaters at Peguis Schools Nos. 2 and 3 - it may be that the fuel consumption of these will be up as the heaters are now burning continually - whereas previously, before their installation, the stoves were only heated in the morning. However, since the installation of the booker heaters the schools are much more comfortable for the children to sit in all day long.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nJR/ES\n8th April, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe have received your letter of the 29th ultimo with regard to the quantity of fuel being used at the Peguis Schools. In a letter dated January 4th Acting Superintendent Boyne stated that the booker heaters would burn approximately one ton of coal a month. You will, therefore, realize that we were surprised to learn that these stoves were burning two tons a month.\n\nI think it would be advisable if Mr. Campbell would visit the Peguis School, and ascertain if the furnace has been operating properly during the past heating season. We would also like to know if the booker heaters are being operated in the right manner.\n\nBernard F.

Receipt #1608 was duly signed by him and the cheque given to him. The Fuel Schools Account was debited $8.00 and the corresponding entry recorded in the Agency Cash Book.\n\nOn receipt of the cancelled cheques from the Winnipeg office of the Bank of Montreal the usual procedure of reconciling the cancelled cheques with the cheque stubs was carried out in order to determine the Outstanding Cheques issued by the Agency and not yet cashed. On comparing the stub which was marked $8.00 with the cheque, it was disclosed that the cheque had been raised from the original figure $8.00 to $18.00 and the \"eight\" to \"eighteen\". The cheque has been endorsed by Harry Fiddler and Skibinski a merchant in Hodgson - it had also been passed to the Coco-Coal Company, who it is anticipated presented the cheque to the Bank of Montreal in Winnipeg.\n\nThe matter was reported to the Hodgson Detachment of the R.C.M.P.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nApril 21, I received a cheque for $10.50, Cheque No. BL224 for Janitor Service at South Region Indian Day School. I received a same cheque for December and one for $2.50 in September.

Must pay the difference from my own teacher's salary. No pupil will do the work for any\nWe wish to acknowledge Mr B F Neary's letter 14-136 (WT 1) dated May 9th last, together with a letter received from Miss Kathleen Jeffrey, Teacher South Peguis School.\n\nWe note the contents of her letter, and advise that, we have been in the habit of paying Teachers $10.50 per quarter for Janitor services. For Fisher River School, we pay $24.00 per quarter.\n\nIt is of course, immaterial to us whether the teacher does the work or gets a pupil to do it. The rate, may be too low, but all schools at this Agency are paid at the above rate. However, we feel that $3.00 for oiling is high, while $6.00 per Month for sweeping, starting fires etc may be reasonable.\n\nIf Miss Jeffrey is to be paid extra, over and above the allowed rate, a revision of Janitor Services should be made to cover all the schools at this Agency.\n\nAs requested, Miss Jeffrey's letter is attached hereto.\n\nPGL/OT\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42136-6, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Apr 30 | to wages - labor - 30844 | 2.80 |\n| May 2 | \" - scrub - 30845 | 3.20 |\n| May 2 | \" - scrub - 30847 | 1.00 |\n| May 2 | P.O.

It is heated by two large furnaces which take a four foot stick of wood, and the work entailed is far too heavy for two women teachers, (Only one at present), as much of the wood used for the furnaces is tamarac and Spruce, many of the billets weighing anywhere from 50 to 100 pounds each. Last winter Mrs Scott actually became ill with having to do this work.\n\nI have located an Indian who lives near the school, who would undertake this work at the above mentioned wages. Please advise by return mail if possible, if this recommendation is approved.\n\nP.G. Lazerty,\nIndian Agent.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, October 16, 1947.\n\nMr. P. G.

Neary's letter of the 18th instant, File 14-136 (W.T.) regarding the above noted subject.\n\nIn view of the fact that a position carrying a salary of more than $300.00 per annum requires a Civil Service Establishment, would it not be possible to engage the services of a Caretaker for this school for the five months from November to March next, inclusive, at $60.00 per month?\n\nThis would cover the greater part of the winter, and would relieve the teachers of the most of the heavy work of firing the furnaces. Please advise.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 1st, 1947.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to engaging the services of a caretaker for the period November 1st, 1947 to March 31st, 1948 for the Fisher River School. We are prepared to allow the person you select for this position a salary of $30.00 a month for the period mentioned above.\n\nBernard F.

Neary's letter of the 1st instant, File 14-136 (WT 1), and in reply, to say that there is no one available who will undertake the work of caretaker at the Fisher River Indian Day School, at the rate of $30.00 per month as mentioned. There are only two men available, and neither of these will undertake the work for less than $60.00 per month. I may say that the work the man would be required to do would be worth at least that much. Please advise.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 1, 1947.\n\nMr. P.G. Lazenby, Indian Agent,\nHodgson, Manitoba.\n\nWe have your letter of the 24th ultimo with further reference to the amount requested for the caretaker at the Fisher River School.\n\nSince writing to you on October 18th, there has been a change in the regulations by which any position which carries an annual salary in excess of $400, requires a Civil Service establishment for the position and the usual advertising, etc., for someone to fill the position.\n\nIn view of this decision, we are now in a position to allow a maximum amount of $400 a year for the caretaking services at the Fisher River School.\n\nYou might request the cooperation of the teacher by arranging to have the children sweep and dust class rooms and relieve the janitor of a certain amount of work. We feel that all parties concerned should cooperate in this matter. If our suggestion is followed out in the above regard, the amount of $400 a year for the janitor appears to us to be ample.\n\nBernard F.

Lazenby, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Hodgson, Man.\n\nWe have your voucher No. 767 issued in favour of Mr. John Keeper, caretaker of the Murdoch School, during the month of July.\n\nIt is noted that you quote as authority for this expenditure official letter of January 13, 1948. If you refer to that letter you will realize that the authority given was intended for keeping the new building warm until a teacher had been appointed.\n\nAs the Murdoch school is now in operation, we feel that you should arrive at a satisfactory basis for the janitor services. Please let me know the amount that you suggest for this particular purpose and you might also state why you consider it necessary to submit a voucher for John Keeper for the month of July when the school was closed.\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nWe have for acknowledgement Mr. Neary's letter of the 11th instant file 14-136 (E 1) in connection with Voucher #767 in favour of John Keeper.\n\nMr. Keepar's services were retained for July to keep the grass down, look after the buildings and in general, keep track of hinges. Indians will break in and Mr. Keeper was held responsible for the Murdoch School.\n\nSince the school has been opened, he has been retained getting the teacher established and doing chores around the place. The school now has to be scrubbed and swept regularly, besides other work, and it is thought that possibly, a man and his wife should be engaged for this work. The rate for each would probably have to be $20.00 each per month.\n\nWe trust the above voucher 767 can be approved in favour of Mr. Keeper, and would appreciate the Department's views in connection with the employing of a man and a woman for carrying on the work.\n\nfor P & Lazenby\nSB, M\nP.

Bewell,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nHodgson, P.O., Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Bewell,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo. File 7. Wherein you advice of the reduction in wages for janitor's services at No.1 school Fairford.\n\nI am wondering if you are not confusing Lake St Martin school with No.1 school Fairford. The janitor or fireman at Lake St Martin school is paid at the rate of $1.00 per day, previously the rate of pay for janitor's services at Fairford No.1 school was fixed at $25.00 per month. However, after the rise in the cost of living, this amount was considered insufficient and the rate was increased to $30.00 per month.\n\nI feel that the cut in wages as well as the cut in services to the teacher would result in so much dissatisfaction both to Mrs. Olds and the janitor that the savings derived therefrom, would not be sufficient to compensate for the unfriendly feeling it would create.\n\nI would suggest, if I may, that the present arrangements be carried through until the end of the current school year and a new scale of wages worked out for the next term.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.F. Traveller,\nGypsumville, P.O., Manitoba.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH, DEPT MINES & RESOURCES, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Voucher No. 438\n\nWith reference your letter 42136-6 (E 1) of March 24th and to our reply of the 29th last, file 7, we have now a reply from our Assistant Indian Agency at Gypsumville, in connection with the janitor's rate of pay.\n\nWe attach hereto his letter, in which he advises no change, and that the rate is $30.00 per month. We are therefore, accordingly, vouchering for Letander for the month of March at this rate.\n\nSince this rate is favourable to the Department, we will advise our assistant at this point that, no change is being made.\n\nRLB/OT\n\nc.c.

Nield requesting authority to allow D.J. Olds $30.00 as caretaker of the above school. Mr. Nield describes Mr. Olds' duties as follows:\n\n\"His duties will be to clean and put on storm windows in the fall. Remove and put on screens in the spring. Scrub the classroom once a month and clean and empty toilets when necessary. Get in wood for furnace and keep classroom warm.\"\n\nThe rate suggested is higher than we have been allowing, and if we give favourable consideration to the Superintendent's recommendation in this particular instance, will it involve increasing the rates for janitor service at other schools in that Agency and possibly in other Agencies in Manitoba.\n\nPlease let me have your comments on the recommendation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n136/6-1-B32\n\nPay to: Miss M.

They have asked me if I can supply them with 3 tons of coal at a cost of $15 per ton.\n\nThere does not seem to be any clear definition of Departmental policy in this respect but I have been in the habit of permitting teachers to make use of school fuel in their residences in view of the hitherto inadequate salaries. In this case Mr. Woollam is receiving $1260 p.a., and Mr. Leighton $1000 and I would recommend that we might supplement this by offering these young men their coal and light. I have already given them some wood but this of course will not keep the fires in during their absence and I would suggest that a small supply of coal, not exceeding 3 tons be made available at their residence; also a supply of Gasoline or Coal Oil for lighting.

MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith original and copy of Day School Return received from W.H.R. Low, Esq., Secretary of the Walcott Day School at Telkwa, B.C., covering the attendance of six children of the Moricetown Band, for the quarter ending December 31st, 1945, and to advise that the Secretary verbally requested of me, the usual remuneration to the board for the tuition of these children.\n\nThe Dennis children, numbers 1, 2, 3 & 6 are those of Michell Dennis, who spends a great deal of his time with his son at Walcott where he is employed as a Section Man. They attended the Moricetown Indian Day School quite regularly when a teacher was available, but since that school is closed they have continued their education at Walcott, and it would appear to be no question of the Department's position in making the payment requested for them, which I recommend.\n\nThe children, numbers 4 & 5, are those of Tommy Joseph (Round Lake Tommy) who has not lived continuously on any Moricetown Reserve for ten or fifteen years, but has resided and operated a farm on Provincial lands near Telkwa, returning to the Reserve only for fishing during the Salmon run, in the late summer. The question arises as to the Department's responsibility for the education of the children of an Indian not residing on a Reserve, although presumably as he continues to be carried on our census, we have some obligation in the matter of the education of the children, and your views of the matter would be appreciated.\n\nIt will be noted that the children did not commence the fall term until October. The reason being that the trustees were unable to engage the services of a teacher until that month.\nIf the application receives favourable consideration, cheque should be mailed to W.H.R. Low, Esq., Secretary, Walcott School Board, Telkwa, B.C.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letter of January 17th and Day School Return covering the attendance of six children of the Morissetown Band at the Walcott Provincial School for the quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nIt is not known what the policy of the Department is with regard to the payment of tuition fees for Indian children who have not actually resided on an Indian Reserve but, in the case of the Michell Dennis children, I would recommend that the usual grant of $35.00 per annum based on attendance be approved.

I now enclose the school returns for the quarters ending September 30th, 1945, December 31st, 1945 and March 31st, 1946, the latter being for the period ending February 14th, and would ask if you would recommend payment for this girl as a pupil in Grade 6, in the junior room of the Hazelton Provincial School.\n\nAlthough the Hazelton Indian Day School opened on February 15th there has been such a large attendance every desk is occupied, in consequence of which Delores has continued at the Provincial School. Should you consider it expedient to allow payment to the end of the quarter, kindly send me back the March return for correction.

Under these circumstances tuition fees should not be charged against these pupils in keeping with Mr. Neary's letter dated May 23, 1947, in which it was stated -\n\n\"The Department have never assumed responsibility for education of Indian children in elementary grades when the parents reside in a municipality and are either house owners or tenants. We have always considered that in such cases they are entitled to the same consideration as any other resident of the Municipality.\"\n\nAlthough the reference is to \"elementary pupils\" only, it is assumed that the same principle applies to High School pupils. This will reduce the total per capita cost from $500 to $400 for the two Harris children.\n\nIt appears that the parents have made this arrangement in order to provide an education for their children, and I consider that their effort merits support. I recommend that approval be given to a per capita grant of $200 for Walter and Doreen Harris.\n\nTuition fees are assessable against Mary Johnson and I recommend that the request for a grant of $250 for this pupil be approved.\n\nR.F. Davey\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42151-3, part 1)\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver, B.

These are all former pupils of Alberni Residential School, who made good progress and are deserving of every encouragement we can offer them for higher education, the two former children are the children of Chris Harris, No. 15 of Kispiox who has borne the expense of Walter and Margaret at school in Prince Rupert up to the present time. He has now rented a house in Prince Rupert where his wife will stay and take care of these young people while attending High School and I would request a grant of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($250.00) for each of these children toward their expenses, the remainder will be borne by their parents. If granted I would recommend that these funds be administered through the office of the Indian Agent in Prince Rupert.\n\nJ. V.

It will be noted that the attached application is for the 1946-47 academic year. It will also be noted that this application is for an amount considerably in excess of the amount normally paid for tuition by the Department for Indian children attending white schools. However, it is felt that our Department should assume its share of the cost of educating children who attend these Provincial schools.\n\nIt will be noted from the application that the amount requested represents the actual cost to the local school board and that the Provincial grant has been deducted in reckoning the per capita cost to the local district. It is recommended that this application be approved.\n\nInformation has been received from Mr. Indian Agent Boys that this family have moved into the Town of Smithers, as of the beginning of January 1947 and Mr. Boys is being informed that since this family is now residing in the school district the Department will not assume responsibility for the cost of the education of these children.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, March 20, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 9th instant, file 1-11-1 (151), enclosing an account from School District No. 54, Smithers, for the education of two children of Michell Dennis during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nAs you are aware, we have had an arrangement with the Department of Education for British Columbia by which we have allowed payment at the rate of $35.00 a year, based on the average attendance for any Indian children who attend white schools. The method of payment requested by the School District No. 54, Smithers, is new and considerably higher than the rate we have previously allowed.\n\nWe feel that Inspector Davey should interview the officials of the Department of Education for British Columbia, with a view to determining if the previous rate of $35.00 a year holds good, or if it will be necessary for us to increase the amount allowed for Indian children attending white elementary schools in British Columbia.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMarch 25, 1948.\n\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour file 103-151-(E.1)\nRe: Tuition Fees for Indian Pupils Attending Provincial Schools\n\nI refer to Mr. Phelan's letter of March 20th concerning the above. I feel that it would not be desirable to have the matter of tuition fees reviewed with the Department of Education in Victoria.\n\nAt the beginning of the current academic year Inspector Davey called upon the Deputy Minister of the Department of Education for B.C. with regard to other matters and on this occasion the Minister of his own initiative brought up this matter and expressed the opinion that our Department should assume the full cost for the education of Indian children in Provincial schools. He was not aware apparently that the present rate of $35.00 a year for elementary pupils was an amount found satisfactory by the Trustees Association of B.C. in 1945. He maintained that since education of Indian children was the responsibility of the Dominion Government our Department should bear the total cost and that the present grant of $35.00 a year was most inadequate. In support of this he produced the Public School Reports for several years showing that the present cost of educating children in the Provincial schools was in excess of $100.00 per year.\n\nAt the present time the highest grant paid by the\nDepartment to any school board in B.C. for elementary education is $65.00 per pupil per year. This represents the total cost less the Provincial grant.\n\nIt is suggested that in those cases where a school board requests the payment of tuition fees amounting to the per capita cost the Department meet this request and that the School Board concerned be asked to submit with their account a break down of these costs.\n\nIt might be pointed out that the Provincial School Act requires that a School District shall not charge another School District for tuition fees in excess of the difference between the actual cost and the Provincial grants. This is a new section of the Act and has given rise to the form used in the case of the children of Mitchell Dennis.\n\nYour further comment on this matter will be appreciated.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApril 2, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 25th ultimo,\nfile O-11-1, in which you recommend that when a\nprovincial school board requests payment of tuition\nfees amounting to the per capita cost, that the\nDepartment pay it at that rate.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the\npractice mentioned will be followed in future.\n\nBernard F.

These youngsters discontinued their studies at Prince Rupert High School at Christmas time. They both made splendid progress and the Principal spoke in high praise of both pupils.\n\nTheir father was taken seriously ill late in the fall and his condition was such that it was impossible for the mother to maintain these children in Prince Rupert at school; there being no earning power for the support of the remaining children in the family. On checking the balance this month, it was discovered that a balance of $40.00 was due to the mother towards board for each child; this amount was paid to her and the accounts closed.\n\nBoth these youngsters are bright and it is hoped that conditions in the family may make it possible for them to continue their education next fall.

Jordan, O.M.I., through the office of Mr. F.E. Anfield, for a grant of \u00a3300 for board and tuition of the above-named who is in Grade 10 at the Seminary of Christ the King, New Westminster, B.C. He has been there throughout the current academic year. Bishop Jordan states that he has received reports of satisfactory progress and it is hoped that he will continue there until matriculation. This young man, son of Robert HARRIS and his second wife, Irene, is shown on our books as born April 30th, 1928, although his birth has never been registered. A check of our earlier records shows him as three years of age in 1930. If this evidence is correct, Kenneth is well beyond the usual age for Grade 10 but that should not prevent him from remaining a Student until he matriculates.\n\nWill you kindly give this application your favourable consideration.\n\nJ.W.

In view of this I recommend payment of this grant.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJune 18, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O.

V. Boys  \nSuperintendent Babine Agency  \nHazelton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Boys:\n\nYour letter to the burser of the Sim Seminary of Christ the King was sent to me.\n\nAs I recall I asked Mr. Anfield last year for a grant to cover one hundred dollars that I paid for Kenneth Harris in the scholastic year 1947/48 as well as for three hundred dollars for the current scholastic year. At the time he did not give me much hope that the one hundred dollar account would be paid and, if I must, I accede to the department's decision.\n\nNow the fees for 1948/49 have been increased to $350.00 and I would ask you if you would kindly re-submit the request for a grant for the entire amount. It would be strange if the Department, in view of the present high cost of living, considered $350.00 too much for board, room and tuition. Personally I find the fifty dollar increase over last year entirely justified.\n\nThank you very much for your interest in this matter.\n\nKind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) A. JORDAN, O.M.I.\n\nMost Rev. Anthony Jordan, O.M.I.  \nVicar Apostolic of Prince Rupert\n\nP.S. I'll be home on Nov. 17th.\nBABINE AGENCY\n\nHazelton, B.C.\n\n26th October 1948\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., P.O.Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nKindly refer to your File l-ll-l of 6th August regarding the tuition grant of Kenneth Bruce Harris of the Kitwanga Band.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I wrote to the bursar of the Seminary of Christ the King, he replied in due course that he had referred the matter to Bishop Jordan from whom I have now received a letter, copy of which is attached herewith. You will note that Bishop Jordan originally asked Mr. Anfield for a grant of $300.00 but when the application forms were forwarded to Mr. Anfield's office for completion they were returned requesting a grant of $400.00. His Excellency's letter explains the discrepancy.\n\nI would recommend that a grant of $350.00 be afforded for the current year.\n\nJ.V. BOE\nIndian Superintendent\n\nJVB:ibms\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Tuition Grant - Kenneth Harris\n\nYour file 103-151-(E)\n\nAttached is the completed application form for the above mentioned as requested in Mr. Phelan's letter dated June 18th, along with letters from Mr. Superintendent Boys and Bishop Jordan requesting an increase in the grant of $300.00 previously authorized to $350.00. It would appear from these letters that such an increase is justified and I would recommend that this be authorized.\n\nW.S.

A search of our files reveals the information shown on the attached list.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would supply the age on September 1, 1948, of Kenneth Harris and his grade. What grade is Perry Neil Brown following in his correspondence course, and what is his age?

The amount is $6.00 for each time the school is scrubbed, amount being $12.00. I should like to know if this cheque had been sent to me or if it was sent direct.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42151-6, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the Indian Agent:\nThis woman has been looking for her pay for some time. I charged her $20 on it. I wrote to the Indian Agent here in this office twice or so about it. So far I have received no reply concerning it.\n\nThanking you for a reply.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. A.C. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6488, file 42151-6, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's note attached to the enclosed letter\u2014which is being returned as requested\u2014I wish to advise that Mrs. Buddrus was informed at the time she commenced duties as teacher of the Moricetown Indian Day School that she would receive an allowance of $6.00 per school month for janitor services. Although scrubbing of the school floor was not specifically mentioned, it was presumed that Mrs. Buddrus would have accepted this as part of the janitor services as teachers have done in all other schools of this Agency. She received a cheque for $6.00 for September which should have been sufficient evidence of the monthly payment for this work. I have received one letter from Mrs. Buddrus, who has been advised in this matter when the subject was discussed some two weeks ago.\n\nDuring the time the last teacher was at Moricetown, the Indians took advantage of her generosity in this regard and I am certain she paid more to them than she herself received. I did not know that anything like $6.00 was paid for scrubbing a floor, which could be done in under 4 hours.\n\nS. Mallinson\nIndian Agent\n\nSM/GM\nencl.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent\n\nOttawa,\nApril 5, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo, requesting payment for scrubbing the Moricetown School.\n\nScrubbing the school is considered part of the janitor's duties and an amount of $6 a month is allowed for this service and has been paid to you. Our reason for giving it to the teacher is that in practice we find that such procedure gives the teacher more control over the janitor than if the amount were paid directly to the janitor. In view of the fact that scrubbing the school is considered part of the janitor's duties, there is no further payment due you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. A.C.

Janitor services includes putting on fires, sweeping, dusting, scrubbing, etc. Putting on fires, sweeping, and dusting takes 1/2 hours per day. For 200 school days labor would amount to 300 hours. This would be 37 1/2 days of 8 hours each. Then the school gets a general cleaning every two months. There is practically nothing left for the other work until the school is scrubbed.\n\nI would refer you to article #51, School closes for the Summer holidays in the Indian School Bulletin of June 1st, 1948. \"Please leave your school in a spotless clean condition.\"\n\nIn this bulletin I am advised to leave the school clean then from the same department I am advised that there is no money to be paid for this work.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6489, file 42153-6, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIf there was no scrubbing etc. to do the wages for the other work would amount to $1.60 per day for an eight-hour day but after allowing wages for scrubbing the wages drops almost to 80 cents per day. I tell you Mr. Philcox it is next to impossible to get any party to work for such low wages. I am informed that in many of the Indian Schools wages for janitor services is much higher and I should suggest to you that the wages here would be stepped up.\n\nI feel that it is beneath the dignity of a Department of the Dominion Government to quibble over the small amount involved. I shall expect my cheque by return of mail and also ask you to give consideration to make the stipend higher.\n\nYours Truly,\nFred C.

Has the Department a rate for such a set-up?\n\nMr. Bolan stated that at Massett they received $25.00 for the three rooms in one building.
