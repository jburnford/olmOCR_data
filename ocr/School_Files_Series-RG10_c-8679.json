Of these 34 are enrolled with the Muscowequan, and 11 with the Gordon Residential Schools. A number of the members of this reserve have stated that they want their children who have been attending residential school, admitted into the Day school as soon as it is opened. If their request is granted, it is anticipated that the Day school will be filled to capacity.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nIndian Superintendent.\nAugust 4, 1948.\n\nMr. S.H. Simpson, Superintendent, Indian Agency,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, we have ordered the desks for both the Nut Lake and Poorman Schools.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, very careful consideration should be given before withdrawing the children from the residential schools and placing them in the day schools.\n\nYou should carefully investigate home conditions to decide the number of children who actually require institutional care. You should also assure yourself that the children who are withdrawn from residential schools to attend day schools will attend regularly. It will not be of any advantage to all parties concerned if the children are just taken from the residential schools and the parents are not in a position or have not the inclination to make certain that they attend school every day except in the case of very severe illness.\n\nWhen you have reviewed the situation we would appreciate hearing from you.\n\nBernard F.

Rusnell, painter, Wadena, Sask. to paint the interior and exterior of the school building, 3 coats, also the outside toilets for the sum of $350.00 labour only.\n\nIt is considered that his offer is most reasonable and I would recommend that it be given favourable consideration.\n\nThe paint for this work is on hand at Nut Lake Reserve and I would ask that authority be given as soon as possible to have this work completed.\n\nSgd. S.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nRegina, August 27th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAn effort has been made to have the labour of painting the new school house at the Nut Lake Reserve, of the Touchwood Agency, performed by Indians, but without success.\n\nMr. S.H.

Russell, painter of Wadena, Saskatchewan, who agrees to perform all the labour of painting the interior and exterior of the building with three coats, also the outside toilets, for the sum of $350.00.\n\nAs this price is very reasonable, and the material is on hand for the purpose, I would recommend that Mr. Simpson be given authority to employ Mr. Russell at once for this work.\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan, in which it was advised that the children that will be attending this school be provided with a hot noon day meal during the winter and early spring months. An extra copy of that letter was sent to him which undoubtedly he will forward to Ottawa.\n\nAttached hereto is Form 37 listing the articles that will be required for this purpose, also Form 37a listing the type of cook stove suitable to be installed in the basement of the school where the children will have their mid day meal prepared and served to them.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing copy of a letter from Superintendent S. H. Simpson of the Touchwood Agency and two Requisitions; one for a 4 wheel trailer, $274.00, wagon box $80.00, bob sleigh $98.90, totaling $452.90; the other for labor and materials, $65.00, for the construction of a covered van with heater and seats. All necessary equipment in connection with the transportation of children to the Nut Lake Indian Day school.\n\nThe Indian homes on the Nut Lake reserve are widely scattered. The new school site is in that part of the reserve where the majority of the Indians will eventually live, because of its soil conditions, which make that part of the reserve more suitable for agriculture in the future. Farming has only commenced in earnest in the last two years and it will be some time before the majority of the Indians are located on the part of the reserve adjacent to the school. In the meantime it will be necessary to provide transportation as recommended by Mr. Simpson in order to promote regular attendance.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Simpson be given authority to purchase the necessary transportation equipment locally, in accordance with the requisitions enclosed, and that the Department agree to the rate of .25\u00a2 per day, per pupil, delivered at the school and returned to the pupils' homes in the evening.\n\nI am writing Mr. Simpson regarding the matter of midday meal, and am enclosing a copy of this letter herewith.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nThere are 78 children of school age on the Butte Lake Reserve, 14 of these live within a radius of 3 miles and 50 live from 2\u00bd to 7 miles distant. The parents of 14 have no homes on the reserve and reside elsewhere. Of the 78 children 6 attend Residential school. It is considered that 7 of these should continue to attend there as their home conditions are not such as to assure proper care and attendance to the day school.\n\nIn order to have as many children as possible attend school it is considered necessary to provide transportation to and from school for them as in many cases their homes are too far distant for the children to walk. Vehicles will have to be provided for this purpose and a driver.\n\nI recommend that an Indian be employed to do the driving and provide his own team of horses. It is suggested that he be paid at the rate of $25 per day per pupil delivered to and from the school rather than being paid a daily or monthly wage. It is felt that this method of payment would assure a better attendance at the school and prove more economical.\n\nIt is estimated that there will be about 25 children that can be counted on to attend the day school this winter.\n\nAttached hereto is Form 37 listing rubber tired trailer, bobleigh and wagon box. Also Form 37 for materials to cover the wagon box and provide a heater and seats therein. This will be able to be used during summer or winter as it can be used on wheels or sleighs.\n\nIt is also considered necessary that the children be provided with a hot noon-day meal during the winter and early spring months.\n\nAuthority is requested to procure the materials and labour to cover the wagon at a total cost of $65.00, locally.\n\nS.H.

Oatrander Esq Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina\n\nRe: my letter 216-G4A, Aug 24/48\nOttawa telegram to you, Aug 30/48\nPainting Nut Lake Indian Day School.\n\nOn October 14th, I received a letter from Mr. G.W. Rusnell, who had been awarded the contract to paint this school, advising that he was unable to complete his contract as his hired help had left him and he was unable to procure anyone else. He has done the following work.\n\nRoofs of school and toilets completed, the west, north and east walls of school, two coats. Three coats have been applied on inside windows of basement. One coat on all windows inside class room. One coat on outside walls and windows of toilets. Two coats on kitchen walls and ceiling. One coat on basement hallway. Three coats on walls and ceiling of classroom.\n\nI am now in receipt of a tender from Messrs F.H. and Ben Olson of Kuroki, Sask. to complete the exterior painting of school and toilets for the sum of $100.00. Also to complete the interior painting of school building, including one coat on class room, which is considered that the three coats applied has not made a good finish. Also to paint all window frames, storm sashes and screens for the sum of $300.00, total $400.00.\n\nI am also in receipt of a tender from Mr. S.O. Larson, Rose Valley, to do the exterior work already mentioned, for the sum of $100.00 and to do the interior painting, just mentioned, for the sum of $270.00, total $370.00.\n\nMr Gordon W Rusnell and his helper Mr. Welfin each did 7\u00bd days work using spray and brush. His painting equipment had to be moved to and from the reserve to Wadena, a distance of 35 miles. The total cost of board was $27.00 and Mr. Rusnell estimates that the cost of moving the equipment was $53.00. He considers the work done is worth $150.00. In view of the amount tendered to complete the work as already referred to and a previous tender to do this work by Luthi Bros. of Punnichy amounting to $700.00 submitted to the Department by Agency letter of May 10/48. It appears that Mr.\nRusnell's value of the work done is reasonable.\n\nIt is considered too late in the year to do any exterior painting, I recommend that Mr. S.O.

Rusnell to paint the new day school at the Nut Lake Reserve, at a price of $350.00, I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Superintendent S.H. Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, in connection with this contract, recommending that Mr. Rusnell be paid the sum of $150.00 for the work which he has performed on the school, and that Mr. S.O. Larson be given the contract for completing the interior painting of the school for the sum of $270.00.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. Simpson on a recent visit to the Nut Lake School, when I found that the work set out in Mr. Simpson's letter had been completed, and that Mr. Rusnell had ceased work and refused to continue after having found that he had quoted a price so low that he could not complete the work without still further loss.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Simpson's plan be followed and that Mr. Larson's offer be accepted, namely to complete the interior work at a total cost of $270.00, and $100.00 to complete the exterior work next spring. By paying Mr. Rusnell $150.00 and Mr. Larson $370.00, the total cost of the exterior and interior painting for the building will amount to $520.00 which, I believe, is a fair price for the whole job, and is $180.00 less than the quotation for the whole job submitted by Luthi Brothers, of Punnichy.\n\nJ.P.B.

Simpson listing articles required in the preparation of the noon day meal for the children. I am informed that all the articles have been received with the exception of the cook stove. In your letter of September 7, 1948, file 121-3-5 (E) acknowledging receipt of the requisition you suggested that the combination Quebec heater-range was being provided for other schools and would prove satisfactory. Apparently this latter stove has not been requisitioned for to date so I am enclosing herewith the required form 37.\n\nOn September 4th, 1948 a letter was forwarded to your office requesting authority to purchase food supplies locally for a hot mid-day meal, the total amount not to exceed $75.00 during the academic year. So far we have not received this authority. Would you please have this forwarded as soon as possible as we plan on opening the school on March 1st.\n\nApparently janitor supplies have not been requisitioned for. May I suggest that you authorize local purchase of the janitor supplies as you did for the Meadow Lake school where I was in charge during December. This proved satisfactory there. Please forward a list of the articles needed for the janitor work. I would suggest that a galvanized tank (45 gallons) be included as no provision has been made for water storage.\n\nJ.T.

We only allow materials for a hot drink or soup, which is intended to supplement whatever food the children bring for lunch. In view of the payment of family allowance it is felt that practically all Indian families should be in a position to supply a lunch for the children at noon. I might add that we only supply materials for lunch during the cold weather, namely from 1st October to 31st March of the following year.\n\nIt is noted that you expect to open this school on 1st March, 1949, and consequently, the amount of $7.50 is authorized for that month for the purchase of midday lunch supplies.\n\nYou may purchase locally the supplies for the janitor.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

He has recommended the installation of a 3,000 Watt 110 Volt A.C. lighting plant, the wiring of the school and school residence and the construction of a small building to house the lighting plant. The estimated cost of the larger plant, the wiring of the school and the construction of a small building is around $1,600.\n\nWill you please let me know whether you are prepared to provide from the Indian Education Vote, the additional funds needed over and above the $1,000.00 which this division has especially provided.

During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the school on the Poorman Reserve in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us:\n\n(a) The names of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post offices and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1928-49. These other means\n\n...... involve\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter 121-6-5 (E) dated January 30th, 1948 regarding the building of a Day School and Teacherage at Poorman Reserve.\n\n(a) The newspapers in which an Ad could be displayed are the Touchwood Times, Punnichy Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, Saskatoon.\n\n(b) Post offices where drawings, specifications should be displayed are the post office in Saskatoon, Superintendent's office, Regina and Indian Office, Punnichy.\n\nA small electric plant will have to be installed as we are not near the power line. The closest we are to one being in the neighbourhood of six miles.\n\nWater is very hard to get on this reserve. I have dug wells with the boring machine which have not been satisfactory, and would recommend that a drilling machine be put to work and locate water before we start to build the school.\n\nThe location could be as near as possible to the Farming Instructor's house, so that the well could serve the school and the Farming Instructor.\n\nR.S.

W.\n\nCol. Neary,- Have just checked up our inventory and find that the source of water is a \"dugout\" 600 ft. from the house.\nCROSS REFERENCE SHEET\n\n121-6-5\n\nEXTRACT FROM, OR PRECIS OF, COMMUNICATION DATED\n\nWRITTEN BY\n\nColonel Neary.\n\nTO\n\nREGARDING Poorman's Indian Day School:\n\n685 bags of cement for the construction of this school were ordered on file 121-8-5 (Nut Lake School).\n\nTherefore, it will not be necessary to order any cement at all at all for the foundation of this proposed new school.\n\nREFER TO FYLE:\n\nSUBJECT\nOttawa, February 28, 1948.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nPoorman Indian Day School.\n\nReference your C-11 (121) of February 7.\n\nWe have recently had an opportunity of discussing the situation with regard to the above school with Mr. Ostrander. It has been suggested by him that Mr. Holterman might also be interested in constructing this school on a similar basis as the Nut Lake School. It is understood that Mr. Ostrander will discuss this proposal with you when he returns to Saskatchewan.\n\nWe could then arrange to forward such materials as are required as per the standard bill of materials forwarded you for the Nut Lake School. In fact, I could forward two copies of the bill of materials and you could delete the items not required or which can be provided for by your own sawmill and then forward the amended bill of materials here attached to a standard requisition form. This standard requisition form should read as follows:\n\n\"Materials required for the construction of a one room day school as per attached standard bill of materials\".\n\nTherefore, it would seem that the big problem in erecting this school will be the location of a proper site with an adequate supply of water. It is understood that the Farming Instructor's water supply is from a \"dug-out\" some 600 feet from his house. We would appreciate hearing from you with regard to a source of water for both the school and Farming Instructor's house. Is it possible to obtain tenders for using a drilling machine such as recommended in your letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter No. 121-6-5 (E) dated February 28, 1948, I would be glad if you would mail me two copies of bill of material for the proposed Day School at the Poorman Reserve, and I will delete the items not required which can be supplied from our mill at Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nMr. Holterman and his son, of Quinton, are prepared to take on the construction of this school on a similar basis as that for the Nut Lake School.\n\nRegarding the water situation, the only supply of water where the Farm house is located, is a small well which only gives enough water to supply the one house. This is surface water and would not be satisfactory.

If additional sets of blue prints and specifications are required, we will gladly furnish these for use by the company.\n\nI also understand from Mr. Ostrander that John Holterman and Sons might be interested in the construction on a similar basis the Poorman's Indian Day School. If this is the case, it is presumed that we will be hearing from you concerning the materials needed for this building. I am enclosing a copy of our bill of materials for your reference in the instance of the Poorman's School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure:\n\nIndian Affairs.

This includes all labor, including chimney, with the exception of painting.\n\nThis includes excavation, putting in forms and all cement work complete.\n\nOur tender price is $4800.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn Holterman & Son,\nper Henry Holterman\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Department letter #121-6-5 (E) dated February 28, 1948, I enclose herewith tender from Holterman and Sons, of Quinton, Sask., on the Day School for Poorman Reserve.\n\nI would be glad if you would send me another copy of the bill of materials and the blue prints as I need these in getting prices from different firms, such as windows etc.\n\nThe price quoted by Holterman & Sons includes the basement and is line with what the price should be.\n\nR.S.

This has now been forwarded to the Minister's office.\n\nUnder separate cover we are forwarding the bill of materials and blueprints as required.\n\nIn submitting requisitions for materials, it might be advisable to indicate a delivery date for the items so that there will not be too great a storage problem while waiting for the contractor to complete the Nut Lake School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nc/o to Mr. Ostrander.\nBFN/MGD\nOttawa, April 19, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nPoorman Indian Day School.\n\nThe above Indian day school is one which is included in our 1948-49 building programme. It is our intention to purchase all the necessary materials through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. It is understood that some of the lumber will probably come from a saw mill operated by the Indians of the nearby Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Davis has obtained a written tender for all labour on the building with the exception of the painting. This tender includes excavation, putting in forms and all cement work complete. It is in the amount of $4,800.00 and is attached hereto.\n\nThis firm is the same company whose tender for the nearby Nut Lake day school was accepted on April 1st, 1948. At that time we were advised that they were a very reputable firm and that they would carry out the work in a satisfactory manner. It was therefore, suggested that the same company be approached with regard to the Poorman day school. As a result, we have now received the attached tender.\n\nYou will note that this tender is for $4,800.,\nwhereas the Nut Lake tender was for only $4,000. This is due to the fact that the excavation, forms, etc., had already been completed at Nut Lake, whereas this has not been done at Poorman.\n\nYou will recall that labour costs on these standard one room schools with attached teacher's residence have varied between $5,300 and $6,300 when the work was done on a cost plus basis. Therefore, this tender of John Holterman & Son would seem to be fair and reasonable and is recommended for acceptance by the Minister.\n\nDirector.\n\nBFN/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Requisitions for supplies of sash window frames doors, etc required for the Poorman Indian Day School.\n\nI have taken the prices etc from the requisition for these items used in the Day School for the Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nI will be getting prices in within a few days on the balance of the material.\n\nR.S.

In case the Contractor shall fail so to do, or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule thereto by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding overtime and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the Contractor, and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereunder.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, and addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to and times when paid to such workmen, and the books or documents containing such record shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wages Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the total wages and hours of labour and the value of the workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrears; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted.

Osirander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.,\ndated June 9, 1948.\n\nOriginal on File 107-7-5\n\n(Chitek Lake Indian Day School)\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, File No. 107-7-5, in connection with the above, I have delayed answering because it was my intention to endeavour to have Holterman Brothers erect the Chitek Lake Day School if we had not been successful in locating a water supply for the Poorman's Day School. However, Mr. J. T. Warden, Field Assistant, Regina Office, visited the Poorman's Reserve this week and located a satisfactory well at a central point on the reserve at a depth of 8 ft. Consequently it is proposed to have Holterman Brothers proceed with the Poorman's Day School as soon as they have completed the Nut Lake Day School.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe Departmental letter #121-6-5 (El) May 21, 1948\nDrilling well at site of Poorman Reserve School\n\nOn enquiry from a local resident living adjacent to the reserve, and who appears to be very familiar with the water problem in the whole of this area, it was found that in the odd case that an adequate supply of good water could be found at the depth of up to 14 feet. Several unsuccessful attempts had been made to drill deep wells some of which were well over 200 feet deep. The most satisfactory method employed in this area for water supply is the dugout and filter well combination.\n\nA school site has been located with ideal surroundings for building, play grounds, and fair soil for a garden, all of which is naturally drained. The prospect for water appeared promising enough to have a shallow well dug on the north side of a small knoll. It is 3\u00bd feet square, and 8 feet deep and has a depth of 2\u00bd feet of clear water therein which to the taste appears to be good. It was not possible to deepen the well owing to the flow of water there into. Bailing tests showed that a supply of from 100 to 120 gallons per hour is now available. This supply flows through a wall of sharp sand. It is proposed to have a sand point driven below the frost level to assure a winter supply of water. If this source of supply proves inadequate a dug out and filter well can be installed near this site.\n\nThe site is fairly central and is located within a radius of 3 miles from the best agricultural land on the reserve. It is within the same radius of the majority of Indian family homes, the remainder of the homes with children of school age are within 3\u00bd miles thereof.\n\nThis whole matter was gone into by Mr. J.T. Warden of our Regina office with me and it is felt that the question of an adequate water supply is assured from the new well, or in the event of its failure from the dugout with filter well.\n\nIt is recommended that the construction work of this school be proceeded with as soon as possible.\n\nAuthority is requested to pay Indian labour the sum of $16 for digging the well which has been cribbed and closed in by materials which were on hand. Authority is also requested to purchase a suitable pump and sand point from the first available source.\n\nSimpson Indian Agent\nS.H.S\nJune 16, 1948.\n\nMr. S.H. Simpson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th instant\nwith reference to the site of the Poorman Indian Day\nSchool.\n\nIt is noted that you have now been able\nto secure an adequate supply of water and we approve\nan expenditure of $16.00 for labour for digging the\nwell.\n\nAll the requests that we have received\nfor materials for the new school have been forwarded\nto the Purchasing Branch and in most cases purchase\norders have been issued and copies forwarded to you.\n\nIf the materials do not reach you shortly\nit will be quite in order for you to communicate\nwith the firms to whom purchase orders have been issued\nand request them to rush delivery.\n\nWe have already forwarded to Messrs.

Simpson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nPUNNICHY, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Simpson:\n\nIt has been drawn to my attention by our Mr. Gunn and Mr. Lamb that the tender for Poormans School called for a kitchen dresser for which we quoted $50.00 as we figured that this was a small kitchen wash stand. Since that time our two representatives have found that this is intended as a built-in cupboard and they have estimated the cost of same at $185.00.\n\nWe are responsible to you for a wash stand or a dresser to the value of $50.00. We are willing to supply what we now understand is the requirements of the Government for the sum of $185.00. Before doing so, however, we would ask you to confirm this latter tender of $185.00.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRELIANCE LUMBER CO.

Ltd. Saskatoon, pertaining to their tender, covered by Purchase Order No. 31904, dated July 6th, 1948 in which is included an item of $50.00 for a kitchen dresser.\n\nThe type of dresser the company tendered on will not meet our requirements. A built-in cupboard similar to that installed in the new day school at the Nut Lake Reserve is needed. The cost thereof was $185.00.\n\nI recommend that the Reliance Lumber Co. Ltd. tender of $185.00 be given favorable consideration.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent Indian Agency.\nSeptember 29, 1948.\n\nMr. S.H.

(RG 10, Volume 6299, file 635-5, part 1)\nJ.P.B. Ostrander Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina.\n\nRe: New Day School, Poorman Reserve.\n\nWith reference to our discussion pertaining to kitchen cupboard space being allowed in the construction of this school I have to report as follows:\n\nOn September 22nd, I advised the Department that the type of dresser which the Reliance Lumber Company intended to supply would not meet our requirements, and recommended that a built-in cupboard similar to that installed in the new school at Nut Lake be provided at a cost of $185.00.\n\nOn September 29th, under file #121-6-5(31) the Department replied in part as follows:\n\n\"We feel that $50.00 should be enough to expend for this purpose and are not prepared to authorize any additional amount.\"\n\nThe tender from the Reliance Lumber Company called for a kitchen dresser. A copy of their letter dated September 20th explained this, also that they figured that this was a small kitchen wash stand.\n\nA small kitchen wash stand will only provide a stand for a hand wash basin, with a refuse pail thereunder enclosed in a cupboard. Therefore no provision has been made for space to store cutlery, dishes, pots, pans and food supplies. Due to the small kitchen space it is considered that built-in cupboards similar to those installed in the Nut Lake School at a cost of $185.00 will meet the requirements.\n\nFurther consideration of this matter would be appreciated.\n\nS.H. Simpson,\nSuperintendent.\nRegina, October 20th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received from Superintendent S.H. Simpson, of the Touchwood Agency, in connection with the new day school being constructed on the Poorman's Reserve.\n\nThe matter referred to in Mr. Simpson's letter was discussed with the writer last week, and there is no doubt that it is a mistake to not supply the teacherage of this day school with a cupboard such as has been installed in the similar teacherage which is part of the new school building at the Nut Lake Reserve.\n\nI consider the cupboard arrangement at the Nut Lake building is very appropriate and convenient. This arrangement is very necessary in view of the fact that the kitchen is quite small, and there is no place where pots, pans, dishes, etc. can be stored.\n\nTo supply a school kitchen wash stand such as that on which the Reliance Lumber Company seems to have tendered, will provide entirely inadequate space for cooking utensils and dishes. It is my opinion that unless a cupboard is supplied, such as the one in the building on the Nut Lake Reserve, the kitchen will always be unsanitary, and certainly not a good example to the Indians who are much too prone to carelessness, hanging kitchen utensils all over the kitchen walls or piling them in a corner of the room.\n\nI would strongly recommend that Mr. Simpson be given authority to install cupboards similar to those in the Nut Lake School, at a cost of $185.00, instead of the poor installation which will result from the expenditure of $60.00 which has been authorized by Department letter of September 9th, 1948, File 121-8-5 (E.1).\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nNovember 1, 1948.\n\nMr. J.P.E. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th ultimo regarding the kitchen dresser included on purchase order 31904.\n\nOn reviewing our file, we do not understand why this item was included on the original purchase order. Please have the firm cancel it.\n\nThe plans for the Poorman School provide for built-in cupboard space in the kitchen and the materials have been supplied for that purpose and these cupboards will, no doubt, be installed by the firm erecting the building.\n\nBernard F.

The sum of $425.00 has been held back on the contract to complete the job. The work could have been done this month on this building had the lumber been dry but we think it advisable to wait until April.\n\nThe toilets only need the siding put on to complete them and $100 has been held back for this work.\n\nThe Muscowequan ration house is completed all but the chimney and $50.00 is still owing to the contractors on this building.\n\nHolterman's are ready to go ahead and complete these jobs early next month, and I would therefore request that the balance of the appropriations for these buildings - $575.00 - be carried over to the next fiscal year.\n\nSgd.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nThe material requested in the attached requisition is considerably more than that included in the 1949-50 estimates ($320.00) for a water supply for Poormans Day School. However it is expected that there will be 40 pupils attending the school, and a great deal of water will be required each day. Further I would like to say that the only water supply to this school at the present time is an outside well, which we have every reason to believe is only a sand pocket, and would go dry if used extensively, but which would perhaps supply drinking water to the school for years if used for no other purposes.\n\nI therefore recommend that the requisition be approved and authorization given to make the purchases as soon as possible.\n\nA.R.

The total cost of the material being $314.60 plus freight $12.00, and the quotation is given by Mr. J.J. Lang of Quinton, Saskatchewan. It will be noted that the estimated labour thereon given by J. Holterman and Son is $289.85 or a total of $616.45.\n\nThe item shown on the Estimates to cover this is only $320.00 and was given by Mr. S.H.

Apparently he figured on material only and did not calculate the cost of installation.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given for the expenditure, and that Mr. Nixon be authorized to purchase the material as outlined in the requisition from J.J. Lang of Quinton, Saskatchewan also to employ J.

General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nyou that the Indians in question were rebels, and have therefore not been paid since 1884; but in that year, fourteen boys and eighteen girls were paid for, although these numbers, in all probability, include considerably more than children of school-age.\n\nMr. ex-Agent Rae has been referred to, for his opinion, and gives it to be, that more than eight or ten Indian children could not be induced to attend.\n\nIn this case, he thinks that much extra expense, in feeding the Indians, would be incurred; since were their habits as hunters to be interrupted, they would require to be supported by the Department almost entirely; but with this, I do not quite agree.\n\nWith regard to their building the walls of a school-house, it is thought that they might probably be induced to do so, as in other cases.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES\n\nRegina, September 18th, 1889.\n\nMy Lord,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., and to inform you with regard to the school at Prairie Lake, that since such matters as the establishment of new schools are now dealt with by the Superintendent, I have referred the matter to him, and will inform you of the result when ascertained.\n\nI have moreover brought before him the other matters which your Lordship has touched upon.\n\nMeanwhile I may be permitted to remark, that your letter came just too late, and only in time to have received, by authority having been given you from Ottawa, to build a mission on the Reserve at Little Lake.\n\nThis Lordship,\n\nThe Bishop of St. Albert.\nIn conclusion, I cannot refrain from an expression of regret that your Lordship should deem it necessary to make the insinuations contained in your remarks, that if the Indians were to burn the missions, it would be easy to trace the instigators of such action.\n\nSuch insinuations, I think, can only be based upon suspicion, and if such determination were to be justified by the suspicions which are, unhappily, entertained regarding it, by some other, undoubtedly great injustice could frequently result.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nMy Lord,\nyour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd) Stephen Reid.\n\nComm.\nGreen Lake, September 2, 1889.\n\nH. Reed Edye,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have just made a trip to Isle \u00e0 la Croix, and in passing here, I at last decided to yield to the desire of Chief Francis Little Bear, of Prairie Lake, who for three years back, has been urging me to let him have a school and mission.\n\nI have given a contract for the construction of a school, and have engaged as teacher Mr. Paul Greffaud, whom I know personally as being very capable of teaching, as well in French as in English.\n\nHe is married, and his wife, a young half-breed, is herself sufficiently educated to teach.\n\nIt being impossible to have the schoolhouse finished before the month of June, it will be necessary to keep school during the whole winter in a private house. There is no equipment; I hope...\nhope that you will be kind enough to procure the necessaries for this purpose.\n\nAlthough the Indians may not be very numerous at Prairie Lake, there are more than twenty children of school age. Paul Grand has been engaged at a salary of $300 per annum, and I have assured him that the Government would pay him faithfully.\n\nI find here letters from Battleford, and learn with equal sorrow and surprise that they continue to refuse to recognize the Catholic school entrusted to Father Vachon, on Thunder Child's Reserve.\n\nI am all the more surprised at the difficulties which they make, since on the reserves of Prairie Assiniboine and Onion Lake, where the great majority of the Indians are Catholic, the Government renders no less assistance to the Protestant schools, which I consider very right, provided they do not compel the Catholic Indians to attend them. Why, I ask you, have two weights and measures? They assured me at Ottawa that there would be nothing of the sort; and I am quite determined to maintain...\nmaintain my right, and the right of the Indians.\n\nWith regard to Saddle Lake, I regret that the missionary, yielding to the advice of the Agent, asked leave to build from you.\n\nThis permission I have in writing from the Right Hon. the Premier. I do not see why one should wish to compel it to be sought from one whose authority is subordinate. There are at least a hundred Catholic Indians who call for a permanent mission at Saddle Lake, and they would be denied it, because the chiefs, who for the most part live at Whitefish Lake, are opposed to it.\n\nI can assure you that had I not been obliged to be away the whole summer, the house would have been built today. The wood is purchased, lying on the banks of the Saskatchewan, exposed to the danger of being burnt, because you did not consider it right to grant the permission which they had the want of tact to apply to you for. I do not wish, Sir, in the least to fail in respect to you, but I maintain that the Indians have the\nthe right, according to all their treaties, to exercise the religion of their choice, even if they be in the minority.\n\nSince they have this right, it is necessary that they be in a position to exercise it; and they cannot, unless they have a mission at their door. The Government at Ottawa has recognized this right; and it has acknowledged to me the right to give them missions and priests, and every agent of the Government cannot do less than recognize and protect it.\n\nWere the season less advanced, and the wood on the spot, the building would soon be done, I assure you. I will probably be forced to defer the matter until spring, but it won't be more distant.\n\nThey tell me that the Indians can rebel. I know the Indians of Saddle Lake, and the neighbourhood. I know that they are excited and urged on. I know too that if they burn the new mission, as they are supposed to have burned the old mission of St. Paul, the Crees, that will not emanate from themselves; they will be obeying the orders, or at least the recommendations, of which the source could be easily found.\n\nAlthough\nAlthough using to you this frank\nand determined language, I say you none\nthe less to believe me.\n\nYour entirely devoted,\n\n(Sgd) Vital, O.M.I.\nBishop of St. Albert.\n\nTranslated by J.J. Campbell.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith for the information of the Department a translation of a letter received from the Bishop of St. Albert, and a copy of my reply to his Lordship.\n\nI will take the opportunity of referring the subject matter of the letter, as I have promised the Bishop to do, to the Sup't General, if so expected, he stops here on his return to Ottawa.\n\nHave the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the 26th November following I was complaining to the late Honorable Mr. Meighen, as I had already done to Hon. Mr. Dewdney and yourself the 24th October preceding of the action of the Department in imposing Protestant schools on our Catholic Indians. This gentleman having made the remark that the Department could not be expected to look out for Catholic teachers, I replied to him what I had said to you yourself, and could repeat today that despite the formal promise of the Honorable Premier reiterated by Hon. Mr. Meighen, the Department, whenever we wished to establish schools ourselves, raised so many obstacles, that I felt much disgusted, and have added; I have engaged as teacher for a Catholic school at Meadow Lake Reserve, over Paul Greyau, but hold him in wait.\n\n\"for\norders from the Department, for fear\nof any difficulty in the payment\nof his salary. Now Mr. White took\nin my presence all necessary steps\nfor the name of Paul Greyman, being\nparticular to have the proper spelling\nof the name, and assured me\nthat he would, under his authority,\nact as teacher, as also school books\nand school stationery. Whether he\ndid anything in the matter, I do\nnot know, but his order must be\nof record. Later, however, I learned\nthat Greyman was acting as a traders'\nclerk at Green Lake, and concluded\nthat having found a more lucrative\noccupation, he had given up his position\nas teacher; but I have since learned\nthat he had never received any\ncommunication from the Department\non the subject. This time, he refused\nto be engaged conditionally, and I\ncannot blame him. If the Depart-\nment therefore does not pay him,\nhis salary will have to be paid\nby myself.\n\nThe teacher above named\nis the same person referred to in\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would appear very\nfavorably authenticated by him.\nShould the latter fact prove to be\ncorrect, there may no longer be any\nobjection to a conclusion of the case\nsatisfactory to His Lordship.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarterhead\nCommissioner\nTo the Indian Commr.\n\nFor the North West Territories.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the application of Bishop Grandin for the establishment of a school at Meadow Lake, otherwise known as Prairie Lake, within the territory covered by Treaty No. 6. In reply I have to inform you, with reference to the allegation of His Lordship, that the late Hon. Mr. White had assured him that he would send Mr. Paul Grizeau, the teacher recommended by His Lordship, authority to act as such, as well as school books and stationery, in regard to which His Lordship states that he does not know whether Mr. White did anything in the matter, but that the notes taken by him on the occasion of His Lordship's interview with him, must be of record. I beg to inform you that no record of any promise having been given Bishop Grandin in this matter can be found, but in connection therewith I beg to refer you to the letter addressed to the Indian Commr. for the N.W.T. on the 12th of November, 1887, and to the letter\nletter in reply from the Commr. dated the 24th of\nthe same month. On referring to the latter letter\na note appears thereon dated the 20th Dec. 1887,\nto the following effect, \"Supt. General says to\ndefer the consideration of this for the present.\"\nI have also, in this connection, to refer you to\nyour letter of the 19th ultimo, and to remark with\nreference to the statement made by His Lordship,\nwhose letter is enclosed in yours of the 12th in-\nstant, that on the late occasion the aforesaid Paul\nGrezeau refused to be engaged conditionally, and\nHis Lordship adds, \"if the Dept. therefore does not\npay him his salary will have to be paid by myself.\"\nI have to remark that there is a difficulty in de-\ntermining whether His Lordship refers, in the\nabove remark made by him to his previous engagement\nof Mr. Grezeau, or the more recent proposed re-en-\ngagement of him. There would likewise seem to be\na complication arising from the fact that His Lord-\nship states in his letter last referred to, that Mr.\nGrezeau refused to be engaged conditionally by him,\nwhereas, in His Lordship's letter enclosed in yours\nof the 19th of Sept. last, he states that he had\nengaged him, and describes the terms on which he\nhad been engaged by His Lordship to conduct the\nschool at Prairie Lake.\n\nWith regard to this matter the Supt. General\nGeneral decided that the teacher's salary should be provided for in the next year's Estimates, and that if a school can be started, and a fair average attendance shown, and a school house provided, a vote to cover salary of the teacher from the 1st of January to the 30th June might be asked for in the Supplementary Estimates for the current year, unless there are school funds available out of the money already voted.\n\nI am, &c.\nWith reference to the attached letter from the Indian Commissioner for the North West Territories dated on the 12th instant and to the translation embodied therein of a communication received from His Lordship Bishop Grandin, in respect to the suggested establishment of a school at Meadow, otherwise known as Prairie Lake, in Treaty No.6, and having special reference to certain statements made by His Lordship in regard to a promise alleged to have been given by the late Hon. Thomas White, when Supt. General of Indian Affairs, that he would send a teacher provisionally appointed by Bishop Grandin, named Paul Crezeau, authority to act as teacher of an Indian school at the above point, and that he would also furnish him with school books and stationery, the undersigned begs to report that the correspondence had in this matter, which will be found on File 43,885, placed herewith, appears to have commenced on the 12th November 1887, when the Indian Commissioner for the N.W.T. was advised that the Department had been informed by Bishop Grandin that there was much need for the establishment of a school at Prairie Lake, and the desire of the Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6299, file 636-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nthe Supt. General for information in regard to the number of children of school age at that point was communicated to the Indian Commissioner in the same letter, who was likewise asked whether or not the Indians would build the walls of the school house, on the understanding that the Department would contribute the usual grant of $100 towards finishing the same. On the 24th of November of the same year the Indian Commissioner replied that the Indians at Prairie Lake had been rebels, and had therefore not been paid since 1884, when there were 14 boys and 18 girls included in the pay list, but that this number would probably comprehend considerably more children than those of school age. The Commissioner further stated that Mr. Rae, the ex-Agent, had been asked for his opinion and had stated that more than eight or ten children could not be induced to attend, further that much extra expense in feeding the Indians would be incurred, as were their habits as hunters to be interfered with they would have to be supported by the Government almost entirely; but with this view the Commissioner stated he did not quite agree.\n\nAs regards the Indians erecting the walls of a school house, the Commissioner expressed the view that they might be induced to do so in this, as in other cases.\n\nThe Commissioner's letter last referred to was submitted to the Supt. General for his consideration, and on the 20th of December 1887 a note was made thereon to the following effect:\n\n\"Superintendent General says to defer the consideration of the present. Signed, L.V.K. Dec. 20th.\"\n\nIn a letter from the Indian Commissioner of the 19th ultimo, which is also on the file herewith, a translation of a\nletter received from the Bishop of St Albert and a copy of the Commissioner's letter in reply were enclosed. In His Lordship's letter it was stated that he at last had decided to yield to the desire of Chief Francis Little Bear, of Prairie Lake, who for three years past, had been urging the Bishop to let him have a school and Mission. His Lordship also stated that he had given a contract for the construction of a school house and had engaged Mr. Paul Grezeau as teacher; that school was to be kept during the Winter in a private house, pending the completion of the school building. His Lordship asked that material to equip the school properly might be forwarded by the Department. He stated that there were more than 20 children of school age, and that Paul Grezeau had been engaged at a salary of $300 per annum, and that His Lordship had assured him that the Government would pay him faithfully.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner in replying to Bishop Grandin stated that since such matters, as the establishment of new schools were now dealt with by the Supt. General he had referred the matter to him, and would inform His Lordship of the result when ascertained.\n\nIn the letter from Bishop Grandin, a translation whereof is embodied, as above stated, in the Commissioner's letter of the 12th instant being the first referred to in this respect, it will be observed that His Lordship states that at his interview with the late Hon. Thomas White, he informed him that he had engaged as teacher of a Catholic School at Meadow Lake Reserve one Paul Grezeau, but that he had told him to wait for orders from the Department for fear of any difficulty as to the payment of his salary arising. His Lordship then states\nthat Mr. White promised to send the teacher the necessary authority, but the Bishop adds that later he learned that Grezeau was acting as a trader's clerk at Green Lake, and he concluded that having found a more lucrative situation he had since learned that Grezeau had never received any communication from the Department on the subject, and that on the late occasion he refused to be engaged conditionally, and His Lordship says he could not blame him, and adds: \"If the Department therefore does not pay him, his salary will have to be paid by myself.\" Whether His Lordship refers now to his previous engagement of Grezeau or the more recent proposed re-engagement of him by His Lordship appears difficult to determine.\n\nThere would seem likewise to be a contradiction between the statement of His Lordship last referred to that Paul Grezeau refused to be re-engaged conditionally by him, and that contained in his letter enclosed by the Indian Commissioner on the 19th of September last, wherein he states that he had engaged him, and describes the terms as before described on which he had been employed by His Lordship to conduct the school at Prairie Lake.\n\nBoth of the above points would appear to require explanation.\n\nThe facts above detailed are respectfully submitted with a view to the question of the establishment of a school to be conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church at Prairie Lake being decided by the Supt. General, should he consider the information before him sufficient to\nto admit of his coming to a decision in the matter.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Forget Esq.\nIndian Commissioner.\nRegina.\n\nSir,\n\nI am not in the habit of writing to the Government or its employ\u00e9s, believing myself too ignorant of its laws, but I would like to know something which causes a deal of talking here. Why does the Government send money to a rancher of Meadow Lake named Alex. Venne and that other ranchers are not receiving anything. On his letters I see the word teacher (yes, he's a teacher how to raise cattle) (in English in the original) and sells same to butchers every year since I know him, he is a man who has in his possession from 60 to 100 head of cattle, his own property, and he has several more on shares with one named Gr\u00e9zand and another named Billy Peterson. I may almost say that he has not kept the school open since he has been at Meadow Lake, he is always travelling at Battleford or elsewhere. Just lately he returned from Ile a la Crosse and immediately afterwards went to Duck Lake. If the Government receives Returns or School Registers from Meadow Lake I can assure you that they are forged, the people who sign know as well as...\nas myself that there is no school, and\nif you have the least doubt about my\ngood faith, you can ascertain the fact\nby sending an Inspector and you will\nthereby know that the Government throws\nits money away and that it would be better\nin my estimation to use it for the roads\nor something else.\n\nIf I say these things it is that\nbeing a liberal myself I do not wish to\nsee, as much as can be done, any scandal\nwhilst my party is running the country.\n\nMany other things I do not mention.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours etc. etc.\n\n(Sgd) P.L. Morin.\nOffice of the\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBattleford Inspectorate.\nMistawasis, Sask.\nJune 24th, 1898.\n\nRef: your letter No. T26/T38 of the 15th April 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the complaints against Mr. Venne, teacher at Meadow Lake, which by your letter above quoted, were referred to me to be reported on, I have the honour to state as follows:\n\nI reached Meadow Lake reserve at 9.30 a.m. on the 6th of June, and found that Mr. Venne was away at Battleford on private business. He had been away about a week, and was expected back in two or three days.\n\nOn examining the register I found that the statement made in Mr. P.L. Morin's letter concerning Mr. Venne's trips to Isle \u00e0 la Crosse and to Duck Lake is correct. But those trips were made between the 12th and the 31st of March, during which period the school is represented as closed, both in the register and in the quarterly return.\n\nAs the return was found to agree with the register I then endeavored to test the correctness of the register.\n\nMr. P.L. Morin was absent from home as I passed.\npassed Green Lake both going and coming. His father, however, is a settler and trader near Meadow Lake reserve, about 2\u00bd miles from the school, and a man of whose veracity all the oldest settlers in those regions speak highly. I asked him if he knew anything definite as to the way this school was conducted. He said after some hesitation that the school was closed since last November. As the school is the teacher's house I asked him if it might not be that a few children attended of whom he did not know. He admitted that one family might have attended.\n\nThis is the Mirasty family, and they are the only children whom the register shows as having attended, for the average for the quarter is only 3.36. He said, however, that even if these did attend occasionally it could not be called a school, for they did not attend except a day now and again, and they came and went at all hours.\n\nThere was only one male Indian on the reserve. He is a relative (he claims to be a brother) of the above mentioned Mirasty. He also maintained that the school was closed all winter.\n\nThe quarterly return shows that \"the school was closed from the 14th. of March till the 31st\", and although it is supposed to have been open since for some two months, yet the register has\nhas never been marked since the 12th of March.\n\nFrom the foregoing facts I formed the opinion that while the school was nominally open it was practically closed, and that the register was not trustworthy as an accurate record of attendance. The circumstances seem to indicate that it has been written up at intervals from memory and somewhat at random.\n\nAs for taking holidays in June there could be no better time (at least in the early part of June) since the Indians, old and young, were nearly all away bear-hunting. But March was not a suitable time as there is very little hunting done then.\n\nThere are, however, sufficient indications that the school, whether open or closed, is doing no work of any value. Mr. Venne has no influence with the Indians to induce them to send their children to school. Moreover, he has become interested in stock-raising to such an extent that it claims both his time and attention, and that almost entirely.\n\nIt cannot be expected, however, that for the meagre salary a teacher can be induced to go to that remote part and devote himself exclusively to teaching.\n\nI would therefore strongly recommend that the Day School be closed and that an effort be made to induce the Indians to send their children to Isle \u00e0 la Crosse Boarding School.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is among these hunting Indians that Boarding Schools are destined to do their most useful work.\n\nAdditional to other drawbacks in the present school, the teacher and his wife and two children live in the school, using it as a general living room, while there is a summer kitchen and a dairy house attached. These conditions are scarcely compatible with successful school work even on a small scale. It is true Mr. Venne has logs prepared to erect a house for himself during the summer, just outside the reserve.\n\nWith reference to the charge that Mr. Venne is \"always travelling\" so far as I had any means of verifying or otherwise, I must say that he appears to travel only during intervals that the school is reported as closed for holidays. That the returns are \"forged\" - the facts do not seem to bear out the charge, at least in the letter.\n\nI have the honour, &c.\n\nW.J.

Your letter states that provision is made in the estimates for salaries of these overseers at the rate of $100.00, whereas our copy of the estimates and my recommendation in the matter provide for $180.00 per annum. Is there a clerical error in your letter?\n\nIn connection with the salary of a teacher at Meadow Lake, I beg to point out that no provision is made therefor in the Estimates for 1900-1901. The amount was not placed therein by me as the school was closed in 1898 for want of attendance. Subsequently, however, Mr. Inspector Chisholm and Mr. Agent Goodfellow recommended that it be reopened and I was informed in your letter of the 22nd January last that provision would be made in next year's estimates for the salary of a teacher for this school;\n\nbut\n\nSecretary,\nDept.

Will you kindly let me know whom you would recommend for the position at Big River, and whether you consider that the office of overseer and teacher should be filled by the same person.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.O.

General,\n\nProvision is made in the Estimates for the current year for the salaries, at the rate of $180 each, of two overseers at Meadow Lake and Big River, in the Carlton Agency, N.W.T., and for teachers at these places at $300 each. Big River is situated about twenty-one miles from the Agency headquarters, on the Mistawasis Reserve, and Meadow Lake about ninety miles from the Agency headquarters. The Commissioner when estimating for the salaries at these points considered that the teachers should act as overseers as it would be impossible to secure the services of competent men to act in either capacity alone at the salaries allowed. Mr. Davis, M.P., has submitted the name of William Peaterson of Battleford as instructor and teacher at Meadow Lake, and is prepared to submit the name of a teacher who will act as overseer at Big River, but considers that it would be better to have an overseer at Big River. This, however, could not very well be done, as the $300 is provided for a teacher at that point. In this connection I beg to refer to memo. of 7th March last, turned out.

It is not very clear what is meant by \"overseer and farming instructor\" - as the latter duty covers the former.\n\nThe parties will be instructed as directed. But it is to be hoped that the Department will not yield to members of parliament, where no other office is involved, the selection of teachers of Indian schools within the limits of their districts. The unfitness of Mr. Dreaver as a teacher ought to be a warning in this regard.\n\nThere are complaints, however, in other directions. The Agent at Duck Lake in reporting a visit on the 4th January, ultimo, to John Smith's reserve, says, inter alia:\n\n\"They then stated that all that Band belonged to the Church of England; that the teacher did not; that she did not reside on the reserve - that she gave no help towards having the children attend church service\".

In case it is thought advisable to reappoint him, I would recommend that he be allowed two employees' positions in addition to his present salary. I doubt whether it is possible for a man with even a small family to live at a place where supplies are so expensive and devote his time conscientiously to his duties without either incurring debt or suffering privation.\n\nVillebrun is a married man of about thirty years, and has two small children. He is sober, moral, and trustworthy, and is accordingly peculiarly suited to a position where his work cannot be frequently looked into. He is also a man of fair intelligence and scholarship. I regret to say that I cannot speak definitely as to the way his work is performed or the actual results of it, as I have only direct information on the subject. From his own statements and from Mr. Price, who as Acting Agent visited the reserve at treaty time, I gather that he has had fair success under as yet very unfavourable conditions.\n\nI have etc.,\n(Sgd.)

This was accepted by the Commissioner, but after an interview with Mr. Inspector Chisholm Mr. Villebrun in a letter of the 20th ultimo withdrew his resignation in the hope that he would be granted either an increase of salary or an extra allowance in the way of rations. The cost of living at the point is high. Flour is $6.50 a hundred, and bacon 30\u00a2 a pound.\n\nThe Commissioner is not disposed to recommend the extension of the rationing system, but agrees with me that the salary paid Mr. Villebrun is not sufficient and that his remuneration as overseer should be increased to $20.00 a month. Provision is being made in the estimates accordingly, but I would venture to suggest that if possible the increase be allowed for the balance of the present fiscal year. In support of this recommendation I submit a copy of a letter of the 5th instant from Mr. Inspector Chisholm written in response to an inquiry made by me when I received Mr. Villebrun's note of the 20th ultimo.\n\n(Sgd) J.A.J.

Morin, Teacher, at Meadow Lake Reserve, that this man is a Roman Catholic, but it might be in name only.\n\nI might say that this man, although a Half-breed is in reality more like an Indian in his actions; and being married to an Indian woman does not tend to better the situation at all, as the Indians are more apt to look upon him as one of themselves, and not with the respect which they should have for him.\n\nI consider that this man is not much good; and he has certainly not advanced the Indians a bit: he moreover does not pull, or even attempt to get along, with the Chief or Indians.\n\nNo complaints were made to me about this man at the last Treaty Payments; but I have since ascertained that the reason for this was that someone had given them to understand that Morin was leaving soon anyhow and therefore they did not bother about saying anything, and for which they were sorry afterwards.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(signed) J.

McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that the Indians of Meadow Lake intend, during the approaching Spring, to commence Farming on their Reserve with a view of becoming, in a few years time, entirely self-supporting. They say that, at present, they are ignorant as to the methods of Agriculture; and therefore would like to have, for the first few years, a competent Farm Instructor: at present they have an Overseer, who is also the Teacher of the Reserve Day School, this arrangement has hitherto been satisfactory; but now that the Cattle have multiplied so, and the Indians will require so much more instruction and supervision in their Farming operations, one person cannot fill the dual position of Overseer and School Teacher, without seriously neglecting one, or the other, of these duties; hence the request of the Band for a Farm Instructor, as previously stated for a few years only, in order that they may get started aright.\n\nThe present Overseer Mr P.C. Morin is a competent man and would, I think, make a good Instructor.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, 26th March, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant reporting that the Indians of Meadow Lake intend commencing farming operations and desire a Farm instructor.\n\nIn reply I have to say that as the Estimates do not provide funds for such a position and other expenses pertaining thereto the proposition can not be entertained at present.\n\nWhen making up your next Estimates you should bring the matter to the notice of the Inspector who no doubt will bring the matter to the attention of the Department if he considers these Indians should have the assistance asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

The farmer in charge, Mr. B. Jefferson, receives the highest salary of any farmer at your Agency, and it is considered that his work amongst the Indians should show better results. In the case of Mr. D. Villebrun, the farmer at Sweet-Grass Reserve, the Department also anticipated a better showing as to work accomplished. If there is not a decided improvement in the work done at these reserves next season the Department will be forced to the conclusion that these farmers have not the proper method of inducing the Indians to work and of training them in farming, and the question of making a change as to management with regard to the farming industry will be taken into consideration.\n\nKindly advise the farmers mentioned to the above effect. You should warn the farmers on the new reserves that better results are expected from them next season, and that if failure of crop is traceable to neglect or mismanagement their removal from office will be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd J.B.

D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY & SECRETARY,\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nReport on Inspection of Battleford Agency from October 1st 1911, to March 31st 1912. Date of inspection, March 8th to 26th, 1912.\n\nAlthough J.U. Paquet has been in charge of the Meadow Lake reserve for a year or more as overseer and teacher, yet this was the first opportunity I had had of inspecting his work. I regret to have to say that I formed a very poor impression as to his reliability and trustworthiness. The information furnished by his diary was very indefinite and unsatisfactory; and in many instances it was impossible to determine whether the references were to his own work or that of the Indians. I was informed by Rev. Father Cochin, whose mission is just outside the reserve, about two and a half miles from the Farmer's dwelling, that the school is a mere sham and exists only in name. The same was said by half breeds living within half a mile from the teacher's house. The school room, such as it is, is under the same roof with the teacher's dwelling, and the statement is made by all the neighbours that it is an unusual thing to see an Indian child around the place at all. On the day of my visit the teacher maintained there was only one pupil on the reserve, and that he sent for him and could not get him to come. There are no evidences of school work to be seen.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nSgn. W.J. Chisholm\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nPrince Albert,\nJuly 29th, 1912.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nI beg to draw attention to Agent Rowland's letter of the 3rd February hereunder in which he states that he considers J. U. Paquet, overseer and teacher at Meadow Lake Reserve unsuited to hold office. I shall be glad if you will read Mr. Rowland's letter and also the extract from Inspector Chisholm's report of the 26th March 1912, which I have placed on this file. The statements made indicate that Mr. Paquet does not fulfil the duties of his office. He is paid $300.00 a year as school teacher and $240.00 as overseer. I shall be glad to know whether you desire any action taken in this connection.\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nOttawa, 15th February, 1913.\nWill you please have the necessary action taken to dispense with the services of Mr. J.

I can see no advantage in keeping it open as it is only an expense and no progress is being made. I would therefore recommend that it be closed at the end of March. As the Indians of this reserve are all Catholic, we could with the assistance of Rev. Father Wadelle the Catholic missionary at Meadow take place the most of these children in the Thunderchild Boarding School. We now have a few in this school from this reserve and the parents are well satisfied.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 16, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant recommending that, on account of the poor attendance, the Meadow Lake School be closed at the end of this month.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department approves of this school being closed at the end of this month and you will be good enough to advise the teacher accordingly. When it is closed kindly see that the building is locked and that the equipment and supplies are safely stored.\n\nYou will be good enough to take the necessary action to have any children of school age on the reserve placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School, as you suggest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAs the result of the burning of the Thunderchild Indian Residential School, the Indians of the Meadow Lake Reserve are very anxious to have a day school on their reserve. Reverend Father Allard, the Roman Catholic missionary at that point, has started a small day school with very poor facilities in an old discarded Government building on the reserve. It is a log building and cannot be made suitable for a school. However, he is carrying on as well as he is able to, doing some of the teaching himself, and getting some free assistance from a young lady living in the town of Meadow Lake, about a mile away from the school.\n\nWhile the establishment of a day school on the Meadow Lake Reserve may not be entirely in agreement with the wishes of some of the heads of the Church, I must say that Reverend Father Allard is certainly very anxious to have one, and, in my opinion, has very good grounds for the stand which he is taking.\n\nThe living conditions of the Indians, and the situation of the homes on the Meadow Lake Reserve make a day school much more practical than on most Indian reserves. I have not been informed of the exact number of day schools which have been authorized for Saskatchewan this year. We have practically settled upon Nut Lake, Poorman's, and Chitek Lake each for a combined day school and teacherage, and Thunderchild Reserve for a classroom without a teacherage. In addition to this, it was tentatively decided to build a day school on the White Bear's Reserve to take the place of the present St. Francis R.C. Day School, which is using the Church for a classroom.\n\nIf funds are not available for a combined classroom and teacherage at Meadow Lake Reserve in addition to these, I would be in favour of delaying the erection of the classroom at the White Bear's Reserve another year, substituting for this a combined classroom and teacherage at the Meadow Lake Reserve.\n\nPlease give this matter consideration and instruct me as to the decision of the Department.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nRegina, June 9th, 1948.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI have written officially to the Department today in connection with a proposed day school at the Meadow Lake Reserve, of the new Meadow Lake Agency.\n\nFor your information I should point out that Father Allard, perhaps without the entire approval of those in authority over him, considers day schools on suitable reserves much more useful than residential schools. In discussing these matters with me, he emphasized that the matter is confidential as between us as he does not wish to be treading on the toes of those in authority in the Church.\n\nFather Allard has grasped the opportunity to start a day school of a kind on the Meadow Lake Reserve to serve those children who are without a school as the result of the loss of the Thunderchild Residential School. He is hoping to receive co-operation from us in the matter and fully deserves it. Any assistance you can give to push this through without embarrassing Father Allard will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDay School Building Programme 1948-49 - Saskatchewan\n\nReference your 1050 - 316 - 11A of June 9 -\n\nAmounts included in our estimates for your day schools are as follows:\n\nSweetgrass (one-room) ............... $14,000.00\nRed Pheasant (one room) .............. 14,000.00\nKeehewins (one room) ................. 14,000.00\nChitek (one room) .................... 14,000.00\nPorman's (one room) .................. 14,000.00\nNut Lake (one room) ................... 14,000.00\nValley River (two room)\n(now Manitoba Inspectorate) ......... 28,000.00\n\nWe have received Major Clark's report on the educational situation at Red Pheasant Reserve. He advises that Superintendent Bell and Canon Hives are in agreement with him that the replacement of this school is not an immediate necessity. Therefore we would suggest that consideration be given to transferring the Red Pheasant funds to Meadow Lake. I would suggest that Major Clark visit Meadow Lake, discuss this matter with Father Allard and consider the establishment of a day school there.\n\nIn view of your statement re the St. Francis Day School on the White Bear's Reserve, would you consider recommending the transfer of funds from Keehewins to this point?\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could hear from you concerning the above two suggested transfers of funds.\n\nBernard N. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 17, 1948.\n\nPERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nI was pleased to receive your personal letter concerning the proposed day school on the Meadow Lake Reserve. I have also received your official letter and have written to you in regard to this matter, officially.\n\nI realize the situation only too well with regard to Father Allard and the church authorities. I recently had an opportunity of discussing a similar situation with Father Laviolette, whose views you already know. Upon your recommendation and that of Major Clark, we are prepared to erect a one-room day school with attached teacherage at Meadow Lake. We will have to be very certain that the number of children warrants the expenditure. In Manitoba we have been operating these day schools in churches for a year or two and then, if we found the Indians cooperating, we have been building proper day schools. You will recall that a similar arrangement worked well at Valley River. We have just arranged for a building foreman for the construction of Valley River. He was recommended highly by Father Lambert and it is possible that Father Allard could interest him in the project at Meadow Lake, if it goes through.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nPersonal & Confidential\n\nRegina, June 21st, 1948.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI wish to thank you for your letter of the 17th instant, File No. 105-3-1 (E), in connection with the erection of a combined classroom and teacherage at the Meadow Lake Reserve, and for the personal interest you have taken therein.\n\nWith regard to that part of your letter which refers to engaging a building foreman for the construction of a school at Valley River Reserve I would appreciate being advised of the method it is proposed to use in that construction. It appears to me that the quotations I have received for buildings of this kind are too high. I expect to receive a tender from Mr. O. Lidfors, at Meadow Lake, for the proposed Meadow Lake School, within a few days. I am not certain of the amount he will quote, but I feel rather certain that it will be over $14,000.00.\n\nIf a combined classroom and teacherage can be erected for $14,000.00 by the use of a construction foreman, and purchase of the material by the Department, I would be glad to have the figures which you have available, to compare them with local prices, for material and labour.\n\nIt must be remembered, of course, that labour regulations in Saskatchewan are somewhat different from those in Manitoba. Saskatchewan labour regulations make it necessary for a contractor to add approximately 12% to normal labour costs in order to provide for the payment of labour on Sundays and holidays, which is not actually being performed. This matter has been mentioned before, and I am sure has received some consideration by you and other officials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.B. Ostreander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nJPBO/ed\nAIR MAIL.\n\nPERSONAL: , June 30, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Ostrander:\n\nMeadow Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of June 21st.\n\nWe are paying the foreman carpenter at Valley River $1.50 per hour. We are paying his two sons $1.25 per hour. We have found that the cost of the materials for the schools vary widely. This is due to the fact that in certain provinces, the mills and building supply companies are not keen to tender on ready built cupboards, stairs, etc., as called for in our specifications. However, the total cost of the materials varies between $5,500 and $6,500.\n\nThe school at Oak River, Manitoba, cost around $1,300.00 using a foreman carpenter. Mr. Doucet tells me that this is one of the best finished schools of this type that he has seen.\n\nIn addition to paying the foreman carpenter and other labourers, we usually arrange for the rent of a bull dozer for the time necessary to do the excavation. We also arrange to rent a cement mixer and a man to operate it, where it is necessary. We even have one small agency in Ontario, where the Agent himself is actually supervising the construction of the building with Indian labour. As you know, the plans and specifications are very detailed and fairly easy to read.\n\nI hope that this is the information that you require. We are only too well aware of the fact that the Saskatchewan labour regulations make your labour costs higher than those in other areas.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa,\n\nAttention of Mr. Neary\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 3rd instant, File 105-3-8 (A.M.), in connection with the tender of Mr. Olof Lidforss for the erection of the combined classroom and teacherage at the Meadow Lake Reserve.\n\nI have been unable to get a second quotation on this building, and I regret that the fact was not stated in my letter referred to by Mr. Mills, Chief Engineer.\n\nAs you are aware, Holterman and Sons are building the Butte Lake Day School and the Poorman's Day School. In addition, they have agreed to build two warehouses for us before this winter, consequently the whole of their time for this season will be taken up. Axel Olson gave a quotation last year on a similar building at the Chitek Lake Reserve, or the Carlton Agency, and his tender was not accepted because it was considered too high. When approached again this year, he informed me that he would not lower his quotation below the tender he submitted last year, as he said in the meantime the cost of material has risen considerably. I may say quite definitely that unless Mr. Lidforss' tender for the school at Meadow Lake is accepted as submitted, this school cannot be built this year. I note the fourth paragraph of Mr. Mills' letter, a copy of which was forwarded to me, to the effect that \".....where they do submit a tender, it is based, not on what the project is worth, but what they consider they can obtain. There is no evidence of prices being based on a fair profit above the cost of labour and materials.\" I may say in this connection that Mr. Lidforss would be quite willing to take on the contract for the Meadow Lake School on a cost plus basis. If that is the wish of the Lands and Development Services Branch I shall approach Mr. Lidforss to accept the work on that basis, but I fear that we will later regret having done so. Mr. Lidforss is not a racketeer in the construction business. He is an honest, conscientious workman who values his services at a certain rate. If he cannot take a contract with a hope that his financing of the contract, plus his own time, at a reasonable rate, will give him the return he requires, he will not take the contract, as his time is very much in demand, and he does not have to look for work.\n\nMr. Lidforss' home is in Meadow Lake, consequently he prefers contracting jobs in that area, and will quote a lower price on them because of saving the transportation costs. There is a great deal of building going on in all parts of this province, and all good contractors have far more work ahead of them than they can handle this year. People who have building jobs to be done are faced with awarding the contract at the contractor's price, or waiting for some time for contractors to reduce their prices.\n\nI note also the remarks of Mr. Mills with regard to having similar buildings erected for $13,500.00 to $14,000.00. If he will inform me where there is a contractor in Saskatchewan who will erect one of these buildings at anywhere near $14,000.00 I shall immediately interview him. I have driven hundreds of miles endeavouring to find contractors interested in work for us, and Holterman Brothers, and Olof Lidforss, are the only ones who were interested enough to bother examining the plans. I believe Mr. Mills should be again reminded that minimum wage laws in Saskatchewan are considerably different from any other province, therefore it is useless for him to continue reminding me that a certain job can be done for less money in other provinces. I am quite aware of the fact, but, happen to be interested only in Saskatchewan, and problems of building in Saskatchewan.\n\nJ.P.B.

DAVIS\nDATED MARCH 31, 1949\n\n\"The Day School at Meadow Lake was opened on February 13th with eleven pupils attending. This number will be increased after trapping season is over and again at the start of the next term when the Meadow Lake Indian children who are at present attending the Beauval Residential School will be in attendance here. This number will tax the capacity of the present school.\n\nI would like to mention that I have taken the school inspector for this area, the principal of the Public and High Schools and several citizens out to inspect this school and they all have given very high praise for the plan on which it was erected and the use of all available space. This school to my mind is one of the nicest schools the writer has ever had the privilege of visiting, and schools such as this should prove to the public that the Indian Affairs Department are taking great strides and trying to educate the Indian children and at the same time give them very comfortable quarters.\"\n\n(Original on 75-171)\n\n5-5-59\nCopied: AM\nDecember 20th, 1949.\n\nExtract from Agent's Report for the month of November on the Meadow Lake Indian Day School.

What I presume to be the cause of this, from what I have gathered from Mr. Chouinard and have seen myself, is that the parents of some of these children do not get up at a decent time to give the children breakfast, consequently the children have to make their own breakfast or go without.

Davis, Esq., Indian Superintendent, MEADOW LAKE, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Department has referred to me an extract from your report on the Meadow Lake Indian Day School for the month of November, in which there is a paragraph devoted to lack of punctuality in the pupils arriving at the school, wherein you state they \"kept drifting in from 9.30 to 10.30 A.M.\"\n\nNo good purpose is served in making a report of this kind without providing the Department with information as to what action you have taken to counteract the unsatisfactory condition, and the result of such action.\n\nIn the final analysis you are the only one who can deal with this in a practical manner. The extent to which your action will prove effective depends almost entirely upon the extent to which you can impose your will upon the parents of such children (any suitable manner short of actual force).\n\nI am well aware that it is not your duty to visit the Indian homes early in the morning to cook breakfast for their children, but I am also aware that most Superintendents, and many Assistants, have been successful, by continual attention to the problem, to have good day school attendance and punctuality.\n\nPlease give this matter immediate attention, advising me of the action you have taken and, in due course thereafter, the results which you have accomplished.\n\nJ.P.B.

Warden, Field Assistant, Regina Office, in connection with a proposed Indian Day School for the Loon Lake Reserve, of the Meadow Lake Agency.\n\nMr. Warden has just returned from Meadow Lake where he was in charge of the agency following the death of the late Mr. H.S. Packman. I asked him while at the Meadow Lake Agency to enquire into the possibility of renting the building referred to in his report.\n\nThere has recently been erected in the Loon Lake Village a good school to accommodate all of the white children of the village, and nothing has been done with the old village school building. Mr. Warden informs me that this building is in good condition with the exception of a need for paint, and that it is large enough to accommodate 35 children. There are only about 20 children of school age on the Loon Lake Reserve, and they all live reasonably close to the Loon Lake Village.\n\nI have hesitated about recommending the erection of an Indian day school for the Loon Lake Reserve, but I am entirely in favour of renting the building referred to for one term, as an experiment. If the Indian parents take sufficient interest in the education of their children that the children will attend school regularly, consideration might be given later to buying the building referred to, and moving it on to the reserve, a distance of about \u00bd mile or a mile from its present site. I would also warn the parents that if the attendance in the proposed temporary day school is not satisfactory they will not be given a day school, and their children will have to be sent away to a residential school.\n\nThe Indians of the Loon Lake Band are practically all Anglicans, and I presume that the Anglican Church would expect the school to be operated under their auspices. It will be noted that Mr. Warden....\nRegina, February 7th, 1949.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions I looked into the possibility of obtaining a building suitable for school purposes to be used for the children of the Loon Lake Indian Reserve. The small building formerly used by the Village of Loon Lake is available, at a cost of $25.00 per month rent. It is a frame building 24' x 36', on cement foundation, but without a basement. The building is unpainted on the outside, but otherwise in good condition. There is no furniture in the building with the exception of a box stove.\n\nThe school is situated within Loon Lake Village Limits and is approximately \u00bc of a mile from the Indian reserve boundary. There are about 20 children on the Loon Lake Reserve of school age, whose parents are anxious that a school be made available for them, and there is a possibility of our being able to purchase the building in question at a later date from the School Unit Board. In the event of satisfactory school attendance the building could be moved on to the reserve.\n\nI might add that there is an ex-school teacher available who would be willing to take the position, and she is a married woman.\n\nI would recommend that the matter of opening a school for the benefit of the Indian children on this reserve be given your favourable consideration.\n\nJ.T.S. Warden,\nField Assistant, Regina Office.\nRegina, February 18th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 7th instant, File 239-316-11A (171), in which I recommended that consideration be given to renting the old school building in the Village of Loon Lake and opening it as an Indian day school.\n\nEnclosed are copies of my letter dated February 12th, File 278-316-11A, to Indian Superintendent J.A. Davis, of the Meadow Lake Agency, and his reply dated February 16th, 1949, in connection with the matter.\n\nI presume that nothing further should be done in this connection until we have the assurance of the Unit Board that the Indian children will have the use of the play grounds surrounding the village school if it is decided to rent the old building for a day school.\n\nI shall advise the Department when I receive from Mr. Davis the report which he is to receive from Mr. Studor, the Director of the Unit Board.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nMeadow Lake, Sask.,\nFebruary 16th, 1949.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: Your file 278-316-11A (171)\n\nFurther to my letter to you of February 9th and your\nletter of February 12th:\n\nRe: Paragraph Two: I wish to thank you for the informat-\nion contained in the letters attached.\n\nRe: Paragraph Three: I wish to state that it was the\nfarthest from my thoughts that Indian children and White children\nshould not mix, but I had been talking to a couple of the Unit\nBoard Directors previous to writing you and their re-action to\nthe children mixing was that they felt that the parents of the\nWhite children in Loon Lake would object. In order to further\nclarify the situation with respect to the school I attended the\nUnit Board meeting yesterday where this matter was fully discussed.\nI drew to the attention of the Board that there was no possibility\nof recommending rental of the school building in its present\nsituation if the White people were going to object to the Indian\nchildren mixing with theirs. It was suggested that possibly\nrecess periods could be staggered and in that way overcome their\nimaginal problem. It was finally decided that the Director,\nMr. Studor, representing that part of the school district would\ncall a meeting and interview the interested parties and would\nreport back to the Board his findings regarding the two schools\nbeing in operation so close together.\n\nA letter from the Unit Board dated February 1st, copy of which\nwas attached with letter of February 9th, sort of confuses the\nissue in that they were agreeable to rent the building at $25.00\nper month and yet this same board seem to be of the opinion that\nthe White and Indian children should not mix. I further pointed\nout to them that actions such as this did not offer much co-operation\nin trying to assist our Indian population of becoming better citizens.\nIn the meantime, would recommend that no further action be taken\nuntil such times that we have definite assurance that the Indian\nchildren can have the same use of the play grounds as the White\nchildren. When the report is received from Mr. Studor we will\nforward same to you for your perusal.\n\nMention at the Board Meeting was made re: purchase of the\nbuilding to be moved onto the Reserve. The Board was not in a\nposition to set a price. They might be prepared to sell it so that\nmatter is now left in abeyance.\n\nRe: Paragraph Six: With mention of Miss Lepine, School\nTeacher, I will have to plead ignorance with respect to the appoint-\nment of teachers as far as religious organizations are concerned.\nI took the matter up with Mr. Nixon Assistant Agent, and neither\nof us knew that the C.O.F.R. claimed such rights on that reserve,\nand Mr. Nixon informed me that he thought they were a straight\npagan band. Mr. Nixon further mentioned that there is some married\nlady living near the school at Loon Lake who would be acceptable\nand who would be willing to teach a school there if put in operation.\n\nAgain let me definitely state that it certainly is not my\npolicy to...\nRegina, February 12th, 1949.\n\nJ.A. Davis, Esq., Indian Superintendent, MEADOW LAKE, Saskatchewan.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, File 281-1-(171), regarding use of the old school building in the Village of Loon Lake by Indian children.\n\nAttached is copy of the report of Mr. Warden to me in this connection, and copy of my letter to the Department, recommending that arrangements be made to rent the building. I have not yet had a reply to my letter to the Department, but I shall advise you of the result as soon as I receive a reply.\n\nRegarding the second paragraph of your letter referred to, please advise me why you are of the opinion that \"it would be far more satisfactory to have the children moved out on to the reserve where the white and Indian children would not be so closely associated.\"\n\nI may say, for your information in the future, that it has been the recommendation of the Joint Committee of Parliament, which has been in conference for two years considering revision of the Indian Act and all other matters relating to the service to, and welfare of, Indians, that whenever the opportunity arises Indian children should be encouraged to associate with white children in both education and recreation, and you may consider quite definitely, that this is the policy which we hope to follow in the future. Of course, if the Unit Board controlling the rental of the school building are so short-sighted and narrow minded that they object to our Indian children playing on the same school grounds with the white children, and refuse to rent the building to us unless it is moved on to the reserve, there is little that we can do about it. However, it will be your duty to discuss this phase of the matter with the Unit Board and ascertain their re-action.\n\nYou will note that in my letter to the Department I have recommended that if attendance proves satisfactory at the school in its present location, consideration might be given later to buying the building and moving it on to the reserve. I may say that in making that recommendation I did not have in mind the desire which you appear to have, to segregate our Indian children. My only reason in making such recommendation was that if we were to own the building, it would have to be located on an Indian reserve and, by moving it on to the reserve it would probably be somewhat closer to the homes of the Indian children.\n\nAnother matter in your letter which I should point out to you for your future information is the suggestion that Miss G. Lenine, who is determined to resign from her appointment as day school teacher at the Big Island Lake Indian Day School might be considered as teacher for the Loon Lake Day School. It is the policy of the Department that the church to which the majority of the Indian children belong will have the right to nominate (for Departmental approval) the teacher to be engaged for an Indian day school. I happen to know that Miss Lenine belongs to the R.C. faith, therefore there is small likelihood that she would be nominated by Bishop Martin, of the Anglican Church, for the position.

Davis, copy of which was sent to the Department with my letter of the 18th instant on the subject.\n\nIn the meantime may I suggest that, notwithstanding the demands made upon the Department in the past by Bishop Martin, of the Church of England, that the proposed day school be operated under the auspices of his church, that the new school be non-denominational. I was misinformed that the majority of the Indians of that band were Anglican. The slight majority of one Anglican over members of the Roman Catholic faith does not, in my opinion, justify the operation of the school under the auspices of the Anglican Church, particularly in view of the fact that there is a still greater majority who have not accepted either faith.\n\nI would recommend that the school be non-denominational, and the vacancy for the teacher for the remainder of the present school term be filled by the ex-school teacher mentioned by Mr. J.T. Warden as living in the Village of Loon Lake, who has the necessary qualifications. I may say in this connection that I have not been informed of her name or the religion to which she belongs.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRes. Yours of May 5th, File 1027-6-46-171.\n\nAttached is a requisition for Janitor supplies for the Loon Lake Indian Day School which is anticipated opening on September 1st, 1949.\n\nWe have estimated for the year's supply but having had no experience in this request that you check and inform us if we have ordered too much or too little of any commodity.\n\nWe have asked for two long handled scrub brushes. These, although slightly more expensive than the ones without handles do a far better job as more leverage is gained. The handleless brushes are for corners and places the others could not reach properly.\n\nAs no teacher has as yet been appointed to that school would suggest that supplies come in care of this Agency at Meadow Lake. Once a teacher is in charge supplies could be sent direct via St. Walburg, (C.N.R.) which is about twenty miles closer than Meadow Lake.\n\nAs paper cups are of no use for hot lunches we have shown three dozen iron-stone cups and saucers.

There is no teacher's dwelling on this reserve, but an unmarried teacher can secure board and comfortable quarters at the farm house, 1\u00bd miles from the school, and the Department is assured that the farmer will co-operate in every way with the teacher in maintaining the attendance and raising the efficiency of the school.\n\nI have to ask Your Lordship, therefore, to take into consideration the appointment of a teacher with proper qualifications and to one with the necessary certificates a salary of $400.00 per annum will be paid. I shall be glad to hear from Your Lordship in connection with this matter at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\n\nRight Rev.

Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nWe beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of date of July 20th and state that we are occupied in trying to find a suitable teacher for the day school of the Poundmaker's Reserve.\n\nThus far, applicants desire to know if salary of $400.00 includes board and lodging or whether same shall have to be provided for out of said salary. As to this we have been unable to answer their queries.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nAlbert Pascal, D.D., O.M.I.\nBishop of Prince Albert.\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nJuly 20 1910.\nOttawa, July 26, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 20th instant in reference to board and lodging for a teacher for the Poundmaker's school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on this reserve no dwelling has been erected for a teacher and an unmarried teacher will have to make provision for his own board and lodging out of the salary provided by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Albert Pascal, D.D., O.M.I.,\nBishop of Prince Albert,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nAs I heard the Indian Department is taking some steps to improve the day schools, I beg to draw his attention on Roundmaker's day school. I suggest to rent a new building for school purpose and one house for the teacher in order to engage a married man. The man could teach and the lady could help him in making the children wash themselves and teach some works specially to the girls and prepare a midday meal. So the yearly wages should be raised from $300 to $600. At the same time the children should be conveyed to the school. According my own idea and my experience I think the Department and the missionaries will see a great success.\n\nHoping the Department granting my request.\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYour very obliged\n\nRev. H. Welmas\n\nJ. W. McLean\nSecretary of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, November 30, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant in reference to the establishment of an improved day school on the Poundmaker's reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that inquiries will be made and you will be further advised. I may say that where conditions are favourable the Department is prepared and to engage a married man, his wife and to provide proper accommodation for them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. H. Delmas,\nDelmas, Sask.\nOttawa, November 30, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReverend Father Delmas has applied to the Department for the establishment of an improved day school on the Poundmakers Reserve. He recommends the appointment of a married man, his wife to act as field matron. This system is employed on several of the reserves in Saskatchewan and the results in general have been very satisfactory. The Department would, therefore, like to have a full report from you upon conditions on the Poundmakers reserve, in which you should deal with the number of children of school age, the distances they reside from the school, the condition of the Indian homes, the present condition of the school building and any other matters that, in your opinion, may be of use to the Department in considering this question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nOttawa, January 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of November 30th, last, in which you were asked for a report on the establishment of an improved day school on the Poundmaker's reserve and to ask when the Department may expect to receive the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to say, relative to the Poundmaker Day School, that an improved School on this Reserve, if it were well conducted, should prove a great success and a benefit to the Indians; as there are now 21 Children of School age, and a lot of others who are nearly old enough to attend too.\n\nUnder date of Aug 6th '10 I wrote you stating that the present building is in a ruinous condition, and not worth repairing. I would also recommend that a married man be employed as Teacher: his wife could prepare the noon meal for the children; and I always consider that the presence of a good woman helps to attract the children to the schools.\n\nOn this Reserve the homes of the Parents are somewhat scattered; so that when the School would be ready for complete operation; I think that it would be advisable to have the ones who reside far away from the School brought there by some sort of conveyance.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

With regard to making a recommendation as to a successor for Mrs Favel's Position; I will again write you when the Church Authorities have approved of an applicant.

D. McLEAN ESQ'RE.\nASSISTANT DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the temporary appointment of Tom Pavel as teacher of the Roundmakers School during the winter months. You should, however, continue your efforts with a view to securing the services of a more competent teacher. It would be well for you to correspond with His Lordship Bishop Pascal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. P. G. Day, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nRev. Father Lacombe, of Delmas, informs me that he has been authorized to employ a teacher for the Poundmaker Bay school. He had secured a female teacher holding a diploma from a Normal School in the province of Quebec; but as he could not promise a higher salary than $300 the lady took another situation. He now recommends the appointment of Miss Anna Bellavance, a girl of about 18 years, who has been educated at the Separate School at Delmas. According to the certificate of her teacher, which I enclose, Miss Bellavance has gone through the 7th grade, which represents approximately the standing of the Entrance Examination, or from one to two years short of the Third Class teacher's certificate. Apparently in this case also the acceptance of the position depends on the salary to be paid, as the reverend Father desires to know whether an allowance of $500 per annum will be made in case of her appointment. I quite believe that Miss Bellavance would do considerably better work than has been done in this school for some time past, yet owing to her rather limited scholarship and her lack of training and experience I could not recommend that so high a salary be paid. I would recommend, however, that $500 be paid to a duly qualified teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. J. B. de la Salle School,\nDelmas, Sept 5, 1912.\n\nI have very great pleasure in certifying that Miss Anna Bellavance has been a pupil in constant attendance at our Roman Catholic School for the past few years. During that time she has always maintained a high standing both as to conduct and scholarship. She just went through the 7th grade.\n\nI am happy to be able to recommend her as a teacher of great promise and ability. You can trust her fully.\n\nSister Saint Aubert,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, September 16, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Poundmaker Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is quite prepared to make an allowance of $500.00 per annum for a qualified teacher, but cannot pay this salary to Miss Anna Bellavance, whose scholarship is very limited, she only having taken a public school course. The very most the Department could allow in this case is $300.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nOttawa, April 25, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department endeavours, if possible, to find teachers with professional qualifications, that is those who have had pedagogical training either in the model or normal schools in some of the provinces and for teachers with such qualifications the Department allows salaries ranging from $500.00 to $700.00 per annum, where there are children to justify the payment of such an amount.\n\nOwing to the location of many of our reserves and the lack of boarding and lodging accommodation it is sometimes very difficult to secure qualified teachers, but it is often possible to obtain the services of competent persons with advanced scholastic qualifications and imbued with an interest in Indian work, to whom the Department is prepared to allow salaries of from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum, although they have not had professional training.\n\nYour communication of the same date in reference to the erection of a day school building has also been received, but, as no provision has been made in the estimates this year for this purpose, the Department cannot undertake the work this season. A note, however, will be made for next\n\nRev. H. Lagombe, O.M.I.,\nDelmas, Sask.\nnext year, when it may be found possible to put up a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

I trust my report for quarter ending Dec 31st forwarded in this mail will be satisfactory, and allow me to state a few difficulties existing through the quarter on this reserve. We opened school on the 13th Oct 1913. There was no provision made for cutting wood for school so I had to arrange for it at my own expense. There was not any wood supplied for cooking a meal a day or heating the house where they eat dinner all winter I provided wood and had it cut until the 23rd Oct. The farmer told me hereafter the wood would be provided for the kitchen stove. The house is not fit for habitation hardly, the Catholic church where we have school is not protected very well single windows and not any to well fitting with stove heat makes the situation a trying one for half clothed children to find in going among the Indians. There are 20 school children on Roundmaker so our seating capacity will be filled as I expect a full attendance when the snow is off the ground. The future looks bright and we are having good attendance we are a happy group among ourselves.\nI remain. Respectfully,\n\nyour obedient servant,\nMrs. Agnes Turney\n\nP.S. I am not complaining but I believe the Department should have the existing circumstances explained why the Poundmaker School is not more of a success, and the poor Indian children are therefore the losers.\n\nI intend to stay on as the Rev. & Sacomb wishes me to stay on the coming year and promises a better protection from the severe winter we have here in this country.\n\nYour O.S.\n\n456475\nOttawa, March 9th, 1914\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., in which you state that you incurred some expense in obtaining wood for the Poundmaker's school.\n\nThe Department will reimburse you for your expense in this matter if you forward, through the agent, duplicate accounts for the wood purchased. When sending these accounts, kindly enclose the receipts received by you from the party from whom you purchased the wood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst.

School Room\n\nThe nave of the mission church is utilized as class-room. The building is quite cold; and the box heater situated in the center is sufficient to heat the room only in moderate weather. Fortunately, there has been only about three weeks of very severe weather thus far this winter.\n\nThe church is by no means central for the school population of the reserve, being about half a mile from one extremity and about two and a half from the other.\n\nIt is, however, a decided convenience for the teacher to be able to occupy the mission dwelling, where also the children's noon meal is prepared and served.\n\n6. Equipment and School Material.\n\nThe desks are quite old, home-made and not being fastened to, the floor are quite unsteady. As no writing is done with pen the need for an absolutely steady desk is not so much felt.\n\nThe blackboard consists of painted lumber board leaned against the wall, and is of little advantage.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.J.

The bulk of the children are situated the same as at Littlepine, all within easy reach of the school, excepting a few stragglers who are not more than a mile or a half distant. This is a similar case to Moosomin, and I personally do not see the necessity of employing a teamster. If, however, the Department think otherwise, I consider that I should have some say in the employing of the teamster. I would like to employ Indians who owe accounts on our ledger and who are quite capable of performing the work.\n\nSgd. J. A.

(RG 10, Volume 6299, file 639-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIn connection with the schools of this Agency I wish to draw your attention to certain facts regarding them. We have gone into the matter of costs of the Day Schools and from the results produced have come to the conclusion that it would be advisable, both from the point of economy and from an educational standpoint to close some of these schools and have the children sent to the boarding schools. I am submitting figures dealing with this matter which prove that the costs to the Department per head is greatly on the increase and the results attained are on the decrease. Although my reports in the past have in some cases been favourable yet I do not consider that the progress made is in proportion to the cost.\n\nMoosomin Day School.- At this school the cost per head per annum for 1914-1915, 1915-1916 and from Sept. 1916-Sept. 1917 is as follows, $103.75, 151.40 and 176.72. The average attendance during the same periods was 9.86, 8.9 and 6. From this you will see that while in the period from March 1914-1915 the average cost per head was $103.75 it has now increased to $176.72, while the attendance has dropped from 9.86 to 6. From the June report of this year the number of children of school age in the vicinity of the school is given as 13, and the average attendance for the quarter is 4.2 out of 13 on the register. In looking over the attendance at this school you will find that out of the 13 on the register there were only three who attended more days.\nthan they were absent during the quarter. From all this it will be seen that the Indian parents on this reserve, with few exceptions, do not care whether the children attend or stay away from school. When the average cost per pupil attending school is taken into consideration the rate is far too high. The cost of educating the children at the Thunderchild Boarding School with the increased allowance during the war is considerably lower than at this school. The child attending the boarding school is making far more progress than the child who is attending the day school. He or she are regular attendants at school where in the day school the knowledge acquired today is lost through being absent for the next two or three days. I would therefore consider it advisable in this case to discontinue this school and enforce the compulsory act and compel the Indians to send their children to the boarding school.\n\nPoundmaker School.- At this school the cost per head for 1914-1915, 1915-1916, and from Sept 1916-Sept 1917 is as follows. $140.00, 141.35 and 175.00. The average attendance for the same periods has been 9.1, 10.3 and 8.5. You will see that the average cost has increased from $140.00 to $175.00 and the average attendance has decreased from 9.1 to 8.5. While the difference is not so noticeable in this school as in the Moosomin, yet the cost is away above what it should be in proportion to the results attained. In looking at the June returns of this school we find that there are seventeen in the vicinity of the school with an enrollment of fifteen and an average attendance of 7.6. At this school we find that there are only five who have attended more days than they were absent. The attendance only figures out at 50% which is far too low. In the case of this school it would be far more economical to close it up and either have the children placed in a boarding school or employ a driver and have them all taught at the Littlepine Day School.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6290, file 639-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRed Pheasant School.- The average cost per head for this school for 1914-1915, 1915-1916 and from Sept 1916-1917 is $73.80, $88.95 and $115.75. The average attendance for the same period was 25.75, 22.20 and 15.20. The average cost in this school has also increased and the average attendance has decreased. The average cost of $115.75 is however much lower than in the two previous mentioned schools. In the June report the number of children of school age in the vicinity of the school is given as 29 and the number on the register as 22 with an average attendance of 13.10 for the quarter. At this school there were 14 who attended more days than they were absent, during the quarter.\n\nLittlepine School.-The average cost of this school for 1914-1915, 1915-1916 and Sept. 1916-1917 was $126.00, $99.65 and $111.90 and the average attendance was 11, 13 and 11. There has not been the same changes in the average cost and attendance as in the other schools. While at this school the attendance has been fair the advancement made by the children has been poor. We trust that the new teacher who is taking the school over on the 1st of next month will show better results. In the June quarter the number shown on the register is 20 which includes all of school age in the vicinity of the school. The average is given as 8.75 which is below the average of the year but compares favourably with the average of 5.5 for the June quarter of the previous year. At this school there were nine who attended more days than they were absent.\n\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the average cost per head for the different schools varies considerably. While in the case of Moosomin and Poundmaker the average for the three years has reached the sum of $143.62 and $152.12 in that of Red Pheasant and Littlepine the average has been $92.83 and $112.52 and the cost of the schools for twelve months from Sept 1916 to Sept 1917 has been for\nMoosomin $176.72, Poundmaker $175.00, Red Pheasant $115.75\nand for Littlepine $111.90. In the comparison between the\nschools as regards the average costs, I have endeavoured\nto be as just as possible. The figures for Red Pheasant\nand Littlepine includes an allowance of $100.00 per year\nfor Field Matrons for preparing the noon meals, which is the\nsame as is allowed for Moosomin and Poundmaker. Red Pheasant\nSchool also includes in its cost the sum of $500.00 for\ntaking the children to school, which charge is not made\nagainst any of the other schools. In the case of Red Pheasant\nand Littlepine no rent was included as these schools are\nheld in Department buildings, while in the case of Moosomin and\nPoundmaker a charge of $240.00 and $300.00 per annum is in-\ncluded for rent.\n\nWere it possible I think it would be far\nmore beneficial to the children if the day schools were taken\naway from the partial control of the churches and placed en-\ntirely under Department control with graduated normal school\nteachers in charge. If it is not possible to do this I would\nrecommend as an alternative that the Moosomin and Poundmaker\nSchools be closed and the children of Moosomin of Catholic\nparentage be sent to the Thunderchild Boarding School and those\nof Protestant parentage to the Onion Lake Boarding School or\nsome other Anglican Boarding School. At the Poundmaker Reserve\nI think it would be either possible to send the Catholic\nchildren to the Thunderchild Boarding School or as I mentioned\nbefore employ a driver and have them all attend the Littlepine\nDay School. At the present time there are attending the Thunder-\nchild Boarding School, 5 children from Moosomin, 12 from\nPoundmaker and 10 from Red Pheasant. There are also 9 children\nfrom Red Pheasant at Onion Lake Boarding School and 2 at\nElkhorn. I think it would be a good rule to follow that when\nthe average attendance for the twelve months falls below 10\nthe Day School should be closed and some other disposition be made of the children. I have always urged the parents to send their children to the Day Schools but have met with poor results on the Moosomin and Poundmaker Reserves.\n\nIf this report should meet with your approval I would recommend that action be taken at once as regards the Poundmaker and Moosomin Schools.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDuncan C.

Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the attached return I beg to advise you that this is the first intimation that I have had from Mrs. Tierney that she was resigning the position of teacher for the Poundmaker School. I visited this school on October 9th and she did not mention the matter to me, although she closed the school two days later.\n\nI have also had a letter today from Rev. Father Watelle advising me that Mrs. Tierney had left the school and that he was looking around for another teacher. You will note that there are only eight children attending the school out of fourteen in the vicinity of the school and that the average attendance is six. I consider that this school has passed the stage where it is advisable to keep it open any longer.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Agent's Report on Poundmakers Day School for the month of September, 1917. Original on 117052-7\n\nThe attendance of this school is on the decrease and no progress is being made. Since my last visit to this school Mrs. Tierney has discontinued teaching at this school without giving this office any notification. I was at this school yesterday and there was nobody about the place. I am writing to Rev. Father Wattelle, whom I understand is in charge of the Catholic Missions in this agency.\n\n(Sgd.) J. A. Rowland,\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 16, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, informing the Department of the resignation of Mrs. Tierney of the Poundmaker Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of the very unsatisfactory attendance at this school, the Department has decided not to re-open it and it is not necessary, therefore, for you to make arrangements to secure another teacher.\n\nIt would be cheaper to place the children who attended Poundmaker's school in a residential school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. A. Rowland, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDelmas, Sask. November 15, 1917.\n\nMr Duncan Scott, Deputy Superintendent General, of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI ask of you to approve of the appointment of Mr John M. Seeber, as teacher on Ponemah reserve, Battleford Agency, in place of Mrs Tierney, having left the School on the 15th of October, for reason of health.\n\nMr John M. Seeber, born in Ontario, 45 years old, married, his wife alive, without children, has been a long time a store-keeper. He has no diploma, but possesses all the other qualifications of instruction and morals to make a good teacher. Mrs Seeber, his wife, will cook for the children, and will attend at their meals.\n\nMr John M. Seeber has started teaching on the 15th of November under the condition of his appointment to be approved by the Department, what is asked by the present.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Watelle, in which he asks the Department to approve of the appointment of Mr. John M. Seeber as teacher of the Poundmakers School and states that Mr. Seeber started teaching on the 15th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as Mr. Seeber has commenced teaching at this school, his temporary appointment is approved of and he will be paid at the rate of $600.00 per annum for his services. His retention in the position will depend on the attendance and the progress the pupils make in their studies and you will be good enough to inform him and Father Watelle accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

November 27, 1917.\n\nMr Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I am informed that it has been decided by the Department to close the Day-School on Poundmaker Reserve under the consideration that it will be cheaper to place the children of that Band in the Boarding School, and with a better result for their instruction and education,\n\nConsequently I ask of the Indian Department to allow me to receive the children of that Band in the Thunderchild St Henry's Boarding School (Delmas), by increasing the number of pupils from forty, allowed at the present time, to fifty.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThunderchild St Henry's Boarding School, Delmas, Sask. Nov. 27, 1917\n\nMr Duncan Scott, Deputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter of the Agency, in which the Agent states that it has been decided to close the day-school on Poundmaker Reserve, under the consideration that it will be cheaper to place the children of that Band in the Boarding School. Not being aware that such a decision was to be taken I could not express my opinion, and I beg to express it now:\n\nMy opinion, based on my own experience of twenty years, is that the Day-Schools on the reserves make no good at all to the Indians, and it is money expended for nothing in keeping these schools. Speaking only of the schools I know, I dare to say that there is more good done to the children in two weeks in our Boarding School than in an entire year in the Day-Schools.\n\nWith such an opinion you will understand that I cannot but be pleased with the decision taken, but kindly let me object to the immediate execution of it under the following considerations:\n\n1) At the request of the Agency I have made arrangement to fill the position left by the last teacher, Mrs Tierney. A new teacher has been procured, and has started teaching, and so not caring to look for another position for the present winter. He has made expenses to come to the Reserve with his wife.\n2) It is stated that the children of that Band will not be deprived of a school, being to be placed in the Boarding School, but that decision taking me by surprise, I do not see how I could find accommodation to receive these children before next Spring.\n\nIn consideration of the circumstances as explained above I beg to make the suggestion that the execution of the decision should be postponed until the 1st of April next.\n\nKindly let me hear from you if you agree with the suggestion.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6299, file 639-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI beg to enclose herewith two letters from Rev. Father Watelle, who is at the head of the Roman Catholic Indian Missions in this agency, which deal with the education of the Poundmaker Indian children.\n\nI had quite a long talk with the Rev. Father on the subject and he was quite pleased with the decision of the Department and was heartily in accord with them regarding the closing of the day schools.\n\nThe appointment of the teacher to the Poundmaker School was made and he had started his work before we received word from the Department requesting that it be closed. As stated in the Rev. Father's letter he has no accommodation at the present time for these children at the Boarding School and will not have until the Department grants permission to increase the number from forty to fifty, when it is his intention to enlarge the school.\n\nUnder the circumstances I think it advisable in the interests of the Poundmaker children to keep the day school open until April 1st, provided that Mr. Seeber is capable of filling the position. I intend to visit the school shortly when I shall form an opinion on the qualifications of Mr. Seeber.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nExtract from Report of Inspector W. Murison,\ndated Sept. 16, 1920, on the Battleford Agency. Original\non 427021-5.\n\nPOUNDMAKERS DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis day school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. The church building is being used as a school being rented for that purpose.\n\nMr. J. M. Seiber is in charge as teacher. I passed the school in the forenoon on my way around the reserve and noted that there were eight children attending that day. They looked clean and tidy. I visited the school shortly after four o'clock but the children and teacher had gone, therefore, I did not meet him. There are 13 pupils enrolled, 8 boys and 5 girls. The average attendance for the June quarter is 5.38 which is unsatisfactory. The class standing is 9 in Standard I and 4 in Standard II, which is not a good showing. Apparently the Indians are not much interested in their day school.\n\nW. Murison\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 22, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo informing the Department that Mr. M. B. Edwards has resigned as teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School, his resignation to take effect from the last day of September, and also enclosing a copy of a report which you received from Mr. Agent Macdonald, in which he advises the closing of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the Agent's recommendation, which is approved by yourself, this school may remain closed for the present. Your suggestion that the children from this reserve be sent to the Brandon Industrial School will receive consideration.\n\nWith reference to the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve I beg to say that the Department is including in the estimates for submission to parliament at the next session an increase of forty in the pupilage at the Thunderchild's Boarding School, and, if this item is approved, the children of school age on the Poundmaker's Reserve can be placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School. With the new addition, which is just about ready for occupation, this school will be able to provide adequate accommodation for ninety children and the grant will be increased to that number, but will not be available until April 1st, next. In the meantime the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve is to remain open. I shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Agent Macdonald accordingly.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give the necessary instructions to those concerned for the placing of all the children of school age who are Roman Catholics and in good health in the Thunderchild's Boarding School after the first of April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It has been decided to close the day school on the Poundmaker's Reserve at the end of the present quarter, namely, June 30th, next. You will be good enough to notify the teacher, Mr. J. M. Seiber, that his services will not be required after that date.\n\nAs you were also informed in the letter above referred to, the Department desires that the children of the Poundmaker's reserve be placed in the Thunderchild's Boarding School. You will be good enough to notify the principal of this school of the increased pupilage allowed, and the Department will expect you to assist the principal in every way possible to recruit for the Thunderchild's Boarding School, the children of school age on the Poundmaker's Reserve who are in good health.\n\nApplication forms and certificates of health should be forwarded for all children who are to be admitted to this school.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will give this matter your early attention and inform the parties interested accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Day\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 18th\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to bring your attention to the fact that no tenders are being called for the erection of a school on the Reserve of Poundmaker. You must be aware, and it is plainly stated in the annual reports of the Department of Indian Education, that there is no school in the Battleford agency that needs more to be remedied than the school at Poundmaker. I am glad to see that a good school is to be built at Little Pine, but in some time I don't understand why nothing is to be done for Poundmaker. The school at Little Pine is in a far better condition than the one at Poundmaker, and if the Department is not ready to build at once on both Reserves, I should think that it would be best to build first at Poundmaker. I am satisfied that...\nat Ottawa you are far from being duly informed of the state of affairs in the Battleford Agency. I never wrote to you about that school because I had the promise of Mr. A. Rowland that he would see to it himself, and I am convinced that he never mentioned it.\n\nSo I would beg you, Sir, to take this matter into consideration and to give us satisfaction.\n\nYours,\n\nE. Lacombe\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nE. Lacombe\n\n433192\nOttawa, April 1, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th ultimo in reference to the erection of a new school building on the Poundmakers Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department was aware that this building is not in the best condition and some minor repairs were made to it two years ago. The school, however, has not been as successful as might be desired and a number of the children of school age are enrolled at the Thunderchild's Boarding School, which school will likely continue to draw a large part of its attendance from this reserve. In view of this the advisability of making any large expenditure in connection with these buildings is doubtful. If, however, it is the wish of the church authorities to continue the day school on the Poundmakers Reserve and endeavour to improve it and if the assurance is given the Department that in the event of expenditure being incurred more competent teachers will be nominated the matter of erecting a day school building will be given consideration.\n\nIn your letter you refer to the erection of a new building on the Little Pines Reserve and I may here state that this action is taken by the Department in view of the closing of the Battleford Industrial School, otherwise the old building would have had to serve for sometime yet.\n\nRev. E. Lacombe, O.M.I.,\nDelmas, Sask.\nI shall be pleased to hear from you in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st inst., I beg to state that it is the wish of the Church authorities to continue the day school on the Pauindawas Reserve and to endeavour to improve it by appointing only qualified teachers.\n\nWe expect that the department will see at once that a new school be built on Pauindawas Reserve in same time as our little ones, so as to avoid bad feelings between the two reserves.\n\nBelieve me, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Lacombe\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department endeavours, if possible, to find teachers with professional qualifications, that is those who have had pedagogical training either in the model or normal schools in some of the provinces and for teachers with such qualifications the Department allows salaries ranging from $500.00 to $700.00 per annum, where there are children to justify the payment of such an amount.\n\nOwing to the location of many of our reserves and the lack of boarding and lodging accommodation it is sometimes very difficult to secure qualified teachers, but it is often possible to obtain the services of competent persons with advanced scholastic qualifications and imbued with an interest in Indian work, to whom the Department is prepared to allow salaries of from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum, although they have not had professional training.\n\nYour communication of the same date in reference to the erection of a day school building has also been received, but, as no provision has been made in the estimates this year for this purpose, the Department cannot undertake the work this season.

I am ready to undertake the repairs myself provided the Department be willing to pay me a monthly rent of $25.00 for the use of the two buildings. I will put on a new roof on the teachers residence and will also put on a new floor, storm windows, storm doors and will have the house banked properly before the cold weather. I will also fix the school so that it be warm and comfortable, and give a coat of paint to the desks.\n\nHoping you will recommend the matter to the Department as soon as possible,\n\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly\n\nE.

At the present time they are taking it from a well dug on the river bank, and the water filters in from the river.\n\nMr. or Mrs. Tierney never asked me for pay for water until someone informed them that the other schools were having water supplied at the expense of the Department.\n\nYours Obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

Rowland,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nConsidering the great inconvenience of having the water hauled from Mr Tierney's place and the expenses that it necessitates, I wish you would impress on the Department that it is necessary to have a well dug in the proximity of the Poundmaker School. Already I have begun the work and we are down about 17 feet deep in a place where we are sure to find good water at a depth of between 30 and 35 feet, according to an expert in the matter. So far I have incurred all the expenses, but my finances don't permit to finish it. If the Department would take upon themselves to finish that well, it would be a saving of much money and would give better satisfaction to the teaching staff of the Poundmaker School.\n\nHoping that you will take this letter into consideration,\n\nI am, dear sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"signed\"\n\nE. Lacombe O.M.I.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nBattleford, Sask.,\n\nSeptember 27th 1916\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I have received a letter from Rev. P. Lacombe, a copy of which is here attached, asking for assistance in sinking a well for the use of the Poundmaker School.\n\nI do not think that it is advisable for the department to assume this expense, as the Catholic Church are receiving twenty dollars a month for the rent of these buildings and should provide a well at their own expense.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 10, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo enclosing a copy of a communication from the Rev. E. Lacombe asking for assistance in sinking a well for the use of the Roundmaker School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will make an allowance of $25.00 towards sinking this well and you will be good enough to inform Father Lacombe accordingly. This is all the Department is prepared to allow for this purpose. When this well is finished no further payments will be made for water for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

It is an old frame house with foundation crumbled away, door and windows decayed and roof leaks badly. The building was struck with lightning at one time leaving a hole over the only space where a bed can be placed.\nthe summer rains flow freely in, also\nthe winter snow drifts through.\nThe kitchen floor is badly worn and,\nin splinters. The door sills are worn\naway and one can slip their finger\nbetween the door and casing.

When the Department establishes the proposed new improved Day Schools on the Poundmaker and Little Pine Reserves, I consider that the most practical and economical manner would be to build one School House mid-way between these two Reserves, with two separate Class-rooms, and one room for the noon meal; this plan I think, would prove to be very convenient and facilitate the work of operating these two Schools.\n\nI am returning herewith the lithographed Plan of Poundmaker Reserve, shewing the location of the Houses and the number of children in each.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

Dollars as the present value of the building.\n\nThe Committee claim the building originally cost within a fraction of $1300.\n\nI informed Mr. Robson the claim for rent from 1st July 1889 at $50. per annum, at this late date, could not be entertained.\n\nI have etc.\n\n(sgd) J.B. Lash.\n\nThe,\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 9th ultimo; and to transmit herewith as requested the original report referred to in Memo: on Voucher No. 3491, issued in favour of the Rev. Thomas Hart to extinguish the interest of the Presbyterian Church in the building formerly used as a school house on Pia-pot's Reserve.\n\nOn receipt of this report I communicated with the Church authorities, informing them of the result of the arbitration and that it was proposed to recommend to the Department the payment of $600.00. Their reply I desired to have awaited before issuing Voucher or making any recommendation, but I went away from Head Quarters and delay occurring relative to response from the Church authorities, Voucher was issued and sent to Department.\n\nIt now turns out that the Church refuses to accept the sum of $600.00, claiming that the building cost $1350.00, that $800.00, of that amount was contributed by the Church, and $450.00 by the Department, that on the assumption that the depreciation of the Government's share\n\nThe Deputy of the\nSupt. Gen'l of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nshare has been equal to that in the Church's share, the present value of their interest is $700.00.\n\nTo this they add rent for use of the building by Department from July 1st, 1899 to 10th October 1890, at the rate of $50.00 per annum, $62.50., making their claim in all amount to $762.50.\n\nI have therefore attached a Voucher for that amount because the Church is determined to insist upon its claim, and it is difficult to see upon what grounds it can be successfully resisted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nbe considered until the information already stated as not having been received is received, also some information as to the material used in the construction of the building as there is nothing stated in reference thereto in the agreement which accompanied the plan of the building.\n\nJ.M.\n\nI think the Governor should be informed of this difference.\n\nJ.M.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Feb. 20th 1891\n\nI beg to report in connection with the Comm's letter of the 5th instant re the amount asked by the Presbyterian authorities for a building erected on Papato Res. by them with assistance to the amount by the Dept. \u00a3845-0.00 for a schoolhouse, that the calculations as to the proportion of the present value of the building which they claim they are entitled to and also as to the rent allowance are correct. The building since the closing of the school has been used as a dwelling house by the farm instructor but no information appears to have been received from the Comm's that the building was suitable for a dwelling house and the amount of present asked by the Presbyterian Authorities \u00a38700.00 together with the amount granted towards\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo\n\nOttawa, 18\n\nthe erection of the building would be a large amount (1150.00) to expend for a farm house if it was not well suited for such and conveniently situated in reference to the other farm buildings.

Crombie Esq.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nPrince Albert\nSask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou came and see your people here on June last. They were asking for assistance to speak for them. They were wanting a school and also a stallion. Because they were promised to them a school to be in their reserve. The first time we were in the reserve one was build and the former instructor shut it. He married the woman who was teaching school. The Indians hardly send their children then, they were not yet civilized. They did not no, that the school was the best thing for them. And today they are very sorry. That's the reason why...\nThey are wanting the school stove in the reserve. I will tell you how the Indians are that this. Because the school is far away they are on the road for two days to see their children. For two days absence some animals die of their own. And when their children are they don't allow them to bring them home and they stay long at school. And where that school is now all these surrounding reserve bring all kinds of sickness because they go there to see their children. And so as to avoid that they want a school to be erected in their own reserve. And about this Stallion. You were counting all the mares in Papot Reserve. You know that they had no girls.\nThat's the reason why they were asking for a stallion because they pay a big price for one horse. Because the Indians have not enough money to buy horses. This therefore\n\nThis is my tale to the inspector of Indian Agencies, I was want to you to answer this letter. The address.\n\nMr. Headman\nPiapot Reserve\nWheatwyn P.O\nSask\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith letter received by me from Mr. Headman, Piapot Reserve, Wheatwyn P.O., Sask., which speaks for itself.\n\nIt will be noted that reference is made by me to the question of stallion in my report of inspection on Qu'Appelle Agency made in July 1916, under heading \"Indian Horses\", paragraph 20.\n\nThe matter of schools is also referred to in Memorandum of Interviews and Meetings with members of Bands of Qu'Appelle Agency, attached to my report of inspection. When these people spoke to me regarding the question of having day schools on the reserves I pointed out to them the fact that when they did have day schools I understood they were not a success owing to the fact that the Indians themselves did not give them the necessary support by having their children attend school regularly. I also pointed out to them that the Department, by way of education, had done far more for them than had been agreed in the original treaty and that, so far as Boarding Schools were concerned, they were served by the best schools in the country.\n\nI would ask that you kindly communicate with Mr. Headman in reply to letter herewith.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, February 27, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing a communication from Mr. Headman, Piapot Reserve, in reference to matters on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the question of securing a stallion will be dealt with in a separate communication and Mr. Headman is being informed that the Department is unable to open a school on this reserve at present.

When the time comes to provide for the education of these children, the Department will be prepared to erect them a modern day-school building and engage the services of a competent, qualified teacher.\n\nOwing to the favourable situation of these people, the Department considers that an efficient day school would meet their educational requirements. Furthermore, Indians are well advanced in civilization and permanently attached, as they are, the Department does not think it politic to separate children from their parents by lengthy periods of residence in boarding or industrial schools but on the contrary wishes to keep the home ties intact.\n\nThe Indians and the Churches interested may be assured that the policy the Department has decided to pursue in this matter is:\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Of course I am counting on the Department insisting that Industrial and Boarding Schools shall not draft children from this Colony.\n\nI doubt very much whether it will be necessary to arrange to furnish a mid-day meal to the children of this school, as their homes are in every case, nearly as good as Whites and I think they should carry their lunch to school as the white farmers' children do.\n\nA trained nurse would be a grand thing. In addition to attending to the sick she should go visiting the different homes on the Colony, and in fact on the reserve generally, and instruct the women in housekeeping, house-cleaning, etc., etc.\n\nI almost think it would be better to have a lady teacher and a nurse live together and give them a boy to look after the pony, etc.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"F.M.

The children of the colony are young and it is considered that their interests would not suffer, should a school not be provided till 1911.\n\nBe good enough to let the Department have your views on this matter.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter above quoted with reference to the establishment of a school at File Hills Colony, and in reply to say that I think the matter of building a school at this point could well be deferred until 1911, in fact it was my intention to write the Department recommending this course, as my time will be fully taken up with the File Hills Boarding school buildings, the Day school at the Assiniboine Agency, the residence for the teacher at Touchwood Hills and a lot of other extra work besides the usual Inspections.\n\nI quite agree with the Department that the interests of the children of this Colony will not suffer for another year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Qu'Appelle.\n\nFebruary 21st, 1911.\n\nLetter No 7820.\n\nSir:\n\nI am somewhat surprised to be informed by Mr Inspector Graham, that in view of a public day school being established on the Colony at File Hills, I am forbidden to recruit there.\n\nI beg to be informed if the prohibition would prevent me from accepting children of our ex-pupils when brought here, as there are now and will be vacancies.\n\nI would also wish to be further informed if the catholic ex-pupils will be compelled to send their children to the public day school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 8, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo with reference to recruiting for the Qu'Appelle Industrial School from the File Hills Colony.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the ex-pupils of this colony, whose children are now coming of school age, were anxious that a day school should be established and, as they are all well-to-do, have comfortable homes and are conveniently situated, the Department thought it well to meet their wishes. The appointment of the teacher and management of this school will be in the hands of the Department.\n\nI here wish to review briefly the reasons which actuated the Department in coming to the decision as above outlined. As you are aware the establishment of this colony has been a pronounced success, due largely to the excellent training received by the parents while pupils at the different boarding and industrial schools and constant and close supervision exercised by officials of the Department interested. Many of the homes in the colony compare favourably with those of settlers similarly situated and their outbuildings, stock and implements are a credit to them.\n\nAt the outset the residential schools filled a need in giving industrial training to these Indian colonists, but, as conditions now exist, the second generation are in an altogether different position. The training of girls in household work\n\nRev. J. Hugonard,\nPrincipal,\nQu'Appelle Industrial School,\nLobet, Sask.\nwork and the boys in agriculture can be accomplished at home, as is the case with the children of white people, and the Department will provide for the secular education by establishing a day school under the charge of an efficient, qualified teacher.\n\nAnother very important feature of this policy as viewed from the standpoint of the Department is that the home-ties will remain intact. In the past the severance of these ties in the interests of the children was unavoidable, but owing to the standard of civilization attained by these colonists there is now no necessity for removing children from their homes in order that they may be brought within the influences exerted by a residential school.\n\nAs the number of children of school age is as yet limited and in order that every opportunity might be given the parents to make a success of the school in so far as attendance is concerned it was considered advisable to prohibit the recruiting of these children by the boarding and industrial schools of any denomination and no admission to residential schools, will, therefore, be considered, unless in special cases where good reasons can be shown why the children cannot take advantage of the day school.\n\nIt is not the intention to use compulsion in this matter, but it is thought that if facilities are placed within their reach most, if not all, of these Indians will send their children to the day school within easy reach of their homes. In the meantime, however, until such time as the school is ready to commence operations no recruiting will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg to say that many white people, who have means, send their children to residential schools in order to obtain a better secular, moral and religious training and they do not consider that the severance is a breaking of the home-ties.\n\nThe convent schools are particularly appreciated by white people of all denominations and if so many of those people consider that they have not the time nor ability for the moral and religious training at home, how much more incapable are the Indians and even the ex-pupils to do the work.\n\nIf the catholic of the colony are not allowed to come here but are compelled to attend a school in which the Department intends giving secular education only, then, for catholics, the case becomes a very important religious question, for the position of catholics as regards public schools is well known in as much as they erect and maintain Separate and Parochial schools so that their children may receive in them not only a secular education but a moral and religious one as well and one which cannot be given at home.

That training is, therefore, is to be left to the Indians and \"the Department will provide for the secular education by establishing a day school under the charge of an efficient, qualified teacher\".\n\nAnd to compel the success of this new system, regardless of\nwhat the wishes of the Indian parents may be, their children are debarred entrance to boarding and industrial schools (maintained at great public expense for the education of Indians) even before the day school is ready to commence operations.\n\nThe new policy enunciated by the Department of Indian Affairs is that the boarding and industrial schools must give way to day schools, and that those day schools are to be secular.\n\nIt is a doctrinaire policy; and, apart altogether from the religious and constitutional phases of the subject, one that should be very thoroughly canvassed by men of practical experience in Indian educational work and of large and long acquaintance with Indian conditions before being adopted as the Indian educational policy of the Government of Canada.\n\nResidential schools have been and are being established for the training of the sons of our farmers in farming, cattle raising and dairying and of the girls in farm-house economy, which experience has slowly convinced us cannot adequately be imparted in the homes of a race civilized for centuries.\n\nBut the Department of Indian Affairs concludes that it has brought certain of the aborigines to such a degree of civilisation and culture that what cannot be done in the homes of white farmers can be done in the homes of red-men, while it supplies in public schools secular education for the Indian children.\n\nNow, I am in hope that this departure from practice of the department of Indian Affairs is not all a new policy entered upon without public discussion and without the knowledge or consent of Parliament which is charged with the trusteeship of the Indian ward of the nation and which provides the funds for the education of the Indian children of Canada.\n\nComing to the religious question I beg leave to say that, in Canada, is has never before been seriously questioned that moral training should be a part of the curriculum of the Indian schools. The different religious denominations working among Indians conduct denominational religious schools. No authoritative pronouncement has ever been made by such denomination against such system and in favor of the substitution of secular system.\nAnd you know yourself, Honourable and Dear Sir, that when you called at Ottawa a meeting of the representatives of the different bodies in charge of Indian education it was clearly declared and well understood that education would be denominational, so that we have heard with great surprise of the contemplated establishment of an Indian secular day school at Pile Hills.\n\nMoreover, the attitude of Catholics upon the general question of education is so well understood that it cannot for a moment be believed that they would acquiesce in such a system of Indian education as that now fixed upon by the Department of Indian Affairs. When they have contended unceasingly and universally for religious schools for whites, and have borne great burdens in certain portions of Canada to maintain them, Catholics could not be expected to acquiesce in the creation of a secular system of education for Indians. For if they contend for religious schools for the children of peoples civilized for ages they must, with ten-fold force, insist upon the maintenance intact of the long established, well tried and well accounted for system of religious schools for Indians, advanced a little today but yesterday savages.\n\nI am so confident in your spirit of justice and fair play that I will take the liberty of adding that, fortunately, the law is on our side.\n\nParliament, among its early decrees, enacted that Indian education should be denominational. The law is still on the Statute Book. Sub-sections 2 and 3 of Section 97 of Chapter 81 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, provides as follows:\n\n\"2. If the majority of the band belongs to any denomination the teacher of the school established on the reserve shall belong to the same denomination.\n\n\"3. The protestant or Catholic minority of any band may, with the approval and under regulations made by the Governor in council, have a separate school established on the reserve.\n\nAssuredly, Honourable and Dear Sir, the Department of Indian Affairs cannot, in the very face of the law, intend to inaugurate a system of schools for Indians in any way at variati-\nce with the policy of those enactments by establishing secular day schools for Indians and even going as far as prohibiting the admission of Indian children of a certain territory into residential schools existing under State Regulations maintained by Parliament.\n\nWhat we humbly ask, just now, in the name of the constitutional rights of Indians is that the Department of Indian Affairs suspends its course of establishing that secular day school at File Hills and that the prohibition of admission of Indian children of this district to the Industrial school at Qu'Appelle be withdrawn.\n\nHoping that the course entered upon at File Hills Reserve, by the Department of Indian Affairs will be reconsidered and that the clouds threatening not only Qu'Appelle Industrial school but all the Indian Industrial Schools shall be dispelled, I remain,\n\nHonourable and Demz Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Protestant or Catholic minority of any band may, with the approval and under regulations made by the Governor in Council, have a separate school established on the reserve.\"\n\nAssuredly, Honourable and Dear Sir, the Department of Indian Affairs, cannot, in the very face of the law, intend to inaugurate a system of schools for Indians in any way at variance with the policy of those enactments by establishing secular day schools for Indians and even going so far as prohibiting the admission of Indian children of a certain territory into residential schools existing under State Regulations maintained by Parliament.\n\nWhat we humbly ask, just now, in the name of the constitutional rights of Indians is that the Department of Indian Affairs suspends its course of establishing that secular day school at File Hills and that the prohibition of admission of Indian children of this district to the Industrial school at Qu'Appelle be withdrawn.\n\nHoping that the course entered upon at File Hills Reserve, by the Department of Indian Affairs will be reconsidered and that the clouds threatening not only Qu'Appelle Industrial School but all the Indian Industrial Schools be dispelled,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The statement shows the total number of residents, the number of children in each family and their ages and sex, and the religious denomination of the parents. It also shows the number of ex-pupils who have entered the Colony since it was started and the number of births and deaths that have taken place; this latter information was not asked for but I thought it would prove interesting to the Department.\n\nYou will observe that this Colony is growing very rapidly. There are 91 souls on it at present and I expect to start up eight or ten new members this Spring, so that by midsummer it will reach the hundred mark or over.\n\nI am also return the blue print you sent me, with the locations of the different individuals indicated on it. The site of the proposed school is also marked.\n\nI would call your attention to the fact that the following Indians who are members of Peepeekisis Band but not school boys, reside on this Colony; most of them were there before the Colony was started,\u2014Flag, 2; Fisher, 2; Noostatik, 2; G.

It has been decided, however, to erect a residence which will provide quarters eventually for both a teacher and a nurse and it is considered that one of the rooms in this building will provide adequate accommodation for the children who will attend at least during the first year, as a nurse will not be appointed at the outset. The plans and specifications submitted by you for a combined residence and hospital are approved and I have to ask you to be good enough to obtain two additional copies of the specifications and three additional copies of the plans. One set of the plans and specifications should be kept by you and the other two forwarded to the Department for transmission to places where they will be put on view for prospective tenderers.

Conditions should be favorable for the opening of this school at the time you suggest, and I will be on the look out for a competent teacher. If one is not found before the end of June it would be advisable to advertise for one.\n\nThe prospects for a large attendance at this school are not so good as they were at one time owing to the rescinding of the Department's instructions regarding the recruiting of children from the Colony by Industrial and Boarding schools. However there should be eight or ten who will go when the school is opened and it will only be a matter of a couple of years before this number is doubled as there are a lot of young children who will soon be of school age. The matter of conveying these children will have to be dealt with. I would suggest that the Department buy a team of quill ponies and a democrat and one of the Indians could be engaged to do the driving at a small cost.

The question of erecting a school-house has not been definitely decided upon, but, as the building containing two hospital wards and living rooms is now ready for occupation and as there is work for a nurse and field matron, I think it would be well to make an appointment as soon as possible.\n\nThe services of Miss Ida E. Collins, who was for sometime matron of the Carcross Boarding School, are available. She did good work while at Carcross both in the school and among the Indians in the vicinity and is at present engaged in the hospital on the Blackfoot Reserve at Gleichen, but this latter position would not appear to be congenial. Mr. Stockton, of the Auditor General's Department, who is well acquainted with Miss Collins and her work, states that she is a splendid woman, thoroughly interested in Indian work and competent as a nurse.\nnurse. He says that she has had a large experience in midwifery cases. I am of opinion that Miss Collins would be a suitable person for the Colony. We have very often great difficulty in obtaining the services of competent people for work of this kind and I think it would be well to get the hospital at File Hills into operation under Miss Collins at the earliest possible date, provided satisfactory arrangements can be made as to salary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

They realize that it might be probably two years before this request could be granted, but they are willing to undertake the support of their children if the Government will accede to their request for a school.

Cochrane, D.D., Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, requesting that a Day School be established for the File Hills Colony. I am also in receipt of the copy of Dr. Cochrane's letter to the Branch wherein he states that he has received a letter from Mrs. G.M. Lovesy, Home Mission Executive Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society, in this connection.\n\nIn reply, I delayed my answer to this letter because I first wanted to see Mr. Jones, the Indian Agent at File Hills, and Mr. Rhodes, the Principal of the File Hills School. After talking this matter over with the Principal and the Agent I have learned that two Indians on the File Hills Colony, Fred Dieter and David Bird, are behind the movement to build a Day School, and they are being upheld by the United Church Missionary there, Miss Ruth Lanigan. Apparently it was decided that this would be handled on the quiet so that the Agent and the Principal of the School would not know anything about it.\n\nAt the present time there are 16 children from the File Hills Colony attending the File Hills School. Mr. Rhodes informs me that only one will be discharged this term and several young children are entering the School in the Fall. Therefore in all probability when the School opens the File Hills Colony will have supplied one fifth of the pupils in attendance.\n\nI quite realize that our Branch have no intention of building a Day School at the Colony at the present time but I want to advise you that when the time comes, we will have to be prepared to build a Day School in the Qu'Appelle Agency and the Crooked Lake Agency because the Indians in these two Agencies have been advocating Day Schools. Also, when we start building the Day Schools it will become necessary to close the File Hills.......\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nto close the File Hills, Cowessess, Round Lake, and Lebret Boarding Schools, as in my opinion I would not advocate running Day Schools and Boarding Schools in competition with each other in the same Agency.\n\nThere is no building on the File Hills Colony which would be suitable for a Day School.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the matter of Miss Lanigan, the Missionary, meddling in school affairs should be submitted to Dr. Cochrane.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, August 14, 1941.\n\nDear Doctor Cochrane:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 9th ultimo and official reply of the 15th ultimo, with reference to the request of the Home Mission Executive Secretary of the Women's Missionary Society, United Church of Canada, for the erection of an Indian day school on the File Hills Colony.\n\nAs pointed out in official letter of the 16th ultimo, it will not be possible to consider the erection of a school on this reserve during the current fiscal year.\n\nFor your information, I attach copy of a letter which has just been received from Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nReverend R.

Gillespie\nP.M. Abernethy\n\nPlans received.\nWE DO NOT SELL SLATE\n\nIssued by the Bangor Slate Association Incorporated\n\nIn the interests of the quarrymen operating workings on the celebrated BANGOR VEIN and for the benefit of the building public.\n\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nOf these various veins the Bangor Vein is the most famous. Along the vein lie eleven quarries, all operating and all turning out a parallel product. The No. 1 Clear slates, and the No. 1 Ribbon slates have for a great many years been standard roofing products, and \"Bangor\" has been a trade name of such enviable reputation that we find competitive companies with quarries more or less remote from this region, having their offices and getting their mail in Bangor.\n\nSlate is found in a number of regions of the United States: Pennsylvania, Maine, Vermont, New York, West Virginia, Maryland, Arkansas and California.\n\n* \"In 1908 Pennsylvania produced 61.89 per cent. of the slate in the United States and Northampton County produced 74.05 per cent. of the Pennsylvania output\n\n* U.S. Geological Survey. \"The Production of Slate in 1908\" by A.T. Coons.\nand 45.85 per cent. of the total quantity of the United States.\"\n\nBangor Vein Slate is distinctive. It is hardly to the point to go into the nice things that the various chemists and assayers of the Government say about it\u2014our only comment along that line is that the Federal authorities are using it.\n\nWe will say to you, however, that all the product is of a uniform blue black; that it has some lustre; that it is tough to a degree which is far in excess of the requirements of even extraordinary usage; that it is non-absorbent taking up practically none of its bulk in exposure to the weather and less than one-fourth of one percent after a protracted immersion in water.\n\nAnd lastly\u2014and this is true of all slates\u2014it comes to the consumer unchanged except in form from its natural mineral state. It has no chemical treatment, no joints, no preservative preparations whatever, yet we can show you buildings which have been roofed with Bangor Vein Slate for sixty years and which still retain their architectural beauty and their protective value. In the British Isles, the real birthplace of the slate industry, there are roofs which have been in existence for hundreds of years and still give good service to the buildings which they shelter.\n\nThe average man who builds a house does so for all time. What he wants in his\n\n* The slate roof of the Saxon Chapel, Bradford-on-Avon, England, is 1,000 years old. This structure was built in the eighth century.\nconstruction are the best and most lasting materials which he can obtain at a reasonable price. Coupled with that he wants architectural beauty. Good looks in general architecture, in furniture, in carpets, in general equipment are all a practical necessity so long as the various articles can combine utility and wearing qualities with appearance.\n\nA certain amount of the original cost of an article must be charged off annually for depreciation. If you can buy a dining room table for fifty dollars and it lasts fifty years it costs you one dollar per year plus the interest on your money which is negligible\u2014but everyone recognizes the perishable qualities of furniture, both from intrinsic depreciation and from changing styles\u2014a new table for example every ten years isn't considered a hardship.\n\nBut\u2014in the matter of roofs, styles do not change and you want one on your house which is good looking, which will perform all the offices of a well behaved roof and which will show you the lowest net cost per year. A roof is in the nature of an investment. You want to put it on and forget it; you want it to look well tomorrow; you want it to keep the weather out and the warmth and dryness in; you want to be free from worry when the house in the next block which had a nice inflammable roof is showering sparks down on your own fire proof shelter.\n\nYou don't want to hire a roofer every little while and coat the top of your house with mineral paint, or to patch up tears, solder leaks, and tighten interlocking joints\u2014the doubtful heritage of \"ready roofing.\" If you have a cistern, thereby utilizing nature's perfect distillery, you want the water in it to be free from taint and tar and pitch and paint and preservative chemicals. All these things a Bangor slate roof will do for you, Mr. Builder.\n\nAt top of next page you will find a schedule of the cost per annum of a slate roof and other roofs. It will pay you to look at it.\nThere is another thing that is sometimes argued against slate roofs: The great weight on the roof beams. The weight of any roofing known to the building arts is negligible when it is put on. A roof, whether it be wood or stone or shingles or tile, however, that retains loads of snow or ice or absorbs a large percentage of water, presents a varying load which will strain any construction. Slate strain is always constant\u2014it will not retain loads of snow and ice and even when immersed in water will absorb less than one-fourth of one percent of its gross weight. Don't be deceived by the \"great weight fallacy.\"\n\nThe foregoing has been addressed to a certain class\u2014and you would be surprised to know how small that class is\u2014those who do not know about Bangor Slate. We are now going to address ourselves to the majority of our readers.\n\nDo you know, Mr. Builder, or Mr. Architect, or Mr. Roofer, that there is a way by which you can always tell whether you are getting Genuine Bangor Vein Slate when you order it? Do you know that there are unscrupulous persons who will substitute an inferior grade of Pennsylvania Slate with a corruption of our trade mark on it, to their own profit and to your detriment? Such a condition is existant and while we appreciate the subtle flattery of the imitation we don't like the reflection on our own perfect product.\n\nEvery square of Certificate Slate that leaves Bangor\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nis accompanied by our inspection Certificate, and the quarries as well as this Association stand back of it. This Certificate is attached to the bill of lading, and when your local dealer receives his shipment he can show you that you are getting what you ordered.\n\nIn the back of this booklet, opposite the names of the quarries where you can secure our product, is a fac-simile of our Certificate. Cut it out or remember it for reference when you get ready to order slate.\n\nNow a word as to our Structural Slate. These large slabs come from the same quarries as do the roofing slates. They have the same characteristics and the same virtues. They are used in a thousand ways in interior construction. Your laundry tubs, your mantels, your kitchen steps, shower baths, sinks and pantry shelves all can be made of sanitary non-absorbent slate which will last forever and serve you well during all that time.\n\nWrite for our instructive booklet telling you how to use structural slate. It will save you money and give you absolute, lasting satisfaction.\n\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nBLACKBOARDS of the highest known standard are made from Bangor Vein rock. Strength is a highly desirable quality in a Slate Blackboard which is often in size four by six or even seven feet and not over 3/8 in. thick. The wonderful elastic quality of the Bangor Vein rock gives it strength and quality possessed by no other slate while its close grain and unfading color gives it a lasting surface equalled by no other rock. Discerning buyers always insist upon getting Bangor Slate Blackboards which command the highest market prices.\n\nThis Association is in a position to mail information with regard to the many uses of slate for both the roof and the interior of buildings gratis, on receipt of request. We want you to look into the matter as deeply as possible. We know\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nwe can convince you; the further you look, the better you will like it.\n\nAnd one thing more\u2014We call our slate by its full name\u2014Genuine Bangor Certificate Slate, and have our friends to thank for the added shorter name, \"The Quality Slate.\" One of our constituents advertises, \"The Roof that Outlives the Building,\" and it does as surely as native stone will outlive wood, cement, brick, mortar and metal.\n\nTo sum up\u2014WHY does Bangor Slate enjoy a World-Wide reputation for Superior Qualities and WHY has it so Many Imitations?\n\nBECAUSE it makes the best Roofing Slate, Structural Slate and Slate Blackboards.\n\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nBECAUSE it is a Strong Slate, being Long Grained and possessing an Elastic Quality not in the makeup of other slates.\n\nBECAUSE it is of Good Lasting Color and does not Fade Out as is the case with many Slates.\n\nBECAUSE it is Durable and will Outlast any other material in the building above the Foundation.\n\nBECAUSE the Producers of Bangor Slate are a Unit as to Progressive Methods, one of which is to exercise pride making up their Product in the best shape known to Practical People.\n\nBECAUSE these same Producers will handle your Slate Problems in a businesslike manner, making Your Slate Interests theirs, realizing that they have an Interest in every Transaction, which continues beyond the Sale of the Goods.\n\nThis Association does not sell Slate. Its mission is to Spread the Gospel of Good Slate. The Country is greatly lacking in Slate Knowledge and we know that Good\nBANGOR SLATE ASSOCIATION\n\nSlate, when its Merits are made known, will appeal to Thinking People. It is the Coming Material and we are proclaiming its Virtues.\n\nOur Doctrine is that all Slate is good. Only that there are Degrees of Goodness. If your Conclusions seem to lead You to use other than Bangor Vein Slate then we shall feel our Mission at least partly accomplished and you partly Converted. Start Wholly right, however and get Bangor Vein, then You will get the Slate which cannot but fully Satisfy.\n\nQuarries Operating on the Bangor Vein:\n\nThe Columbia Bangor Slate Co.\nBangor, Pa.\n\nE.

When Parliament meets and votes an appropriation and the same is made available the matter will receive prompt attention. It is expected that the money will be available about the end of this month.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Ferguson's request for the release of his security deposit, I have to inform you that it is not usual to return a security deposit until the contract is satisfactorily completed, but in view of the fact that the advance applied for can not be made this Department is requesting the Department of Finance to issue a cheque for the amount deposited. If the request is acceded to a cheque will be sent to you for Mr. Ferguson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.M.

The work on the building is not yet completed, but the Department owes Mr. Ferguson $2000.00, for which he has made application and which it is not possible to pay him, owing to lack of funds. In view of the circumstances I have the honour to request that you will release the security deposit in question in order that it may be paid over to the contractor. The Department will withhold the amount of security out of the balance due on the building until a report has been received to the effect that the work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAust.

Ferguson in connection with the contract awarded him for the erection of a teacher's residence at File Hills Colony, I beg to say that it is not possible for the executive officers of the Government to release securities in the manner suggested. Under an Order in Council passed on the 16th June, 1888, confirming a report made by the Deputy Minister of Finance, it is provided that \"hereafter all proceeds of cheques and all deposits on account of contractors' securities shall be deposited in the Government Savings Bank until the contract is completed, when the amount due with such interest as may have accrued under the rules governing a deposit in such Bank will be returned to the depositor.\"\n\nI think under the circumstances named in your letter that it would be quite reasonable to get an Order in Council authorizing the return of the security.

As intimated in letter to you of the 8th November, the Department of Finance was written to in the matter and a request made for the deposit. A reply has been received stating that an Order in Council was passed in June 1888, which prohibits such a course of action.\n\nIt is expected that the Department will have funds towards the close of the present month wherewith to pay outstanding accounts, and settlement will be made as promptly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Koeth,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan.\n\nFile Hills Indian Day School.\nFile Hills Colony Indian Day School.\n\nIn order to clarify the day school situation on the Peepeekisis Reserve, and in order to retain the names which have come to acquire significance with the Indians, it has been suggested that we refer to the two day schools as follows:\n\n(1) File Hills Day School - the school to be operated in the classroom block of the present residential school.\n\n(2) File Hills Colony Day School - the new building to be erected at the Colony and for which tenders are now being advertised.\n\nBefore finalizing these proposals, we would appreciate your comments in view of your knowledge of local conditions.\n\nIn answer to the points raised in your letter of June 17 you may take the following action:\n\n(a) The paint, cedar fence posts and pipe wire fencing can be stored at the Agency and used for day school purposes.\n\n(b) The Dalco lighting plant - This matter will be referred to the Agencies Division when we will write you further.\n\n(c) The sewing machines - These can be used in the day schools, as suggested.\n\n- It\nIt will also be necessary to refer the matter of the typewriter to the Agencies Division.\n\nIt is presumed that you have decided to have the present Principal's residence used for the teacherage at the Pine Hills Day School. It will probably be necessary to have a survey made of the property which will be required for day school purposes. Located on this property should of course be the school and teacherage.\n\nIn accordance with our practice elsewhere, it is presumed Mr. Ostrander and yourself will recommend that the remaining buildings and property be declared surplus to our requirements and sold through our Lands and Development Services Branch. Concerning the property you have of course two alternatives:\n\n(a) To add it to the present Indian reserve,\n\n(b) To arrange for its sale through the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nI would suggest you arrange locally with the United Church officials to continue in possession of the building until about August 15. They have been given permission to ship the furniture to other residential schools. This does not include the furniture in the principal's residence, which will of course be required for our day school teachers. After they vacate the building, it will be necessary to employ a watchman as otherwise there will be a serious outbreak of vandalism. Previous experience has convinced the Department of the necessity of acting quickly in these matters.\n\nBernard F. Berry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJune 28, 1949\n\nJ.P.B.

It is noted in the last paragraph of your letter that Superintendent Booth will write to us about the matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP:MMCN\nSEAL ED TENDERS addressed to the Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada, and endorsed \"Tenders for File Hills Colony Indian Day School(s)\", will be received until noon on August 5th, 1949, for the construction by contract of:\n\n1.

This will mean the school can not be completed before November.\n\nTherefore, every effort should be made to have the File Hills Day School ready for opening by September 1, 1949. I presume that the United Church has approached you concerning teachers for this day school.\n\nI am attaching application forms which you can have them complete and return here. I would ask that Mr. Booth give priority to the preparation of the File Hills School so that the Indians will not complain too much about the fact that the new day school will not be ready until November. It will be necessary to carefully consider the question of furniture for the teacher's residence. I attach standard list of items supplied for our day schools. Naturally, Mr. Booth will wish to review this list in conjunction with the items left by the staff vacating these quarters.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Corner of coat room. Provincial regulation would then compel us to put in a running water wash basin with two taps to allow for hot and cold water. The North East corner of Boys Cloak Room would be similarly made into a wash room with two flushing toilets, urinal and wash basin. The cubby corner upstairs marked \"Chem.Clos.\" would be enlarged to allow a built-in bath, toilet and wash basin. The Kitchen sink would of course be connected to hot and cold running water. All these fixtures would be properly connected under Provincial regulations to drain to cultivating chamber at Septic Tank where catch basin is shown on existing plan. The Sewage well is sufficiently large that it would not require emptying more than once in a month or two, but a little tiny portable gasoline pump is always provided by us in such cases to set on top of this well and as the water from sewage well is then pure and odorless it can be used to water flowers or vegetable garden or lawns or merely discharged at a distance on the ground. The entire additional cost is $3,400.00 including necessary pressure pump and tank, Septic Tank system complete and all installations in perfect working order.\n\nWe enclose a tracing showing suggested structural changes, which are of course also included.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 641-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nProposed Barn, File Hills Colony School\n\nWith reference to the above mentioned barn for the Colony Bay School I wish to report as follows.\n\nIt will now be necessary to consider the possibility of erecting a barn for the purpose of sheltering the horses, which the pupils use for travelling to and from school; there is no doubt that we should provide such shelter as the winters here are very often severe and we cannot let any horses stand outside as that is one of our main issues with the Indians, that all stock should be protected from the winter weather.\n\nI would recommend that a barn be built for 10 horses on a site adjoining the new school and that it be built on skids so as to enable us to move it at least once a year so that we can clean the place up more easily. It is the most difficult job to have the children keep the barn clean; in fact, I have never seen any Day School barn that at some time I had to hire an Indian to clean out. A barn being movable would facilitate this; I have discussed this matter with Regional Supervisor Ostrander and he is in accord with this type of barn.\n\nI am enclosing a requisition for this proposed barn also quotation from the Harvey Lunam Construction Co. on this building; I would strongly recommend that a barn be built this fall if at all possible; this company is prepared to commence work at once if their offer is accepted.\n\nFrank Booth, Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe File Hills Colony Day School.\n\nAs the construction of the above mentioned school is now well on the way, Mr Lunam, the contractor, has suggested that now would be the proper time to wire this building for electric power, as it could be all be built in, and there is no doubt that at some future time this work will be done and then the wiring would have to be built in at a greater cost and it would be wired on the outside instead of the inside of the walls. Mr Lunam has also quoted on a plant.\n\nIf the Department does not wish to, at the present time installed a plant, I would recommend that at least the wiring of the building, if at all possible, and then when an appropriate time the plant could be installed.\n\nI am enclosing quotations from the Harvey Lunam Construction Co.\n\nFrank Booth,\nSuperintendent.\nMr. Frank Booth,\nQuappelle Indian Agency,\nFt.

The cost of wiring the building while it is under construction will be much less than if we wire it at a later date. The contractors, Harvey Lunam Construction Company, quote a price of $859.25 for supplying materials and installing them in the school.\n\nWith regard to the barn, Mr. Ostrander points out that several of the children live a considerable distance from the school, and as a consequence, ride to school on horses owned by their parents. During the winter months it is necessary to have some accommodation for stabling these horses while the children are in school.\nThe Harvey Lunam Construction Company offer to erect a barn which Regional Supervisor Ostrander states would be satisfactory for an amount of $2,288.00. This includes both the material required and the erection of the barn.\n\nI would appreciate it if the Minister would approve acceptance of the above two tenders.\n\nDirector.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** MINES & RESOURCES  \n**BRANCH:** INDIAN AFFAIRS  \n**DATE:** December 9, 1949.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Harvey Lunam Construction Company, Regina, Sask., | $9,240.00 |\n\nIt would be appreciated if this cheque could be prepared and delivered to Mr. Phelan by 2:30 this afternoon.\n\nSTATE BELOW, WITH DETAILS IN EVERY CASE, WHETHER (a) STANDING ADVANCE, (b) ADVANCE FOR SPECIFIC JOURNEY\u2014ESTIMATING NUMBER OF DAYS, (c) OTHER ACCOUNTABLE ADVANCE, OR (d) AUTHORIZED PAYMENT.\n\nProgress Payment #2\u2014File Hills Colony Indian Day School.

Mr. Booth informs me that he submitted the matter to the Indians of the Peepeessis Band asking them to sign a resolution for the erection of the barn, with the cost being paid from Band funds, but that they refused. Assuming that there was possibly little hope in having the barn constructed from this year's Appropriation, Mr. Booth had taken no further action, as he intended to put an item in the Estimates for 1951-52 to cover the cost.\n\nIf funds can be made available, I would recommend that authority be granted for the construction of the barn from Appropriation this winter before Harvey Lunam Construction Company completes the two classroom Day School that they are now erecting. Indian children will be travelling some considerable distance in the winter with horses, and if we do not erect a barn, the horses will suffer while tied near the school with no shelter, in cold weather. Also if we do not erect a barn of this kind, the Indians will possibly erect two or three log shelters near the school and they will be very unsightly.\n\nJ.P.B.

Lunam Mgr.\nRegina, November 3rd, 1949.\n\nFrank Booth, Esq., Indian Superintendent, FORT QU'APPELLE,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nEnclosed are two copies of a letter from the Harvey Lunam Construction Company regarding the proposed barn for the File Hills Colony Day School, at a cost of $2,288.00, for your consideration.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Lunam has in mind the need for building a barn which can be easily moved to another site which, I believe, agrees with our discussion a few days ago in this office. It has occurred to me that as this barn is suggested for the benefit of the owners of horses which will be used to transport Indian children to and from the school, perhaps the band would be willing to pay the cost of it from their band funds.\n\nI suggest this because of the fact that it would be a good thing to have the barn built while Harvey Lunam's outfit is building the school, and I am sure that no funds have been provided in appropriation for the purpose.\n\nIf you think that the barn is badly needed, and you approve of the suggested method of construction, I would be glad if you would discuss it with the band to ascertain their views on the matter of the construction of it being a charge against their funds. If the band refuse to give you a resolution covering the cost of the building, and you so advise me, I shall communicate with the Department to see what possibility there is of having the barn built this year. If no funds can be made available, either from band funds or Appropriation, we may have to wait for two years because, as you are aware, no provision for it was made in your Estimates for next year.\n\nKindly give this your usual prompt attention.\n\nJ.P.B.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDuring my recent visit to Prince Albert, Mr. Jones brought to my attention that the 8 H.P. Diesel engine that was salvaged from the Lac La Ronge School, at the time of the fire, is stored at Lac La Ronge. I believe this motor is in first class condition and would therefore be suitable for power to drive a generating unit at a school where a 110 volt electricity was used with a bank of 56 storage batteries.\n\nI might suggest that if the Department would approve of purchasing batteries and a generator, this motor would be quite satisfactory for the power unit, if lights could be installed at the new, two room Day School and teacherage, which is nearing completion and known as File Hills Colony Day School on the Peepseekisis Reserve.\n\nIf the Department does not entertain the idea of furnishing electricity at this school, it could possibly be transferred to some other point where a motor of this size is needed.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nJanuary 30th, 1950.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Bldg.,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRe: File Hills Colony Indian Day School\nYour File 160-107/8-8\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, please forward a requisition for the batteries and generator recommended in your letter.\n\nWhen we have this requisition with your suggestion, it will receive further consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nRegina, February 3rd, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 30th ultimo, File 641-5 (El), regarding the installation of a lighting plant at the File Hills Colony Indian Day School.\n\nI have instructed Indian Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, to have the engine and generator brought in to Prince Albert from Lac la Ronge, and placed in the Department warehouse at Prince Albert, to be examined by Mr. Tegert, electrical technician, who is presently employed in Prince Albert wiring the Post Office Building for the North west Electric Company, under contract with the Harvey Lunam Construction Company.\n\nMr. Jones will forward me Mr. Tegert's report as to the condition of the engine and generator, and recommendation as to the set of batteries which would best serve. On receipt of the same, if I find that both the engine and generator are in good condition I shall submit requisitions for the cost of the batteries, cost of shipping, and installation.\n\nThe matter is rather urgent as the Harvey Lunam Construction Company are nearly finished with their contract of erecting this school, and were about to install a pump with a gasoline engine for pumping the water. If the electric power plant is to be supplied an electric pump would be substituted for the gasoline engine driven pump, and would be much more satisfactory. In the meantime, I have asked the Harvey Lunam Construction Company to delay the installation of the pump until I obtain authority for the installation of the electric plant.\n\nIf I could be given authority at this time to purchase the batteries recommended by Mr. Tegert, of the North west Electric Company, providing he finds the engine and generator in good shape, the installation could be expedited considerably. Kindly instruct me in this connection.\n\nJ.P.B.

We have simply been allowing sufficient to provide a hot drink.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are returning your requisition of February 1st.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 641-5, part 2)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a report received from D.N. Morrison concerning the condition of the Diesel Light plant salvage from the former Indian School at Lac la Ronge. Also enclosed is an estimate on the cost of the necessary repairs submitted by the North West Electric Company of Regina, who are experts on this type of plant.\n\nThis equipment is intended for installation at the File Hills Colony Day School and Teacherage and batteries for this school were purchased from last year's Appropriation. The batteries have been delivered at the school and in some manner the request for authority to have the Engine & Generator Unit repaired was over-looked.\n\nMr. Morrison has examined the unit and in his estimation all the listed repairs are necessary and the price quite reasonable. I would appreciate very much anything that could be done to rush this authority through.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nRegina, March 24th, 1950.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nREGINA,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nRe Fairbanks-Morse 10 H.P. motor, one generator, and panel, formerly installed at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, I inspected this motor and found it in a badly worn condition, and in need of extensive repair. The valve guide and valve stem show excessive wear. The valve, valve guides, and valve springs need replacing. The piston is badly scored and I would advise replacement. The crank shaft needs re-grinding and the connecting rods need to be re-metalled. The water pump needs reconditioning and various gaskets will be needed to complete the repair.\n\nFrom the condition of this engine I would also suggest that the fuel pumps be inspected and repaired before this engine is put into operation.

Cette \u00e9cole fond\u00e9e par le v\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u00e9funt Monseigneur Tach\u00e9, et depuis lors dirig\u00e9e par les Soeurs Grises de Montr\u00e9al, a beaucoup contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'am\u00e9lioration des nombreux Indiens qui visitent cette Mission. Cependant le manque de ressources financi\u00e8res a \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'ici le plus grand obstacle \u00e0 son d\u00e9veloppement. De l\u00e0\n\n1. Consid\u00e9rant que le Gouvernement ne refuse pas de venir en aide \u00e0 tous ceux qui se d\u00e9vouent au d\u00e9veloppement intellectuel et moral des enfants Indiens des Territoires du Nord-Ouest;\n\n2. Consid\u00e9rant qu'une Ecole Pensionnat serait d'une tr\u00e8s grande utilit\u00e9 pour les nombreuses tribus qui d\u00e9pendent de la Mission de l'Ile \u00e0 la Crosse;\n\n3. Consid\u00e9rant aussi les demandes r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es d'admission \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante sans qu'on puisse acc\u00e9der aux instances de ceux qui les font;\n\n4. Consid\u00e9rant d'autre part que mes faibles ressources sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 absorb\u00e9es dans d'autres \u0153uvres n\u00e9cessaires dans mon Vicariat, et ne me permettent pas de d\u00e9velopper cette \u0153uvre.\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je prie le D\u00e9partement des Indiens de\nde vouloir bien\n\n1. Octroyer \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de l'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse le titre de Boarding School, \u00e0 l'instar de celui qu'il a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 deux \u00c9coles protestantes en dehors des Territoires organis\u00e9s;\n\n2. Accorder \u00e0 cette \u00c9cole les subsides ordinaires pour au moins une vingtaine de Pensionnaires;\n\nConsid\u00e9rant en outre que les Soeurs charg\u00e9es de cette \u00e9cole \u00e9tendent leur sollicitude aux malades de cette r\u00e9gion, je sollicite aussi la faveur qui est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres Institutions similaires, faveur qui serait de leur accorder gratuitement les divers m\u00e9dicaments dont elles pourront avoir besoin.\n\nEsp\u00e9rant que ma requ\u00eate sera favorablement accueillie j'ai l'honneur, Monsieur le Commissaire, de vous offrir ma reconnaissance pour les faveurs que j'aie d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ues de la part de votre Gouvernement, et de me dire:\n\nVotre humble serviteur,\n\n(signe) Albert Pascal, O.M.I.\nVic. Apost. de Sask.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI have the honour to call your kind attention to the following considerations:\n\nIn that part of the North-west within my diocese that has not been visited I came across a very old school in the mission called St. La Croix. This school, founded by the late respected Bishop Tache, and afterwards under the direction of the Grey Nuns of Montreal, has done much for the improvement of the many Indians without this mission. Nevertheless the want of funds has been up to the present time the greatest obstacle to its development. Therefore\n\n(1) Considering that the Government does not refuse to assist all those\nwho devote themselves to the intellectual and moral development of the Indian children of the North-west Territories.\n\n(2) Considering that a boarding-school would be of great use for the numerous tribes dependent on the mission of St. La Croix.\n\n(3) Considering also the repeated requests for admission into this school at present in existence and the inability to comply with these requests.\n\n(4) Considering on the other hand that my feeble resources already employed in other necessary work in our diocese do not admit of my developing this work.\n\nI pray the Department of Indian Affairs to be kind enough:\n\n(1) To grant to the school at St. La Croix the title of Boarding-school in the same manner as it was done to two Protestant schools out of treaty limits.\n\n(2) To allow this school the usual subsidy for at least twenty boarders.\nIn consideration of the fact also\nthat the nurse in charge of the\nschool take care of the sick in\nthat region, I solicit the favour\nextended to similar institutions\nthat is that they be\nprovided them gratuitously with\nsuch medicines as they may need.\n\nTrusting that my request\nwill be favourably entertained,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nAlbert Pascal O.M.I.\nVicar Apostolic of Quebec.\nOTTAWA 3rd November 1896\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from His Lordship, Bishop Pascal, asking that the Ile-a-la-Crosse be converted from a day into a Boarding school with a grant to maintain at least twenty boarders; and in reply I have informed him that you may include an amount to cover this expenditure in your Estimates for 1897-8, when the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith Returns for quarter ended 31st March from day school at the a la Crose.\n\nThis School is situated many miles back, with only an occasional chance of a mail hence the delay in sending Returns in.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Chief General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith returns for September quarter from the Ile \u00e0 la Crose School.\n\nI see that this school has been turned into a boarding school but I have had no advice of this change from the Dept\u2014may I enquire into its standing.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, 9th November, 1887\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo inquiring as to the standing of the Ile \u00e0 la Crosse Indian school; and in reply I beg to say that it is now recognized as a Boarding School, twelve pupils its being provided for in the Estimates for the current year at $73 per capita.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

I also paid $14.00 for the loan of a boat from Miss Lake, Vermont, to Beaver River, from which place I was obliged to return the river being frozen.

J. P. Paquette\nPrincipal\n\nJ. H. McLean\nSecretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, 31st December, 1900.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 29th ultimo, addressed to the Secretary of the Department, and which contains your account, has been handed to me for consideration.\n\nWhile I do not question the necessity for your taking with you three conveyances, as you probably understand the circumstances so much better than I do, yet it would seem to me that it would be well for you to give the Department a more complete explanation than you have done in your letter where you simply intimate that you were obliged to take two double and a single rig on account of the season of the year and the bad state of the roads and your broken leg. From general observation it would hardly appear necessary to have taken more than one. The expense, of course, involved in this matter was much more than it was expected such service would have cost.\n\nI would be glad, therefore, if you would kindly favour the Department with a full explanation, so that it may be placed on record, after which your account will receive attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Revd. Father Paquette,\nPrincipal,\nDuck Lake Boarding School.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nDuck Lake Boarding\n\nJanuary 18th, 1901\n\nI have been obliged to take the liberty of writing to you at this juncture. I have been very surprised to receive such a message to go to Isle la Croix at such an advanced season of the year with only one or two companions. We are not probably aware that during three or four days of the journey it is impossible to find any place of rest for the horses, and the risk of losing the goods is so great that the horses can hardly find anything to eat, therefore the double trip was sent only for the provisions for the house to stand by in case of a month's journey. The other double trip was to bring our tents, bedding, tools, and necessary provisions. The single trip was for myself and man.\n\nIn such a long journey it would have been very imprudent to take less horses and dogs than I did without incurring the danger of being a long time on the prairie.\n\nAs there are no bridges across many large rivers, one of my men\ngot nearly drowned with the horse\nand lost the rig very badly.\nBeing an old traveler in the North\nWest particularly in that wild part\nof the country, I foresaw the difficulties\nthat were to be met with especially\nwhen the rivers begin to freeze and\nsnow on the ground. If I had only\none rig as you imagined, my son\nand wife would have been drowned\nand I would have been left alone\nin the wilderness not less than 250\nmiles from a living soul.\nPermit me also to tell you that my\ntwo other men and myself had great\ndifficulty to draw the team and the\nhorses half drowned from the middle\nof the river.\nAs you may understand though our\nrigs were not very much loaded,\non several occasions in crossing\nswamps etc., we broke our whips,\ntrees and one wheel and once where\nwe were very lucky to have only\nthree rigs and three men with us.\nWe saw several dead horses along\nthe road, and I do not doubt I should\nhave had to leave one or two of\nmine also drowned in the deep mud\nif I had had only one or two horses,\nand as it was the day before\nour arriving at Duck Lake, two of\nour horses were so tired that they\nwere scarcely able to walk. If you consider the expenses were more than you thought they might be, but permit me to tell you candidly that I will never undertake such a journey in a late season of the year for not less than $500. I don't know well enough when I had the order from the Department to go to the North that they would refuse to pay such an amount as it occurred, that is the reason I objected going until I received a telegram from Mr. Stuart, Ottawa, stating that the Department would defray all my expenses.\n\nYou understand that a man of my age and position would not for any prospect do what I had done if it had not been to please the Government.\n\nI hope you consider that I acted very wisely in taking with me three conveyances, and three men; also another reason that I was very much pressed for time to be at Green Lake by the seventh day of November.\n\nIf any explanation is not sufficient and if the Hon. Mr. Sifton did not too far from you, will you kindly tell him a few words about my trip to the North, and he will explain the matter to you as he knows all the...\nparticulars; our Member Mr. Co. O'Davis wrote to him about it.\n\nHoping the Department will help me at once as soon as possible, as I am in great need of money just now.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nM.J.P. Papineau\n\nPrincipal\n\nF.A. Smart\nDeputy Superintendant\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, 21st January, 1901.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. McLean.\n\nI think that Father Paquette should be allowed his expenses. As to an allowance for his time and also providing a substitute for the School, this can be taken into consideration later on. I do not know what this expenditure amounts to and do not know that I am competent to fix the amount.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nSir,\n\nChq. No.3537, Manitoba & North West, is for a payment of $448 to Rev. Father Paquette for expenses of a trip to Isle \u00e0 la Crosse, visiting a School beyond the Treaty limits. All I have in the way of vouchers in support of this account is four receipts as follows:\n\n(1). A receipt from Moise Charrette for $165. for 23 days' hire of team, rig and man at $5. a day, including all expenses.\n\n(2). A receipt from Louis Arcan for the same amount for a similar service.\n\n(3) A receipt from Antoine Napes for $99. for hire of a single rig and man for 33 days at $3. a day, all expenses included.\n\n(4). A receipt from Xepherin Morin for $14. for hire of boat and man from east end of Green Lake to Beaver River and return.\n\nThere is no accompanying statement of expenditure nor any explanation whatever of these receipts which moreover have no certificate of any kind. Kindly explain why this payment was made without proper vouchers. I would also ask why Father Paquette required two teams and a single rig on this trip, as they appear to have been all hired at the same time.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nAuditor General\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have, accordingly, caused one to be made out in duplicate which is enclosed herewith. Would you kindly certify at the foot of the voucher and together with a diary return same to me at an early date as possible?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.B.

Paquette of expenses of a trip to Isle a la Crosse to visit the boarding school at that point I beg to say that the correspondence with the Reverend gentleman led to the payment being made.\n\nAs the receipts do not bear any certificate I have sent him a voucher in order that you may properly certify to the account.\n\nI also beg to attach an extract from a letter dated at Duck Lake, January 8th, from Mr. Paquette dealing with the subject.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Lorne McDougall, Esq., C. M. G.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter No. 17561 dated Ottawa June 18th 1901 I have the honor to forward you the vouchers signed as you requested also a rough diary of my trip to Isle a la Croix last autumn.\n\nA few days after receiving the order from the Department to issue Isle a la Croix Boarding School I started from Duck Lake North three men two double buggies and one single. It may appear strange to you to hear that I brought such an equipment with me but I knew that many travellers left some of their best horses drowned in the mud or on the same road that I had to pass and were obliged to go on foot through the bushes over a hundred miles in order to reach their homes. Not wishing therefore to meet with the same adventure I took what was absolutely necessary for the journey and nothing else.\n\nI found it was very wise to act as\nI did, for we nearly lost one of our men horse and rig in crossing a large river. The roads too were so bad that we were obliged to go very slowly and carefully, and several times were delayed by accidents to the rig such as broken wheels, whistles, etc., etc. In order also to avoid marshy places we were often compelled to pass through river roads which made our journey longer.\n\nHaving started from Dutch Lake the 16th October, we camped at Carleton, went on to Grassley Lake, Snake Plain, Sandy Lake, Fish River, Devil's Lake, Big River, White Fish Lake, and from there we camped four times in several places. On starting, we struck Clear Lake Water, and proceeded to Green Lake South End, where we took a boat to go to the North End. We had to rest for a day at Green Lake to renew our provisions and wash our clothes. After resting we continued our way to Beaver River, where we found such solid ice on all the back that we were compelled to return. Our wound was now covered with frost and snow, and the old Indians strongly advised me not to go on farther unless I wished to be back.\nat Christmas time. We therefore thought it more prudent to return by the same way, and arrived at Duck Lake on the 17th November. Really in good time as the rivers were frozen hard a few days after. My journey lasted thirty-three days, and I candidly acknowledge that no money would oblige me to undertake such a trip at so advanced a season of the year. Hoping that this little detail will be satisfactory, I have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nM. J. P. Paquette\nPrinciple\n\nThe Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa 10th July, 1801.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 10th ultimo, I have the honour to enclose herewith a formal certified voucher amounting to $443.00 for the expenses incurred by the Revd M.J.P. Paquette in connection with his trip to Isle a la Crosse to visit the boarding school at that point.

Mes sentiments vous honorent plus que les expressions dont je devrais faire \u00e9tat de votre sant\u00e9. La sant\u00e9, c'est une chose que nous avons \u00e0 c\u0153ur de garder \u00e0 ma premi\u00e8re lettre, m'encourage \u00e0 recevoir une seconde fois \u00e0 l'intention que vous soyez pr\u00eat \u00e0 nos \u0153uvres d'\u00e9cole et de charit\u00e9.\n\nLes raisons que nous avons caus\u00e9es l'inondation du lac de la Croix ne nous permettent pas de diff\u00e9rer davantage la construction d'une nouvelle \u00e9cole orphelinat, sur un terrain plus propice et avec des dimensions plus adapt\u00e9es au d\u00e9veloppement de cette \u0153uvre si utile \u00e0 nos M\u00e9tis et \u00e0 nos Indiens du vaste district de l'\u00eele de la Croix. Les souffrances auxquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises nos pauvres jeunes filles de Montr\u00e9al, et que nous ne pouvions \u00e9viter faute de ressources ont amen\u00e9 leur rappel, pour cet \u00e9t\u00e9, par leur M\u00e8re Supr\u00eame. Ce sera l'objet d'une douleur immense pour notre ch\u00e8re population, et surtout pour nos chers enfants. Mais Monseigneur Barcel, dans son voyage de France, a trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 Lyon des fonds d'un autre institut, qui consentent \u00e0 venir remplacer de suite les regrettes partout et continuer leur \u0153uvre b\u00e9n\u00e9fique.

Le chiffre des d\u00e9penses d\u00e9passe des 7/10 des ressources que nous pr\u00e9voyons depuis deux ans le d\u00e9partement de l'Inde, et qui sont loin de r\u00e9pondre au nombre des enfants indiens de la localit\u00e9. Nous n'avons que 20 enfants boursiers du gouvernement, et nos Indiens Catholiques (ils le sont tous) d\u00e9passent le chiffre de 900, ce qui, avec les M\u00e9tis donne une population d'environ 1200. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le pays \u00e9tant tout sauf nouveau, nous n'avons pas la ressource de la culture sur une bonne \u00e9chelle.

My sentiments do you more honour than the forms of expression that may perhaps use. The kindness, moreover, with which you desired to reply to my first letter encourages me to appeal a second time to the interest that you take in our school work and works generally.\n\nThe rains that caused the flooding of Lake La Croix will not allow us to put off any longer the building of a new schoolhouse or orphanage on a more suitable piece of land and of a size more adapted to the development of this work so dear to our half-breeds.\nand to our Indians of the vast district of St. Lawrence. The sufferings that our poor Grey Nuns of Montreal have been subject to, which we cannot prevent for lack of resources, have been recalled for this summer by the head of their order. This will be the cause of great grief among our dear people, especially for our dear children.\n\nBut Bishop Pascal, in his trip to France, found at Lyons nuns of another order, who agree to come at once and take the place of the regretted sisters who are leaving, and to continue their blessed work.\n\nWe cannot, as Your Excellency will well understand, longer expose them to the very serious inconveniences of an establishment out of order by water; and although we have to suffer from privations, we are going to start at the work. The expense will exceed $100 of the grant made us for two years by the Educational Council and which is far from sufficient for the number of Indians.\nchildren of the locality. We have only 20 children provided for by the Gov't, and our Indians R.C. Indians (they are all R.C.) exceed the figure 900, which, with the half-breeds, makes a population of about 1200.\n\nOn the other hand, the country being all sandy, we haven't the resource of cultivating on a large scale. I therefore beg Your Excellency to be kind enough to take us under your generous protection in respect to the Educational Council, and to obtain for us either an increase in the number of grant-earners or a special grant that will enable us to meet the expenses of the new establishment. This favour will be in the noble and laudable career of Your Excellency a good and fine deed added to many others, and one that the poor missionaries of the extreme North, humble but devoted workers for the truest civilization, will never forget.\nPlease accept, Your Excellency,\nmy sincere homage and respect\nin O.T. and M.V.\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 5th June, 1905\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the letter from Rev. Father Lacorre addressed to the Premier asking for a grant for an increased number of pupils, or a special grant to enable the Isle-a-la-Crosse school to put up a new building, I beg to say that at present the school receives a grant of $72.00 for each of 20 pupils, and in reply to a previous application for additional grant earners, Rev. Sister Thiffault was informed in September last that the Department regretted that no provision could be made for taking more pupils into this school.\n\nIt appears from Father Lacorre's letter that the present building, which has accommodation for 50 pupils, was under water owing to the flooding of the lake by heavy rains, and that the Grey Nuns who have had charge of the school are leaving in consequence. Bishop Pascal, who is now in France, is bringing out nuns to replace them, but a new building, the priest says, will be necessary. The Department is not responsible for the site chosen and we have no funds available for a contribution to the proposed new building. If it is decided to make a grant, provision would have to be made in the Supplementary Estimates. No special amount is asked for, but the erection of a new building in that locality would be expensive.\n\nWhen the Indian Commissioner applied for an\nincrease in the number of pupils in 1903, he stated that the work done in this institution was worthy of encouragement, and the number of grant earners was then raised from 12 to 20.\n\nWe have very little information about this school, which is 80 miles from the nearest post-office and off the regular route of inspection, and I think this application could stand until the school policy of the Department is being dealt with.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je suis missionnaire fran\u00e7ais, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 65 ans, et r\u00e9sid\u00e9 depuis 34 ans dans ces froids r\u00e9gions de l'extr\u00eame Nord. Bien que fatigu\u00e9 et bien des privations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mes partages durant cette longue carri\u00e8re. Mais une rude \u00e9preuve, survenue depuis peu, nous a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 la plus triste situation. En suite d'une inondation du lac de Croix, nos constructions en bois ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement d\u00e9truites, et notre champ de foins, (le seul produit que nous puissions cultiver dans cette r\u00e9gion de table) tellement saccag\u00e9, que le tout n'est qu'un plan de ma rive. Nos pauvres familles et nos enfants souffrent tellement du froid dans leur demeure d\u00e9pourvue, que c'est vraiment piti\u00e9 de les entendre tous continuellement, quant \u00e0 nous, bien et frais, nous n'avons l'autre abri provisoire qu'un mince hangar. Il faut dire que nous nous remettons \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre pour reconstruire la Mission et l'Ecole, sur un autre emplacement plus favorable. Mais ce travail entra\u00eene de grands d\u00e9penses, et nous sommes \u00e0 pauvres. M\u00eame pour l'entretien de nos enfants, nous n'avons gu\u00e8re que le pain que nous prenons nous-m\u00eames dans la dune.\n\nJe vous supplie donc, Excellence, de mettre bien soin \u00e0 notre aide, et de nous permettre de continuer notre fructueuse apostolat, comme en toutes missions, que nous avons toutes consacr\u00e9es \u00e0 notre foi.

D\u00e9j\u00e0, votre gouvernement, si liberal, nous a donn\u00e9 des t\u00e9moignages de sa sympathie, en nous accordant les subventions pour 20 enfants de nos Indiens.

It is therefore necessary for us to get to work to rebuild the mission and the school, in another more favourable place. But this work entails great expense and we are so poor!

At this date the Rev. Father Rapet, superior of the mission and principal of the school made a request to the Dept. of Indian Affairs that the title of \"boarding school\" be given to this school, he also asked that the sum of $864.00 be given for the keep of a dozen children.\n\nSix years later, upon new demands, to the same Dept., then under your able care, decided to raise the number of children receiving $72.00 each, to 20.\n\nTo-day I come again to ask you another favor, and permit me to say, to appeal to your love of justice in favor of our school and the people who devote their time and energy to its welfare.\n\nWe endeavour to give an education worthy of the name and we hope to find men in the Indian Dept. who are willing to help us and who are interested in spreading instruction and religious principles among the people of the North, which is the foundation of true civilisation, for this work we will ask your help, we have prepared all the material necessary for the construction of a larger school which will be better fitted for the needs of the time, and better situated than the old buildings that were old 40 years ago, we think it our duty to replace them and as they are not in the best place owing to the changes of time we have chosen a new site situated at the confluence the Castor, and Laplonge rivers about 30 miles from here.\n\nConsequently we ask if the Dept. will please,\nIth\u2014permit the transfer of the \"Boarding school\" from Ile \u00e0 la Crosse to this new place.\n\n2ndly, to raise the number of children supported from 20 to 30.\n\n3rdly, to raise equally the contribution of each child from $72.00 to $100.00 right here it might be proper to say that our expenses in living are more than other schools of the same nature owing to our being far from a centre of population, and our nearest stations are Prince Albert and Duck Lake; and it costs us $5.00 per 100 pounds freight.\n\nI also wish to call your attention to our wants for the school articles. My predecessor made application to the government for assistance in putting up the new building but the Dept. did not give any attention to his demand; all we ask now is that the Dept. give us the same favors as those accorded to other schools of this nature.\n\nThe land has not as yet been surveyed and we ask that about 200 acres be set aside for the new school, the land on the border of the Castor river in the ordinary prairie, and about the amount asked for has been already cleared and worked by us.\n\nThese are Hon.

He also asks that the number provided for be increased to thirty.\n\nThe Principal states that they are prepared to put up a new building at the confluence of the Cassia and Laplonge rivers, about 30 miles from the present location, and asks permission to transfer the Boarding school to this site. He states that they have prepared all the material necessary for the construction of a larger school which will be better fitted for their needs and better situated than the old buildings which were erected some forty years ago, and are now out of date. If the Department approves of the new site selected, they will require at least 200 acres to be set aside for the new school. The land in this locality has not yet been surveyed, but they would like to have it set aside for school purposes, as they have already cleared and worked it.\n\nFor a number of years the Priests in charge of this school have been urging on the Department the necessity\nnecessity for a more liberal advance, and also for assistance in the erection of new buildings, but up to the present time nothing has been done to meet their wishes.\n\nThis school is outside of Treaty, and is so remote that it is not visited by any of our Agents or Inspectors, although it is given as being attached to the Carlton Agency. In 1900, the Rev. Father Paquette was instructed to inspect this school, and report to the Department, but all we have to show for his visit is an account which amounts to $443.\n\nThe next term this school will likely be closed as he could not return to report before the end of the term.\n\n[Signature]\n\n7/9/06\nExpenses of transport of children of Industrial School from Isle a la Crose to the new school just completed at the mouth of Lake la Plonge, about 60 miles.

If you are in a position to furnish us with a report on these latter points, the Department would be glad to receive it.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. Blean\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 19th instant re matters concerning the old Isle a la Crosse Boarding School and must say that I know very little about the removal of this institution to some point south of its former situation, outside of press reports, which are not always very accurate.\n\nThe old site at the time it was selected, over half a century ago, may have been very suitable for missionary purposes, but the fixed population has scattered away and the roving population trades elsewhere.\n\nAs to \"Castor\" River mentioned, I beg to say that this is the French form of \"Beaver\" River. This will be found on any recent map running fairly from west to east in latitude $54^\\circ$+ and turning towards the north at almost a square angle in longitude $107^\\circ - 108^\\circ$ until it meets what I take to be the La Plonge River, running out of the Lake of the same name in latitude $55^\\circ$+.\n\nI am sorry to say that I have nobody at hand to inform me of the nature of the country at the point selected, but I feel pretty sure that it could not be any worse than the old site, which, I believe, was not abandoned at an earlier date on account of the money expended there and also for sentimental reasons.\n\nI may possibly obtain accurate information within a short time; if so, I will communicate it to the Department.\n\nIn regard to an increase of the per capita grant, until your letter came to hand, I received no application for an increase this year, so inserted the same amount in the Estimates as Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had little opportunity to talk about matters of the district with my Assistant since his return from the North; but I believe fuller information can be had from him at Ottawa, where he will have probably reached before this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 18th January, 1907.\n\nThe Honourable Frank Oliver,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Isle a la Croix mission was founded about sixty-two years ago by Father Lafl\u00e8che, who afterwards was a prominent figure in the Quebec hierarchy, and Brother Tache, who afterwards filled the See of St. Boniface. The church built by them was destroyed by fire and has been replaced by another.\n\nThe building next in importance is the school conducted by the Sisters. It shows marked evidence of age externally, but is cosy within, and the children whom I had the pleasure of meeting there, evidenced the kindly care and careful training of the devoted women who have gone out from the comforts of civilization to work for the betterment of the natives of the north. The priests' house is a small one. Its only door opens into a large room which occupies the greater part of the building and which is the common gathering place of the Indians and Halfbreeds who sit and smoke with an ease that seemed born of long habit of free intercourse with those who have undertaken the cure of their souls. The mission is about opposite the Company's post. It is close to the shore.\n\nThe site is rather flat and for miles on three sides stretches a bald prairie, though we were told that the mission when founded on the fringe of the forest. Whatever it may have been, it is no longer a desirable situation for a boarding school, and a new one has been erected at Rivers la Plonge, some thirty miles south of the mission.\nThe building is one hundred feet by sixty-two feet, and is two and a half stories high. It was being finished when I visited it. The site is a delightful one on a rising ground from the river which here breaks into a cataract that the Oblate Brothers have harnessed for power purposes. They cut the logs, and, with the harnessed river, sawed them into lumber, with which they built the school, a splendid monument to their mechanical skill, industry and devotion. When I was leaving Isle a la Crosse, the moving of the children from the old to the new institution had begun.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. J.A.J. McKenna,\n\nCommissioner.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1907.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment Indian Affairs.\n\nThis file was mislaid in the Interior Department. I have dealt with the subject of Mr. Benson's memorandum in my report upon the Treaty.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nNearly two years ago, His Lordship Bishop Pascal of Prince Albert presented to you some remarks about the Indian School at Fort la Corne and made some demands on behalf of the same school; and to this day the Bishop's letter has not received any answer. As I am now in charge of the Mission in Saskatchewan, I take the liberty of asking for an answer to his just requests of my predecessor. We have built a school room to accommodate the children and so far we have supplied all that was needed for its maintenance and support, without any help from the Indian Department. In his letter Bishop Pascal made an application for a special grant in order to cover part of the building expenses which amount to more than $10,000. Unhappily I have not at hand the notes taken by myself lately on a visit to this school, but I can say that the main building is 100 feet long, 30 feet wide with two stories and when completed the attic will make a very good dormitory for the children. It is not just and right that the Department should pay part of the expenses incurred for the accommodation of the numerous Indian children of the district. I renew, therefore, the application made by Bishop Pascal when he last charged of these matters, and sincerely hope that you will give your earnest attention to the matter.\n\nI request also that the number of children receiving the government grants should be brought from 20, the present number, to 75 as there is ample room for that number and there are lots of children to be instructed and educated if the Government keeps the promises made to the Indians at the time they made their treaty.\n\nI would add also your consideration of the following facts: The school is very near one hundred miles from Fort la Corne, the last point reached by any road, and from there all supplies have to be carried by boat in summer and by train in winter. Consequently one bag of flour costs at the school three times more than...\nat Peace River or any other school in the province, consequently also\nthe grant which may be sufficient for schools on the railway line or near\ncivilized centres, is altogether insufficient for our faraway school, and I\nbelieve therefore that I am entitled to ask for a larger grant for purposes\nof $100 instead of $75.\nFor the support of our school we must have a farm and keep quite a number\nof cattle and at times an extensive area near the place and as the land is heavy,\ntimbered, the hay swampy season and exposed to be flooded when the Beaver river\ncomes. I ask that the Department grant us all the land from the edge of the Beaver\nriver to the Plonge a distance of about two and a half miles, four miles and a half with\na frontage of one mile starting north from the junction of the Beaver\nand Beaver rivers to the extremity of the swamp formed by the first river south\neast of the school. Allow me to remark that we might obtain possession of\nmuch of the land by our brothers and helpers taking it as their homesteads but\nI think it would simplify matters if the Department were to give us the patent\nfor the land which shall never be of any value. One other reason for this grant\nis the protection of our water power. We have now to great expense to dam the\nBeaver river or creek and we have now a very good saw mill, though not\non the very shore of our school, and by giving us the land as I explained above,\nthe Beaver creek coming out of the Beaver river, it will be distant will be on\nour territory and nobody can hurt our mill in any way.\nWe have now in operation a water works which supply the whole school\nwith pure and wholesome water, and it would not do to expose the health during\nfuture times to be contaminated in any way.\nI would also ask the Department to help us by a special grant to get electric\nlight for the school. We have the power, we can do the work without extra cost; all\nwe need is some money to buy the dynamo and apparatus necessary. Hope\nthe Department will not refuse my request for the benefit of a school which is called to\nbenefit many Indians, and Indians who are worthy of any outlay and sacrifice made.\nmade for their welfare and education.\n\nWhen I was at the school last month, the Rev. Principal complained of not having received any grant from the Department from June last January. I cannot understand how this could happen as the returns have been sent regularly, and I would beg of you, Sir, to give instructions that such delays should not occur in future.\n\nOur school is the only one in the whole north country of the Saskatchewan, as all the Indians are catholic, and the Cree and Chipewyan are ready to send their children if the government grants the request I present today to their consideration. I hope, Sir, that you will not only give your kind consideration to the matter, but take the necessary steps to secure the different demands I make in behalf of the school, that we may go on abreast with the works already so well begun. I believe that the gentlemen of the deep communion have visited the school and expressed their satisfaction with what they saw, and their kind intention to help us in our work. Therefore, I would beg of you to ask for any information that you may desire.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Grandin\n\nEdmonton Alta.\nOttawa, 14th October, 1907.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn Mr. Oliver's absence I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant regarding the Indian School at Isle a la Crosse. Upon the Minister's return your letter will be brought to his attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.E. Crawford,\nFor Private Secretary\n\nRev. H. Grandin,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nEdmonton October 10th 1907\n\nThe Honorable F. Oliver\nMinister of the Interior\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nAllow me to ask your kind consideration for a letter I wrote today to the Hon. Secretary of Indian Affairs about our Indian School at Little Black River. I visited this school last August and came back from my trip north about the middle of September. If the officials of the Indian Dept. did not come across Bishop's letter, I have no reason to believe that they will take more notice of mine and therefore I take the liberty of writing you to bring yourself into the matter I wrote about. Our school will be, or rather is already a success, and happily the class of Indians we have to teach does not in any way resemble too many of our prairie Indians. They are good honest people trying their very best to profit by our advice and the white traders living amongst them readily acknowledge that they are worth the trouble we take to educate their children. We have gone to very great expense in order to build and equip the school and I confidently expect that the Survey Commission will give you a good report of what they saw on their visit to the school. Such an amount as all with our means alone, then Indians are under the care of the Government, and they have been promised that the said Government would provide them with schools conducted by their priests. I ask in my letter for what I consider to be just and reasonable, and if you consider the very great distance supplies have to be freighted, you will not find my request for the augmentation of the grant per capita out of reason. It is the only fair means to help us in the work we have undertaken for the benefit of your charges.\n\nThe request for the land may seem at first quite large, but you must consider...\nThat a great part of the land asked for is composed of muskegs, rocky ridges and a small part of cultivable land. It will take years to clear land enough for our fields and the artificial prairies made necessary by the frequent rise of the Beaver river which floods the whole low land for miles and miles. I do not think that the grant I ask of you will in any way be injurious to the settlement of this country which is not fit for farming or ranching. On the contrary our well and other improvements may induce a few settlers to take up land on the other side of the Beaver to assist members of our establishment.\n\nIn concluding this letter I wish in behalf of the Indians ask you to take steps to insure the enforcement of the law prohibiting the use of poison for killing game. A few white men have done much harm around here & la Cross in this way and the Indians complained of this before me and asked me to help them by laying their complaints before the authorities. It is also a well known fact that white hunters killed for the sake of the skin only more than one moon and left the whole carcass to rotten where the animal had been killed.\n\nI hope Sir, that you will kindly settle up the different points of my letter and give us all the satisfaction you can.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Gaudry\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 31, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nThe Rev. M. Grandin, of Edmonton, has written two letters to the Minister, dated the 10th inst., regarding needs of the Lao la Plonge school, which is the successor to the one formerly conducted at Isle a la Crose.\n\nHe asks that the Department give them a grant to recoup them for the outlay in the erection of the building; to increase the pupilage from 30 to 75; to increase the per capita grant from $73 to $100; to provide them with sufficient land for farming and grazing purposes; and to install an electric lighting plant.\n\nThey have put up a number of buildings, the main one being 100 ft. long by 52 ft. wide and two storeys high, costing about $10,000.00. Father Grandin does not state how much he expects the Department to contribute for this purpose, but as the Churches are in the habit of asking for one-half the cost of buildings from the Department, he would expect at least $5,000.00.\n\nOf course, such extensive buildings would accommodate the increased number of pupils asked for, but to meet the outlay this would entail an increased grant an additional expenditure of $6,000.00 annually.\n\nThe question of land grant would have to be dealt with\nwith by the Department of the Interior. Father Grandin asks for about 4000 acres. He states that his reason for asking for this quantity of land is because they wish to protect their water power, as they have gone to great expense in damming the la Plonge river, where they have put up a saw and shingle mill and from which they derive their water supply for the school. This stream would furnish power for running an electric light plant, the cost of installing which would be close on $2,000, as a direct current generator with a capacity of 300 16- op. incandescent lamps; together with 300 sockets, 300 lamps, 300 resettes, 350 lbs. of wire, 3000 ft. of electric cordage, switches, cleats, tubes, voltmeter and ammeter would cost about $1200 F.O.B. Ottawa, to say nothing of freight and wages of an expert to place it in position.\n\nThe money needed to meet Father Grandin's application would amount to at least $13,000, without taking into account the grant of land asked for. This seems a large amount of money to spend for the purpose of educating nomadic Indians. The increase in the per capita grant from $72 to $100 is worthy of consideration, owing to the excessive cost of freighting in supplies.\n\nMartin Beall\nReport taken in connection with the school at Lac la Plonge on the 20th day of June, 1907.\n\nGROUND :\n\nArea of school grounds.

Although it is a new school, it takes the place of the old school at Isle a la Crosse, which was founded over sixty years ago and abandoned, the new site being more suitable.\n\nThey have ample accommodation for the additional number of pupils asked for and at the time of Mr. Agent Borthwick's visit there were 26 on the roll, 19 treaty and 9 non-treaty.\n\nIf it is decided to increase the pupilage at any of the schools, this application is entitled to favourable consideration. Mr. Agent Borthwick states that the present per capita grant of $72 is sufficient, as they can obtain an unlimited supply of fish and will be able to raise vegetables enough to carry them through.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to my memorandum of the 21st ult. on an application of the Rev.

They are not on any Indian Reserve and the Department was not consulted as to their erection which was undertaken in the general interests of the Mission, and I do not think we should be asked to contribute anything. As I have reported elsewhere, I do not think an increase in the pupilage at any of these Schools should be provided for without careful consideration and at present we are not in possession of sufficient facts to lead us to form the opinion that the privileges of this Boarding School could with gain be extended to a larger number of pupils within this district. While the late report on the school question from myself and Mr. Benson seems to take for granted that these Boarding Schools in the outlying districts are of value, and should therefore not be closed; yet where additional expenditure is demanded to improve and extend their operations, I think the question should be most carefully considered, and that all available information should be obtained before the appropriations are in any way increased.\n\nThe last question should be taken up with the Department of the Interior. Four thousand acres is a large quantity to be claimed for a\nSchool; yet with this question I take it we have no intimate relation.\n\nThe cost of installing an electric light plant is hardly at present in a position for discussion.\n\nAccountant.\nST.

It seems but fair and just that such a school should not be treated as a school near outskirts of towns, since the expenses are four times higher for every thing that must be brought for the maintenance of the pupils. We have build a school in which we have room for 100 pupils and in adding that it may be authorized, I do not think that it made an unfair demand. The Indians around Ville \u00e0 la Croix are certainly of the best to be found in the country and it would be a pity not to give them a chance to educate their children in a proper way.\n\nSo far I have not received any answer to my letter of October 10th, and would be very grateful to you if you could kindly let me know if you have seen it and what you think of the different points raised in it.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Grandin\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 3, 1908.\n\nMr. Oliver:\n\nThe requests that have been received from Bishop Pascal, Rev. Father Grandin, et al., re increased assistance to the school at Lac la Plonge are as follows:\n\nThe Department to contribute to the expenditure in erecting the buildings at the present site. According to the Church's statement about $10,000.00 has been expended, and I presume the Department will be expected to contribute one-half, if not more.\n\nIn this connection I beg leave to say that the present buildings were erected without reference to the Department, are not on an Indian reserve and belong entirely to the Church. Except in so far as it is contended that they are for the sole benefit of the Indians there is no reason advanced why the Department should be called upon to pay anything for their erection.\n\n2: An increase in pupilage from 20 to 50 and per capita grant from $72.00 to $100.00. In 1903-04 provision was\nwas made for increasing the pupilage from 12 to 20, the present number.\n\nWhile it may be true that the buildings will not accommodate a larger number of pupils, I find from a report of Agent Borthwick that on June 20 last there were 28 pupils in attendance, but of these 9 were non-treaty. I presume that as the bounds of the treaty have been extended there will be no difficulty in securing at least 30 pupils, and I would recommend provision being made in the Supplementary Estimates for that number. In so far as the increased per capita grant is concerned this will be met if the general increase asked for by the Church committee a short time ago be conceded.\n\nI may say in this connection, however, that according to Agent Borthwick an increase in the per capita grant is not so much needed as one in pupilage, inasmuch as an unlimited supply of fish can be obtained, and that little difficulty will be met in raising sufficient vegetables. I would suggest that the present per capita grant remain until such time as a decision is reached on the whole question of the Department's financial responsibility to the schools.\n\n3: A grant of land of about 4,000 acres from the shore of\nof the Beaver River to Lac la Ronge, about four and a half miles, with a frontage of one mile starting north (east?) from the junction of the La Plonge and Beaver Rivers to the extremity of the swamp formed by the first river southeast of the school (I enclose a sketch). One of the chief reasons advanced for this grant is that its possession will enable the school to protect the water power developed by the school on the La Plonge River and in connection with which there are a saw mill, shingle mill, water works, etc. The granting of this land of course belongs to the Department of the Interior.\n\n4: A special grant to equip the school with electric light plant to be operated by the power above referred to. The cost of such an equipment is estimated at least $2,000. for generator, lamps, sockets, wire, cordage, cleats, etc.\n\nThe proposition submitted means a financial outlay of say $5,000. towards buildings, $6060. per capita grant, $2,000. for electric equipment, in all about $13,000.00 and an increased annual per capita grant of $6060., also the 4,000 acres of land.\n\nUntil we have reached a settled policy in the matter of Indian education I would recommend, in so far as this Department is asked to contribute that only the increased pupilage, as recommended, be allowed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I see in your memorandum to the Minister that you recommend provision being made in the supplementary estimates for 30 pupils. Is this to be the limit or are they to be allowed for 50?\n\nMartin Benson\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th ult., regarding the Lac La Plonge Boarding School, I beg to say that the Department will authorize an increase in the number of pupils up to thirty at the present per capita rate of $72.00 for this school, starting from the beginning of the new fiscal year, April 1, next.\n\nThe other propositions referred to in your previous letter of October 10, last, will have to stand until a suitable boy in the native Canadian education is found.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

Granin, C.M.I.S.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to the attached complaint from Bishop Grondin in which he states that the Lac la Plonge School has not received any grant since January 1907, I have to say that the grant has been paid in full up to the end of the September quarter 1907, as follows:\n\nCh. 3761 for $334.80, in favor of Rev.

Angel, O.M.I., March Grant, 1907, for Isle-a-la-Crosse Boarding School, was sent to him May 3rd., 1907, and has been cashed.\n\nCh. 2034 for $348.00 and Ch. 3518 for $360.00 were sent to the Rev. F. Angel, Aug. 20th and Nov. 1st 1907, but have not yet been returned as cashed.\n\nChs. 3761, 5598 and 2034 were sent to Rev. F. Angel by registered letters addressed to Isle a la Crosse, via Carlton, Sask.\n\nCh. 3518 was addressed to him at Lac la Plonge, Greenlake P.O., via Mistawasis, Sask.\n\nThere has been no delay in paying these grants but the remote situation of the School has perhaps tended somewhat to delay the payment.\n\nAccountant.\nCK 3761 - Feb 6/07\n5598 May 4/07\n2824 Aug 21/07\n\nSent to Rev & amel. on 2.\nDelivered to the office\nvia Carlton, Sask.\n\nCK 3158 - Sent Nov 2/07\n5302 Jan 20/08\n\nSent to Rev & amel. on 1.\nSent Lake P.O.\nVia Montana via Frank\nOttawa, January 31st, 1908.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nHaving reference to the letter from Reverend Father Gronin of the 16th instant, in which he states that the Indian School at River la Plonge has not received any grant since January, 1907, I beg to say that the Reverend gentleman is labouring under a mistake because on looking into the matter I find that the following amounts were sent:\n\nCheque No. 3761 for $334.80 in favour of Rev. F. Angel,\nPrincipal of the School.\nsent Feb. 4th, 1907, and cashed.\n\nCheque No. 5598 for $360.00 in favour of Rev. F.

There has been no delay in paying these grants upon the receipt of the school returns.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn the same day that I received your letter of the 1st inst. I had one from the R.C. Agent telling me his yearly accounts and I see indeed that the charges mentioned in your letter were received by the Rev. Principal. I cannot explain how I misunderstood so completely the state of affairs at the school and I willingly apologize for the trouble of your unnecessary.\n\nIn my first letter of October 10th I asked the Indian Department to give to the school a certain amount of land that the staff may start some kind of a farm and that they may erect the house necessary for the cattle and horses of the school. There is one Father and three brothers working at the school and the school has granted the land as homesteads, but I am afraid, knowing the country, that one section would not be sufficient for the purposes of the school. Much of the country is not fit for farming and will never be, it is only here and there that one can find a piece of land that may be utilized. The hay crops are very often entirely flooded, and last fall we lost a quantity of hay that was carried away by a wave of the Beaver River. Moreover we have a fine new well on the La Plange creek and we wish to protect the work already done by obtaining from you the ownership of the land on both sides of said creek from La Plange to the Beaver River. The latter is four miles from the school and as there is no settlement around that part of the country, our claims would not interfere with the rights of any one, but would give us a variety that what we have done would remain undisturbed and encourage us to do more future work. We have installed a pump that supplies water to the school from the creek and you to request again to complete the works and buy the machinery necessary for that purpose. Now we would like to have electric lights in the school and if the...\nwere willing to supply the machinery, we could by machines do all the work required. I hope, Sir, that you will be able to help us in this matter which is very important now and it is so difficult to get safely so far such of railways or even common good roads.\n\nI have a letter of the Dept. authorizing 30 children in the school from each district but I much suspect that there are already more than this number in the school; and that many more are waiting your permission to be received.\n\nI hope that my claim for an augmentation of the parish, will be granted as the expenses for the maintenance of children at the Place are among the most burdensome than in any other school that I know of.\n\nThanking you for your answer and hoping that these demands will receive your kind consideration, I remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Baudin\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFather and I ask that land be given to Indian School so that they may have hay for horses at school. There are one priest and three brothers at school who might be granted lots, but afraid one acre would not be sufficient as most of land is very poor. Have a sawmill on Lake La Plonge Creek want to obtain land on both sides Creek from Lake la Plonge to Beaver River. Lake 4 miles from school - no settlers in that part to be affected. Have installed power to bring water from Creek to school.\n\nWant electric light in school - will do all the work if Dept supplies machinery.

But I must draw your attention to one of the points of my letter to which you do not give any answer. I was stating in this letter of mine that we had built up a school 100 feet by 50 feet above the river, and costing us about $10,000, without receiving any help from the Department. In all boarding schools built so far, it has been the practice of the Indian Department to grant a subsidy for the cost of the whole amount expended, but for a good share of such amount. I was asking the Department to do the same for our school and as I believe my request to be just and fair I take the liberty of renewing my demand today. Besides the building of the school we have at our expense dug a canal very near 1000 feet long and 2 feet deep to carry the creeks water to the school, put up a good dam and installed an automatic pump which will supply any amount of good and pure water for the use of the school. It seems to me that we deserve a substantial help from the Department and I hope that you will see your way to encourage us in our effort to make this Indian school one of the best in the country.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report the death of an Indian girl named Aldina Kewaskunikere (Canoe Lake band) which took place at the Roman Catholic boarding school at Lac la Plonge on Sunday, 17th October, 1909, as a result of injuries from burns.\n\nI understood from one of the brothers at the above school, that the girl (who was far gone in consumption) was playing around a burning rubbish heap, and her dress caught fire with the result that she was more or less burned about the legs, and that she died on the date above mentioned. The burning took place some few days previous to her death. Since speaking to the brother I have been informed that the children at the school were employed at the time of the burning in getting up potatoes, and that the fire was lighted at which to warm their hands.\n\nI respectfully request that a copy of this report be forwarded to the Supt. General of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and I would also respectfully suggest the stationing of an Indian Agent and a doctor at this place (Ile a la Crosse).\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd.

Certain alterations and improvements may be necessary to bring the buildings at this school up to the required standard. An officer of Department will be instructed to inspect and report on the improvements required at these schools. A reasonable time will be granted by the Department to allow you to have the necessary improvements made, and in the meantime, provided this Agreement is completed, the increased grant will be paid from the 1st. of April next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The number of logs the Principal wishes to cut is given as about 4,400 and the quantity of timber approximately 261,000 feet board measure. A small saw-mill is being operated in connection with the school for their own use and as a means of revenue and they require this permit in the interests of the school.\n\nThis matter was brought to the attention of your Department of the 17th of November, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The quantity of hay taken can be ascertained after it is cut when the required dues will be paid.\n\nThis application was before referred to in the Department's letter of November 17th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

The Department is aware that it is not practicable for you to have the children examined before they are admitted. The greatest care should, however, as in the past, be taken to recruit only healthy children and on the first occasion that a physician visits the school an examination should be made of all the children admitted between that time and the date of his previous visit and proper certificates forwarded to the Department.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory I have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, N.W.T.\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, file 117161, in which you make application on behalf of the Principal of the Lac la Plonge Indian Boarding school to cut timber on the shore and the islands of Lac la Plonge to the extent of some 261,000 feet B.M. I may say that there is no provision in the timber regulations covering the cutting of timber on Dominion lands whereby your request could be granted, and in addition to this the Minister has given strict instructions that timber is not to be cut on any island. If, however, you will furnish this Department with a description of a tract on the shore of a lake not exceeding one square mile, a portable saw-mill permit will be issued thereon as provided for by Section 41 of the enclosed regulations.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th March last, file 117161, in which you state that application has been received from the Principal of Lac la Plonge Indian Boarding School for permission to cut hay along the Beaver and La Plonge rivers, as shown on the plan which accompanied your communication.\n\nOn the Principal of the School in question making application to the Agent of Dominion Lands at Prince Albert, a hay permit will be issued in his favour on the tract applied for, on payment of the usual dues covering such quantity of hay as he may require in connection with his school; but no exclusive right to the hay on these lands can be granted to the School authorities, this Department reserving the right to issue permits on the tract to any settlers who may make application therefor. The rate of dues on such hay as may be required in connection with the school is 10 cents per ton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Assistant Secretary\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 8, 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to Your Lordship's communication received in November, last, in which Your Lordship makes certain requests on behalf of the Lac la Plonge Boarding School I beg to say that this Department has been in communication with the Department of the Interior regarding the applications for the use of timber and hay limits on Lac la Plonge, as well as for acquisition of the half section of land on which the school is situated with the following results:\n\nWith regard to the hay limits; on the Principal of the school making application to the Agent of Dominion Lands at Prince Albert a hay permit will be issued in his favour on the tract applied on payment of the usual dues covering such quantity of hay as he may require in connection with his school; but no exclusive rights to the hay on these lands can be granted to the school authorities, the Department of the Interior reserving the right to issue permits on the tract to any settlers who may make application therefor. The rate of dues on such hay as may be required in connection with the school is ten cents per ton. The Principal should make the application indicated above.\n\nIn reference to the application to cut timber on the shores and islands of the Lac la Plonge to the extent of some 261,000 feet board measure the Department of the Interior states that there is no provision in the timber regulations covering the cutting of timber on Dominion Lands whereby the request\n\nRight Rev. O. Charlebois, O.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Keewatin,\nThe Pas, N.W.T.\nrequest can be granted and in addition to this strict instructions have been given by the Minister that timber is not to be cut on any island. If, however, the Interior Department is furnished with a description of a tract on the shores of the lake not exceeding one square mile a portable saw-mill permit will be issued thereon, as provided for by Section 41 of the enclosed regulations.\n\nWith reference to the reservation of the half section of land for the purpose of the Indian Boarding School at Lac la Plonge the Principal of the school will be permitted to stake out the area required so that it may be reserved by the surveyor who is sent to lay out this district.\n\nThe Department trusts that this information will be sufficient and that it will meet the requirements of the Principal.\n\nProvision is made in the estimates for an enrollment of fifty pupils and until the Department receives official information that there is the required accommodation at the school for more than this number it cannot be exceeded. I might state that up to the present there has not been anything like the number provided for; the last returns showing only thirty-four.\n\nThe Department regrets that it cannot recoup the school for any expenditure already incurred in the way of building expenses, but the increased per capita grant provided under the new agreement will more than counterbalance the outlay.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI want to submit to you a question. The Lac La Plonge's Boarding School was formerly situated at l'\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse and was supported by the mission alone. Then the French language only was taught for many years. So now a great many people in that District understand and speak French. Very few understand English.\n\nIn a meeting called before me at \u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse, the question whether the French or the English should be taught in Lac La Plonge's Boarding School was brought up. They all agreed to say that their children should learn French first, but English should not be neglected. But you know yourself it is very hard to have Indian children to learn two languages in same time. They mix both together and at last they do not know one.\n\nI know the Department's intention is that English should be first thought in Boarding Schools. Personally I have no objection to it; but what to do on account of the fact that the French is generally used in that part of the country and on account of the will of the parents that children should be taught first in French.\n\nI wish you to tell me what the Department think about this case.\n\nWith the compliment of the season, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Keewatin\n\nD. Scott, Esq.\nSupt. Of Ind. Education\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 25, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 16th instant stating that at a meeting called at Ille a la Crosse the question whether the teaching at the Lac la Plonge Boarding School should be in English or French was brought up and that it is the wish of the parents that the pupils should first be taught in French.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that under Section 9 of the agreement between the Department and the management of Indian boarding schools it is stated that a school shall provide teachers and officers qualified to teach all the pupils in the ordinary branches of an English education. The Department sees no reason why this rule should be departed from. If French is the general language in use in the district the children will have no difficulty in acquiring it, especially as French is the mother tongue of the members of the staff.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

Charlebois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nLe Pas, Keewatin.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat La Plonge.\n\nMarch 31st 1912\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward you my\nSchool Report for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 1912.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Russell\nPrincipal.\nOct. 16th., 1912.\n\nThe Secretary of\nthe Department of Indians Affairs\nOTTAWA,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast winter I informed the Department by letter, that the Indians of the District of Isle & La Crosse required their children to be instructed principally in French language, at the Lake La Plonge School.\n\nThe answer has been that the instruction be simply given in English. I then transmitted this decision to the Rev. Father Principal and order was given to the teacher to teach in English exclusively. Now during my visit at Isle & La Crosse in August last, the Chief accompanied by a large number of Indians addressed to me the following protest:\n\n\"If English only is to be taught, we will withdraw our children or at least we will never allow others to come. We want our children to learn a little English, and above all French.\"\n\nI answered that the affair was not in my hands, but that it was relevant of the Department, and consequently that they should address all complaints to you. Together they decided to send you a letter concerning this matter. If they have not as yet done so, it is probably because they wish to have the consent of another Chief, absent at the time, and as you know communications are slow in those parts of the country.\"\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Father Angel, Principal of the Lake La Plonge School, who says the following:\n\n\"As regards the school I am very much embarrassed. The Rev. Fathers at Isle \u00e0 La Crosse and at Portage La Loche are unanimous in telling me that the Indians have in common accord decided to hold back their children from the School if French is not taught chiefly. What am I to do? I desire a decision without delay.\"\n\nI therefore pray the Department to reconsider this question and to give the decision called for. Knowing the dispositions of those Indians, I believe it to be wiser to grant their request; for they will certainly keep back their children and the school will lack in recruits.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Until the 22nd of this month you may address the answer to me at St. Peter's Church, Visitation Street, Montreal.\n\nAfter the 22nd address at Le Pas, Man.\nMEMORANDUM:-\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nBishop Charlebois, Vicar Apostolic of Keewatin, has again written the Department in regard to the language in which the teaching at the Lac la Plonge Boarding School is to be conducted.\n\nHis Lordship's first letter on this subject was dated the 16th of January of this year, in which he stated that at Ille a la Crosse, which was the predecessor of the Lac la Plonge School, French only was taught and consequently many of the Indians in the district understand and speak French, while very few have a knowledge of English. He says that all the Indians are agreed that their children should be taught French first, but that English should not be neglected. Bishop Charlebois was informed that in section 9 of the Agreement between the Department and the management of Indian boarding schools it is distinctly stated that the management will provide teachers.\nteachers and officers qualified to teach all the pupils in the ordinary branches of an English education and that the Department saw no reason why this rule should be departed from.\n\nHis Lordship again wrote the Department on the 16th ultimo stating that a large number of the Indians on his last visit to Ille a la Crosse addressed the following protest to him:- \"If English only is to be taught, we will withdraw our children or at least we will never allow others to come. We want our children to learn a little English, and above all French.\" He quotes a letter that he received from Rev. Father Ancel, Principal of the Lac la Plonge School, who says:- \"As regards the school I am very much embarrassed. The Rev. Fathers at Isle a la Crosse and at Portage La Loche are unanimous in telling me that the Indians have in common accord decided to hold back their children from the school if French is not taught chiefly. What am I to do? I desire a decision without delay.\" The Bishop asks the Department to reconsider this question and give the decision called for. Owing to the position of the Indians he believes it will be wiser to grant their request, for they will certainly keep back their children and the school will lack in recruits.\nrecruits.\n\nThe chief trouble about teaching English at this school, as I learned from the report of Mr. Rothwell, Paying Officer for Treaty No. 10, is that all the staff with the exception of one Sister have no knowledge of the English language and she is not proficient. The tendency showed that French was being taught more than English in this school and Mr. Rothwell says that some action should be taken to prevent the school staff from teaching French more than English.\n\nI consider that the school should live up to the Agreement which it signed and provide teachers who are able to give proper instruction in the ordinary English branches. French will no doubt be more generally spoken in the school than English, but there is no reason why the English teaching should be neglected. If the Indians in the west are ever to amount to anything, they must have a fair knowledge of the English language and this can only be secured by learning it in school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The first two bands are Chipewyan and the last Cree. The total number of Indians comprised in these three bands is 457. Cree and Chipewyan are the mother tongues of these Indians and any French they know has been acquired from the missionaries and traders who have gone amongst them and, as all the priests and staff of the Lac la Plonge Boarding School speak nothing but French, they naturally wish to preserve that language in the school irrespective of the disadvantage the Indian children will labour under if they do not acquire English. The teaching of English in all the boarding schools in the west is a sine qua non to their obtaining the government grant. They have all signed the agreement and I think they should be held to it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We heard that English language only is to be taught in our school. (See & Plung Boarding school). But we do not want that because so far, the French language has been used and for what reason we want our children will learn mostly French and also a little English.\n\nIf it is not done so, we shall not let go our children to school. It will be useless for them to learn English only, for they will not be able, when going out of school, to speak with their country people who understand French.\n\nHere is what we claim by this letter, and in this we speak in the name of our fellow subjects.\n\nJean Pemagishos, Chief.\nBaptiste Pemagishos, Councillor.\nJerome \u2014 \u2014 , Councillor.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sending you the translation of the Cree letter.

But I think it comes to the same than the Cree one.\n\nI told you last fall that those Indians of Kea la brass were quite excited about that language question. They spoke to me last summer about it. I told them that the change had been done by the Department and it was to the Department they had to oppose their claim.\n\nI know that the Department is determined to maintain the English teaching. On the other hand I know that these Indians are well determined to keep their children out of school if they are learning English. I am afraid that there will be some trouble.\nPersonally I have no more preference for the French teaching than for the English for Indian children. At Ouellette, you know, I never tried to improve the French because the parents were resisting to have English taught.\n\nBut in the Labrador District, it is different. Parents want the French for their children, and they have for reason that, out of the Indian language, it is French which is used in that District, and not English.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department should take into consideration the circumstances in which they are situated. After all, parents must be taught to determine which language is to be taught to their children.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Labrador.\nIndian Industrial School\nat Barral, La Plage\nMarch 31st, 1913\n\nFrank Pegg, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward\nthe Report of Barral Boarding School\nfor quarter ended March 31st, 1913.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, May 14, 1913.\n\nRight Rev.

According to what we hear, here in our school, which you know, it is desired to teach only English. So far as we are concerned this will not help us. In our neighbourhood French is used especially; that is why we desire very strongly that French be taught first of all, afterwards a little English. The French language in our opinion is quite the first; all the same, let a little English be taught to our children.\n\nNow every one says that, if you refuse to agree to this, it will be very difficult for us to send our children to the school. Why should it be desired to teach the children English, that would not help them with the people surrounding us, for they do not speak English when they leave school.\n\nWe share all these opinions on this subject; in testimony whereof we sign.\nOttawa July 30, 1913\n\nSirs,\n\nIn reply to your letter not dated asking that the teaching in the Lac la Plonge Boarding school be conducted in French first, and afterwards a little English, I beg to say that the Right Rev.

Chisholm, Inspector of Indian Agencies, on the Lac la Plonge Boarding School, dated August 27, 1913. Original on 117161/6.\n\nThe weakest feature of their training is in regard to the practical use of English. The language is used in the classes, but not to any extent elsewhere; and while the pupils may repeat in English an answer which they have memorized yet when an attempt is made to discuss the subject with them, however simple it may be, they are lost; they understand but little of what is said, and their power of expression has reached its limit.\n\nApart from the Cree and Chipewyan languages French is the language of the native population of this region. Most of the children know a little of it before coming to school. They hear it daily in school, and many of them speak it well. Situated as they are they will reap much advantage through life from a correct knowledge of French. On the whole they appear to know more French than English; and I have no doubt that in the classes they would show a greater intelligence if examined in French.\nExtract from the Report of Medical Officer G.N.Giles, M.D.,C.M\non the Annual Inspection of Treaty 10.\nOriginal on File 427024-32.\n\nLAC LA PLONGE MISSION\n\nI inspected the Lac la Plonge Mission School and found\nthe pupils in a satisfactory physical condition.

McKay, on the Treaty 10 District, Dated Oct. 18, 1915.\n\nOriginal on File 427001-32.\n\nLac la Plonge School.\n\nThe educational work they are doing is very good but there is one thing I would like to point out, and that is, that I do not think there is enough English spoken. They all talk French, and practically all the education they get is in this language. They are taught a little English, but I am of the opinion that there teaching should be in English. I found the children well cared for and their surroundings clean and sanitary in every way.\n\n(Sgd) Wm. McKay,\nPaying Officer,\nTreaty 10.\nOttawa, November 18, 1915.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nOn the 25th of January, 1912, the Department had the honour to call Your Lordship's attention to Section 9 of the agreement entered into with the Department for the maintenance and management of the Lac la Plonge Boarding School, which requires the school authorities to provide instructors and officers qualified to teach all the pupils in the ordinary branches of an English education.\n\nFrom a report received from the Paying Officer of Treaty No. 10, who visited this school while making the payments, it would appear that little or no English is taught in the school and practically all the education the children receive is given in French. As this is not living up to the terms of the agreement I have to request that Your Lordship will take the necessary steps to see that the obligations of the above named section of the agreement are carried out in future.\n\nWith this exception the report is favourable to the work of the school.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

No. 117161/1, re the English teaching in the Lac La Plonge Boarding School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that, according to the instructions received from the Department in 1912, I have notified the staff of the said School that the teaching should be given in English. Now last year, I have visited the school myself, I have been in the classes and I have found that the children, for their age, were reading, spelling and writing in English as well as in any other Indian school I have been. The teacher appeared to me well qualified to give a good English instruction. I could admit however a report stating that the English teaching is not enough efficacious, but never that \"little or no English is taught\". I am sure your Agent has misrepresented the truth.\n\nHowever I will keep in view your remark and I will do my best to render the English teaching satisfactory.\n\nI remain, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVic.

Nous serions dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 faire la demande pr\u00e9alable, si le gouvernement provincial voulait nous aider, et payer la pension des pupils dont les parents seraient incapables de le faire.\n\nActuellement, nos salles de classe ne sont pas assez grandes pour pouvoir admettre tous les enfants du Settlement (200 ou 25). Mais nous pouvons admettre les 6 ou 7 enfants des settlers demeurants.\nSi c'est \u00e0 de la Premi\u00e8re, et nous allons le faire, puisque votre d\u00e9partement nous y autorise. Ce n'est pas une attention suffisante pour \u00e9riger un salaire du gouvernement provincial.

I have seen the\nsettlers on this subject, and they inform me that it is\nimpossible for them to send their children unless they board\nat the school.\n\nIn order to admit them on these terms, it\nwould be necessary for us to make a considerable extension,\nwhich would be impossible for us to do this year. We would\nbe willing to do it next year if the provincial government would\nassist us and pay for the board of the pupils whose parents\nwould be unable to do so. At present our class-rooms are not\nsufficiently large to provide admission of all the children\nof the settlement(20 or 25), but we would be able to admit\nsix or seven children of settlers living on this side of the\nriver and we are going to do so since your Department has\nauthorized us. There is not a sufficient attendance to ask for\na salary from the provincial government; Nevertheless the latter\nwishes to give a gratuity to our teachers for this additional\nwork, and we are very grateful to it therefor.\n\nYour, &c.,\nJ.

The roof was renewed in 1917. The school is painted inside and outside, and is in fairly good condition.\n\nThis is how we figure the valuation of the school:\n\n- 10,100' of lumber at $60.00 = $606.00\n- 15000 Shingles at $5.00 = $75.00\n- Painting = $400.00\n- 14 Exterior Doors = $168.00\n- 52 Windows = $343.00\n- 20 Double Windows = $130.00\n- 50 Rolls of Paper = $300.00\n- 50 Barrels of Nails = $350.00\n- Work, Carpentry = $250.00\n- Interior Doors = $100.00\n- Work, Laborers (for cellar) = $200.00\n\nTotal = $2330.00\n\nThe heating apparatus, lighting, etc., are valued from the purchase prices entered in our books, to which we have added transport and labor. The other buildings are valued proportionally to the school. You will find hereunder their respective dimensions with the date of erection:\n\nRev.

This cellar with the roof are worth about $1500.00.\n\nI am giving the number of acres of broken lands and the cost of work separately. The Government presently gave the school one square mile of land.\n\nI am also inserting the valuation of the mill and the water power in case the Government would not allow any land, because by retaining the mill we need to be assured of the acquisition of the adjoining land.\n\n(Sgd.)

I regret to inform you that the Department cannot give intelligent consideration to your request for an increase of pupilage from 65 to 70, without still further information. The classrooms at the school are quite small and I should be pleased if you would intimate whether or not the half-day system is in use for all pupils. If the younger children are in the classroom both morning and afternoon\u2014a condition which obtains in practically all Indian residential schools, the Department cannot see its way clear to make an increase in the pupilage. You would do well to make a full explanation of the daily routine at the school.\n\nThis Department had some correspondence, in 1918, with the past principal and with the Provincial Department of Education, relative to the admission of children to the Beauval Indian Residential School as day pupils. Please intimate whether there are any children, not in residence, attending the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

February 13th, 1924.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of January 3, I beg to say the younger children are in class all day. If the Department does not consider it advisable to increase the number we close the question on the matter, I do not insist, but am willing to follow the regular method of the Department. It was only to protect a few more orphans. There are only two little children coming to class who are not in residence.\n\nThinking you kindly I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nMartin [signature]\nPrincipal.\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report on the Annuity Payments throughout Ile a La Crosse Agency, Treaty No. 10 for 1925.\n\nAt 3:30 P.M. the next day, we reached Beauval or La Plonge. We went ashore here and visited the boarding school. A reception was held for us by the staff and pupils, the latter singing songs of welcome for us. Some of the girls sang solos, which were rather nicely rendered. The boys executed some military exercises, which were well done. Their marching was perfect. After the reception I examined the work of the children in the class rooms. I found this work of a high standard especially in the upper grades. The blackboard work and oral arithmetic being good. The writing is very good. Reading is the weak point. The accent is very French and articulation indistinct, but this is offset to a certain extent by the excellency of the other work. Sister Adelin is in charge of the senior class room, while Sister Carrier teaches the juniors. Neither sister has a certificate, but are doing good work. Sister Adelin especially who has her classes well in hand and well disciplined. (There are 67 pupils in the school, but of this 67 only 23 are children of treaty Indians. The other 45 are half-breeds from Clear Lake, English River, Snake Lake, Portage la Loche and from around Beauval. It seems deplorable that this school should be filled with half-breeds when it could easily be filled with treaty Indian children from Canoe Lake, Clear Lake, Portage la Loche and English River Bands, all of whom are Roman Catholic.)\n\nThe school is kept very clean; the pupils well clothed and apparently well fed, as they all looked fat and healthy. The girls are taught to do housework, sewing, cooking, knitting etc. besides the class room work. The boys are taught farming, the care of stock, work around a saw mill. The saw mill is situated on the La Plonge River beside a waterfall which supplies the power. This fall drives the mill and matching machines. An extra flume is connected with a turbine wheel beneath a work shop, in which are installed, re sawing machines, planers, matchers, lathes, pumps and a dynamo. All this machinery is driven by water power. The school and all out buildings are lighted from this power, and all water used in the school and gardens is pumped from this work shop also. There is a farm of about forty acres under an oat and root crop. This crop was looking splendid at the time of my visit. The garden was also well advanced. Radishes and lettuce of splendid quality and size were partaken of at table. The saw mill I might mention was in operation while we were visiting. While I was examining the school and surroundings the doctor was busy among the children. Very little sickness was found among them, owing no doubt to the excellent care given by Sister Robinson who is a very capable woman.\n\nW. R. Taylor\nIndian Agent.\nRegina, Sask., Sept. 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a long report on the Treaty 10 trip, which was written by Mr. Indian Agent Taylor. The report gives a great deal of detailed information.\n\nI would draw your attention to the remarks made by the Agent with regard to the school at Beauval or La Plonge. You will notice that out of 67 children in attendance at this school, only 22 are treaty Indians. Does the Department pay for the 45 who are non-treaty? I cannot get this information here. Was the school built for the purpose of educating Indians or halfbreeds? If it was for the purpose of educating Indians steps should be taken to see that they are put in the school, as the Agent says this can be done quite easily. Apparently the school here is well run.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a report from Mr. Agent Taylor regarding his recent visit to the Beauval Indian Residential School. His general report on the school reflects credit on the management.\n\nRegarding the pupils in the school, his report reads as follows:\n\n\"There are 67 pupils in the school, but, of this 67, only 22 are children of treaty Indians; the other 45 are halfbreeds from Canoe Lake, English River, Snake Lake, Portage la Loche and from around Beauval. It seems deplorable that this school should be filled with halfbreeds when it could easily be filled with children from Canoe Lake, Clear Lake, Portage la Loche and English River Bands, all of whom are Roman Catholic.\"\n\nAs you are aware, Indian residential schools are for the purpose of educating treaty Indian children and the Department expects those recruiting for this class of school - especially in the case of outlying schools like Beauval - to make every possible effort to secure treaty Indian children and not halfbreeds. In view of Mr. Agent Taylor's report that Indian children can easily be secured, it would appear that the applications of half-breed children have been given prominence.\n\nI am confident that you will agree this condition cannot continue and I have therefore to request that you arrange for the early discharge of the halfbreeds at present in the school and replace them by treaty Indian children from the bands mentioned by Mr. Agent Taylor.\n\nPlease let me hear from you at your earliest convenience, advising what steps you are taking to carry out the instructions of the Department in this most important matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secret\n\nRev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nOttawa, Sept. 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing copy of Mr. Agent Taylor's report on his recent visit to the Beauval Indian Residential School. I have noted particularly the agent's remarks regarding the number of non-treaty Indians in the school. The Principal is being written and informed that he should make arrangements for the discharge of these children and the replacing of them by treaty Indian children from the bands mentioned by Mr. Agent Taylor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy & Secretary, Department Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter, No. I32-I-I of the 17th ultimo, just received today. I have no doubt of the good intention of Mr. Agent Taylor reporting that our school could easily be filled with treaty children from Clear Lake, English River, and Portage La Loche. He was led to that conclusion by the fact that in these places there is a great number of children which should be in our school.\n\nI agree with him there. But if Mr. Agent Taylor was acquainted with these children's parents and their dispositions, he would certainly not come to the same conclusion, without further consideration.\n\nThe Chipewyans up North are quite independent; they see the Agent only once a year to receive their pay, and that is all they care for, or expect from the Dept. They are regardless of their children's education. We have tried every means (except by force) to have their children. The very few who did consent, to send them, would not allow them to come back after a year or two.\n\nThe situation is quite different on reserves, where the Agent and even the Police can't get parents to send their children to school.\n\nAs far as I know, nothing has ever been done here to urge these Chipewyans to send their children to school.\n\nThe Department cannot expect us to do that kind of work; experience has shown that in doing so brings odium on the Principal, and school from both parents and children.\n\nIt is true that the majority of our pupils are half-breeds, but we do not try to deceive the Department on the admission of same, as on each form of application, I gave the th regarding each child.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWas not the Department free at that time to accept them or not? You can see by the inclosed letters of correspondence with the Department that nothing was done secretly, nor did we ever refuse to admit these children of the Bands mentioned above. On the contrary we have made every effort to have them in our school.\n\nOn these conditions will you not agree, that it is absolutely impossible for me to provide for an early discharge of the half-breed children, and replace them by treaty Indian children.\n\nOnce more this is impossible, unless the Department gives us some assistance either by an Agent or a Police, or the Chiefs, who would make the Indians understand, that they are obliged to send their children to school.\n\nI understand that the Department can refuse us to admit any more half-breeds in the future and secure help to replace them, but it is not fair to require immediate discharge, when I cannot find means to replace them, and the season is so advanced, the Rivers and Lakes are beginning to freeze, and makes traveling impossible.\n\nBesides this, the half-breeds living among the Indians, and mixed with Indians, at 150 miles from civilization, should be eligible for admission, according to the Circular I inclose herewith.\n\nAnother reason (and not the least) why I ask the Dept., to kindly delay the discharge of these half-breed children, is, that out of forty-five of these children, five only have their fathers and mothers, thirty-two are orphans of either father or mother, and eight are completely orphans. You can imagine, the difficulty to find at once, where to place these destitute children. Dear sir, I am most willing to comply with the desiderata, of the Department, but trust in your kindness, and charity that you will not send away these poor orphans.

(RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 17th of September #132-1-1, advising me that the Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School had been written to, requesting him to make arrangements for the discharge of certain non-treaty Indian children attending his school.\n\nI beg to say that His Lordship, Bishop Charlebois called on me today, and he informs me that to insist on these instructions being carried out immediately would work a hardship, not only on the school, but on the children that would be discharged. Many of these children are orphans, and in some cases, children of deceased soldiers.\n\nI can quite appreciate all that His Lordship says, in view of the fact that winter is now on, and he simply could not discharge these children at this time. My own opinion is that he should be given till next fall to get these half-breed children out of the school.\n\nHis Lordship points out that all these children were admitted as half-breeds, with the knowledge of the Department. In view of the circumstances I would ask you to extend the time until next fall.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI would be glad if you would give this matter your attention as soon as possible, as the school authorities feel they would like to have some assurance that we are not expecting prompt action in this matter.\n\nI might say that in conversation with His Lordship he advises me that he anticipates having difficulty with the Chipewyans, as these people are reluctant to send their children to school, and after they have been there for a year or two they insist on having them out. I have assured His Lordship that once we have the children in the school we will see that they are kept there for the proper period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, November 19, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo, with reference to half-breed children in the Beauval Residential School. Your explanations have been given careful consideration and in reply I desire to assure you the Department recognizes that it would not be practicable to insist on the immediate discharge of these children.\n\nIt is noted that you are quite prepared to comply with our wishes and it is felt that the great majority, at least, of these half-breed children should be discharged by June 30th, next. About that time, you should forward to the Department a list of those who have been discharged to that date and also report on those half-breed children who, you think, should be given special consideration by being allowed to remain in the school.\n\nIt is expected, of course, that Treaty Indian children will be recruited to replace the half-breed children that are discharged. I note that you anticipate some trouble in persuading the Treaty Indians to place their children in the school. Please advise me what action you consider department officials could take to assist you in this regard and your suggestions along this line will receive every possible attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This was a Saturday evening, and beyond looking over the school and outbuildings, and listening to a reception that was given to the party by the pupils which was carried on into the late evening, we did not extend our visit, as the next day was Sunday and I did not examine the children in the class rooms, as the Doctor was busy with them till late into the night. He will no doubt report on the state of their health. The work I saw was copy and exercise book work, together with sewing and fancy work done by the girls. The work on the whole was good. The arithmetic problems showed in some cases advanced calculations, while the neatness and care taken, reflect credit on the pupils.\n\nW. R.

Institution on the north side of the province Monday night died in an attempt to save the children.\n\nCommiss. Bock, Saskatchewan Provincial police, of North Battleford, 400 miles south of the scene of the tragedy, will go north Battleford today and will leave immediately by automobile. He will travel to Beaulav by canoe down the Beaver river. Dr. M. McMillan of Edmonton will accompany him as coroner. The two men cannot reach Beaulav before Saturday at the earliest.\n\nThe charred bodies of nineteen boys, ranging in age from seven to twelve years, and the remains of a heroic sister, rested tonight in an improvised morgue in the small hamlet of Beaulav, Sask., while investigators sped to the scene of one of the most tragic fire disasters in the history of this province.\n\nTRAPPED IN DORMITORIES.\n\nDetails of the midnight fire which destroyed the Catholic school at the isolated village on Monday night are still being gathered. It is stated that the fire enveloped the structure so rapidly that the adult members of the mission were powerless to save the boys trapped in one of the dormitories. Twenty-three children were rescued from the flames, most of whom were led to safety by Sister Lee, who gave her own life in a valiant effort to reach the helpless boys.\n\nThe Sister Superior of the mission was the first to raise the alarm. Awakened by the roar of the flames and the crash of falling timbers she rushed to the alarm bell then ascended the central staircase and boys' dormitories where she called upon the panic-stricken occupants to escape by the stairs she had used. Unheeding, they crowded to the main stairway but here faced with a rush of flames which engulfed the floor below. Caught between two sheets of flame the boys then became panic-stricken. Scrambling up the corridor, they sought a way to safety, but most of them collapsed as the dense smoke and heat enveloped them. It was in this corridor and at the foot of the main staircase that all nineteen bodies were later located.\n\nNUN AND NINETEEN CHILDREN PERISH IN MISSION FIRE:\n\nBeaulav R.C. Institution on Lac La Plonge Destroyed.\n\nLocated in Isolated Section of N. Saskatchewan.\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, Sask., Sept. 21\u2014Nineteen children and Sister Lee were burned to death and a priest whose name has not been learned, was so seriously burned that he is expected to survive, when they slept when fire destroyed the isolated Catholic Mission on Lac La Plonge, Monday night, according to word brought by launch which made the 130-mile trip to Big River, Sask., today. Forty-five survivors were saved. The launch came out for supplies and clothing and those on board were able to give only meager details of the tragedy. Dr. A. Amos, Regina, who was sent to Lac La Plonge, six miles north of Lac La Plonge, to open a new Grey Nun's hospital at that place, hastened to the mission by airplane.\n\nAccording to the fragmentary reports, the fire started in the attic in the boys' dormitory. The flames seized upon the dry frame structure and within a few minutes were devouring everything around the building.\n\nScene of Horror.\n\nThe eager flames and their reflection from the waters of the lake lit up a scene of indescribable horror. The children who made their way to safety by the blazing building huddled in the circle of light and heard the screams of those trapped in the flames. Here and there nothing could be done to help, as the furious heat prevented any attempt to enter the mission, and soon the structure was a mass of smoking ruins.\n\nIt is understood that all the children in the mission were Indians, but their names were not obtained.\n\nGovernment officials and telegraph companies put forth every effort to get additional information of the tragedy today, but few details trickled out.\n\nThe Beaulav Mission is in charge of Father Lajauanesse, of the Oblate Fathers, who is assisted by Father Ancel and Father Adair, eight brothers of the order and eight sisters of the congregation. The heads of the mission are: Sister Superior Raymond, Sister Cartier, Sister Houn\u00e9 and others.\n\nThe mission is one of the oldest in the north. The buildings, a mixture of lumber constructed and fitted on the hot air principle, and the institution operated its own power and light plant. The fire was the third to occur within the last few years.\n\nIDENTITY OF SISTER.\n\nEDMONTON, Alta., Sept. 21\u2014According to private advices received here, the Sister who died at Beaulav Mission was Sister Lee, a native of Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nWAS LARGE FRAME BUILDING.\n\nREGENA, Sask., Sept. 21\u2014Hon. J. M. Ulrich, minister of Health for Saskatchewan, and Dr. M. M. Seymour, deputy minister, returned only yesterday afternoon from a visit paid at Beaulav. They attended to the vaccination and inoculation of the children.\n\nDr. Ulrich describes the school as a large frame building. It was a Federal government institution under the administration of the Grey Nuns.\n\nBeaulav, Dr. Ulrich said, is the northernmost point in the north country of the Oblate Mission, and besides, the school there is a farm with several large buildings. It is centered in the midst of bush land, and the mission has a clearing of about 140 acres.\n\nEfforts immediately make Beaulav their headquarters.\n\nIndian children from practically all the north country attend school there. Dr. Ulrich declared the school had done fine work among its pupils and he was inexpressibly shocked at the news of the disaster.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have read with deep regret, since my return from 3 months tour in the West, of the dreadful fatality at Lac-la-Plonge, Sack.\n\nI deeply sympathise with you and Mrs. Horner also the members of your staff in this sad fate and loss of life.\n\nKindly forward the enclosed letter to the proper party for me and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\nArthur Barnier\n\n26th Sep 1927.\nSeptember 28th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Barner,\n\nI have your very kind and sympathetic letter with reference to the recent destruction by fire of the new boarding school at Beauval and the heavy and regrettable toll of life.

I am very glad that you were able to give such prompt attention to the survivors who were suffering.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nG. F. Amyot, Esq., M.D.,\n\u00cele \u00e0 la Crosse,\nvia Big River,\nSask.\nTo the Indian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThe Indian schools of Canada and the Church among the Indians experienced last Monday night the 19th day of September 1927, the saddest accident in their history. The Department of Indian Affairs is anxious, I know, to have a detailed account of the incident.\n\n1) Description of the School. The third floor contained two dormitories, one at each end of the house. The southern dormitory housed the boys and the northern, the girls. In the centre, at the top of the stairs, was a space occupied by the water tank and a storeroom. Two doors lead from this: one to the boys dormitory and one to the girls. That into the former room was always opened into the landing. Five staircases lead to the dormitories. One in the centre previously mentioned and two at the outer end of each dormitory. One of these was entirely outside the building with doors opening outwards. The other was just inside the wall arriving close to the outside door. Stairs, platforms and doors were all in good condition and the doors of boys dormitory were not locked according to Father Seguin.\n\n2) Origin of the fire and its development. It began in the centre around the furnace in which a small fire was made about five o'clock P.M. The flames apparently spread south through the main floor corridor, all the doors of which must have been opened, and mounted to the boys dormitory by the nor-\nAt the same time, the flames mounted the main staircase to the third floor just outside the centre exit from the boys dormitory.\n\nApparently, Sister Lee, in charge of the boys, seeing the outside door barred by fire, tried to make any exit through the centre with the boys and again was met by flames. Thus they were trapped between two fires and all perished. The fire invaded the whole building in about three or four minutes. At first, the fire was confined to the centre and northern parts of the building, thus giving the girls a better chance to escape.\n\nActivity of the staff. Sister Superior first heard the crashing about 11:30 P.M., she rushed down to ring the alarm bell, woke up all the sisters who rushed out in night attire and were immediately followed by a blast of smoke and flames. Sister Superior still clad in her night clothes, then proceeded by the outside stairway to the boys dormitory where she also gave the alarm. By this time, the smoke and flames had made an entrance to the second floor impossible from the south. Apparently, as stated above, the inmates of the boys dormitory wasted valuable time by trying to find, as they thought, a safer exit by the centre stairway at the bottom of which all remains except one were found.\n\nSister Superior cried fire from the gallery and this woke up the Fathers. Father Gagnon repeated the cry of fire and also rang an alarm bell in the Fathers house. I slipped my casebook on and rushed out in bare feet followed by Father Gagnon and Brother Macdonald. I noticed that that the south western corner of the school was all in flames and realizing that it was hopeless to attempt any rescue from there proceeded to the girls dormitory.\nAt the same time, Brother Beaudoin and others tried to extinguish the flames around the dormitory by use of the chemical fire extinguishers. It dampened the fire for an instant and at this time a great smoke arose, but again the flames burst forth and rapidly spread. The girls filed out, clad in night attire, in perfect order, many of the older ones carrying their small companions in their arms, thus saving their lives. I marveled at the cool calm way the children behaved. Many of them even carrying bedding and articles of clothing along with them. The sister in charge made sure that all girls were out of the building before leaving herself.\n\nThen, Father Gagnon who had followed me passed into the dormitory now filled with dense smoke and attempted to reach the boys this way. While crossing the room, he heard a faint cry which was quickly drowned by the roar of the fire. I also heard this cry but nobody else did. It was the only cry heard, all being made so quick. Apparently the roar was due to the floor collapsing precipitating all the boys and the sisters to their death. Father Gagnon attempted to open the communicating door but fell suffocated by smoke. On the floor, the air was better and when I called to him, he was just able to answer: \"I am lost, where are you?\" I continued calling \"Here, here\" taking between each cry a breath of air outside the door. Father Gagnon guided by my voice was able to find the door and staggered just inside. I caught and pulled him out into the fresh air exhausted.\n\nRealizing that the school was beyond saving and as the boys dormitory was completely engulfed in flame, we made an attempt to save the Fathers house and outbuildings. The distance between the school and the house is only about 20 yards but finally with combined help of the staff and bystanders (workmen attached to the mission).\nand the mail carrier) using all available water the house and buildings were finally saved though badly scorched. The extinguishers were refilled and successfully used in this work. When the water tanks gone out water was carried by bucket from the river. Within about fifteen minutes from the time fire was first discovered, the walls of the school had fallen inward and nothing was left but a mass of burning ruins. The chapel burned last as it was on the back of the school. Father Gagnon seeing the danger to the warehouse containing provisions, etc., which was quite close to the chapel, proceeded to protect it from the flames. This was also saved. When all danger was passed, I gathered all the people into a group and recited prayers for the repose of the souls of the poor Indian children and the sister who had been so suddenly taken.\n\nThe survivors were later housed and fed in the Father's house where they are at the present time. Assistance was given by the neighbouring Indians when possible; clothes for the children and sisters were brought from the mission at \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse by Father Rossignol as speedily as possible.\n\n4) Precautions taken against fire. As noted, we had five staircases in good repair, of which two were outside, one at each end of the school; chemical extinguishers in convenient places ready for immediate use; ladders from the ground to the top of the building at the chimney. The weather turning cold, Father Gagnon before using the furnace, closely inspected it and its surroundings to ascertain if all was in proper order and safe to light. Nothing was detected. The complete heating plant was in perfect order. This was three days previous to the fire. The same Father walked around the outside of the school at ten o'clock the night of the firesaying\nhis rosary and at that time did not notice any smoke or sign of fire.\n\nIf Sister Superior had not given the alarm, and acted as she did, in three or four minutes, all the inmates of the school probably would have perished. The absence of wind and the fact that the bush, houses and buildings were still damp from the heavy rains of the previous days assisted the firefighters in containing the fire to the one building.\n\nI immediately summoned Dr. Amyot from Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse who quickly arrived by a forestry aeroplane to attend the survivors. He reports that all are in good physical condition except a few minor burns and slight effects from smoke.\n\n5) Losses: One sister; sister Lea.

Charlebois, S.S.S.\nBishop of Keewatin.\nBEAUVAL MISSION FIRE\n\nThe jury in the Beauval Mission fire case here have exonerated everyone from blame in the matter, which is probably quite right so far as those directly in charge of the mission were concerned. The fact that Sister Lea lost her life in a heroic effort to save the children, and one of the men employed with the mission risked his life in similar effort is sufficient testimony to the fidelity of those in charge of the mission.\n\nThe loss however of nineteen children who were wards of the Government lost their lives in a fire that was only too likely under the conditions which should not have existed would warrant much stronger criticism than the lines of the jury \"that the difficulties great buildings of this nature with proper equipment in case of fire.\" If it is worth while educating the Indians and congregating them in missions for that purpose, it is only fair that proper buildings be constructed and that the fire hazards be eliminated to the fullest possible extent. In our opinion the jury would have been fully justified in bringing in a verdict of criminal negligence against the Department of Indian Affairs, the guardians of these young Indians. The Department showed no negligence according to the implication contained in the verdict of the jury.\n\nFollowing the Montreal theatre fire of last month the papers were filled with warnings and information of the activities of fire chiefs and others in regard to making safe all public buildings, but the surveillance soon ceased and it is doubtful if the lesson proved of lasting benefit.\nMEMO - Letter from Father L.M.Adam, Principal of the Beauval Indian Residential School, re number of teachers.\n\nThe total number of children attending the temporary school at Beauval is 25. Of this number some are in grade 1st, some in grade 2nd, some in grade 3rd, some in grade 4th and some in grade 5th.\n\nThe impossibility of one teacher alone taking charge of the five grades.\n\nIt does not seem practical to have two teachers for so small a number of pupils.\n\n- The staff has been greatly reduced since the fire.\n- There is no accommodation for two class-rooms.\n\nThe only way out of the difficulty would be to suppress for a time the 4th and 5th grades, in which there are only four girls, and to train these girls in household economy only. Would the Department kindly allow this?\nRegina, Sask., Aug. 25th, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your instructions to me to pay annuity and report on matters in Isle a la Crosse Agency, I have the honor to report as follows.\n\nBEAUVAL SCHOOL\n\nFrom here the party went to Big River where we received the camp equipment and, after repairing canoes, left for Beauval school on June 15th, where we arrived on Sunday afternoon, the 17th. This school is located at Lac la Plorge, and is in charge of Rev. Fr. Adam; the main building of this school was destroyed by fire on September 19th last, and the staff have been carrying on under difficulties ever since. They built a temporary house last fall which is used for all purposes from cooking to classroom work and is, of course, overcrowded, but the best that can be had until the new school is built. Two boys and 24 girl pupils are kept at present. The place is very clean and tidy. The classroom work of the pupils present is well up to the standard, and the children are well mannered, healthy and well clothed; 26 were in attendance at the time of my visit.\n\nThis school and mission is about 25 years old; there is a river through the property and the staff have harnessed the water power which they use to operate a saw-mill planer, run an electric light plant, and for all sort of purposes. They have a ram installed to supply water to the dwellings, school, barns, gardens etc.\n\nAbout 65 cattle are kept here, and they had 18 cows milking at the time of my visit, so the pupils get all the milk they can use; they get the eggs from over 150 hens, so it can be seen they are well and correctly fed. There are 18 horses kept here to do the farm work in summer and haul freight in winter.\n\nThere was about 30 acres of the finest looking, clean, oat crop standing 9 inches high, and it will turn out well I imagine. Also a field of barley, seven acres of potatoes, two of beets, carrots, etc. There are 52 acres of crop and 18 acres of pasture here.\n\nThe saw mill was about to close down after having cut about 150,000 F.B.M. of lumber this spring. There are large hay flats near the school used for pasture and crop.\n\nMy long explanation of what is being done here by the staff, assisted by the Indian boy pupils, is to show that the latter are being taught how to make a living after they leave the school.\n\nJ.

Le souvenir de cette h\u00e9catombe est encore bien vivant dans nos coeurs, comme aussi dans le v\u00f4tre, je n'en doute pas. Nous pleurons les vingt victimes que cet incendie a couch\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment dans la tombe et nous d\u00e9plorons la destruction d'une b\u00e2tisse qui avait co\u00fbt\u00e9 tant de travail et de sacrifices aux missionnaires. La mort des premi\u00e8res est irr\u00e9parable, mais la perte de l'\u00e9cole est chose r\u00e9parable. Or c'est \u00e0 ce sujet que je viens attirer votre attention. Le but de cette lettre est de solliciter le secours du Gouvernement pour faire sortir de ses gendres un monument que le z\u00e8le et la pi\u00e9t\u00e9 des missionnaires avaient \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour subvenir \u00e0 l'instruction et \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation des enfants indiens.\n\nTout d'abord, doit-on construire? Il me semble que poser cette question c'est la r\u00e9soudre, car il est \u00e9vident qu'il doit en \u00eatre ainsi. L'Ecole de Beauval est une des plus anciennes de l'Ouest canadien. Il est vrai que ce n'est que vers 1905 qu'elle est devenue officiellement \u00e9cole indienne, subventionn\u00e9e par le Gouvernement, mais elle existait depuis 1860 comme \u00e9cole de mission \u00e0 l'Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse. Il ne serait pas \u00e0 l'honneur du D\u00e9partement de laisser dispara\u00eetre une telle institution. Sa disparition laisserait tous les enfants indiens du grand district de l'Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de se faire instruire, car il n'y a pas d'autre \u00e9cole pens\u00e9e o\u00f9 ils pourraient aller, et les \u00e9coles du jour, on le sait, ne sont pas pratiques dans cette partie du pays. On peut affirmer, il me semble, qu'il ne serait pas \u00e9quitable que le D\u00e9partement indien laiss\u00e2t laiss\u00e2t plus de cent cinquante enfants indiens sans aucune chance de se faire instruire.\n\nObjecte-t-on que dans cette partie du pays, le sol n'est pas apte \u00e0 la culture et ne permet pas aux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de demander leurs moyens de subsistance \u00e0 la terre? Non assur\u00e9ment. Tout d'abord, l'instruction n'est pas requise seulement pour pratiquer la culture. Il y a bien d'autres fonctions o\u00f9 l'instruction est utile, m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire. Je connais bon nombre d'anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de nos \u00e9coles qui gagnent honn\u00eatement leur vie gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leur instruction, comme employ\u00e9s des diverses Compagnies de traite des fourrures.\nActuellement, cette partie du pays se remplit de blancs peu scrupuleux et avides de lucratif. Comment nos indiens pourront-ils leur faire face s'il n'ont aucune instruction? Sans elle ils seront facilement victimes de la cupidit\u00e9 de ces avanturiers et \u00e9tant dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de subvenir \u00e0 leurs propres besoins ils seront de plus en plus \u00e0 la charge du Gouvernement.\n\n\u00c0 Beauval comme dans ses environs, l'agriculture n'est pas aussi facile que dans le sud de la Saskatchewan \u00e0 cause de la for\u00eat qui recouvre le sol. Tout de m\u00eame l'exp\u00e9rience de plusieurs ann\u00e9es prouve que la culture n'est pas impossible et qu'elle est m\u00eame tr\u00e8s r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice. Ainsi cette ann\u00e9e, on a, \u00e0 la mission de Beauval, trente acres de belle avoine, cinq d'orge, sept de patates et deux de carottes, de betteraves et de choux de Siam. Il y a en plus dix-huit acres en p\u00e2turages comme aussi un grand jardin o\u00f9 poussent les l\u00e9gumes de toutes sortes. On y compte encore soixante-cinq b\u00eates \u00e0 cornes dont dix-huit vaches \u00e0 lait, cent-cinquante poules, quelques cochons et dix-huit chevaux de travail. Le climat y est \u00e9galement favorable; le bl\u00e9 comme l'avoine y m\u00fbrissent tr\u00e8s bien tous les ans. Il est donc \u00e9vident que la culture est possible \u00e0 cet endroit, m\u00eame qu'elle r\u00e9ussit tr\u00e8s-bien.\n\nTout le monde pr\u00e9voit que dans un avenir assez rapproch\u00e9, les indiens auront \u00e0 demander leur subsistance \u00e0 la terre \u00e0 cause du manque de poisson et de fourrures. Actuellement, la chose leur est, pour ainsi dire, impossible, car ils n'ont aucune notion du maniement d'une ferme. Mais quand les jeunes gens auront pass\u00e9 cinq \u00e0 huit ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole o\u00f9 ils auront tous les jours l'opportunit\u00e9 de travailler sur la ferme de l'\u00e9cole, ils deviendront familiers avec ce genre de travail, y prendront go\u00fbt, et pour peu qu'on leur accorde l'assistance post-scolaire ils deviendront facilement fermiers. Leur avenir sera alors assur\u00e9. C'est un fait que les indiens du nord sont arri\u00e9r\u00e9s sur ceux du sud. Or ce n'est pas en les privant des bienfaits de l'\u00e9cole qu'ils pourront s'am\u00e9liorer. De plus tous les districts du nord ont leurs \u00e9coles pensionnats, pourquoi celui de l'Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse en serait-il priv\u00e9?\n\nMais certains disent peut-\u00eatre: \"Si les autorit\u00e9s religieuses d\u00e9sirent une \u00e9cole qu'elles la construisent...\" \u00c0 cela je r\u00e9ponds que nous avons \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 nos d\u00e9pens l'\u00e9cole qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 incendi\u00e9e l'automne dernier, mais nous ne sommes pas dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 recommencer. Quand m\u00eame nous le voudrions, nous ne le pourrions pas, faute de ressources suffisantes. Le confort requis dans les \u00e9coles modernes est trop grand et trop co\u00fbteux pour que nous puissions affronter de telles d\u00e9penses. On n'en est plus aux temps h\u00e9ro\u00efques o\u00f9 le pain n'apparaissait jamais sur la table et o\u00f9 l'invariable menu se composait de p\u00e9mikan et de poisson. Il n'y a que le Gouvernement qui puisse faire face \u00e0 une installation moderne. Cel\u00e0 ne veut pas dire que nous nous d\u00e9sistons de toute obligation, loin de l\u00e0 nous sommes pr\u00eats \u00e0 y mettre du n\u00f4tre mais il faut que le D\u00e9partement fasse aussi sa grosse part. D\u00e9j\u00e0 la n\u00f4tre est consid\u00e9rable. Nous avons \u00e0 la\ndisposition de l'\u00e9cole une belle grande maison, bien am\u00e9nag\u00e9e et chauff\u00e9e \u00e0 la vapeur pour le personnel masculin et les grands gar\u00e7ons, deux grandes et magnifiques \u00e9tables avec toutes les am\u00e9liorations modernes, une p\u00e2cherie et un poulailler de toute premi\u00e8re qualit\u00e9; un beau grand hangar, une remise o\u00f9 se trouvent tous les instruments agricoles: charrues de toutes sortes, fauc\u00e9es, moissonneuse, machine \u00e0 battre \u00e0 vapeur, \u00e9pin \u00e0 vapeur, presse \u00e0 foin, arrache-souche etc etc... Une digue en pierre jet\u00e9e sur la rivi\u00e8re La-Plonge tout \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'\u00e9cole fournit l'\u00e9nergie n\u00e9cessaire pour activer un moulin \u00e0 scie o\u00f9 la machinerie au complet, permet de manufacturer le bois sur place. \u00c0 proximit\u00e9 du moulin, s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve une grande boutique et une forge munies d'outils et de machines. Dans cette boutique, une turbine \u00e0 eau de moindre dimension que celle qui active le moulin et qui peut fonctionner tout l'hiver, met en mouvement une dynamo capable de fournir la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique \u00e0 tout l'\u00e9tablissement. Un b\u00e9lier hydraulique distribue, d'une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s \u00e9conomique, l'eau aux maisons et aux \u00e9tables. C'est l\u00e0 il me semble une part digne d'\u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9e.\n\nQuelle sera maintenant la part du Gouvernement? Il me semble qu'apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 de ces faits, elle ne manquera pas d'\u00eatre grande et g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse. Toutefois tout ce que nous demandons pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9 prochain, c'est qu'un subside de $25,000.00 nous soit accord\u00e9 afin de nous permettre de jeter de solides bases et de mettre en bonne voie de construction cette \u0153uvre qui nous tient tant \u00e0 c\u0153ur.\n\nAvec l'espoir que mon humble requ\u00eate recevra un accueil favorable, je demeure, cher Monsieur,\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n+O. Charlebois, O.M.\n\nVicaire Apostolique du Keewatin.\nThis day is the sad anniversary of the fire that destroyed the Beauval school. The recollection of that holocaust is still living in our hearts as it is in yours. I have no doubt. We are mourning the twenty victims who were laid in their graves and we deplore the destruction of a building which had cost so much labour and sacrifice of our missionaries. The death of the victims is irremediable but the loss of the school can be restored. It is on this matter that I wish to draw your attention. The aim of my letter is to solicit the help of the Government to raise again from its ashes a monument which had been elevated by the zeal and piety of the missionaries, to provide for the tuition and education of the Indian children.\n\nFirst of all should we rebuild? It seems to me that to bring up the question is to solve it; for it is evident that this should be done. The Beauval school is one of the oldest in the Canadian West. It is true that about 1905 it officially became an Indian school subsidized by the Government but it was in existence since 1860 as a mission school at l'\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse. It would not be of any credit to the Department to let an institution of this kind disappear. Its disappearance would leave all the children of the large district of l'\u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse without the opportunity of obtaining any education as there is no other boarding school where they could go; and the day schools as it is well known, are not practical in this section of the country.\n\nI may venture to say that it would not be equitable for the Department to leave more than 150 Indian children without any chance of being educated.\n\nWould there be such objection raised that in this\npart of the country the land is not suitable for agriculture and does not allow the graduated pupils to earn their living from the product of the soil? Surely not. First of all instruction is not given only for agriculture. There are many other activities in life where education is necessary. I know a large number of old pupils from our schools who earn their living very honorably on account of their education as employees of several fur trading companies.\n\nAt present this section of the country is filling with unscrupulous white people whose aim is gain. How will our Indians cope with the situation if they are uneducated? Without education they would be easily victimized by the greed of these adventurers and if they fall to a state where they will be unable to provide for their own subsistence they will then be more than ever a burden to the Department.\n\nAt Beauval and in the surroundings as well, agriculture is not so easy as it is in the South of Saskatchewan on account of the forests covering the ground. However the experience of several years proves that farming is possible and even profitable. For instance this year we have at the mission of Beauval, 30 acres of fine oats, five of barley, seven of potatoes and two of carrots, beets and siamese cabbages. There are 16 acres of pasture land and a large garden where vegetables of all kinds are grown. There are 65 cattle out of which we have 18 milk cows; 150 chicken, a few pigs and 18 draught horses. The climate is also favorable; wheat and oats ripen every year. It is therefore evident that farming is possible in this locality and that it is even successful.\n\nEvery one foresees that in the near future the Indians will have to turn to the soil to gain their living as a result of the depletion of the land of fur bearing animals and fish. At the present moment this is almost impossible to them, as they have no idea of the management of a farm. But after the young men will have followed the school for 5 to 8\nyears, where every day they will have the opportunity to work on the school farm, they will familiarize with this kind of work, will develop a taste for it, and if they are given any post-scolar help they will easily become successful farmers.\n\nTheir future will then be assured. It is a fact that the Indians of the North are not as far advanced as those from the South. It is not therefore by depriving them of the benefit of a school education that they will improve. Furthermore, all the districts in the North have their boarding schools, why then should Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse be deprived of one?\n\nIt may be said that \"If the religious authorities wish for a school they can build one\"; to this I wish to say that we erected at our expense the school which was burnt last Fall, but we are not in a position to do it again. Even if we wanted to we could not on account of our lack of fund. The necessary comfort in a modern school is too large and costly for us to attempt to make such expenditure. We are no longer living the heroic time when bread was never served on the table and when the invariable menu was composed of pemikan and fish. Only the Government can defray the cost of a modern installation. This does not mean that we want to desist ourselves of all obligations, far from it we are ready to co-operate, but the Department must do its share. Ours is already very large. We have at the disposal of the school a fine large building well furnished and heated by steam for the male members of the staff and grown up boys. There are two large and magnificent stables with all the modern improvements, a piggery and a hen house all of the best quality; a large barn; a shed where the agricultural implements, plows of all kinds, mowers, harvesting machines; a steam threshing machine, a steam engine, a hay press, a stump lifting machine, etc., A stone dam across Laflange river, right next to the school supplies the necessary power to operate a saw mill with all its machinery, making it possible to manufacture lumber on\nthe spot. In the proximity of the mill there is a large shop and a smith's forge with tools and machinery. In the shop there is a smaller turbine than that supplying power to the mill, which can run all winter; it operates a dynamo of sufficient strength to furnish light to the whole establishment. A hydraulic pump distributes water in a very economical manner to the buildings and stables. This constitutes a share which should be appreciated.\n\nWhat should be the share of the Government?\n\nIt seems to me that after submitting the facts it should be generously large. However all we ask for next summer is that a grant of $25,000.00 be given us to start the construction of an institution we have so much at heart.\n\nHoping that my humble request will be favorably received, I remain, Sir,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n(sgd) O. Charlebois, O.M.I.\n\nBishop of Keewatin.\nOctober 5, 1928.\n\nDear Bishop Charlebois:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 20th ultimo, urging the Department to provide a grant of $25,000, so that the reconstruction of the Beauval Indian Residential School can be commenced next year. I shall have an opportunity of discussing the building programme with the Honourable Mr. Stewart in the near future, and at that time Your Lordship's representations will be given due consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

When the return was first received it was noted that no information was given as to the hand or hands to which some of the pupils belong and, after enquiry, I am informed that these children are half-breeds who were admitted to the school a long time ago. In this connection, I might draw attention to Department No. 132-1-1, dated 18th November, 1925, with which was enclosed a letter addressed to the Reverend Principal of this school on the subject of the presence at the school of half-breed children. I gathered from the contents of that letter that the Department desired the school to discharge these half-breeds and replace them with children of treaty Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

For your information, I enclose a copy of a letter which is being directed to the present Principal, Rev. M. Adam, O.M.I.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 17th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn forwarding the September quarter return of the Beauval Indian Residential School, Mr. Commissioner Graham points out that the names of eight half-breed children are shown on the rolls.\n\nWith regard to half-breed children attending the Beauval Residential School, I would refer you to official letters of September 17th, 1925, and November 19th, 1925, addressed to the former Principal, Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\n\nYou will note from these letters that the Department expressed a desire to have all half-breed children discharged and to replace them by Treaty Indian children. Mr. Indian Agent Taylor, in a report dated September 6th, 1925, stated that sufficient children could easily be secured from Canoe Lake, Clear Lake, Portage la Loche and English River Bands, all of whom are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will keep our requirements in mind and discharge the half-breed children at present in the school at the earliest opportunity and, when the new Beauval School is erected, first consideration should be given to the recruiting of Treaty Indian children from the bands mentioned by Mr. Agent Taylor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nRev. M. Adam, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMO\n\nLetter from Father Adam, Principal of the Indian School at Beauval, dated Jan. 6th 1929.\n\nRe Admission of Half-breed children into the School.\n\n--------\n\nLetter from Mr. McLean, dated Dec. 17th, in which Father Adam is asked to follow closely the instructions given by the Department to his predecessor, Father Lajeunesse, concerning the admission of children to the Beauval School.\n\nThese instructions were:\n(a) - That the children of half-breeds outside of the treaty should not be admitted to the School.\n(b) - That such children, now in the school, should be dismissed as soon as possible.\n\nClause (a) has been strictly complied with since the above instructions were given.\n\nConcerning clause (b) the following considerations are submitted to the Department:\n\n1. The children of half-breeds outside of treaty who are now in the School were admitted therein by Father Lajeunesse legally and in good faith. Legally because such children were admitted in accordance with a circular from Mr. Scott dated Nov. 9th, 1922 in which it is stated that: \"There is a departmental ruling to the effect that half-breed children living the Indian mode of life on a reserve are eligible for admission to the boarding school, &c.\"\n\nIn Good Faith, for, (i) on the admission sheets there was never the least attempt at misrepresentation; the children were set down for what they really were; (ii) children of treaty Indians were never refused admission into the School; (iii) children of half-breeds outside of treaty were admitted only in extreme cases; most of them were orphans.\n\nConsidering that the Department has knowingly and freely sanctioned the admission of the above-named children, it seems to have at the same time, and thereby, given to the School a moral pledge that the said children would be kept until they reached the age of 18. Had the principal been able to foresee that the children admitted would have to be dismissed in a couple of years, it is quite probable\nthat he would not have admitted them at all.\n\nThere are now in the School 5 children, all girls, whose parents are half-breeds outside of treaty. Six of these are orphans without father and mother.\n\nWhat Father Adam proposes to do:\n\nHe will dismiss two of the children mentioned above during the course of the winter. They live at a post which is very distant from the School, but they will be sent there at the very first occasion available.\n\nOne has been placed as a maid-servant in the hospital at Ille-\u00e0-la-Crosse. Another will be 15 years of age soon and will be dismissed at the end of the year, or immediately if the Department requires it.\n\nThe four remaining children are orphan girls without parents and Father Adam is at a loss to know how he is to dispose of them. He will await the decision of the Department in the matter.\n\nJ.A. Lajeunesse.\nOttawa, January 21st, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReverend Father Lajeunesse has forwarded to the Department a memorandum in connection with the half-breed children in the Beauval Residential School. It is noted that two of these children will be discharged during the course of the present winter; that another has been placed as a servant in the hospital at Ile-a-la-Crosse and that a fourth will be discharged at the end of the present school year. The above arrangement is approved.\n\nIn view of your report regarding the four remaining children, the Department approves of their staying in the school. Please let me have their names and register numbers in order to complete the information on our files.\n\nPermit me to again refer you to the last two paragraphs of official letter of the 17th ultimo. The Department expects that you will keep our requirements in mind and, when recruiting children in future for the Beauval School, you should secure Treaty Indian children only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. M. Adam, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nBeauval, Sask.\nOttawa, January 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nIt has been represented that Forestry planes fly, during the summer, in the vicinity of the Beauval Indian Residential School, which lies between the Beaver river and Lac la Plonge, in northern Saskatchewan. The Rev. Principal has requested this Department to ascertain if mail from Big River can be brought in by air for a part of each year.

D. Lea,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\"Re\" your letter No. 132-1-1 of January 21st. I thank greatly the department for the good solution given to this present matter. You may be assured that I will keep my engagements unless absolute necessity.\n\nHere are the names and register numbers of the four remaining children staying at the school:\n- 0133 Religie Malboeuf,\n- 0143 M. Misponnes,\n- 0145 M. Nox,\n- 0149 L. Lallibert\u00e9.\n\nSince I am the principal of the school I have made all my best to secure intensely \"Treaty Indian children. For that purpose I have made a trip as far as Portage-la-Loche. On this matter I partake the view of the Department. Later on, probably that I will have some propositions to submit to him regarding this point.\n\nThanking you for all the attention given to this matter, I am:\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIsle a la Crosse  \nJune 17th 1929\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows on my visit to the Beauval Indian Residential School on the 14th and 15th inst.\n\nThis school is under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and the Principal is Rev. Fr. L.M. Adam. The school is located close to the Red Deer River about thirty-seven miles southeast of Isle a la Crosse. The main school building was burnt in 1927 and since then has been operated with small number of pupils present in a building close to the site of the old school. There are only 22 pupils present or in residence at the present time but a full staff of teachers is held in reserve pending the opening of the new school under construction. The expense of keeping a full staff on hand is considerable, but the Principal is well advised in doing so as to be ready with a capable staff when more are required.\n\nI first inspected the work of the sewing class of twenty girls. They had knitted stockings, sweaters, mitts and caps; had made dresses, towels, underclothing and handkerchiefs etc.; embroidered numerous articles; could use the sewing machine very expertly. The teacher has also got them well started in basket making and weaving with cane; all the work is very neat and is of service. You shipped this school a lot of army hospital clothing and most of it has been remodelled into dresses and other articles by the pupils and staff. They would like more of it if it can be obtained.\n\nThe school class rooms were next examined and the pupils found to have made good progress since my last visit. They first had a singing class and the singing was in distinctly clear English, not mumbled or sung parrot fashion. The pupils are up to grade four and they can read in English quite without hesitation from the readers; they speak up in good manner; the spelling was in most cases correct; arithmetic was handled by the teacher announcing a problem after which the pupil would walk to the blackboard and work out the answer. Most of the problems were of practical nature and each one included addition, multiplication, division and subtraction, and in all cases the answer was correct and was worked out in bright honest fashion without any assistance from the teacher. The writing of the pupils is very good. As the children are of mixed Cree and Chipewyan parentage they have to speak English as the common language.\n\nThe dormitories were examined and found to be well ventilated, neat and had good exits in case of fire. The pupils use the outside stairs at all times so would be familiar with their use if trouble occurred.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6300, file 650-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nBeauval School.\n\nThe dormitories were rather low in the ceiling and the air space is not very large but this cannot be helped under present conditions.\n\nThe kitchen is large and the food given to the pupils is cereals, milk, eggs, all classes of common vegetables, beef, moose meat, fish, bread and butter, and plenty of each.\n\nEvery pupil has a separate plot of garden as their own, besides they have to work in the community garden; they also look after the hens, pigs, live stock etc under the supervision of the staff. All pupils were well clothed.\n\nThe farm which surrounds the school was next visited. Since last year ten more acres of land have been cleared of large trees, roots grubbed out, and all placed under cultivation. There are now eighty acres of crop as follows:\n\n| Crop     | Acres |\n|----------|-------|\n| Oats     | 42    |\n| Barley   | 6     |\n| Wheat    | 5     |\n| Potatoes | 5     |\n| Mangles  | 3     |\n| Garden   | 1     |\n| Brome    | 18    |\n\nLast season the crop gave a harvest as follows:\n\n| Crop     | Bushels per acre |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Oats     | 50               |\n| Barley   | 35               |\n| Wheat    | 25               |\n| Potatoes | 240              |\n| Mangles  | 450              |\n\nHay wild and cultivated gave 350 tons in all.\n\nThreshing is all done by the staff.\n\nThe oat crop would have been much larger but the migrating blackbirds held their annual convention in the oat field and fed off the ripe crop.\n\nThe soil is very sandy loam but is fertile; just now all grain is ahead of that close to Regina. The potatoes are above the ground and were receiving the first cultivation. No noxious weeds are to be found here, and the early frosts do not occur on the plateau where the crops are grown. There are 68 cattle here of which twenty are being milked, they are in good condition; they have sixteen horses with three foals; one hundred hens with droves of young chickens; there are eleven pigs on the farm. The machinery is all housed and the place is a model farm.\n\nThe saw mill is run by water power and 50,000 f.b.m. of spruce and cedar cut this spring. At the time of my visit they were sawing birch for the floors of the new school.\n\nThe power plant run by water power was burnt last spring. Since the forest fires came through the north the water storage is not reliable but the Principal is putting a dam at the head of the La Plonge River to hold back the water in the La Plonge Lake for use during low water periods.\n\nThe water for all the buildings, gardens, barns etc is pumped by a ram; it is the most economical system imaginable and needs little attention.\n\nThe hay lands near the school are not surveyed yet but I understand that the Department has reserved some land for the school until surveyed. This is something that should not be overlooked at the time Saskatchewan gets their natural resources.\n\nLast year I mentioned the matter of having the Dgt of Public Works clear the rocks from the rapids in the Cowan or Crooked River as the school\n3.\n\nBeauval School.\n\ntransports their supplies over the river route in summer. The Department took this matter up with the Dept of Public Works and last fall the work was done. A little fixing is still required I understand and more work to be done on the rapids in the Beaver River to make them safe.\n\nDr. Amyot came to the school at the time of my visit and he vaccinated the pupils. The health of the children is very good though one has T.B. and one epilepsy.\n\nThe staff here does not need much mention as when you read this report you can see they must be first class to get such results.\n\nYou probably are familiar with the arrangements regards building the new school here, I understand it is being built by the church authorities under arrangement with the Department. The rear wing of the new school is to be built this year; all material for the heating, electric fixtures, water system is on hand, also the sand, gravel, cement, lime, lumber etc. The basement is excavated, footings of cement in, forms up for the basement walls. The whole school is to have solid brick walls, all the brick is being made within one hundred yards of the school site. Last winter a brick making machine was brought in from Prince Albert with a steam engine to supply the power. The staff used over 40,000 f.b.m. of lumber to construct the drying racks for the bricks, making sheds etc., and they have the plant in running order now. In the few days it has been operating they have made 75,000 bricks and they were turning out thirty bricks a minute when I was there; on Friday they made over 13,000. After the brick dries for a week a kiln is made and the brick burnt for three days. It is expected that 800,000 will be required. A first class bookkeeper is on the job and he keeps track of every item entering into the construction of the school, keeps the time of the men etc. He was watching the cost of the brick making very closely, and including overhead, cost of machines transport of same etc., time of expert brick maker, steam engineer and others who has been down to $20.00 per thousand and is trying to cut this down.\n\nI may have missed out some things that should be in this report, but if any come to mind later I will include it in my final report on the Isle a la Crosse district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPaying Agent.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a most interesting report from Mr. Waddy of an inspection of the Beauval Indian Residential School. The report is well worth reading, and gives a great deal of information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLe Pas, Man. 38 oct. 1930.\n\nMonsieur Duncan Scott, Esq.,\nSous Intendant des Affaires Indiennes, OTTAWA.\n\nCher Monsieur,\n\nAvec nous vous serez pein\u00e9 d'apprendre la mort du R\u00e9v\u00e9rend P\u00e8re M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Adam, O.M.I., principal de l'Ecole de Beauval.

Je le crois apte \u00e0 remplir convenablement la position de Principal. Il conna\u00eet parfaitement la situation \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de Beauval, car il y est rest\u00e9 6 ann\u00e9es cons\u00e9cutives. Il parle bien le fran\u00e7ais, l'anglais et le Cris. Actuellement il est dans une de nos missions les plus \u00e9loign\u00e9es dans le nord. Il ne pourra gu\u00e8re \u00eatre de retour avant la fin de d\u00e9cembre prochain.\n\nEn attendant, le R\u00e9v. P\u00e8re J.M. P\u00e9nard, O.M.I. dirige l'\u00e9cole avec l'aide du R\u00e9v.

He died at the hospital of St. Joseph following an attack of typhoid fever. In his person we have lost a man of great value for the education of the Indians.\n\nAs his successor, I propose the Reverend Father Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Gagnon, O.M.I. I believe he is qualified to fill the position of Principal. He knows the situation at the Beauval School perfectly well as he remained there for 6 consecutive years. He speaks well in French, English and Cree. The school is in one of our distant missions in the North. He will hardly be back before the end of December next. In the meantime, Rev. Father J.M. Bernard, O.M.I. directs the school with the help of Rev. E.J.B. Cabana. If you receive the school report signed by one or the other, I will ask to kindly accept it just the same. Furthermore, I would request you to kindly telegraph to Rev. Bernard to authorize him to act as principal until the arrival of Rev. Father Gagnon.\n\nKindly receive my best regards.\n\n(Signed) + O. Charlebois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Edmundston.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nREV. J. M.

The Department approves of the temporary appointment of Father Penard and the arrangement Your Lordship has made to have Father Gagnon take over the principalship when he returns from the North.

Father Gagnon is at present in the north and will not be taking up duties until the end of December, next. In the meantime and until Father Gagnon returns to Beauval, the temporary appointment of Rev. Father Penard is approved.

She was brought to the hospital suffering from rheumatism and general breakdown, while Mr. Murison was there and asked him to write to me to see if the Department would give her transportation for herself and a companion to Montreal. She has been a faithful worker among the Indians and if you will authorize me to send her a transport requisition I am sure the kindness will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDept. Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 22, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, No. 100-4C, with reference to the case of the Reverend Sister Robinson.\n\nWhile I have every sympathy with the Reverend Sister, and am fully aware of the deserving nature of her case, I regret very much to say that the department would not be warranted in providing transportation for herself and companion to Montreal as suggested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.,\nMr. Duncan O. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI have sent to Rt. Rev. Bishop Charlebois copy of your letter of October 28th (132-1-1) re report concerning the progress at the Beauval Indian Residential School; also copy of your letter of the same date (4115-2R.C.) concerning the chapel site on the Big Head Indian Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. X. Marcotte, O.M.I.\nOctober 28, 1931.\n\nDear Father Marcotte:\n\nPursuant to our conversation this morning, I write to inform you that the Department would like to have a report concerning the progress at the Besual Indian Residential School. Your intimation, that His Lordship Bishop Charlebois was hoping to admit pupils in January, comes as a surprise. The last information on our files suggests that the building was ready for the roof in October and that it was not the intention to do the interior finishing this year.\n\nTo plaster and finish the building and to have it ready for pupils should not be hurried, as it would be unsafe to have children sleeping in dormitories unless everything had been thoroughly dried out. Further, there is the matter of proper furnishing. As His Lordship understands, the Department has no funds to assist this year, and, before we can consider per capita grant, it will be necessary to have a full report concerning the preparations that are being made.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter Beauval Sask., ended June 30th 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 1 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at BATTLEFORD AGENCY JULY 8 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1942.\n\nPrincipal F.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2, 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated at: [Stamp]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1944.\n\nPrincipal F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal F.X.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: P.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: F.X. Gagnon Q.M.T.\n\nDated: October 8, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal F.X.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: F.X. Gagnon\n\nDated July 8th, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date, 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Seauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: F.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated April 1, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at SASK., APR 9 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFonds No. J.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Blood Indian, B.C., School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1927.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 1st, 1927.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nBLOOD INDIAN AGENCY\n\nDated at OCT. 15, 1927.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 1947.\n\nPrincipal F.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated October 13 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Oct. 18 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: P.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated: April 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: P.X. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated April 1, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Battleford Agency, APR 13, 1948.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beausoleil Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30 1948.\n\nPrincipal F.X. Gagnon C.M.I.\n\nDated July 1 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nH.S.

Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Meadow Lake Agency this 8 Oct. 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended October 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 1, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nMeadow Lake Agency\n\nDated at this: October 8, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal F.A. Gagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nMeadow Lake Agency\n\nDated at this Oct. 5, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: F.X. Pagnon O.M.I.\n\nDated October 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nMeadow Lake Agency\n\nDated at this 8 Oct., 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended October 1, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30 1949.\n\nF.X.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Indian Residential School, Beauval Sask., School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: F.X.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Indian School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: F.A.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Beauval Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31 1949.\n\nP. X. Gagnon O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan. 3 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at MEADOW LAKE INDIAN AGENCY\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n\nIndian Affairs.
