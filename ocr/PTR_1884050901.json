One can scarcely take up a standard old-country paper but we see some mention of the North West. What is the country like? How is it peopled? One can know as well as one can know its inhabitants, and some new feature is being developed under our own eyes every day, as to what can be done there, and how it can be otherwise. For instance, it has been almost daily, even in the small matter of seed planting, that some German has had success in some way or another; and because a man in a country so far away, not far from the smallest beginnings have great ending.\n\nWith reference to the friends who are working for us abroad, we must mention first and foremost His Excellency the Marquis of Lorne, our late Governor-General, whose voice has been so often heard in the cause of emigration and always in favor of the great North West. We must also mention a correspondent, whom we refer to the Bishop of Saskatchewan, whose word is and has been, so often used in promoting these advantages, and interested in these territories, also other gentlemen who have visited their homes or gone to take a look at the homes of their forefathers, have not been silent on the matter of the new land. As a new country open to emigration on a large scale, it is unequalled, but there is one thing that we must look out for, namely, our emigrant has some thought of the future, when he reaches the North West, and until he gets here he is subject to all the wiles of emigrant agents, some whose business is, of course, to get them settled in these distant places, and should they therefore, the duty of the people of this country, interested, as they are, with the opening of this new land, to see that the interests of the North West does eventually reach his destination, and is not delayed on his way by the specious arguments of these gentlemen.\n\nOFFICIAL JOBBERY.\n\nOnce upon a time, and not so very long ago, it was settled that Prince Albert should possess a Court House. Of course, the Minister looked forward with great local advantage to one of the most rising Towns in the North West Territories. Now, as the action taken by a few of our fellow townspeople testifies in sending a request to the Ministry of Public Works, we find that our Court House from being talked of, is becoming a reality. There is an old saying that \"actions cannot see behind the scenes,\" and so we need only remark that the statement regarding \"Winnipeg\" newspaper, for tenders to build a Court House at Prince Albert,\" the said advertisement emanating from the office of the Minister of Public Works. What has poor Prince Albert, or her unoffending citizens, to do with such a thing? A local work in taking care of their hands and handed over to the Winnipeg firm. The sample state of the case stands thus: some short time since $5,000 were appropriated by the Government for the purpose of building a court house for this town. The next thing we see is an advertisement from the Minister of Public Works in a Winnipeg paper, but not a word of it in our local paper. Why then, dear friends, people a chance. Why have we been left out in the cold, so to speak, in a matter that concerns Prince Albert citizens? It cannot be that we have no mechanics capable of undertaking the work. One look at the town alone disproves that idea when one contemplates the many and nicely finished buildings in this place of necessity. It is not for this reason why an advertisement in the local press to give our several firms of mechanics in Prince Albert a chance to compete with their neighbors, and so to make money spent in public calling on the Government, an opportunity of being spent here? Or is there the possibility of some official jobbery at work? We shall simply submit, that perhaps the Minister of Public Works (though we make no accusations) interested in having the work done at Winnipeg for some consideration of his own. A new town like this has a right to expect to help the Government can give it, and the erection of local public buildings ought to be located as near as possible, and it is a shame that this takes place on the contrary. It seems that some of our citizens should have telegraphed for delay, as they had to yesterday, through the sudden appearance of certain circumstances, of which, believe, they had no previous warning.\n\nHUDSON'S BAY RAILWAY.\n\nJust now the matter is being everywhere manifested in regard to the proposed railway to the Hudson's Bay. The action of the Dominion Parliament in voting large sums for erecting the railway, and also its necessity for the average length of the season of navigation in the Bay is pretty generally commented all through the Dominion, and its success looks as though to confirm the anticipated result. A leading New York paper says on this subject\u2014The Canadian Government has agreed to give a large body of land for the construction of a railway, to connect the Churchill Hill on the Hudson's Bay. This is said to be a fine harbor. The Government is also going to employ a large number of men to winter over the Hudson's Bay Company's Bay, and ascertain how many months of the year they are open for navigation. The railroad and naval survey will go on together, and doubtless the discovery will be made at Fort Churchill. It is important to know whether the open season by this route averages five or six months. It is well known already that it lasts at least four months, during which ships from England will take away all the grain accumulated in the elevators for the previous eight months. There would be little difficulty in getting feeding so far north, and it would be as easy as in Chicago, deliverable to the holders of the warehouse receipts. If this way it could be sold from hand to hand, or advances could be obtained on it from British Banks. There would be no difficulty in find-\n\nEAST END BAKERY!\n\nBREAD UNDEPRESSED BY ANY WEST OF WINNIPEG.\n\nNINE Loaves for $1\n\nHugh McDougall,\nEast End Bakery.\n\nThe Grand Central Restaurant.\n\n(Old Woodbine Saloon)\n\nThis new Restaurant has been opened and is now ready for business.\n\nMEALS AT ALL HOURS.\n\nTHOMAS ORAM\n\nNOTICE.\n\nCANADA.\n\nIn the goods North West Territories, of GEORGE MCKAY, deceased.\n\nWe hereby give notice that the said GEORGE MCKAY, deceased, B.

The success of the shop will keep my shop rocking with patrons.\"\n\n\"But don't you apprehend that great deal of time will be consumed in fitting them to the hair, the dress, the chair and the art?\"\n\n\"I have just read all the magazines which deal with the subject and have a perfect system. Every man will experience a barber, upon entering the room, will be greeted by a host of ladies and regulations of the establishment. They must be adhered to in letter, and not in spirit. I shall have the ladies hand the reporter a card, which read as follows:\n\n\"Customers are not to rise, and it is essential to remain in position with the lady artists.\n\n\"For convenience of the day are all the necessary requisites for the best shaving, including hot towels.\n\n\"The artists will be the same as usual and dominate all young men who come to the shop. The ladies will be treated with uniform courtesy.\n\n\"Those who are not gentlemen may give themselves up to the ladies who are elected by remaining away altogether.\n\n\"Ladies are peculiarly adapted to do shaving and hair dressing more gracefully, than men. This is a natural thing, and it is for this reason that the proprietors have selected these ladies for the purpose of shaving and hair dressing. They will be the most charming and will have an atmosphere of dignity and moral elevation to the barber shop which it has never before possessed.\"\n\n\"There you have it in a nutshell.\n\nThere are plenty of women who cannot find employment, but who want to make a living. I am convinced that there exists a demand for female barber shop where these women will be successful, and I have already set forth the best plan for bringing about such a result. I am engaged to Vassar College, and she has on account of her father's business enterprises is thrown upon the world to support herself. I am getting her instructions now in the use of the razor, and know that she will develop to a real artist.\"\n\n\"How soon will you open the shop?\"\n\n\"In about three months, if everything goes well. We shall need help, and of course it will take some time to get the proper equipment together, but who can readily acquire the art.\"\n\nHow to Take Candy.\n\nThis book gives full directions for making candy, both plain and fancy candy.
