D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nIn your agency report for August the suggestion is made that the opening and closing of Indian day schools be adjusted in future to conform with the dates of other schools in Ontario.\n\nIn this connection may I refer you to circular C-150-48, copy of which I am sending forward herewith. You will note that the instruction with respect to the opening and closing of Indian day schools in this circular is clear and explicit, and it is the duty and responsibility of our Indian agents to see that these instructions are obeyed by our teachers. Any attempt on the part of this Department to have our Indian day schools open and close on the same dates as public and separate schools throughout the Dominion would lead to endless confusion, for the simple reason that opening and closing dates differ in a number of the provinces. We are operating our schools this year on a 10-month rather than a 9-month basis, in response to requests received from Indian day school teachers. Teachers should be reminded, therefore, that it is their duty to see that their schools operate for the full teaching period. It is unnecessary to add that the holidays of Civil Servants and other government employees have been substantially reduced during the war period. In view of this fact, it would scarcely be fair for teachers to ask for holidays other than the holidays for which provision is made in the published regulations.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\nDeseronto, Ont. October 9th 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nPlease find enclosed Day School Returns for the September quarter for the four day schools of Tyendinaga Indian Agency. The attendance at Western and Central schools has not been good and the R.C.M. Police have been requested to check on the absentees.\n\nIn acknowledging your letter 34-1-1 of September 8th in connection with the suggestion contained in my agency report for the month of August, I would advise that this office and all schools have a copy of your circular and that schools are and have been operated in accordance with the instructions contained therein and are thoroughly understood.\n\nThe local teachers are very pleased that the Department has seen fit to increase the academic year from a nine to a ten-months basis, with the corresponding addition in salary and which should give them an increased incentive in carrying out their duties.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ontario, May 18th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nOn my visit to Central Indian Day School on May 15th, Mrs. Eva Brant, temporary teacher at that school, informed me that she would not continue teaching after June 30th next, and that it would be necessary to procure another teacher.\n\nMrs. Brant's husband works a one hundred acre farm, and through lack of help has been inconvenienced during the period Mrs. Brant has been teaching, and this woman is needed at her home.\n\nUnless the Department has a teacher in view suitable for this position, it is suggested that an advertisement be entered in the Belleville and Kingston papers for a week requesting applications. I would wish your authority to insert this advertisement and would you also inform me of the salary to be paid to a proper qualified teacher.\n\nIf a suitable applicant cannot be obtained in this manner, I would then consider that Miss Jean Schell, now on leave of absence as teacher of this school, be requested to resume her duties as teacher, as I personally consider that as a teacher her services would be just as important as those in which she is now engaged in a munition factory.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 22, 1944.\n\nMr. A.D. Moore, Indian Agent, Deseronto, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, in which you advise that Mrs. Eva Brant intends to give up duties at the Tyendinaga Central School at the end of the current academic year.\n\nPlease consult the Public School Inspector, Mr. A.W. McGuire, with a view to ascertaining if he has any teachers in mind that he could suggest. Salary will be allowed at the rate of $90, plus bonus of 17%, which means a total of $105.30.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nIn February of this year I was appointed Inspector of the joint inspectorate of Centre and South Hastings. Tyendinaga was separated from Centre Hastings and joined to Lennox, where Mr. K. O. Birkin of Napanee is Inspector. I fully expected that Mr. Birkin would be appointed to inspect the Indian schools in Tyendinaga. In fact, I was given to understand at the Department of Education in Toronto that the authorities at Ottawa would be asked to make the change. I am surprised to learn that there has been any delay in the matter.\n\nDr. V. K. Greer, Superintendent of Elementary Education, at the Ontario Department of Education, can supply you with further information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. W.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, 1944\n\nSchools;\n\nThe attendance at the schools was only fair during September, many of the older children being kept at home to assist in harvesting canning crops, due to the shortage of adult help. Mr. Birkin, Napanee, Public School Inspector who has inspected the Reserve Schools during 1943-44 has been transferred to Peterborough for one year and Mr. Mackles, Belleville, Inspector of the South Hastings District, has taken over that portion of Mr. Birkin's territory that includes the Tyendinaga Reserve Schools.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nThe reports of the teachers show that the attendance at Central and Mission schools has steadily improved, while that of Eastern School has maintained its usual good level. Good reports have been received of these Indian pupils attending Shannonville and Milltown white schools as they are attending regular and making good progress, possibly being due to the new environment.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH DECEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools;\n\nThe attendance at the Agency schools during December was low, due to the severe weather and storms. The teachers were able to get to their schools so that Eastern School was closed one day, Central one day and Mission two days. The reports of the teachers for December show that there are a considerable number of pupils suffering from colds and at Eastern School, a number were absent from skin diseases, a condition that has been hard to clean up at this school. Cod Liver Oil was delivered to the schools in late November and teachers instructed to see that the children received the same. During December there was a considerable falling off in the attendance of Indian pupils to the Shannonville and Milltown white schools, due to inclement weather and sickness.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nSchools: The school attendance during June quarter has been fairly good, but in spite of the efforts of this office and local Reserve organizations, the attendance has never been brought to a maximum and it is anticipated some better results will be obtained in the future on account of family allowances being paid to Indians. The teachers report a moderate number of cases of head and body lice, also the odd case of skin disease in which it has been necessary to order the children home for attention and treatment. Four pupils from Eastern, all that tried, have passed their Entrance examinations and two of these at least have expressed a desire to attend the Local High School; the other two are making their own arrangements to attend Vocational School at Belleville. Two pupils from Central passed their Entrance Exams and one girl is expecting to continue to High School at Deseronto. As previously reported, the co-operation from the R.C.M.P. and Special Constable in their duties as truant officers has been poor, lack of which can be attributed to the extra duties placed on the police on account of the war, which limits the time available for duties on the Reserve. It is expected these officers will give more supervision from this time on and that the parents will be closely checked in connection with the poor and irregular attendance of children of school age. For two days, June 19 and 20, senior pupils of all Reserve schools attended the Homemakers Club convention and heard addresses concerning Family Allowances, nutrition and medical care, school attendance, etc., from which they should derive considerable benefit in future. Manual training and sewing work at Eastern school has progressed well but has lagged some at Mission and Central schools, due partially to the indifference of the teachers in not procuring materials as was authorized. It is suggested that some definite graduation ceremony be established annually for Indian pupils who pass their Entrance examinations and at this gathering the children receive their entrance diplomas and also be capped and gowned. Such a procedure would be of some incentive for pupils to at least get their entrance and presentation of their certificates could be made by an official of the Department or some prominent local school inspector or public official. Gowns and mortar boards are inexpensive and could be supplied by the Department on a loan basis and be available yearly.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM REQUISITION DATED APRIL 30th, 1948.\nFROM THE TEACHER OF THE TYENDINAGA CENTRAL\nINDIAN DAY SCHOOL. ORIGINAL ON FILE # 34-1-4.\n\nThe teacher states:\n\nI would suggest that Department give a trophy for an annual school field, trophy to go to school scoring highest number of points. I would be willing to arrange such a field day. Our children need to learn good sportsmanship.\n\nWe wish to revive inter school softball games.\nOttawa, November 1, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just reviewed the September quarter return of the Tyendinaga Central School. It shows an enrolment of 22 with an average attendance of 11.\n\nThe Eastern School has an enrolment of 33 and an average attendance of 25; while the enrolment at the Mission School is shown as 30 with an average attendance of 18.\n\nYou will note from the above figures that the average attendance at the Central School for the month of September is approximately 50%, but the percentage at the other schools is higher. In all three cases and especially in the case of the Central School these average attendances are not very satisfactory. We had hoped that with the payment of family allowances the average attendance at the Tyendinaga Schools, which has been so bad for many years, would improve. You have already been given specific instructions regarding the action to be taken in regard to family allowances in the event of children of school age not being enrolled or in the case of children who are enrolled but do not attend regularly. This matter should be again brought to the attention of the Tyendinaga Council at their next meeting, because fifty per cent attendances are not consistent with the payment of family allowances.\n\nIt is rather interesting to note that the average attendance at the Central School is the smallest, while the teacher at this school applied recently for\n\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nan increase in salary. While the parents may be indifferent, it is reasonable to expect that the teacher should be sufficiently interested to encourage the parents to send their children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDeseronto, Ontario, November 20, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would acknowledge your letter of November 1st in connection with the attendance during September of Indian pupils at the three Day Schools of Tyendinaga Reserve and would state that the attendance during September of each year has always been fairly low due to the fact that a number of pupils are kept out of school to assist in the harvesting of tomato and other canning crops.\n\nThe reports made by the teachers to this office for the month of October show the following enrollments and average attendance:\n\nEastern Day School-Enrollment-36- Average Attendance 84.92%\nMission Day School- \" -27- \" \" 82%\nCentral Day School- \" -22- \" \" 75.25%\n\nand while these averages could still be improved on, they are very fair and, as children are no longer needed to assist in harvesting crops, there should still be more improvement for the month of November.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being advised of the resignation of the teacher of Mission Day School and, if no replacement is secured, it will create an awkward situation and I am of the belief that, to retain good teachers, the Department will have to increase salaries to procure satisfactory employees and thereby bring salaries of teachers of Indian Day Schools in harmony with those paid teachers of white rural schools. It is also considered that a teacher receiving an adequate salary will give more satisfactory service and that more demand can be made on the services of a satisfied employee.\n\nADM/JMcV\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ontario, March 14, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Francis Thompson,\nTraining School, Bowmanville.\n\nThe above noted boy, aged twelve years, whose parents are claimed to be Isaac and Gladys Thompson of unknown address, was committed by a Sudbury Magistrate to the Ontario Training School for Boys, Bowmanville, and, at the time of the boy's trial at Sudbury, the constable, giving evidence, stated he was not a Treaty Indian.\n\nIn December, last, this boy was released from the Bowmanville School to Peter Joe Brant, Indian resident of Tyendinaga Reserve, on the condition that Brant supplied him with a home and arranged that he attend school regularly during the winter months. Brant desires to send him to a Reserve school and, as he is not recognised as an Indian, this would be contrary to the policy of the Department in that none but Indian children are eligible to attend Indian Reserve schools. I would be pleased to receive the decision of the Department concerning this boy being allowed to attend a Reserve school. I am personally of the opinion that it would create a bad precedent and there are white tenants on the Reserve who would be seeking the same consideration and treatment for their children. Your early reply would be appreciated.\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM/JMcV\nOttawa, March 18, 1946.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore, Indian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 14th instant, the Department is not prepared to allow Francis Thompson to attend any of the schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve, as he is not an Indian.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Tyendinaga Central Indian Day School No. 441.\n\nThe teacher of the above school, Mr. Leslie Claus, has been appointed as a teacher, Indian School, Grade III.

Elliott to the Sarnia School, I have approached Mrs. Elliott who has given me the enclosed letter to forward to you.\n\nI might add that in view of the short time before school reopens, should Mrs. Elliott have transferred it would have put me in a most awkward position since there is one school on this reserve closed already because of the scarcity of teachers and I doubt, very much, if it would have been possible for me to obtain the services of another teacher to replace Mrs. Elliott before the Fall term. I trust that Mrs. Elliott's refusal will not affect her position as teacher of Mission School at this reserve.\n\nN.C.

It is not possible at the present time for an officer of this Department to visit the Reserve and select a suitable site. You and the members of the Council should be able to arrange this matter, which should receive your early attention. The site chosen should be central to the majority of the children who would attend, and should be dry and have good drainage facilities. There should be sufficient ground to provide ample playground, and, if necessary, a school garden.\n\nIt is not likely that the new buildings will be ready for occupation before the beginning of the new year.\n\nYou should take immediate steps to secure a site for the Central school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As one thing we need is fresh air in the school. I do not see how the teachers stand it as I cannot stand it when I am in for an hour.\n\nI hope you will consider this at once and let me know before we get too advanced with the building.\n\nAnd one question I would like to know is if I am expected to look after the building of these schools as it will take a lot of my time, as it is about 20 miles drive to take in both schools; and how often I should go to look them over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nG. M. Campbell\nArchitect\nDpt. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\nDeseronto, Ont,\nDecember 7th, 1922.\n\nI took the matter of fresh air ventilation in the new schools with Mr Clarke Public school Inspector today, and he recommended the E. N. Moyer floor Furnace which brings the fresh air from outside. This furnace is made in Toronto and there are a number in the school in Hastings County and all are giving good service in heat and ventilation.\n\nAnd I would farther say, now as we are building new schools on this reserve that we have them up to the standard in every way as far as possible, and as our means will permit.\n\nHoping you will take this matter up at once and let me know what you intend to do about it.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 12, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 7th inst., with reference to the furnace you recommend to be installed in the new Tyendinaga Schools, I would ask you to be good enough to submit a price for the installing of the furnaces as recommended.\n\nYou will observe that the plans and specifications were prepared along the lines as recommended by you.\n\nYou will be expected to give whatever time you think necessary in order to see that the buildings are being built in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

Two resolutions were passed appointing two men to look after the building of the new schools. I have told them several times that the Dept was building them and the Band did not have them and the Band did not have to put up a cent, how is these men to go on the job.

B. Automatic Single Desk\n\nThe title, Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., is synonymous with accuracy, desirability and honesty of construction. The manufacturers have never inflicted the public with experiments. For years they have been masters of perfect mechanism. The New \"Ball-Bearing\" School Furniture embodies essential principles that are made possible by experience and expert construction, aided by the best material that the ingenuity of man can produce. Our New \"Ball-Bearing\" Desks combine grace and beauty with the highest form of durability and rigidity. They embody every requirement\u2014durability, simplicity, comfort, beauty of outline, superb finish, accuracy of fittings and an absolutely, permanent, noiseless, Automatic Folding Seat.\n\nThe Desks made by The Canadian Office & School Furniture Co. are in use in all the civilized countries of the globe, half a million in Canada alone.\n\nPatented, Manufactured and Controlled by\nThe Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., Limited\nPRESTON, ONTARIO, CANADA\nFastening of Wood and Iron\n\nBy Means of Our Combined Double Wedge and Dove-Tail Fastener\n\n(Patented 1898)\n\nThe accompanying cut plainly shows our exclusive method of fastening woodwork to iron. B represents upright standard. A represents the double wedge and dovetail, which slips into hole D in groove C of woodwork. When the wood is placed over the iron, wedge A fitting into hole D, and the back is driven downward, the wedge A forces the flange on standard firmly into the recessed groove C in woodwork, thus forming one continuous fastening the whole length of the wood.\n\nThe wood work of seat and top of desk is fastened to the iron in a similar manner. This is the only common sense method of putting school desks together, and we are the inventors, and have a monopoly of its use.\n\nNote the perfect tongued and grooved glued joints; we make our tongues and grooves in a large size which gives an extra large surface for the glue to spread, thereby making the most perfect joint possible. Our method of jointing has stood the test of years.\n\nNo Keys or Bolts Used in Setting up This Desk\n\nIn Process of Setting Up\n\nThe accompanying cut represents a \"Ball Bearing\" Automatic Double Desk with entire seat, partly set up with the back off, showing the flange and wedges on the standard and the holes and recessed groove in the wood back. When the solid top, seat and back are driven home they wedge themselves firmly, locking all parts securely.\n\nEvery Slat Supported by the Flange and Each Lug a Part of the Main Casting\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf\n\nThe Locked Book Shelf is secured in place by being pushed in grooves in the standard from the front, before the back of seat placed in position. It can never be removed by mischievous boys allowing books, pencils, etc., to fall on the floor to the great annoyance of the teacher and orderly pupils.\n| ITEM | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                        | UNIT PRICE | EXTENSION |\n|------|----------|------------------------------------|------------|-----------|\n|      |          | Fill in number of days in space (a) and date in space (b) |            |           |\n|      |          | Sign your name in space (c)        |            |           |\n| No. 1 | 1        | Single School Desk, for pupils 16-20 yrs. | $30        | $30       |\n|      |          | Front for same,                     | $20        | $20       |\n| No. 2 | 4        | Single School Desks, 12-18 yrs.     | $25        | $25       |\n|      |          | Fronts for same,                    | $20        | $20       |\n|      |          | Rears for same,                     | $15        | $15       |\n| No. H | 6        | Single School Desks, 9-14 yrs.      | $6         | $6        |\n|      |          | Front for same,                     | $15        | $15       |\n|      |          | Rear for same,                      | $10        | $10       |\n| No. 3 | 6        | Single School Desks, 6-10 yrs.      | $50        | $33       |\n|      |          | Front for same,                     | $10        | $10       |\n|      |          | Rear for same,                      | $35        | $35       |\n\nTo be cherry finish.\n\nInk wells to be supplied with each desk.\n\nPrices quoted to be F.O.B., Deseronto, Ont.\n\nShipment to be made in ten days from receipt of order.\n\nCanada Office & School Furniture Co.,\nPreston,\nOnt.\n\nNote:\nIf desks are shipped, set up and crated, add 75\u00a2 each to above prices.\nQuotations for\nSCHOOL DESKS,\nReceivable until noon\nFEB. 6, 1923.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT**\n\nOttawa, Jan. 24, 1923.\n\nReq.

Campbell,\nDeseronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nCould you arrange to have benches built around the walls of the cloak rooms in the new school? They would be a great convenience. In the first place, the class room is small and the cloak rooms would be of more use if the benches were there. The children would have some place to sit while removing and putting on their rubbers. Also they could eat their lunch there thus keeping crumbs out of the class room. On stormy days, when the attendance is usually small, they could be used at recess and noon when playing games. Mr. Walker informs me that the cost would be $4.50 including everything for all the benches we require.\n\nAlso, the hall of the new school is absolutely dark, which is no doubt an oversight. Mr. Walker tells me this could be remedied by removing two of the panels and putting in glass. Something should be done about this soon.\nmatter, as this is not merely an inconvenience, but a danger in a public school. Benches such as we would like, are in the cloak rooms of the Collegiate at Napans. The pupils found them very useful. We always ate our lunch there, in fact were not allowed to bring it into the class room.\n\nThanking you for giving these matters your attention,\n\nYours truly,\nMrs. Celia Field\n(Teacher)\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter from Mrs. Tile teacher at the Central School asking me to have seats put in the cloak rooms also glass in front door never noticed the door before and when it is shut there is not a bit of light in the Hall the upper brackets could be taken out bend a each fitted in to give light. Hoping to hear from you soon immediately written.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Ind Affairs\nOttawa\nOTTAWA, February 16th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Central school on the Tyendinaga Reserve, in which she requests that benches be built around the walls of the cloak rooms in the new school building which is in the course of erection, and also that glass be placed in two panels of the door leading into the hall.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that Mr. Walker, the contractor, informed the teacher that he would build the benches at a cost of $12.00. You may arrange with him to have this work done, and it should be completed to your satisfaction. You may also arrange with the contractor to have glass put in the panels of the door. The cost of the benches and glass panels will be paid as an extra on the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M.

A dozen are desired.\n\nThe seating is by single non-adjustable seats and is satisfactory, except that a few more are required of NO. 3 size.\n\nClosets are in terrible condition. The girls can scarcely use their closet without being fouled and the boys' closet is all full and partially wrecked. These buildings are too far away from the school to be easily accessible in bad weather.\n\nH. J. Clarke,\nInsp.\nOttawa, June 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Central School on the Tyendinaga Reserve, has drawn attention to the condition of the closets. He states that they are in a terrible condition, and cannot be used without the children being fouled.\n\nYou should take immediate steps to have these closets thoroughly cleaned and put in a good, sanitary condition. This matter should not have been delayed until the present conditions developed. It is considered that the teacher should have reported the matter to you if you did not notice the same on your visits to the school. You should see that the closets at all the schools are thoroughly cleaned before the schools reopen after the holidays.\n\nThe Inspector also states that there are not sufficient seats in the Central School for the number of pupils in attendance. He recommends that a few more of the No. 3 size be supplied. Please state whether there is accommodation for more desks, and, if so, state the number required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

You should have this closet put in a good state of repair.\n\nAt the Eastern School, you should arrange to have a new floor laid in the front porch. We note that you estimate the cost to be approximately $7.\n\nThe steps at the Mission School should be repaired, and the cost of this work should not exceed approximately $5.\n\nPlease have the above repairs attended to before the schools open after the present holidays, and forward vouchers for each school separately covering the cost of the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The desk chair need 4 new casters as three are broken. As for the Burlap I have not been able to get a price in Town as no one keeps it but I looked in Eaton's Catalog and it is quoted at 60\u00a2 per yd and the Teacher wants 27 yds but if she got the half of the amount it would do I think.\n\nWe should have about 6 drinking cups which I think would be sufficient.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nJ.M.Campbell\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 27th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the closets at the Central school on the Tyendinaga Reserve. Owing to the lateness of the season, no action need be taken to remove them to another site. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring with a view to the erection of new closets, and at that time you should state the approximate cost in erecting new ones.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a new chair and casters for the desk chair. No unnecessary expense should be incurred. You may also purchase 6 drinking cups and a new lock for the front door.

Campbell\nAgent\n\nMarch 27th, 1926\nExtract from Report of Inspector Clarke on the Central Mohawk Indian Day School - dated June 8th, 1926.\n\nLike those at the Western School, these closets are far too far from the school. The teacher reports that in winter two little girls were in some danger during a severe storm on account of the distance they had to wade through the snow. There is no reason whatever why these buildings should not be placed immediately in the rear of the school and 10 or 12 feet from the building where they would be easily accessible in bad weather. At present it is 50 paces to reach them. These closets should be cleaned out. The boys' closet is filthy now.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nIn a report dated the 8th instant, on the Central Day School, Inspector Clarke again refers to the condition of the closets and their distance from the school. In your letter of November 24th, last, you stated that new closets were required at this school and you were instructed by official letter of November 27th, to bring this to our attention early in the spring of 1926.\n\nWe have not yet had any report from you in this matter and I should be pleased if you would supply me with an estimate of the approximate cost of erecting new closets closer to the school than the present ones are situated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nCentral Mohawk School,\nTyendinaga, Ontario,\nJune 30, 1926.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe toilets at this school are much too far from the building. Last winter two of the little girls had a narrow escape from death through being trapped there during a storm. It took the combined efforts of the teacher and the larger boys to get them back into the school. We are in a badly exposed position here. I would recommend that these buildings be moved much nearer to the back of the school, during the summer vacation.\n\nThe walls of the school room and cloak rooms are badly soiled. They should be cleaned and decorated before September. I would recommend a pale shade of green, or else cream.\n\nVery truly yours,\n(teacher) Mrs. Celia Fife.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith quarterly report from the Central School and also Requestion for School Supplies also a letter from the Teacher Mrs. File in reference to the closets which I explained when I was at the Dept., and in reference to the walls being soiled she never called my attention to it. And as this is a new school the walls should not be soiled as the Writer School walls are clean and not soiled.\n\nMrs. File told me sometime ago that she was going to write the Dept. and see if her Husband could take this School as she would like to go to Ladies College and I have not heard anything about it since...and by any thing is done I would think it advise she be put any Dept. of Ind Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.M. Campbell\nAgent\nOttawa, July 12, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, enclosing a communication from Mrs. File, teacher of the Central School on the Tyendinaga reserve, relative to the toilets and requesting that they be moved nearer to the school building.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted from Mr. Inspector Clarke's report that the present situation of these toilets is about 50 paces from the school. It is considered that, for sanitary reasons, it would be unsatisfactory to have them located near the rear of the school building. It is thought that the older boys, in winter, could keep a path cleared. We note the Inspector recommends that these toilets should be thoroughly cleaned out.

If so, you should state the approximate cost involved in having the work done.

Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nThis school should be painted on the outside. It has not been done since 1923, when the school was treated. It is beginning to peel off. The steps and steps are absolutely bare. The fence between the two yards should be done at the same time, as well as the outbuilding which have never been painted.\n\nThere are no railings on this steps, and as it is so small, there are frequent accidents when the children fall or are pushed off. A stout railing would prevent all this.\n\nWe are in need of a gate, as this one is broken and has blew off its hinges for years. We have to will it to keep it upright. We try to have flower gardens and a good galley is necessary.

This matter could be drawn to the attention of the Department next spring.\n\nIf you consider it necessary, you may arrange to have a guard placed at each end of the steps at the front entrance to the building and the steps painted.

The Department considers that bolts of towelling could be cut up into suitable lengths, individual tags supplied and the towels hung on separate pegs in each school. This work, of course, should be undertaken under the supervision of the teachers - the cutting, hemming and tagging to be without cost to the Department. Please let me know at an early date if you can make arrangements for this improvement, and if the teachers will whole-heartedly support the scheme.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Can not the Department help her and the children out in this? It is one of the best things that I find in the rural schools.\nOttawa, October 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Central Day School, states that the teacher is anxious to have a warm lunch provided for the pupils during the cold weather and that she intends to obtain a small coal oil stove. The Inspector requests that the Department assist her in the providing of this lunch for the children during the winter months.\n\nI may say that the Department would be disposed to provide a supply of tea or cocoa for the serving of a warm drink. It is expected, however, that the pupils will bring their own lunch. Please report as soon as possible regarding this matter, and obtain from Mrs. File a list of the quantity of tea, cocoa, etc., required. You should also state whether you consider there would be any danger in supplying a coal oil stove for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

It would be nice for the pupils if this could be done but we have not much room in this school and the teacher goes to her boarding place for her dinner and the pupils would be left alone, but if the teacher would bring her dinner she could watch what was going on.

An account, in duplicate, covering the cost should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly give me information regarding the financial assistance we can expect from the Department to aid in furnishing the pupils of the Indian Day Schools with a hot lunch. We have been having hot lunches in our school since Christmas (Central Mohawk Day School Tyendinaga Reserve). Both parents and pupils are very enthusiastic over it and the experiment has been such a success that I feel that something should be done to establish it permanently.\n\nThe advantages are very evident. I have had practically one hundred per cent possible attendance since this was begun. An epidemic of chicken pox and whooping cough has kept some children at home, but every child who was able has come to school every day this winter. January usually marks the lowest...\nour attendance here, and so,\nif only for this reason, think\nthe scheme should be\nput upon a proper working\nbasis.\n\nThis is my sixth year in\nthis school, and it is the\nmost successful year we\nhave had in that time.\nOne family in particular,\nliving three miles across\ncountry, is attending school\nin a body, missing only\none day, when it stormed\nso hard that not a pupil\ncould venture out. These children\ncannot get to school in the\nspring when the water is\nhigh, consequently they have\nformerly missed school\nfrom Christmas until Easter or\neven later. They are a sickly\nfamily, and their mother\nsays \u2014 and truthfully, I believe\n\u2014 that they cannot stand it to\nwalk so far through the snow\nand eat a cold lunch.\n\nNot only this but I am\npositive that I can already\nnotice a change for the better\nin the health of the whole\nschool. Formerly, I compelled\nthem to play out of doors at\nleast part of the noon hour.\nNow the school is deserted as\nsoon as the lunch is eaten. The cleaning committee, of course, remains, and everything is in order by 12:30 or 12:45 at the outside.\n\nAt present we are \"carrying on\" with borrowed equipment, most of it my personal property. We are using a portable oil stove, one burner which must be carried back and forth night and morning, as I use it in my room at my boarding place. I have loaned a few cooking utensils from my own home\u2014most of the homes here are too poor to spare any. The children who could, have brought their own dishes. We have not enough when everyone is present, but we manage somehow\u2014often it is a bit awkward. We had a concert before Christmas, and, at present, we are buying our supplies with the money. Not many of the people here are able to help financially during the winter.\nTry to furnish cheap, wholesome food. Our milk we buy at five cents a quart. It is too cold for the children to carry it so far. We have such food as porridge (rolled oats), cream of wheat, cooked rice, vegetable soup, potato soup, cocoa, creamed potatoes, macaroni and tomatoes, etc. The children like anything and everything. We have used no canned goods as yet, with the exception of one can of tomatoes. Much of the food I prepare and cook partly at my boarding place. Last week, our lunches averaged two cents each.\n\nI can obtain an oil stove for (two-burner) for twenty dollars, from Boyle and Son, Napans. We need some sort of cupboard or cabinet, cooking utensils and dishes. Fifty dollars would furnish everything, think although I cannot be certain. If I am given credit for that amount at one of the hardware stores in Deseronto I will be able to buy at least the necessary things. Two dollars\na week would furnish us with food, supplemented by what the children bring. It would be money well spent, for many of these children are under nourished\u2014one family, in particular, is in a half starved condition.\n\nKindly tell me what help I can expect in this matter. The present arrangement is only temporary, but, imperfect as it is, it has had simply marvellous results. Many more advantages come to mind\u2014the work done in cooking, sewing, cleaning, etc., for example. It must be made a permanent thing in some way. Will the Department place a certain sum at my disposal, and let me expend it here, or shall I send a list of necessary articles and have them sent to me?\n\nVery truly yours,\n(Mrs) Helga B. Tile\nTeacher & Central Mohawk Day School, Grandin.\nOttawa, February 10, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mrs. File, teacher of the Central School on the Tyendinaga Reserve, requesting that supplies be furnished for the purpose of serving a midday lunch to the pupils. She states that they have been serving a lunch since Christmas with excellent results and that, as a consequence, there has been a full attendance of the Indian children.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of October 30th last, and your reply thereto of November 4th. In view of the teacher's report as to the benefits accruing from the serving of this lunch, it is considered that it would be in the interests of the children and the work at the school to supply the necessary equipment and food for the purpose until the end of April, next. The teacher requests that an oil stove (2-burner), a cupboard and utensils for preparing and serving the meal be supplied. She states that approximately $50 would cover the cost of what is required. You should, therefore, arrange at once to purchase an oil stove (2-burner), a small cupboard in which to store food and utensils and a small number of utensils and dishes for the serving of the meal. Please consult the teacher as to what is required and arrange for the purchase as soon as possible. We are informing her that you have received authority to make these purchases.\n\nRelative to the items of food required for the lunch to supplement what the children bring from their homes, you may purchase a small quantity of rolled oats, rice, cocoa and a small quantity of other food supplies for the purpose. The teacher states that she has been obtaining milk at five cents a quart, and you may arrange for a small quantity of same to be delivered each day. The teacher should keep an accurate record of the milk supplied. She also states that an expenditure of $10 a week would provide all the necessary food supplies required.\n\nIt is expected that the preparation and serving of the meal will not interfere with the regular classroom work of the teacher. She should obtain the assistance of the older girls in the preparation and serving of same. As the serving of this lunch is in the nature of an experiment, and is to be continued until the end of April, next, the Department will await a full report of the success achieved. We are informing Mrs. File of the authority granted you to make the purchases stated above.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, promptly verified, covering the cost of the food and utensils purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto,\nOnt.\n\nActing Asst. Deputy\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nOttawa, February 10, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, relative to the serving of a midday lunch at the Central School on the Tyendinaga Reserve to supplement the food taken by the pupils from their homes. We have noted the success which has already been met with in the serving of this lunch.\n\nWe are communicating with Mr. Agent Campbell and requesting him to buy the equipment necessary and a small quantity of food supplies for the purpose. The Department will expect that the serving of this lunch will not interfere with the regular classroom duties. You should keep an accurate record of the milk delivered each day, and hand this statement to Mr. Agent Campbell. We are enclosing a copy of our communication to the Agent, and from it you will observe the supplies he has been authorized to obtain, and that this lunch is to continue until the end of April, next. I shall be pleased, at the end of April, to receive a full report from you as to the benefits derived by the pupils from the serving of this lunch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F.

Why cannot these minor\nmatters be attended to at the proper time, and before the\nfire is needed.

He states that apparently the grates are broken, as the coal falls through into the ash box; the feed door has nothing to hold it shut and gas escapes badly into the room and that the check damper in the pipe does not work properly.\n\nYou should arrange to have any repairs required to this furnace carried out as soon as possible.

You should arrange to have this tank cleaned out and placed in a sanitary condition, and an account, in duplicate, should be forwarded in the usual manner covering the expense incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should also furnish full information as to the type of furnace required and the cost of supplying and installing same.

I again call your attention to the condition of that water tank. I again call your attention to the condition of that furnace. It was badly out of repair in October, but nothing was done to improve it.\n\nThe knob is off the front door.\n\nIt is discouraging to me to report to you repairs that are needed and needed badly and have these suggestions absolutely ignored. For example, last October I made a somewhat definite report on the condition of that furnace, but nothing was done, and the teacher and children have had to do the best they could with a broken furnace all winter. I also told you of the condition of the water tank, but it is in the same condition today. I have three times reported those broken seats without any result. Is it your wish that I make no reference to these matters?\nOttawa, June 19th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Central Indian Day School, draws attention to the condition of the water tank and also to the furnace. He states that there are a number of broken desks and that he has called attention to this matter on several occasions. He also states that the knob is off the front door.\n\nIn this connection, I would refer you to official letter of May 3rd, last, requesting you to forward a report regarding the erection of new closets and the installing of a new furnace. You should also furnish a report regarding the broken desks, stating the name of the manufacturer and whether it will be necessary to order new parts. If so, the size of the desks should be stated. You should see that the knob is replaced on the front door, and you should also report regarding the condition of the water tank and what work is required to place it in good condition.\n\nYour early reply giving the information asked for above will be appreciated, in order that, if it is decided to authorize any work, it can be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He states that the fence is damaged by the boys in climbing same, which could be easily avoided. Please draw this matter to the attention of the teacher, and she should see that the pupils do not damage the fence. You should arrange to have any repairs required carried out.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the water tank is now out of commission and that an open pail is being used for drinking water, which is unsanitary and an excellent way to transmit any communicable diseases that may exist. A report regarding what work is required in having the tank placed in a satisfactory condition, and the cost of same, should be made by you at an early date.\n\nThe Inspector also states that when the coal was put in the bin whatever kindlings there were were buried by the coal and that there is no kindling to light the fires. He states that the old toilets are useless and the material might be used for kindling if the caretaker is given permission to use same. The department will leave this matter in your hands and, if you consider that these old closets should be removed, the material in them could be broken up and used for kindling wood.

The fence is shabby and I would recommend a new fence in front the same as we put up at the Eastren school and a new small gate, as the present Style is very shakey and dangerous for the children going over the steps, the cost would be about the same os the Eastren school fence.\n\nAs to the water tank the old one is cracked and will not hold water, a new one would cost about $5.00.\n\nAs to the Kindling wood we have lots of kindling and one of the old closets has been taken down and the other will be taken away, as I gave it to All Ste Church.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG.

It is, no doubt, too late this present season to have this work carried out, but the Department would approve of having a new fence erected next Spring of the same style of fencing as was recently put up at the Eastern School and known as style \"LP\" lawn fencing, with the necessary gates, posts and scantling. Please bear this matter in mind and arrange as soon as conditions permit next Spring to have the new fence erected in front of this school.\n\nRelative to the water tank or container, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of a new tank of sufficient capacity to meet the requirements. While a serviceable tank should be supplied, the cost should be as reasonable as possible. After this tank has been delivered, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe disposition made by you of the old closets has been noted. You should see that the site on which they stood is properly filled in and levelled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDeseronto, Ont,\nDecember 30th, 1929\n\nSIR:\n\nIn farther reference to your letter of Nov 29th Re a water jar for this school, I beg to say that I called on Mr Ives of Belleville who sells crockery and he gave me his price on water tanks a three gallon tank complete $2.75 and a four gallon complete $3.25 at his store, and I would recommend that one tank be placed in each school.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nG M Campbell\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 3, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, quoting prices for which you can obtain a water tank for the use of the four Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery at each of the schools of a four gallon tank. It is noted that the price of these tanks, complete, is $3.25 each F.O.B. Belleville. Please arrange to have a tank delivered at each of the schools as soon as possible and forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

If this has been obtained, it is considered that it would provide satisfactory arrangements for a supply of drinking water for the pupils.\n\nYou may purchase two chains and two locks for use on the gates at the Eastern School.

In this connection I have to say that you may expend an amount not exceeding approximately $8 per month in the purchase of groceries and other supplies for each of these schools. It is noted that the teachers desire to start the serving of this lunch as soon as possible, and they may do so as soon as you have furnished them with the supplies required.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the supplies furnished.

It is in charge of Miss Helen Schell. She just completed her Normal course in June and this is her first school. She seemed interested and anxious to do her best.\n\nOut of twenty-six names on the roll, twenty-one were present.\n\nThere are twenty-seven single desks in the school.\n\nThis school is heated by a Good Cheer School Heater made by James Stewart Manufacturing Co., Woodstock.\n\nIf funds are available next year, it might be advisable to have this school painted.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith monthly school reports for the month of November 1930 which I visited on the 24th & 25th. The schools are all in good working order and all teachers are doing good work, in my report for the Eastern and Central schools I spoke of new books needed as some one has been getting in these two schools during the week ends. One book was taken out of the Eastern School last week, the Bible book which is worth $8.50. I have spoken to the caretakers about the schools being got into and they said they did not know anything about it.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nS. M. Campbell\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind.

It is also noted that there has been loss, by thieving, of textbooks, etc., from the Eastern and Central Schools. It is considered that this matter should be followed up, with a view, if possible, to ascertaining the culprit, and you should make full enquiry in order to prevent an occurrence. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of any new locks that are required for the doors of these schools, and you should see that these new locks are installed at an early date. The caretakers and teachers should keep a strict watch to prevent further loss and with a view to discovering who is entering the schools and taking the supplies.\n\nAfter you have purchased the locks and when same have been installed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

M. Campbell\nAgent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing your report for the month of May on the four Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve. It is noted that the attendance has been good at all the schools.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the front steps at the Central School, I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding approximately $5 in having any new stringers and new flooring installed. You should arrange to have these repairs carried out at an early date, and, when completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto,\nOnt.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Clarke's Report on his inspection of the TYENDINAGA CENTRAL INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on June 1st, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 34-1-6.\n\nToilets are out of doors; under separate roofs and conveniently placed. One of the draw boxes should be emptied at once.\n\nWhile we have no water supply here, I am pleased to learn that your Mr. McCougan was at the school yesterday and practically promised the teacher that a well would be provided.\n\nThere is a nasty hole in the front stoop, large enough for child to get a foot through and, if they did, running out as they do, a leg would probably be broken. In fact, the whole stoop should be rebuilt for it is all pretty well rotted out.\nOttawa, June 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Tyendinaga Central Indian Day School, recommends that the draw boxes in the toilets be emptied at once. I have to request that you will arrange to have the toilets at all the schools cleaned out and placed in a good, sanitary condition immediately after the schools close for the coming summer holidays. You should also see that these toilets are securely fastened during the holidays.\n\nSeparate vouchers, in triplicate, should be forwarded covering any expenditure incurred at each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my visit of inspection to the Tyendinaga Agency on the 30th and 31st ultimo.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThere are four Indian Day schools in the agency with a total roll of 157. On the day of my visit there were 137 pupils present. The register shows a very satisfactory average attendance. The pupils are reported as making excellent progress. Discipline in the different schools is good and the deportment of the pupils shows the results of the interest taken in them by their teachers. Besides the regular curriculum they are taught the rudiments of agriculture, sewing, knitting and mending. The classrooms are well equipped and on the whole clean and well ventilated. The outside closets are not cleaned out often enough. They should be cleaned once a month during the summer months and treated with lime to prevent odor. This applies to all four schools.\n\nThos. Mc Gookin,\nInspector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. WILLIAMS.\n\nRecommendations Tyendinaga Agency.\n\n4. Closer attention by the agent to the condition of school buildings in regard to necessary repairs and cleanliness.\n\nThos. Mc Gookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on my visit of inspection to the Tyendinaga Agency on the 30th and 31st ultimo.\n\nCENTRAL SCHOOL\n\nIn very fair condition. The interior needs redecorating. The classroom is dingy and depressing. There is no well here. The water has to be brought from a barnyard well about 40 rods from the school and has never been tested for drinking purposes. It is thought that water could be found on the school lot at very little expense for drilling. There are several drilled wells in the vicinity where water has been found at 50 feet.\n\nThos. Mc Gookin,\nInspector.\nOttawa, July 18, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, who recently visited the Central School on the Tyendinaga Reserve, draws attention to the water supply. He states that the water used at the school has to be brought from a barnyard well about 40 rods from the school and that this water has never been tested for drinking purposes. He considers that water could be found on the school lot at very little expense for drilling, as there are several drilled wells in the vicinity where water has been found at 50\u00a2.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your report on the question of providing a water supply for this school. You should state whether you consider the water in the well from which the supply is obtained is pure and satisfactory in all respects for drinking purposes or whether you would recommend that a well be drilled on the school property. If the latter, you should state the approximate cost of drilling a well and installing a suitable pump. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. M. Campbell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nIndian Office.\n\nDeseronto, Ont.\n\nJuly 23rd, 1932.\n\nSIR:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated July 18th, Re the water supply at the Central school, I beg to say that this school has got water at Mr Maracle's well for the past 20 years and the Maracle family uses the water in the well for the house and I have never heard of any complaint about the water.\n\nA well at this school would be a good thing but owing to the hard times it would be better to wait until next year and we might have more money to do the work.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nG. M. Campbell\n\nAgent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI certify that the services specified in this account have been satisfactorily performed, that they were necessary in the interest of the public, and that the charges made are in accordance with contract or agreement authorized by ........................................... or, if not by contract, the charges are fair and just.\n\nNo item in this account has been previously certified by me for payment.

Please forward a separate voucher for each school.\n\nIt is considered that the Department should not be required to pay specially for cleaning each school and oiling the floors. These services should have been performed by the respective caretakers, who are paid regular salaries. In view of the fact that our funds this year are so limited, you should state why you incurred this apparently unnecessary expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Campbell\nAgent.\nOttawa, September 26, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, I beg to say that the Department is paying the accounts which you have submitted for cleaning and oiling the floors at the four schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nThe cleaning of the schools and the oiling of the floors is considered to be part of the regular duties of the caretakers and the Department will not allow extra payment for this work in future. The amount paid to the caretakers of the four schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve compares favourably with that allowed caretakers at other Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

The attendance has been poor for the month on account of the wet weather and sickness cold and flu and afraid of diphtheria.\n\nThe teachers at the Eastern & Central schools asked me about the hot lunches they could get. They would like to start on December 1st. Last year the Eastern received $6.00 and Central $8.00.\n\nWill you please advise me if it is to be continued this year.\n\nAlso the grant of $50.00 to buy candy to treat the pupils at Christmas the same as other years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, enclosing your reports for the current month on the Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve, and requesting that a grant be provided to supply hot lunches to the pupils of the Eastern and Central Schools, and also for a grant to purchase supplies for a treat for the pupils at Christmas.\n\nRelative to the serving of a hot lunch to the pupils of the Central and Eastern Schools, I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, the supplies allowed for this purpose during the present winter consist of materials for a hot drink only. You may incur an expenditure to the amount of $5 per month for the Central School and $7 per month for the Eastern School in the purchase of the cocoa, sugar and milk required, if the latter cannot be supplied by the pupils themselves. This hot drink is to be served for the period from December 1st, next, to March 31st, following. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, from time to time for the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the above supplies. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The above authorized expenditure must not be exceeded in each case.\n\nRegarding the purchase of supplies for a treat at Christmas for the pupils of the four schools in your Agency, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5 for each school. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The expenditure incurred in the purchase of supplies for a Christmas treat should be shown for each school separately.

G. M. CAMPBELL ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE EASTERN SCHOOL ON THE TYENDINAGA RESERVE FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1933.\n\nWhen Inspector McGookin was at this school this month he said we should have a new fence on three sides of the grounds, and I measured it today and it will take 45 rods. The old fence is so twisted that it cannot be stretched. It will also take 20 posts, and the cost will be about $45.\n\nIn reference to the report for the Eastern School, a fence is needed badly as cattle come in the yard and do damage to the flowers and small trees. Please advise me in the matter.\nOttawa, May 29, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your report for the current month on the Tyendinaga Eastern Indian Day School regarding the new fencing required for three sides of the grounds, and giving an estimate of the cost of the posts and fencing required, I regret to inform you that the Department will have no funds to provide the cost in having this fencing carried out, and the present fence will have to serve this year.\n\nIf you consider it advisable, you may have a few minor repairs made to the old fence in order to make it as serviceable as possible, but you should incur no large expense for the purpose. If you have the repairs made, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. M.

The Mission school in particular is very much handicapped more especially during the winter months. Water for this school has to be drawn from a distance of approx. two miles. Mr. T. Emmons, the teacher, draws the water using his car to do so. He finds it very hard during the winter months to make the necessary trips owing to the bad condition of the roads. The Central school have to get water from a nearby farm. The well of this farm is in the barnyard and the water is not very good owing to seepage of surface water. The Western school secure water from a creek which although it is running water is not strictly pure owing to the fact that the creek runs through farm lands and cattle and other animals use the stream. I would suggest that in order to overcome this shortage of water and to avoid any possible chance of contamination that as soon as possible wells be made on each of the school properties.\n\nH. J. Eade,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your monthly report of the 28th ultimo, on the Tyendinaga reserve, regarding the difficulty experienced in connection with obtaining a water supply at the Central, Western and Mission Indian Day Schools and recommending that wells be provided on the property at each of these schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that, if possible, you will give an estimate of the cost of drilling wells at each of these schools. You would be guided concerning the depth it would be necessary to drill or dig by the depth of wells in the neighborhood. You might state, also, whether you would recommend that the wells be drilled or dug and how, in your opinion, the work should be carried out. The Department may have certain funds in the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year; and, if the cost is not too high, consideration will be given to having the work done when weather conditions permit this coming spring. I would request that you give particulars regarding the cost of each well, separately, including digging or drilling and the installing of a pump. When your report is received, further consideration will be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. J.

The Western School\n40 ft. of drilling @ $1.75 per ft. = $70.00\n70 ft. Casing @ $.80 \" \" = $56.00\nLocating well by expert = $25.00\nTotal = $151.00\n\n2nd. The Central School\n60 ft. of drilling @ $1.75 per ft. = $105.00\n40 ft. Casing @ $.80 \" \" = $32.00\nLocating well by expert = $25.00\nTotal = $162.00\n\n3rd. The Mission School\n70 ft. of drilling @ $1.75 per ft. = $122.50\n50 ft. Casing @ $.80 \" \" = $40.00\nLocating well by expert = $25.00\nTotal = $187.50\n\nW. D.

And your letter of March 6th, file 34-1-5.\n\nI have to report further and state that in accordance with your request to secure estimates of the cost of having wells dug or drilled at each of the schools mentioned, I secured from two well drillers of Belleville Ont., estimates of the approx cost, and these I have enclosed for your perusal.\n\nIt will be noted that only an approx. estimate can be given, and that any drilling undertaken whether water is found or not will have to be paid for. In the estimate of W.E Gartley he gives a price down to a certain depth, if he had to go deeper before water was found the cost would be increased so much per foot. Mr Gartley can also supply the pumps.\n\nIn the case of the estimate submitted by W.D Elliott the installation of pumps would be an extra charge. The price for drilling is also more expensive, and there are extra charges for a water finding expert.\n\nI may say there is already a cement top and pump on the old well at the Mission day school, this well is approx 16ft and at present dry, Mr Gartley considers that he can drill deeper in this well and get water, if this can be done the pump which is there can be used again.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.

Mr. H. J. Rade, the local Indian Agent, was requested to furnish an estimate of the cost of drilling the wells, supplying and installing pumps with cement platforms.\n\nIt is difficult to give an exact estimate of the cost, as this will depend on the depth it will be necessary to drill in order to obtain a good supply of water. Mr. Rade submits the estimate of W. E. Cartley, a competent well driller, of Belleville, Ont., covering drilling, supplying and installing casing and pumps, and cement platform, as follows:-\n\n| School       | Cost   |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Western      | $71.00 |\n| Central      | $55.00 |\n| Mission      | $60.00 |\n\nHe also forwards an estimate from W.

I would request your authority to proceed with the work and will be pleased to be advised if it will be satisfactory to have Mr. W. E. Cartley, who is a competent well driller and who furnishes the lowest quotation, do the work, or the names of any other well drillers in Belleville or Deseronto, whom you desire an opportunity be given to quote.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with repairs to day schools on the Indian reserves for the fiscal year, I beg to inquire whether there will be any funds available for decorating purposes in connection with the four Indian day schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve.\n\nThe interior of these schools are badly in need of decoration, the ceilings and walls are very dirty and should if possible be cleaned up.

And your reply of May 10th, file 34-1-5, in which you advise that arrangements may be made with Mr Gartley to carry out the work at the prices quoted by him, as follows:\n\n| School          | Price |\n|-----------------|-------|\n| Western School  | $71.00|\n| Central School  | $85.00|\n| Mission School  | $60.00|\n\nI have to report further and advise that I communicated with Mr Gartley and informed him that he could proceed with the work at the above mentioned prices. Mr Gartley however after receiving my letter interviewed me and stated that he was not just satisfied with the definite prices allowed by the Department for the work, and that the prices quoted by him were only approximate, according to the depths mentioned, and that should it be found necessary to go deeper he would expect to be paid for additional drilling at a rate of $1.50 per foot. Also that in the event that water is not found after drilling a reasonable depth, he would expect to be paid at the same rate as if water were found. I may say that it is customary in drilling wells for the driller to charge a certain price per foot, whether water is found or not, if water is not found, or if the water is found and turns out to be mineral or unfit for use, it is usual to try again at a reduced price on some other location on the property.\n\nMr Gartley before proceeding with the work would like to have definite assurance from the Department that if it is found necessary to go to a greater depth than that mentioned in the quotation, that he will receive additional pay at the rate mentioned, and also that in the event of water not being found that he will receive payment for his work at the rate mentioned namely $1.50 per foot.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J. Eads\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, May 31, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, with reference to the quotations received from Mr. W. E. Gartley, Belleville, Ont., for the drilling of wells and the installation of pumps at each of the Western, Central and Mission Indian Day Schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve. It is noted that the prices quoted for drilling the wells were approximate, according to the depth mentioned in Mr. Gartley's quotation. Should it be found necessary to drill deeper, the Department would allow payment at the additional rate of $1.50 per foot. If water is not found at a reasonable depth, Mr. Gartley should cease drilling and you should report the matter to the Department, for further instructions, at the same time, stating what further action you would advise be taken.\n\nThe Department would like to have this work commenced at an early date. It is hoped it will not be found necessary to go to any great depth in excess of the figure mentioned in Mr. Gartley's quotation. In the event of water not being found, he will be paid for his work at the rate mentioned, viz.: $1.50 per foot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nSecretary\n\nH. J.

Jan. 8th 1936\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nSchools Branch\nOttawa\nOntario.\n\nDear Sirs:\u2014 I understand that the representative of a Company selling Indoor Sanitary Toilets, has waited upon your Agent at Deseronto with the object of interesting him and through him, your Department in equipping the Mohawk Schools in Tyendinaga with this accommodation.\n\nLet me premise what I am about to say with the statement that I am not in any way attempting to promote the sale of any particular style of Toilet. I have no interest financially in any company selling any school equipment. But I am deeply interested in the children that it is my privilege to meet from time to time as their Public School Inspector. I have visited your schools officially now for twenty-eight years, and they are as much to me as are the Public Schools under my inspection. Hence I am very desirous of seeing them have the advantage of modern sanitary accommodations. As I see it, it would be an excellent object lesson to these people of what should be. It is next to impossible to make children, particularly boys, take any care of the ordinary school outdoor toilets. Your children are no worse than others, but I have visited these schools when the toilets were an abomination. I have had frequent complaints from the teacher at the Eastern School, that tourists use the toilets after school hours, and foul them on occasion to a disgraceful state. It does not seem possible to keep them out. The schools off the Provincial Highway do not suffer to the same extent. I have been able of late to report the toilets as \"reasonably clean.\"\n\nPoor Copy\nwith the exception of eight, are equipped with indoor sanitary toilets, and I would very much like to see your schools equipped similarly.\n\nI suppose that financial considerations have to enter into the matter at these times, but if the finances of the Department will stand the expense, in my opinion it would be a good investment to make, from the point of view of elevating the Indian, as well as promoting the health of the school girls who are approaching womanhood, and have to use in cold weather, the out-of-doors toilets. Of course they have to use them at home, and they always will unless they are shown the advantages of something better.\n\nThe representative referred to in the beginning of this letter called on me today, and told me that Mr. Eade would welcome my support in this matter. Hence this letter.\n\nI would just like to say at this point, that while I have not had the privilege of meeting Mr. Eade since he became your Agent at Deseronto, I would like to say how much I appreciate the interest he is taking in these schools. In the past, I have had to advocate desired improvements, alone or almost alone. He sees the needs and is willing to co-operate in securing them. I feel that it is only simple justice to him, to say this, for I firmly believe that he is endeavouring to be a real agent.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nH.J. Clarke\nP.S. Inspector\nOttawa, January 11, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the installation of indoor sanitary toilets at the Tyendinaga Indian day schools.\n\nIt is agreed that this would be a very desirable improvement, but, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to favourably consider the matter at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

This year however the teacher of the Mission school Miss Lilian Brant can arrange to serve hot lunches to her pupils if given the material to do so, namely soups or cocoa and other necessities.\n\nIn making this request I have to state that many of the pupils attending these schools come from a long distance and carry their noonday meal with them; the cocoa or soup supplied hot at school is of great benefit to them.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

If granted the money will be spent in such a way that each child will receive an equal share of fruit or candies which will be distributed under the supervision of the teachers of the four schools.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

In making the request in that way I made a mistake. What I intended to request was that $25.00 per month be allowed for the purpose of supplying lunches. Last year the amount per month allowed by the Department was $20.00 but this year the teacher of the Mission school is willing to look after the lunch for her pupils if the Department will approve of the extra sum involved.\n\nWill you please write me and give your approval if possible, lunches will be served in the three schools during the months of December to April of the present academic year.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

If you will refer to Department letter dated February 19th 1925, File 34-1-5 you will be in a better position to find on your files the actual cost of this heater. It would appear however that the contractor purchased the heater and installed it in the school.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nH.J.

As a result, we have no definite information regarding the name of the manufacturer of the heater which was placed in the school at that time. You may make inquiries and let me know what type of heater you consider most suitable for this school.\n\nPlease let me have the catalogue number and the approximate cost, in order that I may have all the information necessary to place the matter before our purchasing agent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nH.

A Christmas treat was given to each pupil, supplied by the Department, and the children spent a happy time.\n\nNoonday lunches are now being served in the schools, and it is a great benefit to the children who are unable to return home for noonday lunch, owing to the distance some of them live from the school. Cod Liver oil is also being given once a day to each pupil in all schools, this is found to be very beneficial and helps to build the children up and ward off colds. The children are all well clothed and the schools are kept warm and comfortable.\n\nH. J.

Boxes should be emptied before they become the breeding place for millions of flies.\n\nMISSION\n\nToilets are poor affairs, particularly the boys'. The draw-box is not properly placed, and the interior of the box so light that it will soon be the breeding place of millions of flies. You have no screen door, and one window is unscreened.\n\nEASTERN\n\nToilets require repairs, particularly the boys'. The three entrances are out of repair. The flooring at the main entrance is so badly decayed that someone is liable to break through and suffer a serious injury.\n\nWESTERN\n\nToilet boxes should be emptied at once. They are nearly filled. The space for the boxes should be darkened, so as to exclude flies or they will breed by millions in the filth. At present the interior of the boxes is about as light as if they were out in the open.\n\nM.W. McCracken, Esq.,\nIn Charge Tyendinaga Indian Agency,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nWESTERN (Cont'd)\n\nThe fences are out of repair. Horses have been on the yard and when they went out, they took the front gate and post with them. The children are attempting to have flower beds, but what is the use unless the fences are repaired?\n\nThe above-mentioned matters should receive immediate attention, particularly the cleaning of the toilets.\n\nFor your information I may add that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $350.00 was provided for general repairs and painting at the four schools in the Tyendinaga Agency. It would be appreciated if you would let me know in what manner you consider the above amount should be expended. In the event of any material being required full particulars should be given in order that purchase can be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 24-1-5 of June 16th with reference to Inspector Clarke's reports concerning the four Indian Day Schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve and would beg to submit a report on the general repairs which are considered necessary at each of the following schools.\n\n**Eastern School**\n\nOne side of school roof leaks and should be patched with shingles.\n\nRepairs to floors at main entrance as well as boys' and girls' entrances as floor boards and posts have become rotten and broken in some places.\n\nBoth boys' and girls' toilets require shingles on roofs.\n\nA new door is needed in boys' toilet.\n\nRepair broken and missing boards in screens around toilets and replacing of a rotted post at one end of girls' screen.\n\nNew seat needed in boys' toilet.\n\nWindows in three entrances to school need reputting.\n\nRepair to broken lattice work on girls' entrance.\n\nThe total cost of material and labour for the above mentioned repairs considered necessary at the Eastern School is estimated at $35.00.\n\n**Central School**\n\nA new fence should be erected on three sides of this school as the old fence on the east, west and north sides is in very poor condition. A total of 35 rods of ordinary galvanized woven wire fence is needed to prevent damage by cattle to the school property.\n\nTwo loads of gravel placed around the front entrance would help fill the large hollow and assist in eliminating water and mud which surrounds entrance in wet weather.\n\nMinor repairs to toilets is also thought necessary.\n\nThe total cost for material and labour for fencing, gravel and repairs is estimated at $40.00.\nMission School\n\n1 screen door required for front entrance.\n1 screen for window.\nA new shingle roof is necessary on boys' toilet, also new flooring and repairs to screens.\nToilet boxes need adjustment and new gate at rear to help darken the interior.\n\nEstimated cost of material and labour for above repairs is estimated to be $20.00.\n\nWestern School\n\nA new fence around this school property is badly needed. I consider an ordinary woven wire fence would be suitable and would cost approximately $50.00 for material and labour.\n\nBoards are missing and broken in both toilets and if these were repaired the interior would be darkened. Bracing of posts and boards on screens are necessary which would cost in the vicinity of $10.00 for material and labour and this would greatly improve these toilets.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted to have this repair work done as outlined above for each of these four schools. Indian carpenters would be engaged to do the carpentry work and Indian labour on the fencing to be done would be used. The unexpended balance of the $350.00 available would be ascertained when this work has been completed and could then be used in painting the Eastern School or any one of the other schools as they are all badly in need of painting.\n\nIn connection with Inspector Clarke's recommendations concerning the emptying of the toilets at the Central School, I would advise that these were not more than one-quarter full on date of my visit. However, the toilets at the Western School do need emptying. This work at each of the four schools will be attended to in the very near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken, In Charge\nTyendinaga Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 30, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, you may expend an amount of $40.00 for material and labour in repairing the fence at the Tyendinaga Central Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nM.

General repair work found necessary at these schools is being done by Indian labour. It was impossible to secure an Indian carpenter in July to do carpentry work at the schools due to the fact that all Indian carpenters were employed in the construction of the storage granary. This caused delay in having repair work done on the schools but repairing has now been started and should be completed by the end of next week. After the repair work on the schools is completed, it is thought that there will be some unexpended funds from the $350.00 which was set aside by the Department for school repairs at this agency and if so, it is suggested that one or two of the schools be painted this year. However, the unexpended balance cannot be ascertained until the repair work has been finished. A letter in connection with the painting of the schools will be forwarded to the department at a later date.\n\nM. W. McCracken,\nIn Charge.\nDeseronto, Ontario.\nAugust 12th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder Departmental letters of June 30th, files 34-1-5, 34-2-5, 34-3-5, 34-4-5, authorization was granted to have certain repair work done at each of the four Indian Day Schools on the Tyendinaga Reserve. This work is being carried out in accordance with instructions. Due to the fact that all Indian carpenters were engaged in working on the storage granary during June and July, it was not possible to commence the school work until this month as an Indian carpenter could not be secured. This caused delay in completing the repairs to the schools but it is expected that the repairs will be completed by the end of next week. When work on repairing the entrances etc. was started, it was found that other repairs which were not included in the original estimate would be necessary. Due to this, the estimate of money to be expended for these repairs may be slightly exceeded. The accounts which will include cost of material and labour for fencing and general repair work at these schools will be forwarded when the work is completed next week.\n\nAfter the work which has already been authorized on these schools is completed, it is almost certain that there will be a considerable unexpended balance remaining from the $350.00 available for Tyendinaga schools this year. As the Department are no doubt aware, each one of the four schools needs painting badly. In view of the fact that the Eastern School is on the Ontario Provincial Highway, I would suggest that it be painted first at an estimated cost for material and labour of $75.00. If the unexpended balance is still sufficient after the Eastern School has been painted, I would recommend painting the Western School at approximately the same cost as the Eastern. A competent Indian painter is available to do this work which should be commenced immediately so that it would be finished before school opens in September.\n\nI would wish to be advised if it meets with the approval of the Department to paint the Eastern School. After this has been done, the amount of funds still available could be determined and if sufficient, the Western School could then be painted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken, In Charge\nTyendinaga Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Aff's Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of your recommendation you are authorized to proceed with the painting of the school referred to by you as the Eastern School on the Ontario Provincial Highway. It is noted that the cost of painting this school is not likely to exceed $75.00. It is highly desirable that this work should be undertaken and completed at the earliest possible date. After the work at the Eastern School has been completed you might communicate with us again in respect to the other schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nM. W.

The roof on the All Saint's Church on this reserve was completely torn off. A large steeple crashed through the roof of the Christ's Church. Chimneys on the Council Hall were blown down and many small buildings and parts of roofs, garages, etc. were demolished throughout the reserve. In view of the extensive damage done to the Churches which are band property and would therefore have to be repaired from funds of the Band, I did notify the Department immediately after the storm and Mr. Patrick did visit this agency to inspect the damage.\n\nA small portion of the shingle roof was torn off the Western school and numerous panes of glass were broken in each of the four Indian Day schools. Repairs at the schools were considered urgent and have been completed. Instructions are being awaited from the Department in connection with repair work necessary at the two Churches and in the meantime I authorized Rev. Pringle to conduct Church services in the two Day Schools on this reserve.\n\nM.W. McCracken,\nIn Charge.\nDeseronto, Ontario.\nOctober 14th, 1939.\n\nJohn A.

Our four Indian Day Schools withstood the effects of the storm fairly well and only minor damage was done such as windows being broken, a small section of the shingle roof on the Western School being uplifted, doors being blown off and screens around the toilets being blown down.\n\nThese repairs had to be attended to almost immediately and I did authorize John A. Maracle, Indian carpenter who did the repair work on the Day Schools last Summer, to do the necessary repair work.\n\nI would recommend that the Department approve of this expenditure as the work done was urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I am told that has been done in past number of years, would you please advise me about this as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Wendell\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa Canada\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding Christmas treats for the children of the Tyendinaga schools I would refer you to official letter of December 6, 1939, in which the former Agent was advised that the Department did not intend to make any grants for this purpose after the year 1939.\n\nIt is considered that the teacher should be able to arrange a concert a week or so before Christmas and either charge a small admission fee or take up a collection. By so doing sufficient funds should be raised to provide a Christmas treat for the pupils attending the school. In addition it should have a tendency to make the Indian parents realize that they have some obligations with regard to the education of their children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

This ceiling should have three coats of white or light ivory paint and the wall which are of plaster should have two coats of ivory after some small repairs have been made to cracked and loose plaster. The main-scoting in the class-room as well as all interior woodwork should be cleaned and given another coat of varnish in an endeavor to brighten it up.\n\nWhile an expensive wood was used in the finish in this school it was to light and every door in the school is loose, due to the frames cracking and splitting and not being of a substantial wood to hold nails and screws and it will be necessary to replace a portion of each of these door frames. The same conditions exists in the cloak rooms where this fine lumber is full of holes and split from screws from coat hangers, all of which hangers are now off the walls. These boards should also be replaced by heavier and harder wood.\n\nA new front door 36\" X 7' X 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" with 6 small panes is also needed as the present door is quite the worse for wear and has been repaired many times.\n\nIn addition the following small repairs are needed at this school,\n\n- A small toolshed for storing windows, screens, garden tools, etc., 4' X 4' X 7' high of matched lumber to be erected behind the coal shed on the north side.\n- Repair screens, doors and boxes at the school outhouses.\n- Re-nail wire fencing to posts and install 2 pieces of 2 X 4 in same.\n- Make urinal trough in boys outhouse.\n- Repair locks or replace same on two doors in class-room.\n- Repair protective screen around stove in class-room.\n- Install new sill at front door of school.\n- Floor school porch with 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch flooring, size 5' X 6'.\n- Repair and tighten down some class-room desks.\n- Procure and install 80 feet of savetroughing, 20 feet of conductor pipe and four elbows to replace present pipe which is rotten and useless and is allowing water to damage the foundation of the school.\n\nThe cost of the materials necessary to make these repairs should not exceed $85.00 and the cost of the labour $60.00 and it is requested that authority be granted to procure the necessary materials and that an advance be made for wages to be accounted for by credit voucher.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA.

October 15th 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nTyendinaga School Improvement Competition.\n\nA competition was held this year for the improvement of the grounds at the four day schools on Tyendinaga Reserve and in May last an inspection was made of the schools and they were listed in accordance with their advanced state of improvement at that time and given the following classification; 1st Eastern; 2nd Mission; 3rd Central and 4th Western.\n\nIn the early Spring trees were procured from the Ontario Forestry Branch and shrubs from a nursery and were planted in accordance with the landscape plans provided by Mr. Chas. Buchanan of the Ontario Agricultural Department. Annual plants and flowers were also supplied and planted by the teachers and pupils of the schools.\n\nOn October 14th Mr. Buchanan did judge these school grounds to award prizes for the school showing the greatest improvement since his inspection of the grounds in May and the following was the result of such judging,\n\n1st Central Day School, Prize $5.00\n2nd Eastern Day School, \" 3.00\n3rd Western Day School, \" 2.00\n4th Mission Day School. Painting.\n\nThe prizes were given through local contributions and have been an incentive to make this competition a success and Mr. Buchanan states that he finds a greater improvement for the year at the reserve schools than was found in all the schools of the Counties of Lennox and Addington, which are his charge.\n\nGarden tools, lawn mowers, etc., have been supplied the reserve schools and next Spring it is hoped to continue this improvement plan in planting more shrubs and nursery trees to make an advanced improvement to the schools of the Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent\nOttawa, October 19, 1942.\n\nRe: Tyendinaga School Improvement Competition\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and to thank you very heartily for the information contained therein.\n\nIt is to the officials here and to myself a great source of satisfaction and encouragement to learn of the attempts that have been made to improve and beautify school grounds on the Tyendinaga reserve. It is difficult to over-emphasize the effect of neat and well kept school grounds on the minds of growing pupils.\n\nWe note from the information contained in the last paragraph of your communication that it is your intention to continue and to extend this work during the spring and summer season. It is our intention to send forward a summary of your letter to the Director for his information. A summary will also be sent forward to the Minister's office.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. A. D. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nDeseronto, Ont.\nDeseronto, Ont.,\nJanuary 4th 1945.\n\nSecretary,\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nThe attendance at the day schools has not been good and part of this can be attributed to severe colds, the balance to the lack of co-operation by the parents in sending their children regularly. The weather during December has been very severe and this has attributed some to the poor attendance. Mission School was closed for nine days during the month on account of the teacher being ill. Manual training materials have not as yet been supplied the school and we are waiting the decision of the Fair Board as to whether they intend holding a fair next year and providing prize money for school exhibits, as this materials is secured to make products that are listed for prizes in the school exhibits. The board are late in making their decision, which is expected during the month of January.\n\nA.D.

D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nADM: MMM\nREPORT ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1946.\n\nSchools:\n\nThe attendance at the schools has been quite good and during the latter part of the month, a considerable number of the elder pupils were kept from school to assist their parents on their farms in planting spring grain and canning crops. Public School Inspector Birkin, Napanee, Ont., made his official visit to the schools on May 22nd and 23rd, there being a very good attendance at Central and Western and only a fair turnout at Mission and Eastern Schools. I visited these schools at the time of Mr. Birkin's inspection and this official seemed well satisfied with the progress of the pupils and the services of the teachers and spoke highly of the vocational program being carried out. Suggestions were made in connection with some minor repairs, a report of which will be made after my June visit to the schools, so that the work can be done during the vacation period. Mr. Birkin seems favourable to a consolidated school project on the Tyendinaga Reserves, as some progress has been made in this in his inspectorate of the Counties Lennox and Addington with marked success in administration and equipment and accommodation at rural schools.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nDeseronto, Ontario, June 30th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIt is recommended that a screen door and also a batten storm door be provided for the Central Indian Day School, both of which are necessary during the different seasons of the year. The cost and installation of both these doors should not exceed $10.00, and could be purchased from local merchants.\n\nCentral is in a very good state of repair and no other work is contemplated this year.\n\nA.

It should be replaced entirely and I would suggest the location be moved down the hill behind the school where they will not be so conspicuous.\n\nCentral School, under Mr. Claus, has a very small attendance - about sixteen pupils. The building is in good condition except for the odd minor repair and some paint.\nDeseronto, Ont.\nJuly 30th, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to the Day Schools on Tyendinaga Reserve, it is submitted that since it is improbable that further action with regards to a two room school will be taken before the Fall term commences, it will be necessary to effect certain necessary repairs to the present schools.\n\nIt is therefore requested that the sum of $500.00 be forwarded to this Office to pay for these minor repairs, lumber and materials, so that the necessary repairs may be effected at an early date.\n\nIn so far as materials are concerned, they will only be in the nature of small quantities of screening, paint and lumber, which should not total more than $100.00 and it is therefore requested that permission be granted to purchase any materials locally rather than through the purchasing agent, so as to avoid any unnecessary delay since exact quantities are not known.\n\nCould I be advised of any further information you require at your earliest opportunity, please.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.C. Dimmell,\nfor Indian Agent.\nREQUISITION FOR CHEQUE\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: Mines and Resources\nBRANCH: Indian Affairs\nDATE: August 13, 1948\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|            | Tyendinaga Indian Agency Trust Account...........| $500.00|\n\nSend cheque to:\nMr. N.C.

We have three Indian schools in operation there and one now vacant.\n\nThe rather serious problem now confronts us of either opening the old school again or arranging to transport these Indian children to the nearby Provincial School at Shannonville.\n\nThere are several complicated factors to be considered in making a decision. One of the most serious is the high cost of transportation.\n\nThere are twelve children from this reserve now attending high school and seven at the Belleville Collegiate.\n\nI would appreciate receiving your approval for my visit to this reserve for Monday, May 16, and Tuesday, May 17.\n\nI would also welcome an opportunity of discussing with you the proposed inspection trip of the schools in the Port Arthur Agency, which I mentioned to you previously.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nRELATING TO EDUCATIONAL MATTERS ON TYENDINAGA INDIAN RESERVE\n\n(1) Primary Education: There are approximately 145 pupils now attending Elementary Schools, 100 of these are attending our three schools on the Reserve, and 45 are going to schools outside the Reserve. Of the 100, approximately 50 are attending Eastern Day School, 32 Mission Day School and 18 Central Day School. Of the 45 pupils attending outside Schools, 2 are at Deseronto Public School, 31 at Shannonville, 12 at Milltown Public School, the others attend Deseronto High School and Belleville Collegiate. Besides the Indian Pupils there are a number of white children resident on leased land on the reserve, who at present are not eligible to attend Indian Schools.\n\nWe have at present 3 Indian Schools in operation and one vacant. Eastern Day School is situated on No. 2 Highway, Lot 32, Con. A. This is a fine frame school in a good state of repair. It has a good basement used for teaching Home Economics and Shop and quite a large play ground. At present it is vastly overcrowded because the population seems to have shifted to the east end of the reserve.\n\nMission School, is located on Lot 27, Con.2, is a frame structure which has been in use for quite a long time. Although there has been a number of complaints from the Teacher that the building is done, I cannot say that I have any evidence to substantiate these claims. The building is certainly not as well kept as the Eastern School, nor are the grounds in as good shape. There is a separated teacherage at this school, which is in a good state of repair.\n\nCentral School, also a frame structure is in good state of repair and has a fine set of grounds. It is located on Lot 21, Con. A. and as its name would indicate is central on the reserve.\n\nWestern, our fourth school building, is located on Lot 10, Con.2. I did inspect this building and find that with very little cleaning and redecorating it will be quite suitable to put into use again. I understand it was closed a few years back when the school population decreased. However there are sufficient now to make a good school (see map). I therefore recommend that this school be put into shape for the next Fall Term.\n\nThere may be need also for another School building to relieve the congestion at Eastern School. I am not prepared to suggest a site at the present time for this new building, but I am of the opinion that it should be located somewhere south and west of Eastern School. I shall enclose with this report a map locating all the pupils on the reserve, from which you may be able to determine a suitable location before visiting the reserve.\n\nThe suggestion has been put forward that one central graded school would be advisable for this reserve and then transport the pupils to it by bus. While this plan may have many advantages in so far as better education is concerned I do see the following objections:\n\nIf we hired the transportation it would cost approximately $90.00 per pupil per year. This added cost would not be offset by any saving in teachers or any greater economy of operation costs. Also the time the pupils would be away from home would be greatly increased on the average due to the loop method used by school buses. This added time is generally taken from the children's \"free\" time as the same chores still have to be done at home. We would also be using a great amount of money for a new school building to replace our four good schools buildings.\n\nAt the present time we have 3 teachers on the reserve; Miss Stoddart, I find quite capable and doing an excellent job at Eastern School. She lives in the Town of Deseronto and commutes night and morning.\n\nMrs Elliott lives with her husband in the Teacherage at Mission School. She has lived on the reserve practically all her life and so has become quite an influence.\n\nMr Claus is an Indian on the Reserve and has been teaching at Central School. I am of the opinion that he will resign this year and take up carpentry and farming, for which I feel he is well suited.\nI do feel that our teachers might give more leadership in their communities to encourage the children in extra curricular activities. Having taught myself, for some years, I understand the objections the teachers will raise to this suggestion, but I repeat that I expect teachers to give some leadership in the community. I have been able to hold a Staff meeting a month and am of the opinion that this is a good policy, as teachers and I are able to exchange ideas and settle a number of problems.\n\nIn so far as the curriculum used on this reserve is concerned I believe it to be on the whole satisfactory. However, in view of the fact that our High School pupils number somewhat less than 9% of Public School enrolment, it would seem that our Public School curriculum must fit the children for life. I would therefore suggest introduction of some more practical subjects. Home Economics at present is taught in only one school, as is crafts (to any extent). Also we have little instruction in music, which is a poor policy, because these Indians have great natural musical abilities. The difficulty to introducing these courses is in obtaining competent teachers. It may be possible to co-operate with schools outside the reserve and make use of itinerant teachers, particularly for music. I recommend that this suggestion be given due consideration.\n\n**SECONDARY EDUCATION**: At present we have 12 pupils from the reserve attending Secondary Schools, 5 at Deseronto High School and 7 at Belleville Collegiate and Vocational School. Notwithstanding this paucity of Secondary pupils the level of achievement of these pupils is very low, so low that I am inclined to think that our children are building up a reputation for poor scholarship for the Indians. Of course there are a few exceptions. I am at a loss to get a full explanation of this situation, but one reason might be put forward, that is the home background which is not encouraging; another sometimes suggested is the scarcity of openings for trained Indians resulting in little incentive for scholars. Apparently the inherent reticence of the Indian has also probably discouraged a number from taking higher education.\n\n**Other Training**: At present we have only one girl attending an institution other than high or public school. There just doesn't seem to be any incentive or interest in further training when the pupils reach the age of 16 or 18. However I have had a number of older men and women express regret that they had not proceeded further with their education. If these expressions are sincere it might be possible to introduce short courses during the off seasons. One which has already been suggested is \"farm wiring\" (in view of the fact that we are expecting to get the reserve wired next year). The Ontario Government sponsors a series of these courses locally and we may be able to make use of their organization next winter.\nDeseronto, Ont.\nMay 6th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAtt'n Col. Neary\n\nEnclosed please find report relating to the educational set-up on the Tyendinaga Reserve at the present time, also a map of the reserve locating all the pupils on the reserve. The numbers indicate pupils attending school and pre-school age in each family (i.e., 4-2 would indicate 4 children attending school, 2 pre-school age). I would appreciate your bringing this map with you when you visit the reserve next week.\n\nThe list of repairs included in the report, particularly the painting, will be revised according to your instructions.\n\nI have not included in this report the problem of white children resident on the reserve, getting to school. I will discuss this with you at a later date.\n\nD.R.Cassie,\nSupt. Tyendinaga Agency.\n\nENC.(3)\nMay 17, 1949.\n\nMr. J.R.

Stoddart in the Tyendinaga Eastern School.\n\nBernard F.

The local Superintendent has found it necessary to watch his work continually as Mr. Claus is somewhat inclined to be lackadaisical.\n\nThis will be his last year teaching and his wife will take over the school in September.\n\nI have recommended to Mr. Cassie that some interior decoration scheme at this school be followed in re-equipping the Tyendinaga Western School.\n\nBernard F.

The school is situated on the west side of the island and is fairly centrally situated. The building is about 20 x 26 feet and is in good condition, and the grounds, about 100 x 120 feet, are fenced and kept in good order. The outbuildings are in good condition. There was a supply of about 5 cords of wood piled up in the yard. The seats are old bench seats, taken, I think, from an old church which has been replaced by a new church, and give seating capacity for 32 pupils. The stove and fuses are in fair condition. There is a fair blackboard, globe, map of the older provinces of the Dominion, and a map of the world. The teacher requires the first part of the First Book in the form of tablet lessons. There were 35 pupils present on the day of my visitation, 22 boys and 13 girls. The order was good, and the teacher evidently has good control of the school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Aug 28, 1894\npupils conducted themselves well and spoke\nwith very satisfaction in the course of the\nexamination. The school appears to be doing\nwell, and if its present efficiency is\nmaintained, and the attendance of the pupils\nis reasonably regular, they ought to make\ngood progress. The walls are decorated\nby a number of mottoes, pictures, and\nvarious leaflettes. The Church of Eng-\nland contributes $100 a year toward the\nmaintenance of the school, and the Depart-\nment $200.\n\nThe following were among the exercises\ngiven in arithmetic:\n\nNotation - 1416 777,666 (1) 3657\n2,307 202,202 4312\n34,563 440,440 2163\n52,078 5,609 5429\n168,914 9,065 15961\n\n(2) 1327 (3) 968716 (4) 31423\n7236 759824 219354\n1342 208891 98069\n6516 20420 (5) 67458 (6) 67458\n3 202374 472206\n\n(7) 523 (8) 523\n23 2613\n1869 1046\n1046 13075\n\nThe following is the result of the examination:\nI beg to report that I have, this day, \nand by the same mail, forwarded to \nthe Department, included in one large \n10 x 14 envelope, as follows viz:\n\nReturn of No. 1 Ojibwa School at Whale \nIsland for March 1896,\nAmount Monthly Expense in School \nfor Month of March\nand Application for Teacher's Salary $50.00 \nfor Month ended 31st March 1896.\n\nAnd\n\nReturn of No. 2 Ojibwa School for \nMarch 1896,\nAmount Monthly Expense for March,\nand Application for Teacher's Salary $45.00 \nfor Month ended 31st March 1896.\n\nTo the\nSuperintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada.\n\nSam Lee\nApril 1896\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your circular (special notice) dated 6th instant stating that many teachers are disregarding instructions with regard to filling out and adding columns in Quarterly reports etc.\n\nI have not noticed in answering reports that any of our teachers have failed in this particular, but will be more particular myself in future, and if there is anything lacking in any report in this quarter I will see that it is supplied before the reports are sent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\n\nTo the\nDept.

There are 17 children of school age in the Division 5 of whom are on the School Roll with an average attendance of 75 so that the statement of the Petitioners that they are in the Majority can hardly be maintained as to Dismissing the Present Teacher to make a vacancy to be filled.\n\nPoor Copy\nto be filled by Peter Thomas.\n\nI am quite sure that Inspector Borden would not recommend such a course.\n\nNeither do I recommend it. The teacher is doing well in the school, and has always done well.\n\nPeter Thomas had his innings in the school, and could not keep it. The reason why is not at all creditable to him, and to push out a young man without a voice, to make a vacancy for one that can't pay that. Neither can any one else, would be such an outrage that no honest person could expect to succeed in accomplishing such thing.\n\nTo the Secretary, Indian Affairs Office, Ottawa, Canada.\n\n[Signature]\nSamlin\nSuperintendent\nChief N.W.

A good many of the older children from the Island attend the Industrial schools at Sault Ste Marie and Mt. Elgin, but that is no reason why the younger ones should not receive a good elementary education.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nAdvice not given to specify to teachers what certificates they must have.\nOTTAWA, 9th November, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo transmitting a Resolution of the Council of the Chippewas and Pottawatomies of Wallaceburg Island against the establishment of a central school on their reserve; and in reply I beg to inform you that the Department regrets that the Indians do not feel disposed to entertain this proposition favorably, as there is no doubt that there children would be benefited by the establishment of a properly graded school. In view of their decision it only remains for the Department to see that their present schools are made as efficient as possible, and to this end it will be necessary for the present teachers to obtain district certificates before the re-opening of the schools next year if they wish to retain their positions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.B. McDougall, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nSarnia, Ont., Aug. 16th 1904.\n\nMr. J.B. McDougall,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a letter signed by Peter W. Thomas, Peter Willis, and Daniel Chawme stating that their teachers were duly notified to attend the Examinations at Sarnia the first week of July and that they failed to do so. They further protest as Trustees against their schools being taught longer by their present teachers and state that they are in favor of having a higher grade of teachers.\n\nIn compliance with their request I beg you to forward this letter to the Indian Department with such observations as you may desire to make relative to the matter in question.\n\nI may add that in my judgment the Indians should be notified that as soon as they vote to close up the little old school houses they now have and build a two-roomed central school they will be given teachers holding higher grades of certificates. Under such conditions two teachers could do better work than three now do, and less money than is now paid for three teachers who some years ago were able to pass the High School Entrance, would secure two good second class teachers.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nD.D.

At the close of the Model School term at Christmas they could doubtless be secured, but not at present except at somewhat high salaries.\nWalpole Island, Aug 29th\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose you a letter received from school inspectors & teachers regarding the schools on the reserve that never will be satisfactory, given in the matter until there is a central school and a higher grade of teachers when the bridge and road completed there would be a school hall at the Methodist Church that would be convenient to all those in need that would have to travel often over three miles or one of the present school houses could be changed to this central point and the other closed up. I think that if the dept. gave them to understand that something had to be done in the matter that they would take some action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn D. McGill\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 29th August, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nIn November last Mr Agent McDougall was informed that the present teachers of the Walpole Island schools would be required to obtain district certificates if they wished to retain their positions. Mr Public School Inspector Moshier has written Mr McDougall stating that the Trustees have informed him that the teachers have not complied with the Department's requirements in this respect and he considers that the only way to improve matters would be to close up the present schools and build a central school to be placed in charge of two teachers having higher qualifications. Mr Agent McDougall says that one school would answer the requirements of the reserve, and as I pointed out in my memo. of 2nd Nov. last, the Indians are quite able to pay for a modern school building, and the salaries of two duly qualified teachers. When this question was submitted to the Council last year, the Indians were not in favor of disturbing the present arrangement. I think that, as advised by the Inspector and the Agent, something should be done in the matter and I would suggest that the Indians be notified that the present schools will not be re-opened under the old teachers after the Christmas holidays, and that the question of establishing a central school be again submitted to the Indians, who should be informed at the same time that the Department considers the schools, as now conducted, to be useless, and that unless they are...\nwilling to contribute a sufficient amount to establish an up-to-date central school; the money being spent on education is now wasted.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: \"Poor Copy\"]\nOTTAWA, 2nd September, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Mr Public School Inspector MacKier regarding the Walpole Island schools; and in reply I beg to say that as the teachers failed to present themselves for examination as directed the Department proposes to close the schools at Christmas unless qualified teachers are engaged.

Your letter No. 152441 dated Jan 3rd 1905 stated that they would not be engaged unless they passed the requisite examination. They are not trying the examination and I do not think that they intended to. It was merely an excuse for continuing the schools. It would be better to close the schools than to keep the same teachers as the children are making very little progress in their studies or at all.

Mr Agent McDougall writes, stating that they have not tried the examination and that he does not think it is their intention to do so, and that in his opinion it would be better to close the schools than to keep them on.\n\nI think the Department should authorize Mr McDougall to engage new teachers for these schools.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 26th July, 1905\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with further reference to the teachers of Nos 1 and 3 schools on Walpole Island; and in reply I beg to say that as they have failed to pass the prescribed examinations, their services have been dispensed with from the 30th ultimo, in view of your report.

I passed the Public School Leaving Examination in the year 1897, and before sending in this application, I wrote to the Deputy Minister of Education to ascertain whether this certificate...\nis equivalent to the district certificate, and his reply was that it better qualified me than the district certificate.\n\nI have had six years experience of teaching music, that teaching would not be entirely new work to me.\n\nMy home is on Walpole Island, my father being the Methodist missionary there, so that I am very desirous of getting one of the Island jobs.\n\nIndeed if I were permitted to teach for this coming year, I would willingly\nattend model the following half term.\n\nyour truly,\n\nMiss Ashworth\n\nWallaceburg\n\nAug. 24, 1965\nWalpole Island Aug 25 1905\n\nSecretary, Dept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nActing under instructions of your letter No. 1384 dated July 26th I have advertised in the Toronto Globe for two teachers for No. 1 and 3 schools but have not received any applications yet. If we could get a teacher for No. 1 school I think it would be advisable to close No. 3 school up for the present as there is very few pupils in the neighbourhood of this school. I enclose you an application from Miss Agnesworth, a daughter of the Methodist Minister on the reserve. The R.S.

McDougall, Indian Agent, Walpole Island, requests me to write you re the qualifications of Miss Ethel Postill who has applied for the position of teacher at one of the Walpole Island schools.\n\nMiss Postill is now in training at the County Model School here for a professional District Certificate. Her non-professional standing is better than that of the ordinary candidate for a District Certificate as she tried last July for the Junior Teacher non-professional standing, and failed only in Physics and Latin. Her education and training is, therefore, all that you require.\n\nIf she proves to be able to govern well (and that cannot be told until she is tested in her own school) she should give good satisfaction. I think she would do better in number three school on the east side of the island (closed this term) than she would in No. 1 school where there are some large boys who may be a little hard to control. If, however, no better one applies for No. 1 she should do better work than is now being done in it, and Miss Aylesworth, now in number 1 could be transferred to No. 3 which is much smaller than No. 1, easier to manage, and only a few rods from her father's home.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nD.

But of course it was my intention to go to the island to live, at least as the two months have elapsed.\n\nWhen my parents were living out on Wolf Island, that complaint could not have been honestly made against me, and I had a three miles\nwalk to school over extremely muddy roads.

His work on such occasions was highly appreciated by both parents and pupils. If those in authority could see their way clear to hire him said school as a permanent appointment I would consider it a good thing for said school. He is a man strictly temperate being a total abstainer from the use of intoxicants of any kind.

Mr. Inspector Conn visited the school on the 21st ult. and gives her age as between 60 and 65; that she had only about six months' previous experience in teaching on a Third Class certificate, which expired long ago; that, judging from what he saw of her she knows very little of the art of teaching and, of course, is too old to learn now. He further states that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the Indians, for which, in his opinion, there is good reason.\n\nThere are about 40 children of school age in\nin the section and it would be only fair to the Indians, who pay two-thirds of the salary, that a qualified teacher should be engaged, and I would suggest that Miss Cameron be informed that her services will not be required after the summer holidays and that the necessary steps be taken to engage a competent teacher for this school.\n\nHad Mr. Gordon been more frank in his application, Miss Cameron would not have been appointed. He spoke of her as a \"young lady, qualified and well recommended\", the truth being that she is old and infirm and incompetent.\n\nMartin Benson\n\nI think Miss Cameron should be taken DC1.\nOttawa, November 19th, 1909.\n\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nEx'd\n\nI beg to call your attention to my memorandum of the 16th of July, last, in reference to the No. 1 School on Walpole Island, which is in charge of Miss Bessie Cameron. Since the date of that memorandum Mr. Public School Inspector Conn has again reported on that school and has repeated his recommendation that steps should be taken to provide an efficient teacher for this school. He does not hesitate to say that Miss Cameron is unfitted for the position in every way. Some action should be taken as the Indians are dissatisfied with her and it is unfair to them to keep her on.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 19th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you have some interest in Miss Bessie Cameron, Teacher of the No. 1 School on Walpole Island, I have to inform you that the Department regrets that it would be unfair to all concerned if she were continued in the position after the close of the present year.\n\nAs you were informed on the 28th of July, 1906, Miss Cameron's appointment was to depend upon the success with which she conducted the school. Since she entered upon her duties the Department has received three reports from the Public School Inspector for that district, all of which go to show that Miss Cameron is not giving satisfaction.\n\nThe Inspector states that \"Miss Cameron claims to have an expired Third Class certificate, but is not able to produce it. She had six months' experience before assuming charge of this school, but as she is at least sixty years old that experience was gained some forty years ago. The Inspector further states that Miss Cameron does not know how to teach and is too old to learn, and that steps should be taken to provide an efficient teacher, otherwise it would be almost as well to close the school.\"\n\nYou will see from the foregoing extracts from the Inspector's report that there is no other course open to the Department than to ask for Miss Cameron's retirement at the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nD.A. Gordon, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\n\nSecretary.\nDOMINION SUGAR COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\nWALLACEBURG, ONT. NOV. 23, 1909.\n\nMr. John J. McLean,\nSec'y Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have your favor of the 19th. If the reports which you have are correct, I certainly will not stand in the way of having a change made in the interests of the education of the Indians on the Islands.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDAG-A\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nI want to say something about the old woman that teaches school. She is no good; she doesn't know nothing about it. She has not taught school for nearly two weeks. She let her sister go and she's no good at all. No children go at all. They don't like them. Don't learn nothing they say. Peter Thomas wrote to you say they are going to do anything to get money they may have to go get whisky he drunk up time he send his children off to school. They send young girl to teach she slap and say bad words no good they tell him to run Gordon he don't know them they say they going to stay here long time an India.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1909.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to advise you that in the interests of the Indians the Department has decided to place No. 1 Walpole Island School in charge of a qualified teacher who will be required, in addition to the regular school work, to take up some branch of domestic science. To carry out this programme it will be necessary to secure, if possible, the services of a teacher who has graduated from a training school within recent years.\n\nThe Department desires to make this change after the Christmas holidays and if it is successful in securing the services of a teacher with the qualifications above referred to during the month of December your services will not be required after the 31st proximo. Should it, however, not be possible for the Department before that time to engage a teacher such as is desired for this school you will, should you so wish, be allowed to remain in charge of the school till such time as your successor is appointed. Be good enough to acknowledge the receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Bessie Cameron,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, November 30th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has decided to dispense with the services of Miss Bessie Cameron as teacher of the No. 1 Walpole Island School on the 31st proximo, or as soon after as it is possible to obtain a successor, and Miss Cameron has been so informed.\n\nThe Department is desirous of obtaining a duly qualified teacher for this school, who would take up the teaching of sewing and perhaps some other branches of domestic science.\n\nThe salary previously paid here has been $300.00, but the Department would be prepared to pay an initial salary of $400.00 to a competent person and I should esteem it a favour if you could put the Department into communication with some suitable teacher who might care to take up the work on this reserve after the Christmas holidays, or as soon thereafter as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHenry Gonn, Esq., B.A.,\nPublic School Inspector,\nSarnia, Ont.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of the 30th ult., I am as yet unable to suggest the name of a suitable successor to Miss Cameron. I would suggest that you advertise in the \"Classified Column\" of the Globe.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry Conn.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nAt a meeting of the chippewa council held yesterday at my office Peter W Thomas an Indian of this reserve laid a complaint against Miss Jessie Cameron the present teacher of No. 1 School. He stated that he had thoroughly investigated the matter and it could be proved that the teacher Miss Cameron instead of going to the water closet had thrown the water trail and had the children take the trail to the river and reach it out and get it for drinking purposes. The council ordered me to write to the Department and have the teacher dismissed on these grounds and that she does not teach only part of the time her sister fills her place and is not competent to teach as to the last objection I know it for a fact Miss Jessie Cameron is a cripple and is not able to get to school in bad weather and her sister rather her place when I knew the P.S. Inspector was here last he informed me that this teacher was not competent to teach and it was throwing money away to keep her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Dingall\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary Department\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, December 18th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to the complaint against the teacher of the No. 1 Walpole Island School by Peter W. Thomas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 30th ultimo Miss Cameron was advised that her services as teacher of this school would not be required after the 31st proximo, unless the Department should fail to secure a teacher before that time. Inadvertently you were not notified of this decision on the part of the Department.\n\nThe Department would be glad to know if you have anybody in view who would take up the work at this school. A qualified teacher is desired and one who would take up the teaching of sewing and perhaps some other branches of domestic science, for such a teacher the Department would pay a liberal salary.\n\nI may add that the Department will advertise in \"The Toronto Globe\" next week for a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

Indians as a rule are apathetic in their attitude towards the education of their children and the arousing of their interest is one of the essentials of success.

I understand one man here wants his relations to take the school and he worked against me. The ladies keep a poor school. I shall write Hon. L.D. Mclean Lee, who gave me pointers. Thanks for kindness in the past. Yours truly, W.M. Batchelor\nWalford Island June 7th 1910\n\nHon. Indian Department\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTo inform you that our school teacher for W. I. School William Bachelor has been boarding with me from April 19th 1910 seven weeks today. And he was to pay me every two weeks $5.25 Five Dollars and fifty cents. But two weeks he paid me $5.25 balance in two weeks board all total $10.25 credit $5.25 balance he owes me $4.25 up to date. He has no money to pay for his board and he has nothing to give to secure his board till his salary comes and he was talking to resign from teaching and I don't feel like keeping him any longer unless you make some arrangements with me or through our local indian agent J. B. Mc Dougall so I will get any pay without fail. And he also owes my wife for washing he has been looking another place for board but failed. Let me hear from you by return mail.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nPeter W.

As you were appointed caretaker on the 26th of April, last, at a fair wage it is considered that there was no excuse for the state of affairs complained of by the Inspector as well as by the Agent. The Department will be prepared to make some improvements to the school during the summer holidays, but it will expect you to perform your work as caretaker in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nWm.

However, Mr. Batchelor wrote the Department stating that he was badly in need of funds and an advance of $50.00 was sent to him through Mr. Agent McDougall this week and the balance of his quarter's salary will be paid at the expiration of the time. As Mr. Batchelor will now be in funds no doubt he will settle your account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nPeter W.

I addressed my letter for some time to Hon. Mr. Oliver and thought the minister had to consider the financial part. In fact I am not versed in Parliamentary tactics.\n\nAttendance and interest at school is good. It is a difficult school to work as only 30% speak English, i.e., it is hard work.\n\nI must not forget to thank you for the suggestions re: dealing with the children and parents\u2014great benefit too. Also, the school house clean. We have washed it out. There has been much rain and the children go through two mud holes to reach the school. Also the firewood has mud on it, etc.\n\nPlease let me know if the Dept desires my services as teacher again. As it is expensive living here can you grant $50 income this summer?

There was fighting among them too. On the morning of inspection the floor was dirty as it had been raining all night and the attendance was small.\nThis muddy or dirty place between this school. Between the school gate and the door there are two mud holes to pass through or around, and about the same breach the girls close the plaster falls on the floor and makes a mess.\n\nI understand the friends or relatives of two former teachers may offer little matters to my injury, so I am told. They have an idea of getting an appointment again so I am told. Have other work to do than mind them, I know they may make the X for attendance mathematically correct, but few of the pupils knew what X signified as N N.\n\nThank you for consideration suggestions re. dealing with the Indians.

They can learn by contact with tourists. The children are getting to act like whites and use white manners in ways. Hope to profit or impart an academic education.\n\nCan not do it as well if they have insolent ways much be natives treated.\n\nIf you object to children going to stores at noon, then stop it if you wish. When children return I ask them about outside things. They can learn English.\nin this way I have no doubt the repairs to school will be attended.\n\nIn meeting with some of the chiefs sometimes your name and two of them remarked that you were an excellent man so and one said said a good one.

Some girls 18 years receive their aid boarding $8 to $10 a month. Here it is double that. I want a good room to study in. I am a steady man, love home. Some of the Indians call me the best teacher, and some may not. I ask for a stated salary as the Indians are changeable. It will make no difference in long work as I want a reference when I am for another.\nAs you may know there is much drinking in this school, dancing keeps up till 3 or 4 AM. Surplus around our house 100 empty liquor bottles. I think they should have more education and pay for it.

They should be constantly within your supervision from the time they arrive at the school in the morning until they leave again in the evening.\n\nIt is not considered necessary that you should have an agreement as the official correspondence which you have in your possession sets forth the terms upon which you were engaged and the Department reserves the right to dispense with your services upon giving you due notification.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Miss Odeh is fully qualified to teach the school if she would take an interest in it and be punctual but the trouble with her is that she is never on time for anything. She is like the most of the Indians slow and easy and the trouble with most Indian teachers is that they talk too much failure to the pupils she could be given a trial and if not satisfactory a change could be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

Bachelor of Walpole Island for several months in my opinion he is an educated gentleman of good appearance and I think sound judgment, he has consulted me several times professionally.\n\nWM R. HALL M.D.\nMedical Health Officer\nSir,\n\nThey state that I have read the charges made against me as teacher of No. 1 School at Pelican Island by Agent McDougall. I shall endeavor to answer some of these and show that many of them are not true.\n\nThe agent was prejudiced against me and said once that I wished to complain him as agent. I had not the remotest idea of being Indian agent in any place.\n\nSchools. Things in school and our event well until the Agent tried to injure me. I was told this by some. I supposed he circulated statements re my health etc.\nSchool\u2014During my term some 214 new pupils were added to the school. I had a true friend ship for the children and gave them plenty gifts.\n\nAfter the Thomas children came to school there was some trouble with them. The children had the Western Echo. I sent them this to Agent McDougall but he took no action.\n\nI am charged with assaulting one Clarence Thomas a pupil of the school. I gave the boy a whipping for being very noisy and rebellious in school and class.\n\nIt was shown in court that the boy had no marks on him.\n\nClarence was new scholar to me he had previously attended school in Michigan and he told me he was in trouble there, he said he drank whisky and did other bad things. In school I told him to say word or lesson he would yell quite loud at times.\nHe said he stayed out of school or run away while in Wabash. I would say that when I whipped Clarence he screamed loud and this caused some of the children to cry. I put them out of the school. I suppose the children were scared when the grown up Indians and white man were at door to assault me.\n\nI think this assault was planned by a white man who rode about in a auto and I was told he did sell a good deal of liquor. He was not at the trial I suppose he ran away. The parties who assaulted me came from a house which was not a good. They were drunk the worse of liquor in the morning. I passed the white man in his auto and he stopped and was ready for fight. He is a stranger to this island I think.\nThis man in the auto used to drive at furious pace past the school and I spoke to him that it was not safe however I am sure that he was assisted by the Indians through matter.\n\nTrial: Should have entered a charge of assault against the parties.\n\nAfter a trial before a magistrate on Malpole Island, it seems some told the magistrate to send me to Jarvis to be tried by the judge and I was detained at Jarvis till the judge was ready. At the trial there was no proof of any marks by the boy. The judge had great difficulty in reading the statements by J.P. from the country. The judge did dispose of a fine of $10 but after further consideration he said there was no fine or costs as I was discharged.\nCourt. Inspector Conn stopped his work for the day and gave evidence stating that he had a good school and was well qualified man.\n\nState of mind of teacher.\n\nI did not drink or use narcotics, after pills now and then. I think the reason I was disliked by a few was because I did not smoke whisky in them. I have been often packed to do so.\n\nAt my boarding house I was very much annoyed by drunken Indians\u2014white men. They did strike me but they were amiss.\n\nThe man of the house kept public dances in the house sometimes lasting 2 or 3 a.m. The children were very bad. No rules or government.\nWhen the house was empty I took a walk out or sat in the school at 4 p.m.\n\nJosephine Davis noticed and the Agent ought thinks I was silly.\n\nI would walk along the shore river and study nature.\n\nBoarding\n\nThe agent promised to board me when I came to the school but he quoted city prices for common board. I suppose prejudices him against me.\n\nAlso that I was considered a better teacher than his daughter whom I succeeded in the school.\n\nRepairs & House\n\nI was hindered at schoolwork because certain repairs were not done. Before damage had been done properly. Windows were over\nout during all my term\nClosets unfit for use. There\nwas a rope around my\nchair, and another rope\naround the stove to keep from\nfalling. No kindling for fires\nprovided. I asked for them\nmany times. I will not mention\nmore of these to weary space.\n\nReferences\n\nInclude references from\ntwo doctors of high standing\nin depth have inspectors\ncoms report.

McLean your efficient secretary very attentive to matters of the school. In fact he spoke of an advance of salary me.

This position was filled by the appointment of a lady teacher, but the Department has at the present a vacancy in a school at Walpole Island. This school is conveniently situated and the surroundings in the summer months are exceedingly pleasant. Board and lodging can be had either in the home of the Indian Agent or in that of the Methodist Clergyman on the reserve. The Department is prepared to pay here a salary of $500.00 per annum and will accept your services temporarily, if you desire to accept the position.

Batchelor for a position as Teacher of an Indian School, or in some other branch of the public service, I am of opinion that he is not suited for the Indian school work and that we could not put any confidence in him. As I have already reported to you we were forced to dispense with his services at No. I School, Walpole Island, where he was arrested for unduly punishing some of the children and was committed to Sarnia Gaol for examination as to his sanity.

Frank Oliver\nMinister of the Interior:\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th Inst re School matter. Perhaps I can get on without an Indian School. Had the idea that it would be a permanent position so long as I did good work and not thinking there would be any opposition by the Agent. Should have resigned before and thus avoided trouble and expenses etc.\nWitnessed\n\nSo, on the island told me the agent was making great efforts to have his daughter in the school. There been at great loss as white school boards are prejudiced against a man who taught in an Indian School.\n\nWhen took charge of Sch. No. 1 Walpole Island it was in low condition. The front door was broken anew one so there more window panes out. girls chest was wrecked. The children told me boys did this before. Seems I suppose a few months before.\nAs your duties are light and it is possible some of the reference reports were not brought forward about middle of June the Dept promised me an increase of salary if the Inspector's report was favorable, as he reported favorably of me some time before.\n\nThe attendance was good except in the busy season of sugar beets & working on campsites. As you have noticed in my reports I had enrolled some 15 new pupils.\n\nI fail to see how the agent can give full report of the school as he only\nspent some 5 minutes at each visit.\n\nI should think it the duty of an agent to be helpful to the school.\n\nI had the old stumps of brownings of last year.\n\nThe windows were broken before January and were not mended.\n\nI understand some Conservatives Reformers consider Shaw not been treated as I should have been and may petition Parliament to have the matter looked into.\n\nHow Border's name was mentioned to see to it.\nIt may lead to general review of Island matters. The Island attracts a lawless place. She said dance halls abound, open till 2 AM. All liquor is used in these dancehalls. Attempts at murder, stabbing, now & then a drowning. Cases cheap drunk. These dance halls charge an ordinance tax to the lawmen control them. The churches are in low state because education is backward.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.A. Batchelor\nOttawa, January 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, and in reply I beg to say that inquiries will be made into the matters complained of therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. Batchelor, Esq.,\nChatham, Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will at your earliest convenience proceed to Walpole Island with a view to reporting upon the manner in which Mr. McDougall is conducting his agency. It is represented that dance halls at which liquor is sold are open and that educational matters are very backward. The Department would like you to visit the two schools and report as to the manner in which they are conducted and equipped.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. G. Ramsden, Esq.,\nChief Inspector,\nBox 433,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, February 10th, 1911,\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 24th, 1911 File No-152941-1, I have the honour to report as follows:\n\nI visited the No-1 school on Walpole Island on the morning of February 6th arriving at 9.20. There was just one scholar present three more came in within the next 10 minutes and two more shortly after that, making a total of 6 in attendance during that forenoon. I say say that it was a very stormy day which no doubt would account somewhat for the small attendance but strange to say all those that were present were small girls, no boys. The teacher Miss McDougall at this school claims no particular qualification for her position. She is a bright girl but does not take her duty seriously, as she considers that she is just merely filling in for the time being.\n\nSince the 1st of January there have been only 17 scholars enrolled at this school where there should have been over 30. The attendance has ranged all the way from 1 to 11 scholars per day. There has been considerable sickness upon the island during the past month which accounts partially for the state of affairs. I am informed whoever that there are about 40 children of school age within the radius of this school, and I think with a good energetic teacher and cooperation of the parents, this should be one of our best Indian schools.\n\nJ. G. Ramsden\nChief Inspector of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, February 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 10th instant upon the No. 1 school on Walpole Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that you found the school-room in good condition upon the occasion of your visit. I may say, however, that there is further information that the Department wishes to obtain if possible.\n\nA Mr. Batchelor was in charge of this school for several months during the past year and his services were dispensed with upon complaints being made as to his management of the school and as to his personal conduct. I would ask whether during the time that you were on the reserve you learned anything with respect to Mr. Batchelor's work. At that time the building was reported to be in a poor condition in respect to minor repairs that might easily have been made. There was also no proper arrangement for the caretaking and I would ask you to report as to the state of repair in which you found the building and whether arrangements are now made for the lighting of the fires, and the sweeping, scrubbing, etc.\n\nNo reference is made in your report as to the condition of the ground, fences, and outbuildings. You will be good enough to report on this.\n\nA complaint has also been made with respect to the\n\nJ. G. Ramsden, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nOttawa, Ont.\nattitude of the Agent towards the schools and I would ask you to state whether so far as you were able to learn the Agent is interested in this feature of the work and gives the teacher the support that he should as an official of the Department. The late teacher complained that he did not receive co-operation from the Agent and stated as a reason that Mr. McDougall wished the position for his daughter.\n\nYour recommendation with regard to the employment of a competent, qualified teacher is noted. I may say that the Department endeavoured to secure such by public advertisements sometime ago, but was not successful. In any event there would appear to be little use in appointing an outsider unless Mr. McDougall is prepared to give him every assistance in the way of seeing that buildings and other accommodation are kept in a proper state of repair. It is also the duty of the Agent to use his influence with the Indians to attain a full and regular attendance.\n\nYou should also report whether the school is so situated that a teacher can get suitable board and lodging within a reasonable distance.\n\nYour remarks with regard to Miss McDougall are noted and there would not appear to be any reason why she should not give her best efforts to the work so long as she is being paid a salary by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, Feb. 16th, 1911.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of even date.\n\nI learned Batchelor was a very good teacher, but he was eccentric. He locked the doors, and severely punished a child for which he was fined $10.00 and costs. I did not observe the minor repairs you speak of.\n\nThe fire was burning brightly, and the floor clean. No complaint made as to this. I did not particularly examine the fence and grounds as the weather was very stormy and snow covered the ground. No complaint was made about the teachers receiving no assistance from the Agent. One of them as reported is his daughter, and not likely to complain, the other an Indian, and they very rarely complain when under salary. As reported in other portions of my former letter, the Agent was easy going. I talked with him and the Band as to their duty in assisting the Teachers, and we trying to obtain a good attendance.\n\nSchool No. 1 is well situated for boarding accommodation, School No. 2 not so well situated, but still I think accommodation might be got.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nBrantford Oct.\nMay 5th 1811\n\nMr. Francis Oliver\nInspector General of Indians\n\nMAY 18 1811\n\nSir,\n\nI have stated that I taught No. 1 School Halfway Island for about 6 months including vacation last year, and that during the term the Inspector, Clergyman and Chiefs considered me as successful as teacher.\n\nThe idleness on the Island was a great hindrance to my teaching and culminated in my being assaulted by a whiskey party of Indians. I do not expect to teach as I received at the assault bodily injury.\nI have to wear curtains or bandages.\n\nI am anxious that the Government should maintain fair order on the Island so that a person stationed there should not be in fear of injury day as well as night.\n\nThe papers reported a stranger on the Island as being robbed and then burned to death. Justice much of the evil doing has not made public. I suppose the lack payment of $11 balance due for caretaking of school. I was paid $4. Salary for family was $30 per year, and $10 services as teacher 1st week of fall term '1910. This week the school was not repaired or ready.

The Department would, however, like you to take up some branch of domestic science, preferably the teaching of sewing to the girls. If you will consent to do this the necessary materials will be purchased for you when you open the school on the first of September. A certain length of time each day can be allotted for this work.\n\nYou will be good enough to give special attention to the teaching of calisthenics and not less than ten minutes each day should be devoted to this. A copy of the manual for this purpose will be found in the school-room, but should there not be one there a copy will be sent you from the Department upon request.\n\nI would also ask you to pay special attention to the teaching of hygiene using the Ontario Public School textbook.\n\nMiss Electa Bissell,\nRow's Corners, Ont.\nThe Department furnishes all supplies for the school-room and when you take up the work should you find yourself in need of anything in the way of books and stationery I would ask you to be good enough to communicate with the Indian Agent, who will forward a requisition to the Department.\n\nOne of the difficulties that Indian teachers meet with is the apathy of the parents in respect to the education of their children. It would be well for you, therefore, to visit the parents in their homes frequently with a view of impressing upon them the necessity of sending their children regularly to school.\n\nShort monthly reports upon your work would be very gladly received by the Department and any assistance in its power towards helping you in your work will be very gladly given.\n\nIt will not be necessary for you to send your certificate either to the Department or the inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

As soon as you arrive at Walpole Island you should make inquiries for Mr. J. B. McDougall, the Indian Agent, who lives close to the school and who has been asked to give you every assistance possible.\n\nWith regard to the opening of the school you have already been advised that it should be opened on the 1st of September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

No. 1 Walpole.\n\nSomeone here was telling me that if I should just teach here until next June I would lose two months' salary; that is\nthe salary for the summer vacation. I have never considered that I was being paid for twelve months, but always thought the salary was paid for ten months, which is a school year. In my last school I was receiving four hundred dollars. I was paid quarterly and received\none hundred dollars each quarter. I expected in this school to receive one hundred and twenty-five dollars each quarter. Of course I know nothing of another year whether I would stay or not; but if I should leave next June, I would not like to lose part of my salary. I hope you will understand and will explain at once.\nas I do not understand why I should not receive the five hundred dollars by next June as that will be the end of the time for which I am hired.\n\nHoping I have made this clear, I remain respectfully yours,\n\nElecta Russell\nOttawa, September 29, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in which you ask to be informed as to the method adopted by the Department in the paying of the salaries of teachers.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department requires that the teachers in all its day schools shall teach 216 days in each school year and new teachers beginning duty after the summer holidays are paid for the September quarter for the number of days which they teach during the quarter.\n\nThe Agent reports that you commenced duty at the Walpole Island No. 1 School on the 5th instant and you should, therefore, teach nineteen days during the current quarter for which you will receive 19/216 of your yearly salary of $500.00. For the December and March quarters one-fourth of the yearly salary will be paid for each quarter and at the end of the June quarter, provided you remain at the school till that time and teach the required number of days, the balance due to complete your full salary for the year will then be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Electa Bissell,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWalford Island Oct 4/11\n\nThe Secretary Department Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou have written to Miss Russell, the teacher at No. 1 Walford Island School saying that she would receive her salary of One Hundred Dollars at the end of June 1912, i.e., first for ten months school.\n\nAccording to that I didn't receive my full salary, Three Hundred Dollars per year. I taught nine months.\nbeginning in October and only received two hundred and twenty five dollars in three payments presently five dollars each. I should have received two hundred and seventy dollars for the nine months.\n\n$730.25.

You have already been paid $225.00 and there is a further balance due you of $23.61, a cheque for which amount is being sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I would not like to see any change of teachers in this school as Miss Bissett takes a great interest in the pupils and it would be hard to get a better teacher for an Indian School.

However, I purpose communicating with several teachers with a view to having them apply for the position, and will let you know the result at an early date.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPublic School Inspector.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nTen years ago the Public school Inspector in his report on the No. 1 Walpole Island School stated that he considered one centrally located school on Walpole Island should be built in place of the three ungraded schools then in operation. With your approval this question was submitted to the Indian Council of the Chippewas and Pottawatomies of Walpole Island. They passed a resolution unfavourable to the establishment of the central school suggested by the Inspector. Their chief ground of objection was that in the event of a graded school being opened Indian teachers would be removed and replaced by whites. Since then education has made very little progress on the Island, chiefly owing to the inefficiency of the teachers. One of the schools has since been closed and the teacher of the No. 1 School, who has been doing good work for the short time she has been in charge of the school, has sent in her resignation to take effect on the 30th of this month. The last census return shows that there are 108 children of school age on the\nthe Island, with an enrolment of 80 and an average attendance of 43.\n\nI am of opinion that if a centrally situated, two-roomed school were built, with accommodation for the teachers, similar to the one we are putting up at Rama, the children on the Island would then be in a position to obtain some lasting benefit from the schooling they would receive. Under present conditions with Indian teachers and lack of accommodation for white teachers very little advancement is made. These Indians have very little capital to their credit and would not be able to pay for the upkeep of the school, but the school vote is sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure, and if the Department would erect a building and pay the salaries the objection of the Indians to white teachers would be done away with. In fact, even under the present conditions, they have no claim to a voice in the appointment of teachers as they are only contributing $200.00 from their funds for the support of the schools.\n\nThere is some doubt as to the most suitable place for the erection of a central school. I would suggest that Mr. MacKenzie of this Department, who is an old experienced teacher and knows what the Department requires and what would be good for the Indians, should be sent there and\nthe Island, with an enrolment of 80 and an average attendance of 43.\n\nI am of opinion that if a centrally situated, two-roomed school were built, with accommodation for the teachers, similar to the one we are putting up at Rama, the children on the Island would then be in a position to obtain some lasting benefit from the schooling they would receive.

I would suggest that Mr. MacKenzie of this Department, who is an old experienced teacher and knows what the Department requires and what would be good for the Indians, should be sent there and\nand I have no doubt that he could obtain their goodwill and assurance for the regular attendance of the pupils if a school of the kind above referred to were put up on the Island.\n\nThe Department is sending a number of Indian school teachers to the Ontario Agricultural College and the Toronto University Summer Schools and if Mr. MacKenzie were allowed to visit Walpole Island early next month he could then on his return visit these institutions and see what use the teachers were making of the privilege granted them by the Department of attending these schools. He would be able to form a good opinion of the advantage the Department will gain from this experiment.\n\nMy reason for bringing this matter to your attention at the present time is that the Indian missionary on the Reserve, Rev. Sampson Brigham, who called at the Department a short time ago, urged the necessity of something being done at once for the establishment of a central school.\nOttawa, June 18, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department, having decided to take up the question of establishing a centrally located school on Walpole Island, I have to request that you will proceed there early next week and go carefully into the question of selecting a suitable, centrally situated location for the erection of a building similar to the one the Department contemplates putting up at Rama. You should ascertain the cost of about an acre or an acre and a half of ground for the purpose and obtain an option from the locatee. As you will come in contact with many of the Indians on the reserve, the Department would like you to explain its attitude in regard to the proposed school and the advantage it will be to the children to have a graded school on the Island.\n\nWhile on your way to Walpole Island the Department would like you to stop off at Muncey and make a careful inspection of the way in which the work on the repairs and improvements to the Mount Elgin Institute has been carried on by the contractor.\n\nOn leaving Walpole Island you may proceed to Sarnia and see the Rev. Mr. Rigby and the Agent in reference to the suggested improvements to the schools in this agency and the supplying of the mid-day meal.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nYou may then proceed to Guelph and visit the summer school in connection with the Ontario Agricultural College, at which a number of our Indian teachers will be in attendance. The Department would like you to meet the Indian teachers that are there and you will then be able to form an opinion as to the advantage that they are likely to derive from this course.\n\nYou may also call at Toronto and see the Indian teachers that are at the summer school in connection with the Toronto University.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 20, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. A. F.

Soney. Chas. Soney was drowned on the 24th March 1913 and left no heirs mean their concerns. He was having been married under Sec. 28 of Indian Act leaves his land to the band. The land is mostly fenced and under cultivation but has no buildings upon the land. If the improvements could be sold to have obtained that requires land, and the proceeds applied to the purchase of grave place I think that it would be satisfactory to all.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Department\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJuly 9, 1913\nMinutes of Joint-Council Held at Indian Office July 7th 1913\n\nMoved by Peter Willis seconded by Levi White:\nThat we except the proposition of the Indian Department in regard to a graded or central school being built on the whole island reserve.

The Indians without exception were in favour of the establishment of such a school. For my own part, while fully appreciating the benefits of a consolidated school instead of two schools as on the Island at present, I am afraid that there are certain conditions there that would have a tendency to destroy the effectiveness of such an institution.\n\nAs it is now the children have long distances to walk to the two respective schools, ranging from one quarter mile to four and five, the majority being over mile.\nmile from their school. I chose a site, which is the only one where I think a central school might be properly located. It is a good site with running water in a dredged cut close by. I went fully into the distances that would have to be travelled by the children and, while I could give these distances by families, a table such as that would be hard to analyze. I have, however, made a summary which shows that:\u201417 children would have to travel a distance of one mile or under, 38 children over one mile and under two, 45 children over two and under three and five children over three miles. You will thus see that about one half of the total number of children of school age on the reserve, which is approximately 108, would have to travel over two miles to the consolidated school. This I consider is altogether too long a walk and the only way in which it could be overcome would be to provide for the transportation of the children at least during the spring, fall and winter months. On account of the location of the Indians and the way the roads run on the reserve, it would require three conveyances to do this work to any degree of satisfaction. The question of distance is the first objection that I have to point out.\n\nSecondly, the site of a consolidated school must of necessity be about the centre of the island. The No. 1 school\nSchool, in which there has been a white teacher for some years, is situated at the front, close to the English Church, the agency residence and the homes of the two missionaries and the customs officer. It overlooks the main channel and in the summer time at least is not an undesirable place to live. The No. 2 or Pottawattome School is in the centre of the Island and at present taught by an Indian. As said above, a consolidated school would have to be established about the centre of the Island, a mile or so from the present No. 2 School, and would be a rather lonely place to live, as it would be about two miles from the Post Office and the residences of the people above referred to. The only white teacher we had on the Island has resigned and I feel in my own mind a little doubt as to the possibility of obtaining the services of teachers, at least two in number, who would be satisfied to live under conditions that would exist at the new school, even supposing the Department was prepared to supply them with comfortable quarters in which to reside. If we had at the present time, as we have at many of our schools that I might mention, teachers who have been in our service for sometime and who in all probability will continue therein and if they expressed\nexpressed a willingness to accept the conditions, then I would have no hesitancy in recommending the establishment of such a school, provided means of conveyance were found.\n\nI suggested to the Council that, in view of the fact that their funds would not be encroached upon to build the school nor pay the salaries of the teachers to any greater extent than now, they might take into consideration the question of paying the cost of transportation, but I see that they evidently did not bring the matter up at the meeting which was held on the week following the one I attended.\n\nI called at Sarnia to see Mr. Conn, the Public School Inspector, to ascertain his views, if he had any, in regard to the matter. Without having given the thing any serious consideration he stated that he was inclined to agree with me that there were these two obstacles at least to the establishment of a central school. Mr. Conn promised to look into the matter more fully and let the Department have his views at an early date. I think this matter might stand over for consideration till another year at least.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Conn is endeavouring to obtain a teacher for the No. 1 School. Presumably Mr. Sampson\nSampson, who is doing fairly good work under the circumstances at the No. 2 School, will continue in charge there. It should be possible for the Department to secure the services of a teacher for the school at the front at a somewhat later date when vacancies in the Ontario schools have been supplied, as there should be a number of teachers with limited certificates available, as those fully qualified will be given the first chance in the public schools.\n\nIf no action is to be taken certain repairs to both the No. 1 and No. 2 Schools are necessary to make them comfortable for the winter. These, however, are not extensive and the Agent can be given instructions regarding them at once.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.J.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWhen I engaged in Walpole School, I was informed by Agent Mr. Callum that teacher's salary was paid at end of each quarter. I have since performed my part of the agreement and no salary has been received. Be kind enough to inform me at once if I am to receive my salary as agreed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nS.E. Wilson\nOttawa, October 29, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, in which you request to be informed as to why the amount of the salary due you for the period you taught the No. 1 School on the Walpole Island Reserve during the September quarter last, has not been paid.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that all salaries due teachers of Indian Day Schools are paid quarterly, upon receipt of returns showing the attendance and number of days taught. If you will be good enough to prepare a return showing the attendance at this school for the period which you taught during the above named quarter and forward to the Department, through your local Indian Agent, the Department will pay you the amount of salary due for that quarter. A supply of blank forms for this purpose are enclosed herewith.\n\nIt is thought that had you applied to the agent in this matter, he would have informed you of the Department's requirements and supplied you with the necessary blank forms for making out your returns.\n\nThe Department cannot calculate the amount of salary due you for the September quarter until a return is received from you showing the number of days you taught.\n\nA copy of the Indian Day School Regulations is also enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nMiss E.E. Wilson,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No.1 School\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06",
