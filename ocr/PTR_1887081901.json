Archdeacon Pinkham was consecrated Bishop of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe ordinands for the consecration, consisting of the Ven. Archdeacon Pinkham and the Ven. Chaplain MacKay,\n\nhad been ordered to attend the service by letter, every available seat being occupied.\n\nLong before 10 o'clock streams of people gathered outside the church to witness the consecration ceremony, so that by the time the bell ceased tolling it was morally impossible to possess any possibility of obtaining an open seat within the church at the hour appointed when the choir was an exceptionally large one, had been increased for the occasion and selected musicians had performed a nice processional hymn. During the singing of this hymn the church dignitaries and choristers joined in processions up the entire aisle.\n\nThe service\n\nThe celebration of the service on this occasion was of a character not known in the hands of the metropolitan. His grace took the place of the Most Reverend Archdeacon MacKay, the secretary of the House of bishops, who arranged the proceedings. The opening was the reading by the Rev. Canon Pitt, Bishop-elect of the Canons chapter. Then followed the Dean of the cathedral in the choir, who read the service appointed by the metropolitan.\n\nThe procession included the Bishop-elect, his wife, two deacons, the Archdeacon and the Rev. Canon Pope, assisted by the Archdeacon and the Rev. Canon Pope, assisted by the Archdeacon and the Rev. Canon Pope, assisted by the Archdeacon and the Rev. Canon Pope, assisted by the Archdeacon and the Rev. Canon Pope.\n\nThe procession included the Bishop-elect, his wife, two deacons, the Archdeacon, the Hon.

Police.\n\nA very interesting and exciting match took place between the above clubs on Saturday evening last, which resulted in a victory for the former by three games to two.\n\nThe game was keenly contested throughout the game by the members and spectators present, and enthusiastic and valuable demonstrations of enthusiasm and skill were exhibited during the course of the play.\n\nThe weather was everything that could be desired. The individual play of the Prince Albert club excelled that of the Police, their teamwork being very effective. The Police were good at throwing, but the running and dodging was all that could be desired for. And there were several instances where directions of purely elements the spectators, players, and officials, and the players of both teams made some excellent final exhibitions of the game yet made.\n\nMr. Goo. C. A. Land was again chosen as referee, and his decision was always accepted by both teams.\n\nThe men were called out. The names and respective positions on the field stood as follows:\n\nJ. Wigness goal Const. Leslie\nW. R. Fish point St. Denis\nA. A. B. Spratt center Poveshull\nJ. Russell & J. Field defense\nN. McKenzie do Sergt. Talbert\nJ. Olford center Corp. Bailey\nJ. Russell & J. Field defense\nJ. Knowles do Aike\nW. V. Maclean house Capt. Laraway\nG. Knowles do Davis\n\nThe first game was rather one-sided. The town team handled the ball on the Police side of the field, and were quite unsighted, during which some excellent defense and home play was manifested. Knowles scored an splendid pass through the Police goal, scoring the first goal for the Prince Albert team.\n\nTime - 3 minutes.\n\nThe second game was of longer duration, both teams laying themselves out for a good afternoon's work, and though not interesting as a game of lacrosse, was nevertheless well contested. The Prince Albert defense played a magnificent game, and the Police were good for their plucky performances, especially Fish, Spratt and Wigness; but despite their efforts they were unable to secure the game for the Police team.\n\nTime - 15 minutes.\n\nThe third game was more interesting, the Prince Albert boys displayed by the most skill, Russell and Olford working wonders. The Police, however, after two matches had hardly been played, one resulting in a hollow victory for the town club and the other in a close game, may be said to have given up, but no number of defeats and no number of matches will persuade call foul on the part of absolute honesty used during this game by none of the police on backs, language or which in no way impaired the good order and moral tone of the community, and which justify calling forth a general expression of sympathy toward the Police team.\n\nThis game Spratt got his thumb broken, caused by two blows with a increase from the Police. After this time, Knowles again secured the rabbet and the second game for the Prince Albert club.\n\nTime - 25 minutes.\n\nThe fourth game was the one in which perhaps the best skill was shown, and the Police and Police again upheld the reputation of the Police, while Knowles, Russell and Maclean did some service for the Prince Albert side.\n\nThe Police finally won. But it put an end by Knowles, scoring goals for the Prince Albert.\n\nTime - 25 minutes.\n\nThe fifth game was the one that took gigantic efforts to avoid what seemed an inevitable defeat. The home play of the Police was excellent, and they did so much for the Prince Albert defense, who were considerably weakened by loss of Spratt. By a combination of their efforts, the Police did good work for a second game. Time - 10 minutes.\n\nThere was still 12 minutes to spare of the fifth game, but the Police were too late to be called before either side changed sides; therefore there gave the game its name.\n\nJames Sinclair acted as umpire for the latter, and Sergt. Parton for the Police.\n\nThe Police Lacrosse Club were afterward visited by Mr. Robertson, Mayor Macintosh presiding. Numerous toasts were proposed and responded to, and several songs were given. After a meal was eaten, the party adjourned to the gathering dispersed about ten o'clock, on the singing of God Save the Queen.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nLondon, August 1.

There are now 100 Canadian vessels on the merchant ships looking after American fishermen, and 100 vessels and very powerful boats and the American coast guard, but with the presence of so many enemies on the look out, the opportunities for the Canadian fishermen are limited.\n\nCapt. Laraway states that for weeks at a time he has not been able to get a vessel to go out and fish, and he follows every move of the Americans.\n\nOtto, August 2. There was an important Cabinet meeting at the Palace. It was decided to send a special mission of American fishing crafts. The proceedings are not known. It is said that the mission will be sent to urge Canada to make certain concessions, at the least only of enabling Great Britain to maintain her friendly relations with the United States.\n\nSHIP TUMBLER.\n\nA very respectable-looking citizen called at a house on Fourth avenue yesterday afternoon and asked very politely if he might see the owner or any of the inmates. When admitted to start off with the inquiry:\n\n\"You have been up North for a few days?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Your husband was with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"One of the chief amusements was fishing?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"He had good luck, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Catch one pleated weighing\u2014let me see\u2014weighing how much?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Leave this house at once!

Several vessels were within the sea, but hundreds of miles from land, possessed of sufficient fuel for a long trip.\n\nA First-class Livery, Feed and Sale Stable\n\nOpposition is the Life of Trade\n\nJ.
