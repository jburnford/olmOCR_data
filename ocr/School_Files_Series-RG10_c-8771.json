Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and after consultation with Mr. J. J. Smith, Indian Agent at Kamloops, we have prepared designs and estimates for a pumping plant with a capacity of 3600 U.S.G., to serve an irrigable area of 386 acres of the Kamloops Indian Reserve.\n\nPumping Plant\n\nThe pumping plant is to be located near the present irrigation pumping plant at the Kamloops Industrial School. At this point there is ground high enough to carry a ditch quite close to the river, so that only 400 feet of pipe line will be required. Another great advantage of this site is that power can be obtained from the present transmission line at very little extra expense and without any transformers.\n\nMain Ditch\n\nThe main ditch line will start at an elevation of 74 feet above low water and 16 feet higher than the present Industrial School ditch. It will be 3 miles in length, of which 2 miles will be through the Industrial School property. For the first 2 miles the ditch line will be along the hillside just north of the wagon road, and in this section a great deal of grading will be required. The last mile will be through cultivated land and will be practically all earth ditch.\n\nLand\n\nThe land that will be served by this plant is shown on the accompanying plan. The total area is 466 acres, of which at least 386 acres is first class irrigable land. It is all fenced and 90% of it is cleared; but it does not produce satisfactory crops at present on account of lack of water.\n\nArea \"A\", east of the Kamloops road and north of the flooded land, contains 160 acres, much of this was irrigated and cultivated at one time. Probably 50% of it could be brought under cultivation from the proposed system with very little trouble.\n\nArea \"B\", west of the Kamloops road and north of the flooded land, contains 110 acres, most of which has never been irrigated. In some spots the soil is rather light; and the land lies in ridges so that it cannot be irrigated as easily as the other two acres.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\ntwo acres. It is estimated that at least 50% of it is good irrigable land.\n\nArea \"C\", just north of area \"A\" and lying between the road and the U. S. R. track, contains 176 acres. This includes some of the most productive land on the reserve. It is quite close to the Indian village. It is estimated that 50% of it is good land which could be irrigated from the proposed system with very little change in the existing ditches.\n\nThe total area of irrigable land is therefore as follows:\n\n| Total | Proportion Irrigable | Irrigable Acreage |\n|-------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Area A | 160 acres            | 80%               | 144 acres |\n| Area B | 110 \"                | 50%               | 55 \"      |\n| Area C | 176 \"                | 90%               | 158 \"     |\n\nTotals 446 acres\n\nCost. As shown by the attached estimates, the cost of the whole plant, including trams for line, main ditchline and main intake, is $12,750, or less than $45.00 per acre. This provides for first class construction throughout. Current prices are given for the machinery, supplies and labor.\n\nPower. In view of the rapidity with which the surplus power from the municipal power plant is being contracted for, it would be wise to enter into a contract with the city for the 100 H.P. required as soon as it is decided to build the plant.\n\nMechanics. In order to secure delivery of this machinery in time for installation next spring, the order should be placed before the end of December if possible.\n\nOperation. The officials of the Indian Department are thoroughly familiar with the advantages of irrigation by pumping and know of the results obtained from the plant we installed at the Kamloops Industrial School in 1918.\n\nIf the land to be served by the proposed plant is properly divided among the Indians, and a competent agriculturist engaged to advise them in their farming and to be responsible for the operation of the irrigation plant, according to the plan discussed with Mr. Scott when he was in Kamloops, there seems to be no reason why the whole proposition should not be quite successful.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDivision Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have had the experience and we now prize the new machinery at their proper value.\n\nThe cost of operation under the old regime proved very expensive. Besides the gas, oil, batteries and repairs, the gasoline engine required the attention of a man for three or four hours each week. The account for gasoline alone rarely fell below ten or fifteen dollars a month. During January the cost of electricity for the new motor is three dollars and ten cents! And the pressure is on the taps in the house continually.\n\nWe wish to thank you sincerely for this great improvement. We feel sure the Department will feel as pleased as we to learn that the system gives satisfaction.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVery truly yours,\nJames McQuillan M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

(RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\nThe Multi-Motor washer is provided with a swinging reversible wringer which is driven and operated automatically in connection with the washer.\n\nOperating Washer and Wringer\n\nPress the foot lever at the front of the starting wheel, starting the engine. When the tub is filled and the lid is closed, turning the latch that holds down the lid throws the machine in gear and starts the washer. When the tubful is washed, unlatching the lid stops the washer, and lifting the lid throws the wringer in gear. Turning the latch again to position as when holding the lid starts the wringer.\n\nWhen the first tubful of clothes are out of washer, the closing and stopping the engine starts the machine on the second batch. The wringer may be left in gear and can be swung into position to wring from the rinse to the bluing tub or from bluing to clothes basket, while the second tub is washing.\n\nThe whole operation of washing and wringing, after starting the engine, is one of opening and closing the tubs and either washing or wringing, or both at once, are performed and controlled in the same way by any woman or even a mild boy enough to help about the house can operate the Multi-Motor perfectly.\n\nAn important feature of the Maytag wringer is the safety lever. Should the clothes and wringer wind around the rolls, a light blow on the safety lever instantly releases the supply roll. This safety device is a protection to the wringer and absolute insurance against possible injury to the clothes or the person who feeds the wringer.\n\nThe Multi-Motor is made only by the Maytag Company, and sold only through authorized Maytag dealers.\n\nIt brings to every rural household a labor-saving utility equal to anything obtainable in the best equipped city home.\n\nCome in and get all the information about this wonderful machine and let us demonstrate it in your own home.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThere is no escaping laundry work on the farm. Even if economy permitted the implementation of every convenience demanded, that convenience is seldom available for the great majority of rural homes.\n\nThe only solution to the washday drudgery problem is the use of the power washer. The hand washing machine proved a great advance over the tub and washboard, but modern household management everywhere demands more efficient equipment. Saving laundry equipment, equipto the superior type found in the city home, which was not possible for the great majority of rural homes until the invention and perfection of the\n\nAG MULTI-MOTOR WASHER.\n\nThis machine contains its own power plant\u2014a small engine installed under the tub, just as a motor is attached to the electric washer. The engine is started by simply pressing the foot on the starting pedal. The pipe, and starts the motor. The power supplied is as constant and steady as the electric current.\n\nAnd there is positively nothing complicated or cumbersome about this engine and no difficulty in its operation. It has only three moving parts, and these are run in an oil bath which insures perfect and continual lubrication. The engine has no valves to turn, sealing no drip waters, as is common in gas engines. Nothing to get out of order. The woman can start and stop the engine without the least difficulty, and while running, it takes care of itself.\n\nFigure 2 shows the engine attached to the washer. Notice how small it is, and how firmly attached to all parts of the washer legs. It is mounted on a pan which prevents oil from dripping on the floor and is provided with a flexible exhaust tube of sufficient length to conduct the exhaust, with all odor, smoke and noise, out of a convenient window or into a chimney, thru furnace or stove, if need be.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates the engine detached from the washer. Notice the simple design, lines of external construction. The internal construction is just as simple. The operation is constant and dependable at all times.\n\nNotice the two belt pulleys on the end of the shaft\u2014one 4 inches and the other 5 inches diameter. With these the owner of the Multi-Motor has little power control of his own to do the curdling, cream separating, and other such odd jobs.\n\nThe farmer's wife who possesses a Multi-Motor washer is not dependent upon the whims or necessities of the men folks. Where the washing is done by power from the ordinary farm power plant, the men almost invariably have some urgent use for it, and washing is what the women must often resort to the tub to get her washing out in time.\n\nThe Multi-Motor does away with all that delay and worry and hard work, making the performance of washday duties easy and orderly, without disturbing any other farm activities.\n\nIt requires no special room or building, and costs less than the Multi-Motor. As it takes up no more space than a hand power washer. It can be set in the kitchen and do the washing under the supervision of the housewife while she is attending to other house work or caring for the children.\nMore Clean Linen\nJ. H.

Two years ago you took me into your back kitchen to see Connor wash your clothes, and your good wife demonstrated to my entire satisfaction that if I wanted to keep Mary happy and contented I should go to the hardware man and buy her one of the contraptions to do her washing.\n\n\u201cI went and bought the thing while Mary was away on a little vacation, and then brought her home like a tickled kid. When she saw it she threw her ar-r-ums around my neck and wept with joy; \u2018twas something she had been wanting for years and years and never asked for; and me\u2014I\u2019d been so close to my own affairs that I never gave her hard work a thought.\n\n\u201cWell, Connor has been sending letters and booklets to me telling of his other machines and of his wringers: he says he wants Mary to be satisfied in every way. The other day he wrote and told me of hitching electric power to one of his Washers, and now all a woman has to do is put the clothes in the machine with the water, attach the electric cord to the lamp socket, turn on the power, and away it goes as sweet as anything.\n\"He told me that he was able to take all the hard work out of wash day, and that just as I added equipment to my store to save time and labor, so should I do the same thing for Mary. I wrote back and told him to have the hardware man get one of the Washers and I would look it over if it took work away from Mary then I was going to have it.\n\n\"So the other day it came, and I went over to see it. It was that simple a child could run it, and I had one of the things sent over to the house. This morning Mary was up bright and early and had her washing on the line before I left, and all the time the work was being done she was getting breakfast and tidying up the house, singing away as happy as a lark on a bright May morning.\n\n\"When I left, she said, 'Jimmy, this morning I'm going down to your store at ten o'clock to visit you just to show that I appreciate this wonderful gift that you've given me\u2014and incidentally to show off to my neighbors. I can hear them say, 'There goes Mary Malone trapsin' off, and it only the middle of\n\nYou owe it to yourself to possess one of these Washers.\n\nthe evening\u2014I hear she has an Electric Washing Mac. Jimmy's good to her all right; luck is with some people.' Can you beat it?\"\n\n\"What's so wonderful about this machine of Connor's, is it better than the old style? If it is I want one over at the Hotel.\"\n\n\"Wait now,\" said Jimmy, \"and I'll give you a demonstration. I'm the hardware man and you're my customer: 'So you've been sending most of your clothes to the laundry and the rest of the stuff your wife does at home\u2014hm-m-m. Man, did you ever realize that the laundries wear out more clothes and linens for you than you do yourself; did you ever know that clothing or linens washed in a Connor Washing Machine will last five times as long as if you send them out?\n\n\"And did you ever realize that your clothing is dumped in with clothing from every part of the city and all washed together? And did you ever figure out whether you would care to wear a garment that had been rubbing up against the garments of someone who might have some contagious disease or be extra dirty? I can see by your face that you wouldn't have it so.\n\n\"All right\u2014that brings us down to the point where you would have your clothing washed at home if it were possible for your wife to do the work or to get some girl to do the work for her. It is well...\"\nnigh impossible to get servants to do the work in the home; the day of the old-fashioned washerwoman is past. It means that you must either send it out or do it yourself.\n\n\"The woman who does her own washing by hand in the old-fashioned way skimps on her clean clothes; she knows better than anyone else the hard work that must be done before that linen will be clean again. She knows what each unclean garment, handkerchief, tablecloth, napkin, sheet, costs before it is nice and fresh.\n\n\"Did you ever bend over a tub and do a week's washing? No, you didn't, and if you did you would get so sick and tired of it that you would immediately go out and hire someone to do it for you\u2014or send it to the laundry.\n\n\"You point out a home to me where they have all the clean linen and clothing they need and I'll show you a Washer in their cellar or laundry.\n\n\"Years ago\u2014and in some parts of the world it is done today\u2014people washed clothing by taking it to the river, dipping it into the water and beating it over a stone to force the water through the fabric. Then came the washboard where the clothing was rubbed up and down, the popular belief being that the rubbing took out the dirt; and then it was discovered that the dirt was taken out of the fabric by forcing the water through it. So the washing machine was developed.\n\n\"Now, here is a solution of all the washing problems in your home. It says plenty of clean linen and plenty of clean clothing. It says longer wear for every washable thing you own. It is a Connor 'Perfection' Electric Washer. Here we have the Washer, built strong enough to stand the wear and tear of heavy washings. The tub is very generous in size so as to do the work quickly and efficiently. The woman takes hold of the handle\u2014so, and pulls it over where she wants to do her work, hitches the electric cord to an ordinary lamp socket and proceeds to put in the proper amount of water in which she has mixed the proper amount of soap. To put in the water she grasps the little knob here above the gear, pulls up the slusher, and lifts the\n\nIt is so easy to handle. The slightest pull will roll it into position.\n\nWith less effort the clothes are on the line in half the time.\nlid\u2014a very easy thing to do. She puts in the clothes, closes down the lid, turns on the power, and away it goes, quiet and business-like.\n\n\"Remember all you have in the machine is water and soap, two purifying properties. The mechanical arm, at the end of which is the latest type of wooden dolly, slushes the clothes back and forth through the water, taking out all the dirt. It is done as well as if it were done by hand, and there is no wear, no tear, no rubbing.\n\n\"And the woman can go on with any other work she wants to do. She doesn't have to watch the machine; doesn't have to watch the children to see that they do not get hurt with it, for all the wheels and gears are enclosed so that there isn't the slightest possibility of anyone getting hurt or caught. The Washer works on.\n\n\"When the clothing is washed, it is ready for the wringer. The clutch handle is pulled back, which stops the washing process; the cover is lifted and the wringer swung into place ready to wring out the clothes which have been washed.\" (Shown on Page 10.)\n\n\"Is the wringing done by hand?\" asked the Hotelman. \"Not at all\u2014it is done by power\u2014a simple movement of the clutch lever starts, stops, or reverses the wringer. All the operator does is to feed the clothes evenly through the wringer, just as in a hand wringer. You tighten down the top screws for light articles, and loosen them for heavy things. If (as in the picture on page 13) the clothing should wind around one of the rolls, the safety device at the top instantly allows you to loosen the rolls so that the garment can be unwound. Merely a pressure on the top lever, and the springs release and the rolls are free. If you have a laundry with stationary tubs, the clothing can be put through the wringer from the \"Perfection\" into one of the tubs, and the Washer set to work on the next batch of clothes. This is a time-saver, as the wringer can be swung over the tubs and the clothing put through the rinsing water into the bluing\u2014the motor being powerful enough to drive both the machine and the wringer.\n\nYou have more clean linen, and no damage done in washing.\n\"At the bottom of the wringer there is a water board which can be moved from one side to the other, depending upon which side the clothes are being fed into the rolls. The twelve-inch extra wide wringer rolls are of the best quality white rubber, are soft and pliable, will wring dry and give years and years of efficient service.\n\n\"I might say right here that these wringers are the best that this or any other country produces, and have proven by years of service they are truly a woman's friend.\n\n\"When the washing is finished, the water can be run off in a few minutes by merely turning the tap. Usually a hose attachment will carry the water to the drain or out of the house as the case may be.\n\n\"Now in all this, the hardest work the woman has to do is to lift each garment from the water to put it through the wringer\u2014just a few minutes' work which can be accomplished with very little effort. There is no bending over smelly sudsy water, no back-breaking rubbing, no wearing out of clothes. There are no heavy tubs to lift or empty; electricity does all the hard work\u2014a cost of only a few cents per washing.\n\n\"You get up in the morning and do not hear any complaints about the hard work. The woman looks forward to her Connor \"Perfection\" Electric\u2014she is able to get her clothes on the line in just an hour or so, depending upon the size of the washing. She has no heavy work to do, and while the clothes are being cleaned she can be doing her regular household routine work. All the washing is out of the way by the middle of the morning and when you go home at noon there is no trace of it. You have your meals in the same way you do on other days\u2014there is no odor of soap throughout the house.\n\n\"And the best part of it all is that you have something for your money at the end of the year. You have the machine, just as good as the day you bought it, and you have clothing and linens that have not been worn out, and you know that every cent you have spent is right there in the home where you can see results.\n\n\"Now, I know that you like plenty of clean linen\u2014clean towels daily\u2014clean sheets a couple of times a week, clean shirts and handkerchiefs and...\"\nsocks. And your wife and children like plenty of clean clothing. If you are a slave to the public laundries you skimp on clean clothes and clean linen; you know that every shirt or tablecloth or handkerchief that is soiled means so much added to the expense of running your home. With the Connor \"Perfection\" Electric Washing Machine you can forget these little expense bills; you can use all the clothing you like and know that the women of your home will not have to break their backs getting the washing done at the beginning of the week. Right here you get the entire investment back in perfect satisfaction\u2014in the feeling that you are no longer a slave to the laundries.\n\n\"And the satisfaction in your home! Why, it is worth the price of the Washer to know that things are running along in a fine way, that you will not have to depend on\n\nYou can swing wringer over the stationary tubs and wring clothes while the washing goes on.\n\nwash plans, that wash day will be just the same as any other as far as the work is concerned. You buy years of life for your wife, if she does the washing. You buy years of satisfaction for her in the knowledge that her clothing is being washed in her own home where she can superintend every detail of it, knowing that it is being washed clean and that it is not mixed with linens from every home in the city.\n\n\"Just as you would install a machine for farm, office or factory, to do the work in a better way, to save time and labor, you should install a Connor \"Perfection\" Electric Washing Machine in your home, so that your wife may conserve time and labor. She has just as much right to a labor saving device as you have\u2014don't you think so?\n\n\"Now, when shall I send one to you?\"\n\nSafety release separates the rolls when necessary.\nAND JUST THIS WORD FROM US\u2014\n\nOn the opposite page you will see a mechanical outline illustration of the Connor \"Perfection\" Electric Washer. It points out to you the many features which our friend, Jimmie Malone, explained to his friend, the Hotelman, one Monday morning.\n\nYou will note the sturdiness of the construction\u2014the legs all of one piece from the top of the tub to the floor. There is nothing that is poorly constructed. The Connor Organization has put its very best efforts into making this Washer an economical labor saver for the thousands of women who are doing their own washing\u2014and for those who will find it more convenient to do the washing in the home.\n\nThe gears are machine cut and run noiselessly. All connections and fittings are made so that there is no looseness to cause undue wear.\n\nWith proper care, even under the heaviest working conditions, this Washer should last a lifetime and give good service whenever used.\n\nWith each machine we enclose full directions, very carefully prepared, which will enable you\nto operate the Washer to the best advantage. When our instructions are followed there will never be any trouble. We have thousands of Washers now in use and all are giving perfect satisfaction.\n\nWe want you to have the same service which these users are getting; want you to have the same convenience, and the same satisfaction in knowing that your clothes are beautifully cleaned in your own home.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTHE DAY OF THE WASHBOARD IS OVER\nA PERFECT METHOD TAKES ITS PLACE\n\nNo longer is the washing of clothes dependent upon physical exertion\u2014either of the housewife or of those she may employ!\n\nAfter thousands of years of following in the beaten path of custom, it has been proved unnecessary to rub clothes to pieces in order to remove the dirt. It has been proved unnecessary to sacrifice human health and happiness in accomplishing a menial task.\n\nElectricity\u2014the greatest power for the aid of humanity discovered since the world began\u2014is the magic force that has made this possible. This same giant of energy that has transformed the industrial world\u2014that has meant to your husband's factory, office, farm, whatever it may be, inestimable saving of time, labor and money\u2014has now been applied to solving the problems of the home, chief among which, as you and every woman will agree, is the problem of wash-day.\n\nThe Electric Clothes Washer is the appliance through which this force is enabled to perform its marvellous work. And when we say that BlueBird is the \"Aristocrat of Washing Machines\" we are well within the facts, for BlueBird is the de luxe product of the industry, as well in its outward dress as in the inner details of its construction\u2014a wonderful triumph of Canadian mechanical genius and manufacturing ability\u2014an Electrical Washer and Wringer built for those people in every walk of life who appreciate that only quality truly represents value\u2014built to last a lifetime and to perform the most efficient work in the shortest time and in the most economical way.\n\nThe Canadian Made BlueBird Electric Clothes Washer operates on the oscillating principle, which, by continually forcing the water through and through fabrics, washes them CLEAN without injury, wear or damage to even the frailest garments and thoroughly washes even the heaviest blankets.\n\nThe clothes are placed in the BlueBird tub, the switch is turned, and in from twelve to fifteen short minutes its rocking action has flushed the hot suds and water through the clothes, literally thousands of times, without once rubbing them or tearing them, but cleaning them to a degree unknown to those who have not washed by this absolutely ideal process.\n\nThen, while the second tubful of clothes is being washed by the same process, the first has passed through the power-driven wringer into the rinse-water, again through the same wringer into the bluing-water and from the bluing-water into the clothes basket\u2014the quiet, sturdy little motor, actuated by the energy carried through two small wires, doing it all at a cost of from one to five cents for a whole week's wash!\n\nIf you want to know\u2014and what woman does not want to know\u2014the whole story of what BlueBird means to the Canadian housewife, call on your nearest dealer in electrical household appliances. If he does not handle BlueBird, write the BlueBird factory at Brantford and ask for a copy of the epoch marking book, \"Out of Bondage.\"\nWashing Operation\n\nONE turn of the handle and the \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" with its polished copper vacuum cups forces the soapy water thru the clothes and thru the perforations of the inside tub, then sucks it back again until the clothes are thoroughly clean.\n\nIn fifteen minutes, the vacuum cups have forced the soap and water thru the clothes, equal to three thousand nine hundred rubs on a washboard. Imagine the relief from backache,\u2014tired arms and swollen hands that this remarkable machine affords.\n\nWhen Extremes Meet\n\nRag rugs, blankets, cotton filled comforts, silks, lingerie and laces are all alike to the \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\"\u2014nothing too bulky or too fine for it to handle, and BEST of all, without the slightest injury or wear to the fabric.\n\nDrying Operation\n\nTHE wringerless principle of the \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" is its chief feature and is an especial boon to the housewife or laundress.\n\nThis new and patented device bridges the gap between work and ease and makes it possible to dry an entire load of clothes,\u2014wringer dry,\u2014in one to two minutes without handling.\n\nThink of the time saved! In the old wringer way each piece has to be lifted out of the hot suds by hand or with a stick, and run thru the rubber rolls, regulated to suit the thickness of each article, or the clothing will not be uniformly dry. The \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" dries each piece the same, irrespective of its thickness and leaves the clothes without deep creases or wrinkles, saving time in drying and making ironing easier.\n\nThe \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" is the only home laundry machine on the market that DOES NOT REQUIRE A WRINGER. Using CENTRIFUGAL FORCE it dries the clothes wringer dry in one minute and thereby eliminates the many disadvantages attendant upon the use of the former. By pressing the foot pedil down, the inside tub is raised out of the water, the end of the handle and the tub commence revolving, forcing the water out of the clothes thru the perforations.\n\nIn addition, if desired the \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" will dry a load of clothes ready to iron, if the dryer is allowed to operate approximately fifteen minutes.\nWHETHER you do your washing yourself or employ a servant, it is necessary to devote a certain amount of time on wash day to the laundry,\u2014the length of time depending upon the efficiency of the laundress or the mechanical means at hand.\n\nIn the first place,\u2014Can you depend upon the laundress to handle your clothes as carefully as you would yourself?\n\nIsn't it necessary to inspect the clothes after they are washed? Are they perfectly clean? Are the delicate pieces torn?\n\nHave you lost quantities of buttons which later have to be sewed on by yourself?\n\nAre the colors faded,\u2014and finally, in these days of high cost of living,\u2014have you got two dollars worth of efficiency and cleanliness?\n\nIF necessity compels you to do the laundry work yourself, don't you want to feel free to leave the laundry if the baby cries\u2014or a neighbor drops in? You don't want to be tied down to a wash board or a washing machine that will not operate without your undivided attention.\n\nNow,\u2014wouldn't it be a comfort to be able to forget all this and have an electrical servant to take all of this work and worry off your mind and when wash day arrives have your mind and hands free to do as you choose?\n\nThe \"LAUN-DRY-ETTE\" with its beautiful polished copper tub and its patented nickeled dryer, washes and dries the clothes without handling or injury. In the succeeding page we tell you how this wonderful servant solve your wash day problem.\nWASHES AND DRIES THE CLOTHES WITHOUT\n\nLIFTING BACKACHE\nRUBBING WRINGING WRINKLES\nSCALDED HANDS LOSS OF BUTTONS\nWEAR TO CLOTHES PINCHED FINGERS\n\nCapacity six sheets\nFifteen minutes to wash\nOne minute to dry\nCosts $1\\frac{1}{2}c.$ per hour.\nNo gears to strip\nFully Guaranteed\nAll copper tubs\nAttaches to lamp socket\nFully insulated.\n\nThe LAUN-DRY-ETTE is complete with all copper inside and outside tubs, motor, cord and two-piece detachable plug.\n\nCLOTHES WASHED AND DRIED IN THE SAME TUB WITHOUT A WRINGER\nThe Great West Washer\n\nThe springs of the overbeams shafting are made of heavy castings and babitted, and are bolted to angle iron supports.\n\nAll metal parts coming in contact with water are made either of brass or galvanized iron to insure durability.

Great West Electric Washer\n\nA Motor-Driven Washing Machine for Laundries, Institutions and the Larger Homes\n\nCut Your Laundry Bills in Two by Installing The Great West Washer\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 26th October last in which you requested me to obtain prices for a washing machine and wringer for the Kamloops Indian Industrial School from dealers in laundry machinery and suggested that I consult with the Principal regarding the kind of machinery he required, I beg to say that I obtained prices from all the local dealers for various kinds of machines, but these all appeared to be more for household use than for an institution. I wrote to the Reverend Principal and sent him the literature dealing with these machines and he was of the opinion that none of them would be suitable for the work at the school and then suggested that Messrs. Golightly Bros., of Vancouver, manufactured a washing machine and wringer which would answer his purpose and I got in touch with this firm. This machine is called \"The Great West Washer\" and Messrs. Golightly Bros. informed me that one of their firms visited the Kamloops School recently and looked into the matter and concluded that the proper thing to install would be one of their No. 2-a machines with a H.P.S.I. electric motor combined as shown on the attached circular marked (A), and a piece of 1/8/16 shafting with two boxes and three necessary pulleys for counter shaft to drive the wringer, which is a large size one with rubber rollers and fitted with rest and loose pulleys. The price submitted is $430.00 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nThe Principal informed me they also required a small laundry stove for heating irons. This can be obtained locally from the Albion Stove Works at a cost of $11.00 f.o.b. Victoria. It will heat twelve irons at a time but would keep twenty-four irons in use, as one set of irons can be heated while the other set are being used. This stove is used a great deal in a number of the local laundries.\n\nThe other electric washing machines on which prices were obtained are as hereunder:\n\n(B) Leun-Dry-Ette, wringerless washer, $240.00 f.o.b. Victoria, Hickman Tye Hardware Company.\n\n(C) Blue Bird, $200.00 f.o.b. Victoria, Carter Electric Company.\n\n(D) The Connor, $150.00 f.o.b. Victoria, Messrs. Hawkins & Hayward.\n\n(E) The Maytag, $150.00 f.o.b. Victoria, Messrs. Weiler Bros.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nCirculars dealing with these latter machines are also herewith enclosed lettered \"B\" \"C\" \"D\" and \"E\". I am of the opinion, however, that it would be of little use to the school to install a single machine of any of these makes, the best one of which I consider to be the Laun-Dry-Ette, two of which would cost $480.00 or $50.00 more than a single \"Great West\" washing machine and wringer, and therefore think it would be best to install one of this kind and also the laundry stove, which would cost $441.00 plus freight to Kamloops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have indulgence for my little postman who was anxious to render service, picked up the unfolded letter, treating of Motor Cattle and Alfalfa seed, folded it, placed it in the addressed envelope and posted it, before I had collected all the price enclosure concerning the alfalfa seed.\u2014The price will not exceed thirty-five cents a pound.\u2014I shall forward them in a day or two.\n\nYours very truly,\nJames McCauley, M.D.\n\nMr. Duncan E.

(RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nApril 20, 1921.\n\nDear Father McGuire,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, in which you ask for some further expenditure on the Kamloops industrial school.\n\nI regret very much that I am not able to comply with your request. I have endeavoured to be as liberal as possible, fully appreciating the character of the work that you are performing at this institution, and I have, as a matter of fact, made expenditures on this school that really should have been made from the earnings. This fiscal year, however, my funds have been still further curtailed, and the greatest economy will have to be exercised to enable us to keep our many schools on a working basis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. James McGuire, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Kamloops Industrial School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nAt the beginning of the new year I am requesting three articles from the Department:\n\n1. An electric motor of ten horse power and its installation: Approximate cost, Motor $425, Install $100.\n2. Corn or Ensilage Cutter, $230.00.\n3. Alfalfa seed, three hundred pounds: $100.00.\n\nThe corn and ensilage have passed from experiment to fixture; with the irrigation plant they are here to stay. However reluctant, I must face the motor and cutter.\n\nLast year borrowed both and was fortunate enough to escape serious damage; as it was, we lost about twenty tons. The borrowing system is bad: the machines might be damaged while with me; when our corn is ready, others' is ready and we must wait; the delay thus occasioned might easily cause the loss of the entire crop by frost. This would mean disaster; hence the request.\n\nIt should be noted that last fall a meter for the use of domestic water supply was placed in the yard in preparation for the installation of the motor for the ensilage cutter; this foresight now facilitated and reduces the cost of installation.\n\nFor us, the crops of corn and alfalfa possess educational value. They are easily handled, and as a result do not interfere with the boys' classes. With them and the barn and silo new, we can teach...\nthe basis irrigation, seeding, cultivation, saving of hay, filling of silo together with the proper care and feeding of both beef and dairy cattle. Since September the boys have not lost an hour's sleep. In all our improvements this point has been kept steadily in view.\n\nIn case the Department decides not to grant our entire request, might I suggest that we begin by installing the motors? We have been happy in following system but we not know serve from it.\n\nHoping you are very well and with best wishes,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McCauley, M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan E.

We lost both time and money.\n\nIn September the Department furnished us with cement to encase the pipe. The work lasted nearly a month. The other day we primed the pump to test the quality of our work. What was our delight to find that upon turning on the switch the water gushed from the upper delivery without the pipe leaking a drip. If after being soaked with water it withstands the frost of next winter the work will be permanent.\n\nThe Department will be glad to learn that such a small expenditure gives so great an advantage.

We now have some sixty head of beef cattle. With our irrigation system and barn we hope to supply our own beef. This autumn there will be twelve fit for the purpose.\n\nAnd now for the larder? The keeping of meat here has always been, and still remains at all seasons, a serious problem. It will now prove more serious if animals which are fit for the block in the fall must be kept over winter to be slaughtered only as needed.\n\nA refrigerating plant I have always thought of as part of the new kitchen. But in the event of it being utterly impossible to build this year, which I hope it is not, would it not be possible to proceed with the construction at least of the refrigerating plant? It would obviate waste. It would not be expensive. It would be a permanent improvement answering a constant requirement. When we have not, and cannot have under existing circumstances, cellar accommodation for provisions, it is easily realized how important this feature becomes.\n\nHoping that this point will receive your attention at your convenience,\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Our aim has been to remedy this unsanitary condition, prolific source of flies, by enclosing an alfalfa patch which makes excellent pasture. This is now ready and we wish to enclose it at once.\n\nLike Wellington at Waterloo, we have been praying for night or Blucher to come in the form of a new house! So far we have not been quite so fortunate as the Iron Duke! We have, however, had slight reinforcements and these, especially during visits or hanging time, require us to ask a slight increase, not renewal, of our kitchen utensils.\n\nKnowing that this requisition will receive your usual kind attention,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McQuire O.M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Dept.-General\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nof Indian Affairs.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am writing to say a word about our toilets and house water system.\n\nOur outdoor toilets in winter cause us those troubles inseparable from their use by little children in cold weather. They postpone the call of nature sometimes so that accidents occur. In the summer we use lime and disinfectant. But the coming warm season will force me, I am afraid, to build new toilets.\n\nThe water comes into our kitchen, laundry, and boys' washroom, none of which is frost-proof. Every precaution is taken at night to drain pipes as far as possible. Even then, there are no leaks about the place\u2014so frequently and so hurriedly pressed into service are the pipe and pipe-cutter. It is inevitable.\n\nThere is no shout nor wail about these conditions. We try to meet them cheerfully. A year ago I said that to put off the building of our house more than another year would prove a dangerous experiment. These were some of the things I had in mind; with the course of time they become more critical.\n\nIs health a necessary concomitant of adverse housing conditions?... We have sixty-five children here with red faces and glorious appetites! And plenty to satisfy them, thank God!\n\nThe motive in speaking of these matters...\narise from our inability to find for them ourselves a remedy. Besides, a knowledge of them prevented surprise. No reply is expected.\n\nHoping your health is as good as ours,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McQuire, M.D.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Dept. General,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nFebruary 2, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the installing of electric motor near the silo for the cutting of ensilage, crushing grain, and sawing wood, and in reply to say that the Department is glad to learn that the motor is giving you such perfect satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am, however, sending you under separate cover a blueprint copy of a refrigerating plant which I would ask you to look over and return to me with your views as to whether a building of this nature would meet your requirements, and the accommodation you would require in the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nKamloops Industrial School,\nKamloops - B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith quotation for Industrial School, from Kamloops Hardware Co., which was omitted from letter of yesterday's date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJFS/S.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that during the winter, considerable difficulty was experienced at the Industrial School with the domestic water system.\n\nSeveral freezings up of pipes occurred, and on one occasion the services of the City Electric thawer had to be secured to thaw the main from the pneumatic pump to the building. This main pipe has, no doubt, been laid several years ago, and has now become so rusted that it can hardly be used in the laundry.\n\nOn my recent visit to the School, I examined the discharge from the main through the several distributing pipes in the buildings. All showed the decay in the main, that to the laundry being the worse. The water cannot be used for washing. I was also shown garments which were washed after the water had been running for several hours, and notwithstanding this fact, there were practically ruined.\n\nI would therefore recommend that authority be given for the purchase and laying of 325 feet of 2\" galvanized pipe between the pneumatic tank and the distributing pipes in the main building and 228 feet of 1\u00bd\" from thence to the laundry. 2\" galvanized pipe is quoted at 42\u00a2 a foot and 1\u00bd\" galvanized at 32\u00a2 per foot.\n\nI am recommending the authorization of this expenditure as I consider it an absolute necessity and one which calls for immediate action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJFS/S.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nJuly 28, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nwith reference to the erection of a cold storage plant at Kamloops Industrial School, I beg to say that the Dominion Water Power Branch at Ottawa have been asked to give instructions to their officer at Kamloops to consult with you and prepare and submit to this Department, a sketch of a cold storage building for your institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

I would ask you to be good enough to give instructions to your officer at Kamloops to consult with the Reverend Principal and furnish this Department with a rough sketch of the building as asked for by the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A. F. MacKenzie)\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Challies, Esq.,\nDirector, Dominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa - Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAntoinde Larue, like other Kamloops Indians, cannot have sufficient water from the Paul Lake Creek. For a year I might try to supplement the supply with our pump. But this could not continue for obvious reasons.\n\nThe pump, however, for all the land West between us and the fill on the road going North, must be placed near ours. We occupy the strategic position. Our power line might therefore be utilized and our ditch going West likewise might be made a double part to play. Briefly also, you need someone like me to take charge of that pump.\n\nThis is, of course, the only question worth considering in regard to the entire Reserve. And I am discussing this question with you, not with the present Indian Agent. You would oblige me much by stating clearly on what conditions the Department would cooperate financially for the installation of such an irrigation plant. We would hasten slowly, say a year hence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, M.D.\n\nMr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nFor pasture our beef cattle must go to the Indians. This year we lost them some forty miles to Adam's Lake Reserve. A scrub bull there caused us considerable damage. There is danger of the cattle crossing Cold Creek and of being lost between there and Scotch Creek Reserve; the Indians themselves built a brush fence to obviate the latter difficulty for this year.\n\nThis is a splendid range and both the Indians and we wish to use it. To do so we wish to build a wire fence from the lake to the bluff or creek cutting off the only two men causing trouble and the access to Scotch Creek.\n\nAbout thirty spools of barb wire would be required at about five dollars a spool. If you could authorize us to make this expenditure or part of it we would complete the fence this fall.\n\nOf these Indians Etienne had Adrian, Noyere and Sam at School, all now working with him; Leon had Cecilia, Rebecca, Regina, Narcisse and Lillie, the three two first respectfully married, the three last still here at School. Men of the kind explain our success here; a little aid only tends further to build the school in their minds.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire\n\nIndustrial School,\nKamloops, July 13, 1922.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We wish to remedy this by the repairs requested. The portable houses, of which we had too few, given us last year by the Department, have enabled us to make important gains this spring in little pigs and chickens. What we have we wish to hold.\n\nThe Northern Construction, from whom we must buy, quoted me over the phone fourteen dollars a thousand for the lumber.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.S.\n\nMr. J.D.

Lack of it causes great waste and serious inconvenience.\n\nThe one portrayed, however, would require too great a quantity of ice owing to our hot summers; besides, the temperature could not be brought below freezing. To store meat during winter and to preserve it during summer we would have to freeze it.\n\nOwing to the importance of this plant for us, I am requesting the Department to ask the Dominion Water Power Branch at Ottawa, to allow their Office here prepare plans for a suitable plant or to modify those already sent. This would prove the safest and cheapest way.\n\nHoping this aid may be granted me as in the past, in a matter in which I am most interested.\n\nI remain,\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\nJames McQuire\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn F. Smith, Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\nKamloops, B. C.\nIndian Agent Smith has reported that Kamloops Industrial School are having considerable difficulty with their domestic water supply system. The pipe supplying water to the institution is badly decayed, and the water therefore, is unfit for use in the laundry. The pipe has frozen several times during the past winter, and on one occasion it was necessary to obtain the services of the City Electric Thawer to thaw the main from the pump to the building. The estimated cost of repairing this pipe line would be $586.00 which is $380.00 for labour and $206.00 for pipe.\n\nIf you give favourable consideration to their request, it might be suggested that the Department will supply the pipe, if the school authorities will look after the installation of same.\nI noticed at the time of my visit this summer that new buildings are needed here, with the exception of the barn, ice house and 2 pump houses. The boys' dormitory is very poor. The main building, in which is a girls' dormitory, the offices and chapel, is fair. Two classrooms are outside - no co-education. I advised the principal to keep in mind the general plans when locating the ice house this summer. All the land is irrigated. An electric pump supplies the power and has been a wonderful help to the school. The pigs and hens are along the river bank.\n\nFather McGuire strongly recommended that an agent, sympathetic to the school and to the Oblate Fathers doing Indian work in the vicinity, be appointed when the present one resigns. Father McGuire is quite interested in making the school a centre of farming instruction and would give active help in a following-up system for graduates.\nDear Mrs. McLean,\n\nMay I request you to call the attention of Mr. Scott, or in his absence to give your own personal attention to our refrigerating plant?\n\nHay is short in this district owing to winter killing. We are no worse than others, probably not so bad for our corn crop is enormous. But we must reduce our range stock which is now in prime condition. In these circumstances you can see why we are in haste for the refrigerator.\n\nI wish to thank you in advance for your courtesy in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\nJames McGuire, M.I.\n\nMrs. D.J.

If, as may prove the case, it is decided to place the refrigerator in the new house, it is not difficult to see that the new house is long past due, and that the lack of it will take the meat from the children's mouth, the meat for which they and I labored faithfully.\n\nCan you oblige us by giving us information at once?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire\n\nMrs. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Ind.

(RG 10, Volume 6447, file 882-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Department is today in receipt of a report and estimate of the cost of a refrigerating plant, from the Dominion Water Power Branch which was prepared on a request from this Department, for the Kamloops Indian Industrial School, B.C.\n\nAs you know, it had already been decided to provide for this school an ordinary ice house for the storing of meats and other perishable food during the summer months. After giving further consideration to this project, it was considered that this kind of refrigerator would not meet the requirements of this institution. A great number of cattle kept by this school have to be slaughtered in the Fall, owing to the lack of fodder, and the temperature which can be obtained in an ordinary ice house such as that first granted, +40\u00b0 Fahrenheit) is not sufficient to ensure the proper keeping of this meat.\n\nThe above mentioned project comprises the building of a cold storage room of sufficient space to permit the storage of ten beef carcass at the same time, together with a large amount of other food which has to be kept in a fresh condition for a short time. The low temperature required to keep the meat frozen during an indefinite period (20\u00b0) is supplied by an ammonia refrigerating plant having a congelating capacity of one ton per twenty-four hours. This machinery would consist of an ammonia compressor and condenser operated by a 5 H.P. electric motor. The cost of the building which would be built of reinforced concrete would amount to about $1,800.00; the machinery and the extension of the power line would cost approximately $2,500.00, making a total of $4,300.00 for the whole installation.\n\nWith reference to the cost of operation, it would be necessary that the machinery be operated from seven to ten hours per day throughout the season of six months, entailing a monthly expenditure of $33.00 which gives a total annual expenditure of $198.00. This amount will, of course be paid by the school together with all other operating expenses.\nAfter carefully examining this project as submitted by the Dominion Water Power Branch, I am positive that no other scheme could meet the requirements of such an institution. The ordinary ice cooling process has never proven satisfactory in cases where large quantities of meats have to be preserved, and the cost of the construction and maintenance of a small plant of the same capacity as that already described would amount to at least $1,800.00.\n\nThe Artificial refrigerating system would be a permanent improvement which would not incur further expenditure from the Department for its maintenance or operation, and in view of the relatively low expenditure involved, I would strongly recommend that this system only be taken into consideration in preference to the other, and that the necessary authorization be given to the Dominion Water Power Branch to proceed with the work before the cold season definitely sets in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nKAMLOOPS BC OCT 16 17 1922\n\nDUNCAN B SCOTT\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nAS OUR NEED OF A REFRIGERATOR IS PRESSING AND AS\nOUR LACK OF IT NOW OR SOON MUST ENTAIL GREAT\nLOSS WE WOULD ESTEEM IT A GREAT FAVOR TO HAVE\nFURTHER INFORMATION AT ONCE CONCERNING IT\n\nFATHER MAGUIRE\n\n230AM\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 11th last in regard to a report covering the cold storage building for the Kamloops Industrial School.

Light, as you know, abounds here; there is but little danger of having it insufficient. Might it not be well to ask the architect to reduce the window space, especially in front? As sketched it would be very warm from the sun in summer and cold in winter.\n\nBy reducing the length of the building and augmenting the width, a great saving in heat would be effected. There would be less light but more heat.\n\nIf care were taken in the installation of the heating system to provide for cutting off the steam from any section, fall and spring heating might cost less. The boiler should burn either wood or coal.\n\nIt is well to realize that as there is no grazing land belonging to the school for beef or range cattle, neither is there any timber berth for a supply of wood. If this matter were taken up in the near future, something of the kind might be had in the vicinity of the Shuswap Lakes. Lately we have burned mill wood. At the Nor Construction Mill, seven miles away, we\nhave it for the hauling from the Adamo P. Lumber Co. at Chase it costs us about three dollars a cord. Provision should be made to avail ourselves of these supplies while they last.\n\nWould it be well to facilitate the heating of the house as much as possible? Then, to be able to burn wood or coal as expediency would demand? Would it be well to cast about in quest of a wood supply?\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McQuire, M.D.\n\nMrs. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nReverend Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the present condition of the drainage system at the Kamloops Industrial School, I would say that I have placed this year, an item in the estimates to provide for the erection of a new Industrial school next year, which will include, of course, the installation of a complete new drainage system.\n\nSketch plans for your consideration are being prepared and will be sent you in a day or so.\n\nThe extent of the work to be undertaken will, of course depend upon the appropriation voted by Parliament.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O. M. I.,\nPrincipal, Industrial School,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nMight I request you to keep steadily in mind the sanitary system of kitchen and laundry when any opportunity of building offers? Any building at all capable of housing litters and girls would relieve the situation. The kitchen and laundry would be part of it and connected with a good septic tank.\n\nThe boys would occupy the present parlor, dining room, kitchen and bakery, using the upstairs as dormitory dormitory. We would ourselves connect the present sanitary system in third part with the main from the new building to the septic tank.\n\nTo keep the school open under the present sanitary system is thrilling business. At the end of November we swarmed upon a cesspool for both laundry and kitchen. Both gave out at once and both were in bad condition. As we were finishing, winter set in, the thermometer gradually descending until eighteen below zero was registered this morning! A blessing in disguise as no evil effect can come from the overflowing of the cesspits; still, it is thrilling.\n\nBy keeping clearly in mind the prime necessity of constructing the septic tank first thing in spring you will remedy the situation\u2014and the thrills.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Duncan & Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIt is impossible to lay too much stress on the necessity here of having a proper system of disposing of sewage.\n\nIt is not my intention to enter into detail concerning the cesspools of the laundry and kitchen both failing at present to operate, both overflowing, the one outside, the other under the house, and both extremely dangerous for all of us.\n\nThe burden of these lines is simply once again to arrest your attention upon the necessity of erecting a portion of the main building, no matter how small a part, wherein the litters and girls could be lodged, and especially of making proper arrangements for the disposal of sewage. The Principal's office, the parlor, the boys' dining-room and kitchen could be occupied by the boys for some time; this part was honestly constructed, the sewer pipes well laid and could in all probability be connected with the main of the new building, thus ensuring safety of health. The boys' house, now uninhabitable, would be abandoned and anxiety for the health of all relieved.\n\nMight I request you to place the construction of a sanitary system for us foremost in your mind when thinking of building at Kamloops?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McCune, O.M.S.\n\nMr. Dunman & Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 23rd., 1922.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI enclose cheque for $1500.00 and would ask you to kindly wire this amount to the credit of John F. Smith, with your branch at Kamloops, B.C.\n\nI enclose blank telegraph form franked.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H.

Smith\nIndian Agent.\n\nJFS/S.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndustrial School,\nKamloops, Nov. 2, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWe are making request to the Department for an irrigation intake pipe and a few articles to aid us in making a few repairs.\n\nTile Pipe 1/2 in diameter - 125 feet long - to replace the wooden box of same length now serving as intake pipe for the irrigation pump. Cement - 6 cwt.\n\nThree gallons black to paint the pneumatic water tank.\n\nPaint - Two red \"wagon and implements.\"\n\nTurpentine for mixing - Two gallons.\n\nTwo pipe wrenches for repairing water pipes.\n\nWrenches - One monkey \"bust by frost during winter.\"\n\nNail Hammers - Two\n\nChisels - Two\n\nFiles - Two\n\nClips - Two pairs\n\nNails - Two kegs\n\nLime - Two cts. - Toilets.\n\nOwing to the fact of the intake pipe of the irrigation plant being laid in June, it was impossible on account of rising water to put it low enough; the following year the pipe on the pump was cut a foot shorter because sand and gravel were being sucked up from the bottom of the well. Later we cemented the well. Now we wish to sink the well and intake pipe four feet to enable us to pump earlier in\nthe spring and later in the fall. Mr. Smith, the Indian Agent, may, if he wishes, furnish further details.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire O.M.S.\n\nMr. Duncan & Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nWilcox-Hall Co., Ltd.\n\nWHOLESALE and RETAIL\n\nAgricultural Implements and Machinery, Automobiles, Carriages, Wagons, Sleighs,\nCutters, Harness, Saddles, Paints, Varnishes, Oils, Electricit\nSupplies, Earthen and Chinaware, Phonographs,\nPianos and General Hardware\n\nPHONE 74\nDRAWER 188\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nNov. 8th/22\n\nRev.

The cylinders being cast separate are securely and accurately bolted to the compressor base, therefore can be easily removed and replaced.\n\nCylinders\u2014To be water-jackatted, each cylinder to have a diameter of 4\u00bd inches and a stroke of 4\u00bd inches.\n\nSafety Heads\u2014Each cylinder to be supplied with a safety head so that in case any foreign matter, or a rush of liquid should enter the cylinders, the safety heads will lift, thereby preventing as far as possible any damage.\n\nValves (patents pending)\u2014Are so constructed that they can be readily withdrawn and examined by removing the cylinder covers. The valves are guaranteed to work mechanically silent.\n\nPistons\u2014To be supplied of our double trunk construction, accurately turned and fitted with metallic rings.\n\nConnecting Rods\u2014To be supplied of steel with anti-friction metal bearings.

The water for condensing purposes passes upwards through the 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch pipe and the ammonia gas to be condensed passes downward between the outside surface of the 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch and the inside of the 2 inch pipes. On account of the gas and the cooling water travelling in opposite direction and on account of the small space between the two pipes, the ammonia gas is cooled and liquified quickly.\n\nThe 2 inch ammonia pipes are fitted with special ammonia flanges screwed and soldered thereon and bolted at each end to special semi-steel flanged return headers and fitted with lead gaskets, thereby securing a tight joint. The 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch water pipes are fitted at each end with unions and connected to return bends.\n\nWhere more than one section of condenser is supplied the different sections will be connected at top and bottom by special headers and each section to have a valve on the inlet and outlet, so that each section can be shut off and disconnected from the main system either for inspection or repairs without interfering with the working of the remaining sections.\n\nStands\u2014Of heavy construction are supplied by us.\n\nLiquid Ammonia Receiver\u2014One to be supplied about 6 feet long by 6 inches in diameter and to be of suitable construction.

H. Trudoroff,\nDivision Engineer.\nDominion Water Power Branch -\nKamloops, B.C.\nMarch 31st, 1925.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to inform you that at the request of the Department of Indian Affairs and in accordance with instructions received from your office on November 4th, 1922, a refrigerating plant, having a capacity of 1 ton refrigeration per 24 hours, was installed at the Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nThis plant which was constructed under the supervision of this office, was duly completed, placed in operation, and handed over to the Reverend Father McQuire on March 7th, 1925.\n\nBUILDING\n\nThe building which is situated immediately in rear of the site chosen for the proposed new school, consists of 2 compartments as follows: 1 Engine Room 12' x 5' x 6'6\" high; 1 Storage Room 12' x 10' x 8' high, and is of reinforced concrete construction, the walls and floor being 6\" thick, reinforced both horizontally and vertically for temperature stresses, and the roof being of reinforced slab design, 5\" in thickness, carried on 1 - 8\" I beam as shown on the accompanying plan.\n\nThe floor of the building is situated at an elevation of 4 feet below the surface of the ground, and the building is covered by a wooden shade roof of double thickness having a\n1\" air space between the inside and outside layers, designed to protect the concrete walls and roof from the direct rays of the sun; ventilation between the two structures is provided for by means of lattice work on both front and rear gables.\n\nPLANT\n\nThe plant which has a capacity of 1 ton refrigeration per 24 hours is of the Ammonia Compression Direct Expansion Type, electrically operated, and consists of 1 ammonia compressor, 1 ammonia receiver, 1 condenser, 1 oil trap, 1 scale trap, 1 - 3 HP, 220 volt motor together with all valves, gauges, mains, coils, fittings etc necessary for its proper operation.\n\nThe plant is situated in the smaller compartment of the main building, and was supplied and erected by the Canadian Ice Machine Company, under the supervision of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nINSULATION\n\nInsulation of the Storage Room is obtained by means of a specially constructed compartment situated inside the concrete building (see accompanying plan) and consists of the following:\n\nWalls\n\nAll walls are 12\" in thickness constructed of 4 layers of V joint with insulating paper between them, and so arranged that there is a 6\" space between the two inside layers, this space is filled with slag-wool which is a mineral product and one of the very best heat insulators obtainable. In addition to this slag-wool insulation, the two inside layers of V joint are separated by means of 2\" studding so that a 2\" air space is formed, lined on the inside with 1 layer of insulating paper.\n\nRoof\n\nConstruction of the roof is practically the same\nas that of the walls with the exception that 3 layers of V joint were used in place of 4, and so arranged that there is a 6\" space filled with slag-wool immediately between the two air spaces. (See accompanying plan)\n\nFloor\n\nInsulation of the floor is obtained by means of 1 layer of cork 2\" in thickness laid in hot asphalt on the main concrete floor and covered by a surface of cement 2\" in thickness.\n\nDoor\n\nThe door is of the swinging type 16\" in thickness specially constructed by means of alternate layers of V joint insulating paper, and slag-wool, it is carried by two hinges and is supported at its free end by a tie rod attached to a swivel placed in the wall immediately above the hinges.\n\nPiping\n\nRefrigeration of the Storage Room is obtained by means of ammonia pipes situated on the walls and for this purpose approximately 400 lin. ft. of 1/4\" dia. special ammonia pipe were installed; this piping is so arranged that by opening or closing 5 by-pass valves a section of the piping can be cut in or out of the system at the will of the operator, thus raising or lowering the temperature of the storage room without altering the speed of the machine.\n\nIn addition to the above piping a calcium congealing tank having a capacity of approximately 20 cu. ft. was installed which renders it unnecessary to maintain the compressor in constant operation throughout the full 24 hours per day, and will permit of the plant being closed down at any time, if necessary, without damage occurring to any of the food-stuffs which may be stored therein.\n\nVentilation\n\nVentilation of the storage room is obtained\nby an electric fan which is connected with the outside air by means of a closed air pipe 3\" in dia. The pipe can be opened when necessary and foul air exhausted from the room by the fan, fresh air being admitted in its place through the 1\" dia. air-vent situated beside the door. (See accompanying plan)\n\nFittings\n\nBoth compartments are provided with electric light, and drains for the removal of waste water, while the storage room has been fitted on 3 sides with 6\" x 6\" timbers for the suspension of frozen meat etc. (See plan) These timbers are supported by 4 - \u00be\" dia. bolts which pass completely through the roof and are securely attached to 2 - 8\" x 6\" timbers placed transversely across the building and supported on the main walls, this precaution obviates any strain being placed on the concrete roof, which might otherwise cause it to crack unduly.\n\nSERVICE CONNECTIONS\n\nPower\n\nPower for the operation of both the compressor and electric fan is 220 volt - 3 phase - 60 cycle alternating current and is obtained from the City of Kamloops by means of connections made to the transformer situated in the vicinity of the school buildings. The erection of 200 feet of pole-line was necessary for its transmission.\n\nWater\n\nWater for the operation of the compressor is obtained from the present domestic water-supply pumping-plant, and is delivered to the engine room through 200 feet of \u00be\" dia. water main at a pressure of approximately 40 lbs. per sq. in.\n\nLight\n\nCurrent for the illumination of the building is\nobtained from the same source as that for power purposes, 250 volt lamps being used in place of the usual 110 volt.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nThe construction of the building for the above plant was under the supervision of the Dominion Water Power Branch, and was carried out by day labor during the months of December, January and February, the temperature during this period often fell to 15 degrees below zero and seldom exceeded 32\u00b0 F. for more than a few hours at a time. This low temperature made the work of construction exceedingly difficult, and necessitated extreme precautions being taken to prevent damage by freezing.\n\nOwing to the above considerations the cost of constructing this plant was approximately 5% greater than it would have been under ordinary conditions.\n\nCOST\n\nThe total cost of the above plant including cost and erection of the machinery, the construction of the buildings, insulation, fittings, water and power connections, etc., amounted to $4,268.54. (See appendix \"A\")\n\nREMARKS\n\nThe plant which is designed and installed to operate at a condenser pressure of 150 lbs. per sq. in. and a back pressure of approximately 20 lbs. per sq. in. will when operating continuously with all by-pass valves open, maintain the storage room at a temperature of 20\u00b0 F. when the air outside the refrigerator is in the vicinity of 90\u00b0 F. This temperature is sufficient to store meat in a frozen state for long periods.\n\nAs stated above the dimensions of the storage room are 12' x 10' x 8' and after deducting for pipes, congealing tank, fan, etc., there remains a\nclear storage space of over 600 cu. ft. which is sufficient for the careful storage of 12 or 13 beef carcasses.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDivision Engineer.\n\nR.

same principle which insures the maximum amount of efficiency.*\nWHY BIRCHFIELD BOILERS EXCEL\n\nSimplicity of construction.\nElectric arc welded.\nAbsolute free circulation of water.\nNo lap joints or rivet heads to burn off, leak or corrode.\nNo cracks or joints around the fire box to putty.\nNo gaskets or small parts that require renewing.\nHot gases come in contact with nothing but effective heating surface.\nThe boiler is well balanced.\n\nArrangement of tubes and water legs provides perfect steam liberation and rapidity of circulation ensuring maximum heat absorption and preventing collection of scale and sediments.\n\nThe construction permits of no air leakage. The height and length of the fire box, combined with a large combustion chamber, provides ample room for the air and heat producing gases to mix and burn, thereby reducing fuel consumption.\n\nThe boiler proper is a single unit constructed of six plates of steel, fire door ring, and stay bolts joined by electric welding.\n\nTubes expanded and beaded.\nNo holes are punched through inside plates.\nSmoke boxes, front and rear, are detachable.\nSmoke connection is horizontal at rear of boiler.\nGrates are self supporting, of the rocking and dumping type, are heavy, strong and durable, with fifty to fifty-five per cent air space.\n\nBase is detachable.\n\nThis boiler is distinctly an advance in boiler construction. Actual tests prove that with ordinary care our boiler will save from fifteen to sixty-five per cent of the fuel required to operate any other type of boiler.\n\nEASY TO CLEAN. EASY TO FIRE. NO REPAIRS.\n### Birchfield Steam Boilers\n\n**Patented Oct. 18, 1921**\n\nBirchfield Boilers will carry all the radiation shown by their capacity.\n\nAll boilers are tested to one hundred pounds cold water pressure at the factory.\n\nWorking pressure fifteen pounds per square inch.\n\nSteam trimmings (extra, see list): Gauge and Syphon, Water Column with Gauge, Metal Diaphragm Draft Regulator, and Safety Valve Complete.\n\nFiring Tools: Poker, Slice Bar and Flue Scraper furnished with all boilers.\n\n| Boiler Number | Capacity | Sq.

Manufactured in different capacities suitable for buildings of all types and sizes.\n\nBuilt of steel, they are rugged and strong and are not subject to cracking or breaking.\n\nThe design is simple, and scientifically proportioned so as to produce the most heat from the fuel used, and what is equally important to absorb a maximum amount of the heat.\n\nBirchfield Steel Boilers are easy to clean, easy to fire, efficient with wood, coal or oil, and materially reduce fuel and labor costs.\n\nWhat these users say of Birchfield Steel Boilers are typical of results obtained.\n\n\"We are extremely gratified.\" \"Fuel Oil cut in two as compared with old cast iron boiler.\" \"Every claim more than fulfilled.\"\n\nREX ARMS APARTMENTS, LOS ANGELES, CAL.\n\n\"Entirely satisfied.\" \"Believe it is the best boiler we could have bought.\"\n\nTHOMAS TEBB, TEBB APARTMENTS, ABERDEEN, WASH.\n\n\"Performance leads me to believe it is without doubt, the most efficient heating boiler on the American market.\" \"I am glad to give it the highest possible recommendation.\"\n\nPETERS CONSTRUCTION CO., PORTLAND, ORE.\n\n(Mr. Peters has placed an order for his second Birchfield Steel Boiler.)\n\n\"Its giving absolute satisfaction.\" \"House thoroughly heated with one third of the fuel used in old boiler.\"\n\nL.

In a building such as mentioned above however, which would likely require at least a car load, the flooring would be shipped direct from the Factory at Meaford.\n\nAt any time that this office can give you any information on Hardwood Flooring which might be required for any of your building operations in Alberta and British Columbia, I will be only too glad to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly\n\nFMB/B\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. P. and tested to 60 lbs. Birchfield boilers are superior to the Kewanee or any other type of steel boiler in that they require less fuel, are practically smokeless and do not require brick settings. The parent Company in Tacoma have built 650 of these boilers (for steam and hot water) within the last 26 months. They have been adopted by the Seattle School Board and you will note from the enclosed photographs two boilers No. 631 which were installed in their new Columbia School.\n\nWe are manufacturing four of these boilers for new buildings and Schools in Vancouver and Victoria, in addition to which we have already installed two large steam boilers in the new Coughlan and Dollar blocks, Vancouver.\n\nLocal Heating Engineers and Contractors are submitting tenders to you based on both Kewanee and Birchfield boilers and we hope that you will give our product your favorable consideration.

It is with respect to granite Cut Stone. We tried from two sources to get a figure on this work from Vancouver, but all we were able to obtain was a price for the quarried material F.O.B. Vancouver. With this as a basis, we had one of the best Cut Stone men in Winnipeg prepare us an estimate. This resulted in a price of Cut Stone in Granite at $8,700.00 F.O.B. Kamloops.\n\nIf we can buy the stone at a less figure we are prepared to give the Department a credit. We thought possibly a proper tender for it might be in the mail this morning and we could have wired you any change it made in the figures.\n\nIf we are unable to purchase granite at the price named we have based our figure on supplying Tyndall Lime Stone and giving the Department a credit of $2,300.00 for this substitution.\n\nRegarding the Deposit Cheque, we intended arranging this by telegram as on previous occasions, but we were unable to ascertain the amount required in time to give the necessary advice to our Bank last evening. We discovered this morning that the difference in time between Ottawa and Winnipeg made it impossible to have the cheque delivered to you before noon, so we trust the course suggested by our telegram may be followed with satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\nWinnipeg, Man., August 5, 1928.\n\nDuncan C.

When laid in the wall, the partitions or webs come directly over each other. Interlocking Tile may be used in the same manner as common brick in ordinary construction.\n\nWARM IN WINTER COOL IN SUMMER\n\nThe many air spaces in the wall prevent heat from passing through the wall readily, therefore, no matter how hot the sun does not heat up the inside of the building. In winter the building can be heated with a smaller heating plant and with less expense for fuel.\n\nECONOMICAL\n\nDenison Interlocking Tile requires less than one-half as much mortar as brick. It also requires much less steel to support it when used in curtain walls.\n\nEASILY AND RAPIDLY LAID\n\nThe mason handles the tile in one hand without laying down the trowel. No other tile of equal size can be handled in this way. The mortar bed is 4 inches wide, giving a full, free spread of mortar and thorough bedding between courses.

Tenders were invited for the erection of this building and the following have been received:\n\n- Thomas Carson.............Vancouver...........$88,987.00\n- Poole Construction Co., Ltd........Regina............99,985.00\n- Claydon Company, Ltd........Winnipeg..............101,362.00\n- Robert Moncrieff...........Vancouver.............104,221.00\n- J. McDiarmid Co., Ltd., Ltd........Winnipeg........112,415.00\n- Johnston Co., Ltd...........Kamloops..............113,000.00\n- M.A. Clark................Penticton..............113,397.00\n- Smith Bros. & Wilson.......Vancouver.............121,520.00\n\nThe Minister therefore recommends, pursuant to the requirements of Sub-section 2 of Section 36 of the Public Works Act that the contract be awarded to the lowest tenderer, Thomas Carson, for the amount of his tender as above cited, namely, $88,987.00, the same being reported by the Architect of the Department as fair and reasonable, and money being available from the Vote for Indian Education.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,\n\n\"The Kamloops New School\"\n\n\"Report by Mr. Carson & Co. of Vancouver when tender of $88,957.00 was accepted by the Department.\"\n\nMr. Carson states as follows:\n\n\"Plans and specifications were received on 24th May, 1923 and after checking up the estimates submitted by the firm, I had altogether omitted the item of external bricks. Consequently, my tender was lower than intended.\n\nI desire to postpone signing contract until this matter has been considered and decided by the Department. I should be glad if you will submit the abstract to the Department and request a decision.\"\n\nMr. Carson explains as follows:\n\nThe clause under brickwork, page 21 of specification was not considered quite clear; he was unable to decide whether pressed bricks or common bricks were intended for the face of external walling, and left the item pending further information; eventually this item was overlooked.\n\nMr. Carson now wishes the Department to definitely decide what class of brick will be accepted, in order that he may decide the cash value of the work omitted.\n\n1. If common bricks are acceptable the value would be approximately $2,795.00\n\n2. If 2nd quality pressed bricks do do $3,595.00\n\n3. If 1st class pressed bricks do do $7,000.00\n\nMr. Carson strongly inclines to the view that common\nbrick complex with the requirements of the Department and guests, in support of his contention, the Schools recently erected by the Department at Sechelt and Grass Lake. In particular Mr. Carson requests decisions on the following points:\n\n1. Is the Department prepared to make any allowance for the mistake made by him?\n2. The quality of brick to be invested upon.\n3. Failing an allowance, will the Department permit him to withdraw his tender; this would involve the return of his Deposit Cheque for $8,900.00.\n\nMr. Carson expresses regret at the mistake made and states that he deserves the favourable consideration of the Department; failing this, however, he is prepared to sign the contract and accept the resultant loss.\n\nMr. Carson is in Kamloops preparing for an immediate start on the work; the exact location of the building cannot be determined until the return of the Reverend Principal of the School from Vancouver, on Thursday 30th inst.\n\nMay I request that the decision of the Department be forwarded direct to Mr. Carson, and a copy sent to me, if possible, for personal guidance and information.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ford\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nA contract was awarded recently to Mr. Thomas Carson of Vancouver, at his tendered price of $88,987.00 for the building of the first unit of the proposed new Indian Residential School at Kamloops. Mr. Carson submitted the lowest tender. The next lowest tender received was that of the Poole Construction Co. of Regina, for $99,985.00.\n\nA letter has now been received from Mr. W. H. MacAulay, Architect of Kamloops who was appointed Inspector of Construction for this building, advising that Mr. Carson omitted the item of external brickwork from his tender, and asking if the Department is prepared to make an allowance for the mistake made by him; also, if the Department cannot allow him for the brick, would they permit him to withdraw his tender and return his deposit security. Mr. Carson also states that he expresses regret at the mistake made, and that he desires the favourable consideration of the Department, failing this, however, he is prepared to sign the contract and accept the resultant loss.\n\nThe cost of brickwork omitted is $2,798.00. The addition of this amount to his original tender still makes his price considerably lower than the next lowest tender, and it appears that an error was made by him in totalling up his tender. Our Architect is of the opinion that unless the contractor is allowed the item for the brickwork, that he will probably lose money on his contract. Will you please instruct me if favourable consideration can be given to Mr. Carson's request.\n\n(J. D.

Charles Stewart,\nThe Minister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs-Kamloops School.\n\nMr. Thos. Carson the general contractor for the new Indian School at Kamloops B. C. has awarded us the contract for the cut stone work in the said building. Owing to friction between the Granite Cutters Union and the Sandstone Cutters Union the Granite Cutters have refused to cut our granite work unless that they are allowed to cut our soft stone which means that the Sandstone cutters will walk out and leave us with a considerable amount of work unfinished on our hands.\n\nThe specifications call for a considerable amount of Rockfaced granite. We are willing to dress all stone in the said building if we could use Newcastle Island Stone a very hard fireproof sandstone. The dressing of this stone will barely offset the rockfaced and dressed work on the granite.\n\nWe are now finishing the bank of Montreal Building at Victoria B. C. with the same stone. It has been specified in the new C. P. R. Building at Victoria and the new Memorial Hall at Victoria. The Assay Office (Dominion) and several leading banks are of Newcastle Island Stone. We might add that the San Francisco Mint was one of the few buildings that stood the earthquake and fire them in 1906 which proves it one of the best stones on the continent.\n\nThis change would enable us to carry on our contract without waiting for a settlement with the labour Union of the Granite Cutters and causing the general contractor any delay besides giving the department a superior class of finished work on their building.\n\nWe are submitting a sample of Newcastle Island Stone from a new and better quarry which we are operating.\n\nWe remain,\n\nYour very Sincerely,\n\nJ.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nNovember 8th, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI spent yesterday with Mr. McBride going into the question of the brick and stone to be used in the new Kamloops school. I showed Mr. McBride the copy of the letter addressed to the Minister, regarding the substituting of sandstone for the granite. Mr. McBride is still of the opinion, however, that granite should be used for this school, and I fully agree with him.\n\nWhile in Kamloops I examined buildings in which sand-stone had been used and found the effect of the weather on the stone resulted in cracks forming in many places. This is due to the mild weather in the daytime and the freezing at night, which is experienced at Kamloops.\n\nWith reference to the brick we examined samples of all brick available in the Province and decided on using the red pressed brick manufactured at Clayburn. This is a high-grade brick and will give full satisfaction.\n\nA good start has been made on the school and the site chosen for the building is an excellent one.\n\nWith reference to the letter from the Rev. Mother Superior regarding the changes the Sisters desire in the plans, I spent an afternoon with the Sisters at the School, going over and explaining to them the plans for the building. They did not quite understand the lay-out and after explaining the proposed building to them and making a few minor changes they stated that they were entirely satisfied with the lay-out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nIn reply to a letter from the Deputy Superintendent General, under date of the 20th inst., enclosing copy of letter from Rev.

James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nIndian Industrial School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nDear Doctor:\n\nDuring the heat of the summer and the cold spells of winter we rarely had meat come upon the table in prime condition. It was of poor quality in the shops or thawed out too long, or tainted in transit, or deteriorated in keeping here. Even the beef slaughtered here at school suffered in much the same way; we were continually in trouble when there was question of placing good meat on the children's table in sufficient quantity.\n\nNor had our idea of a remedy reached that point of clearness where they were free from all doubt and could be stated with precision. Far from it; indeed after consulting Agent, butcher, engineer and packer we saw every avenue filled with traps and pitfalls. Even when you telegraphed that you hesitated in authorizing the outlay, I must confess that I said and answered nothing for the same reason that a monkey does not talk: I had nothing to say!\n\nBut you decided on a refrigerator and it was built. But heretofore we have said nothing of it: Would it answer the purpose? Would the cost of operating prove too great?\n\nLet me hasten to say that so far it has more than fulfilled our expectations in both respects. We killed all our own meat during\nsummer and every day and every meal it came on to the table to the satisfaction of everybody.\n\nThe machine required care of course; all machines do. But the result is worth while. We hope the Department will be pleased to have this gratifying information. We are more than satisfied.\n\nIt is only by realizing our extremes and changes of heat and cold both summer and winter, the efforts we had made to meet them, how we had been beaten and disappointed, what a gap there always remained unfilled and how effectually the refrigerator has met all these and what a boon good meat is to little children that you can realize how thankful we are to you, Doctor, for your decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McCauley O.M.S.\n\nDuncan E.

Sister Mary Gabriel on the subject of the new Kootenay school. Will you kindly show it to Mr. Gurney Orr, our Architect, who expects to be in Kamloops about the 31st instant. Kindly ask him to give the matter his best attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. C. Dallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nOctober 20th, 1923.\n\nRev. and dear Sister Mary Gabriel,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 18th October. Our Architect, Mr. Gurney Orr, expects to be in Kamloops about the 31st instant. I am sending him a copy of your letter through the Indian agent, and have asked him to give the question of the laundry and kitchen accommodation his very best attention.\n\nI trust that you and your staff have been very well since Mrs. Scott and I visited you. We enjoyed that short time at your wonderful institution.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nProvincial Superior,\nSt. Ann's Academy,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSt. Ann's Academy\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nOctober 12, 1923\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Sister Superior of Kamloops where the Department is undertaking the building of the central portion of the new school.\n\nShe points out to me that the plan as now construed would place the laundry, the kitchen. It would seem that these two units would hardly be combined, and she considers it to better advantage to have the laundry leading into the Girls' recreation room. As the clothes come from the laundry, they could be easily be folded and cared for by the girls, thus eliminating constant traffic through the kitchen.\n\nShe tells me that she talked over the matter with Mr. McCauley, who quite agrees with her, and who is willing to draw a little sketch making the proposed change, and submit it to the Department. Although I have not seen the plans, I quite agree with her as regards the proximity of the laundry to the recreation room.\n\nThe Sisters also hope that the proposed wing for the girls will not be considerably delayed, as they cannot utilize the central portion as living quarters without seriously deteriorating the apartments which will be used as offices later on. I think they prefer remaining where they are until such time as the whole is completed.\n\nWe have in view, as you already know, only one object,\u2014and that is to economize space, time, and to better the conditions all around. When all is told, the labor has to be done by the Sisters in the house, and they best know what is necessary.\n\nI already knew that you will take this into consideration, and I sincerely trust that the change will not interfere with your plans, or increase the building expenditures.\n\nWith the assurance of my hearty co-operation in the work here,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial Superior.\n\nMr. D.

The letter was addressed by the Department of Indian Affairs to \"W.H. Macaulay, Inspector of Construction, 10025-113th St., Vancouver, B.C.\" No such address could be found by the letter guides and upon examination of the telephone book no such person of this name could be located. I took the liberty of opening the letter, with a view of finding its correct destination, upon reading which I phoned to the residence of Mr. Carson, whose wife replied that her husband was away, that was the Contractor who was expecting to receive a contract to build a school at Kamloops, and that Mr. Macaulay's address was Box 271, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nI have forwarded this letter in the care of the Office in Charge of the Indian Office at Kamloops, requesting him to see that the letter reaches its destination, and advising him that should this not be possible to return the letter to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir Archibald,\n\n\"New Residential School, Kamloops B.C.\"\n\nHerewith attached please find copy of letter from the Rev. Father McGuire, in reference to which I hasten to report an answer. The Rev. McGuire and the Sisters Superior object very strongly to the location of Laundry, the small amount of dormitory accommodation and the omission of a Dining Hall.\n\nI have clearly explained that I have no authority whatever to deviate from the existing plans in any particular, but would be willing to examine any suggestions and submit them to the Department, strictly providing they appeared essential and in the best interests of the Building.\n\nFurther, I have pointed out that the Architect is to be consulted by the Department. Mr. R. Murray Orr, will be in Kamloops on or about Nov. 1st when any outstanding difficulties could be taken up with him personally.\n\nI am however requested to formally present these matters to the Department direct, to obviate delay and unnecessary work; the details to be taken up with Mr. Orr on his arrival here.\n\nI have informed the Contractor, Mr. Brown, that in view of a possible change in the location of the Laundry it would be advisable to delay operations on this particular portion of the work.\n\nIf an expression of opinion by me is in order, I would state that the objections raised are reasonable, and the suggested changes both good and practical; further are capable of being put into effect without materially affecting the cost of the building as a whole, or widely interfering with the general design or layout.\nLaundry. The existing levels, or grade, of the site are particularly favourable to the placing of Laundry under the Junior Girls Recreation Room.\n\nThe present facilities for convenient operation and supervision are considered satisfactory in every way.\n\nStore. The two small stores adjacent to Kitchen each 12'6\" x 6'6\" are considered quite adequate, and their space could be utilized to better advantage as a pantry.\n\nA fairly large store adjacent to the Kitchen is urgently required to accommodate the large stock of eggs, butter, tobacco, fruit etc., which are preserved seasonally for Winter and Spring consumption; in addition, a fairly large storage room is required for groceries including flour, rice, beans, bacon etc.\n\nDairy. The supply and care of milk is of primary importance in the establishment, firstly from the food value, and secondly from an educational point of view.\n\nIt is considered that most of the girl laborers are destined for an agricultural life. Consequently a certain amount of instruction in General Dairy work under proper sanitary conditions is considered essential.\n\nLocation. A portion of the space at present occupied by the Laundry could, with advantage, be utilized for both Store and Dairy, they would be excellently placed, access to the former being obtained directly from Kitchen and to the latter from the Balcony adjacent thereto.\n\nFor the Store a fairly long but narrow room having shelves on both sides, together with metal bins for flour, rice, oatmeal etc. is considered desirable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nIndustrial School\nKawartha, Ont.\nOct. 18, 1923\n\nDear Mr. Maclean,\n\nFollowing our recent conversation concerning the question of the Laundry being in the dormitory, I wish to say that you would oblige me greatly by referring the matter to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nWe wish the Laundry removed from the kitchen to a position near or under the Girls' Recreation Hall where the girls generally come to do their work; this arrangement would leave the Kitchen work and Laundry work separated, as they are in fact.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nCapt.

Father MacKinnon; it faces practically due South and is, therefore, quite satisfactory.\n\nMost of the work has been, and is, in the nature of excavation, the Central portion under Chapel etc. is complete, the Eastern portion, and Laundry practically so, and the Western portion, under Boiler Room, being grounded and.\n\nIt was found necessary to disconnect the House Drain and dig and temporary backfill, this matter has duly reported to the Department, and confirmation of the action taken was requested.\n\nThe Contractor requests Detail Drawings. I presume these will be forwarded at an early date; the walls of granite work are urgently required, a section thru the Basement window sill, showing treatment of granite grade Count etc. is particularly urgent; also detail of Basement window frames.\n\nPoveshell's Servant\n\nW.

Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, relative to the position and installation of the septic tank for the new building.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that Mr. Orr, the Department Architect, will be in Kamloops on or about the 31st instant and you should discuss this matter with him. He will, if necessary, make a recommendation by telegram to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Macaulay, Esq.,\nP. O. Box 455,\nKamloops, B. C.\nNew Industrial School, Kamloops, B.C.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copy of letter received from the Rev. Father McGurk relating to Septic Tank.\n\nFrom information to hand, I understand that it is proposed to build the Septic Tank in the new future. Consequently, I presume that the exact location has been decided by the Department.\n\nOther than that the tank will be constructed somewhere south of the New Building, I am unable to obtain information here, on this subject.\n\nThe tank location has a very decided bearing on the Drainage Scheme for the New Building, particularly as to the connecting up points.\n\nThe question raised by the Rev. Father McGurk relative to the connecting up part of present or existing drainage scheme, is particularly urgent; the present site has overflow occasionally, and the present building operation necessitated disconnection of main house drain.\n\nMay I request information as to the exact location of the proposed Septic Tank, together with the probable date on which construction of the work will be commenced.\n\nReceipt of the information at an early date, if convenient, will enable me to make the necessary arrangements for connecting up the New Building at convenient points, together with such temporary arrangements as may be found necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. Macaulay,\nInspector of Construction\nIndustrial School\nKamloops B.C.\n10 Oct. 1923\n\nMr. Macaulay,\n\nFollowing our recent conversation about the sulphur tanks I beg to say that I would be very pleased if you could take up with the Department the details of its location and installation.\n\nIf these matters have settled we might then see about connecting part of our present system with the new sulphur tanks.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames McQuire O.M.S.\nGURNEY ORR.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT.\n\nWE CAN SUPPLY YOU FOR INDIAN SCHOOL KAMLOOPS BUFFS REDS OR OTHER NUMBER ONE AND TWO QUALITY PRESSED BRICK MANUFACTURE IN BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nEVANS COLEMAN AND EVANS\n\n434 PM\nOttawa, Oct. 15, 1923.\n\nSirs:\n\nI have been instructed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant addressed to the Deputy Minister with reference to the brick to be used for the Kamloops School.\n\nI beg to advise you that the Architect of the Department is leaving for the West this week and will be at Kamloops towards the end of the month, and a decision will then be made regarding the brick to be used for this building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His opinion local brick may be favourable.\"\n\nMr. MacBride called at the School this morning about 10:30 a.m. and after securing general information re general layout of School asked where bricks were being, or about to be, used.\n\nI explained that the Town had submitted samples, a local firm, James Johnston & Co., and the Lindsay Brick Co.; that samples had been forwarded to Ottawa and he was awaiting decision.\n\nMr. MacBride stated that he was strongly in favour of the brick supplied by James Johnston & Co., but admitted that he had not examined the bricks manufactured by them since the war.\n\nAt my suggestion Mr. MacBride consented to examine samples also to meet Johnston & Co., and,\n\nAfter inspecting the bricks in his yard, Mr. MacBride strongly expressed his disapproval, describing them as altogether unsuitable for the purpose intended.\n\nMr. MacBride afterwards examined the Lindsay Brick and described it as a much better brick; he however desired to see the 2nd quality Calgary brick; consequently we visited the New Catholic Church built of these bricks, two years ago; he was very favourably impressed by the Calgary bricks and would, I think, like to see them used on the New School.\n\nMr. MacBride requested me to forward the above mentioned telegram and stated his intention of writing to you immediately.\n\nMay I suggest, for your information, that a good effect can be obtained from the Calgary bricks; failing this, I believe that a pleasing effect can be obtained by using Calgary bricks as headers and Paddy brick as stretcher, at low cost.\n\nYours obedient servant\n\nW.H.

Messrs. Johnston & Co., Kamloops brickyard.\nB. The Dudley Brick Co., Dudley.\n\nA. The sample marked A, or the local bricks, show a hard well burnt brick, with good ring, but uneven in shape and colour. The bricks in question are bad and would give a very unsatisfactory appearance where used as headers, in heading (every fourth or fifth) corners, window and door openings, piers, etc.\n\nIt is very questionable if these bricks, being up with the recessed joint as specified, would give the desired appearance.\n\nThe Rev. Father McQuaid is particularly charmed with these bricks, and considers their non-descript appearance altogether out of keeping with the design in general and the granite features in particular.\n\nI have inspected the bricks in the yard and doubt that the samples submitted could be held up to.\n\nMessrs. Johnston & Co., however, assure me that they are now burning, or about to bury bricks which will, in every way, be superior to the bricks in stock, particularly with the ends of bricks show improvement.\n\nOn this point however I am unable to express an opinion.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\"B\" The sample marked \"B\" or the Budeby brick is not too well burnt, and has only a moderately good ring, the cuts too are poor and have the same objection as Sample A when used as headers.\n\nOtherwise these bricks are good, and as they tend towards a deeper or darker red, with exposure, the colour in all that could be cleaned.\n\nOpinions differ as to the weathering qualities of this brick, the majority being favourable.\n\nLayed up with a recessed joint they look fairly well, strictly providing the good bricks are selected and the softer bricks say the light coloured ones, are used for internal walling where no very great strength is required.\n\nMany favourable appearances have been obtained by using these bricks as stretchers and a No. 2 quality of Calgary bricks as headers.\n\nComparative Cost. Both Messrs. Johnston & Co. and the Budeby Brick Co. are anxious to supply the bricks for this building and the prices quoted for delivery on the site, as I believe, the same in each case to be $2.50 per thousand.\n\nWill you please let me have a decision as soon as possible, in order to allow advantage being taken of remaining good weather.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Regarding the power saw, please state what power equipment the Principal intends to use in running the saw. Please obtain prices from a number of dealers for the supplying of the saw and the power equipment necessary to run the same, if the latter is required. You should submit the prices, together with any recommendation you care to make, for the consideration of the Department.\n\nRegarding the fencing of a portion of the Indian Reserve, kindly state whether, if this were done, the Indians of the Band would approve of the same being cut off from their Reserve and used for the purpose for which it is desired by the Principal. We note that the Chief, in a letter to the Principal, appears to be in favour of the fencing, but we wish to be assured before authorizing the work that the majority of the Indians will also give their consent. Please state approximately the cost of the 10 spools of barb wire and the keg of staples asked for.\n\nAs soon as we have the above information we will be in a position to decide as to whether the expenditure required can be met or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The price of wood, seven dollars a cord, is for us prohibitive. So far, the Northern Construction gave us yearly some sixty cords of slab wood for our burners or heaters. That mill is now gone, so that we must seek elsewhere. The Provincial Government accorded us a free use grant of forty acres on the North Thompson at the Twenty-five Mile House. Last week the Foreman and some six or seven boys put about three hundred logs on the skidway. It is for the cutting of this wood into stove lengths that we ask the power saw, as it must be cut before we load it on the train, and we prefer the men to cut it rather than the boys who at that distance from home would lose more class than we care to permit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Dallin)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nCOPY.\n\nIndustrial School,\nKamloops, B.C., Feb. 9, 1924.\n\nRe Pasture.\n\nDear Mr. Dallin:\n\nThe pasture on the School land is hardly sufficient for the dairy cows. For our beef cattle, no provision has ever been made. It is to the interest of both school and Indians that a somewhat permanent provision be made.\n\nFor the last three years we have been using as you know, the Indian Reserve at Adams Lake which belongs to the Chase Band. It is forty five miles from here and the Range is not fenced. There are serious disadvantages, but it has the great advantage of being a good range and of being isolated.\n\nIt is not necessary to fence the entire reserve, but the Chief, Etienne, the Indians and I, as you can glean from the enclosed letter from the Chief, request you to ask the Department for about ten spools of barb wire and a keg of staples to fence a small portion of Adams River and Cold Creek to prevent the cattle from going down on Squilax Reserve, and a small portion of the Reserve to protect two or three Indian holdings.\n\nThe Indians, the Chief and I have had much trouble over this difficulty; but we have all recognized that it was a difficulty which could easily be removed, hence our request.\n\nMight I ask the Agent to insist through the Chief, upon the exclusion from the Range of all but purebred sires.\n\nWith best wishes, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. W.C. Dallin,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nShuswap, B.C., January 31st., 1924.\n\nRev. Father James McGuire,\nIndustrial School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Father:\n\nI received your letter of the 28th of January. Well, I was thinking that it would take about ten balls of barb wire to fence that place. You know that fence from Cold Creek. I think we will move this fence from the River fencing it above the road. We will fence in Mrs. Anthony's place and then lead on to, till we come to Custa William's place, then we follow Gusta William's fence into the Lake, and Joe's place will be place the same, but they will have to watch their own gates. We will have our fence gates at Goosta's place.\n\nThat's all. 10 lbs. Staples.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Etienne Narcisse,\nChief.\n\nP.S. I'll tell you when to start fencing up there. I kind of think it's too early in March.\n\n15 lbs. Staples.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Feb. 26, 1924.\n\nW. H. Maculay, Esq.,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nSend me details of material and labour included in certificate number three.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nChg. Indian Affairs.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Kanada, Dec. 1924\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\n\"Kamloops Indian Residential School\"\n\nKenneth Macaulay, Architect, Calgary,\nNo. 3, in favour of Mr. Thomas Carson\nContractor for the above mentioned building\nfor an amount of Six Thousand Four Hundred\nand four dollars the Day 8th Nov. 1924.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nKenneth Macaulay\nArchitect of Government\nOttawa, Feb. 28, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Macaulay:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, also your sketches for the boys' and girls' wings.\n\nAs far as the general lay out, as shown on your sketches, I am of the opinion that it should meet the requirements very well. There is one point, however, and that is the arrangement of the plumbing fixtures in the basement of the girls' wing. I may say that I am confining myself to the girls' wing at present, as if money is provided at the coming session of Parliament it will be for the girls' wing only this year. I think it would be very much better if it were possible to keep the wash basins away from the wall as the continual splashing of water, when these basins are in use, tends to keep the wall in a damp condition. If the Sisters require as many basins as shown on your sketch, it will certainly be impossible for the Department to provide individual lavatory basins, and we will have to follow the style used in some of the other schools, that is of providing a long table, covered with zinc with a water trough in the centre. On this table the pupils will use individual wash basins. A certain number of taps for hot and cold water will be installed at different places along the table.\n\nAs for the baths there are a great many more baths shown on your sketch than we generally provide. I am returning the sketches, under separate cover, and would ask you to please consult with Rev. Father McGuire, and see if it is not possible to rearrange the plumbing fixtures in the basement.\n\nI would also ask you to please let me have a rough section showing the location of the proposed laundry under the girls' recreation rooms. I would like to have this information as soon as possible in order that the plans can be prepared, and if money is provided for the work, there will be no delay in inviting tenders.\n\nPlease ...... P\nPlease advise me the total number of girls that accommodation should be provided for. In figuring the dormitories accommodation of five hundred cubic feet is required for each pupil, and the ceilings will be eleven feet high.\n\nYou have not sent a sketch showing the top floor of the wing, in which I have shown, on the sketches submitted to Reverend Father McGuire, the dormitory accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nW. H. Macauley, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nP. O. Box 453, Kamloops, B.C.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nR. Murray, Secy\nOttawa\n\nOctober, Kamloops 14th Oct. 1924\n\nSir,\n\nUnder a separate cover I am forwarding an arrangement sketch plan of the wings of above building. The said plan represent as far as I am capable for me to ascertain the requirements of the Rev. Father McGurk and the Chiefs in general; they may perhaps be regarded as the essential features of the accommodation they deem necessary.\n\nSome difficulty has been experienced in arriving at sketches submitted, in an endeavor to convey the expressed requirements, within the bounds of a practical solution. The latter demands, in some instances being somewhat abnormal; hence the delay.\n\nA sketch will be immediately dispatched, arrived from Victoria on Monday next, in response to a telegraphic message from the Rev. McGurk, and with the assistance all understanding difficulties have quickly been overcome.\n\nThe Chiefs are now satisfied that, with the exception of certain minor requirements as to way of fittings, the sketches submitted adequately represent their requirements.\n\nThe Rev. Father McGurk is therefore perfectly satisfied with the arrangement of the Chief's Wing subject only to details in the way of fittings etc.\n\nIn reference to the matter of land being shown, I would point out the opinion is unanimous and the point undoubtedly contended, that so long as an undesirable minimum, consequently believing that the best of...\nOctober,\n\nIn regard to the proposal to allow the Department to proceed with the adoption of the Old Country Plan into idea with ordinary white painted houses. This idea has been readily accepted by the Hon. Mr. Murray and the Acting.\n\nGenerally they desire, but built of white glazed bricks, wooden board to project far enough to form a shelf for their books. In the dining room rail, window shelf to serve as towel rail, well between window board and back to have fixed mirrored plate glass approx 14' deep.\n\nA better will obviate the necessity of the usual mirror.\n\nThe question of lighting fixtures was raised, but not decided. As I thought, it better to keep the matter in abeyance until you had considered the suggested designs; the question of other or wall lamps would then be decided together with the window sash, the prevailing idea here, so that there should be provided for each floor.\n\nThe skeleton will likewise convey a fairly accurate idea as to what the Principal and Master desire; it would perhaps be advisable to postpone discussion of details until you have examined the scheme submitted and decided to what extent it is acceptable.\n\nIf you will notify me as to decision I will prepare and forward rough sketches of the various details in the way of fittings etc. It is desired to have everything in harmony with the proposed design.\n\nI hope the information supplied will be of assistance. Such has been somewhat difficult to complete, but has the merit of being a correct interpretation of the requirements outlined by the Governor General.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 382-5, part 3)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo the Secretary\nOttawa, Kanata, Ont.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nR\n\nSir:\n\nRe: New Residential Indian School, Kanata\n\nIn reference to the above building, I have to report as follows:\n\nSince my last report for the ground and dry weather has been generally good, building operations have commenced on 1st February. Certain portions have been laid off and work is proceeding.\n\nThe brickwork, doors, windows, and walls are progressing well. The construction appears to be proceeding at a good pace.\n\nThe chapel portion will be ready for ground floor shortly, and the story portion including kitchen, store, and dairy (old laundry portion) ready for roof by the end of May.\n\nAll materials except granite are arriving on the site satisfactorily, and further progress expected in the course of the next few days.\n\nAll sketches for new wings showing local requirements have been completed, approved, and forwarded to the Department under separate cover.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours obediently,\n[Signature]\nW.H.

Again from samples submitted to them from all over the United States, the product from this quarry was accepted against all others for the roofing of the Navy Yard Buildings at Mare Island, California.\n\nAt present writing, we regret we are not yet prepared to quote you a figure on the supply of the material necessary for the roofing of the above mentioned building, but if the suggested substitution should meet with the approval of your Department, we shall be pleased to do so in the course of a few weeks.\n\nWe shall appreciate the favour of your reply in due course and beg to thank you in anticipation.\n\nD.

In reply I have to authorize you to purchase from Wilcox-Hall Co., Ltd., a \"Wee MacGregor\" Standard Drag Saw with Clutch. I have noted that the price is $234, less 10% for cash. Their account, in duplicate for $210.60 should be certified by you and submitted to Ottawa for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Hallin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of Department letter of the 26th ultimo, file 154-0-5, and in reply enclose quotations of prices of power saws, for which the Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School has made requisition.\n\nThe \"Wade\" and \"Wee MacGregor\" saws are constructed with gasoline tank and motor from which it derives its operating power.\n\nI am advised by the Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School that he has obtained a permit from the Provincial Forestry Department to cut timber for firewood at a point some miles distant from the School. The cutting of this timber on ground into the required lengths for fire by one of the above mentioned saws would be of great assistance and would be the means of saving a number of pupils having to proceed to the point in question to cut the wood by hand.\n\nAs there are not a sufficient number of pupils old enough or big enough to be entrusted with the dangerous task of hauling the logs to the school grounds, I would recommend that the Department give the requisition made by the Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, for the purchase of one of the above mentioned saws, its favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Wm. C. Dallin)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nTHE MODEL \"B\" WADE DRAG SAW WITH DISC CLUTCH\n\nWe have always said that when a better drag saw was built, WADE would build it. Our Model B WADE is a better drag saw and we are proud to have built it. We could have put a clutch on our drag saw long ago, but we would have been just like the rest. All WADE only builds drag saws that ARE better.\n\nAll of the many practical features which have made the 122 Model WADE famous, such as the V-shaped narrow wheel barrow frame and brake tire, the automatic lubricating system, positive dogging arrangement, simple speed control, quick detachable saw blade, double freeze water drain, primed spark plug, high-tension ignition system, have been incorporated in the Model B WADE with the addition of our multiple disc clutch.\n\n\"Motor Idles\"\n\nWith a Model B WADE it is possible to run your motor independently of the saw blade. When lever is in a forward position the motor operates but the saw blade remains stationary. Motor can be run for hours without stopping. Pulling the lever back toward the operator sets the saw blade to work again, making the saw operate just as it had meant to do when the clutch was engaged. This is what makes the WADE clutch drag saw so popular among lumber cutters throughout the United States. No more tie-ups while threading the saw blade from a tight log. With it threaded the saw blade is easily controlled and more makes an easier, faster cut. The clutch is also efficient in cutting unit. The clutch holds the wood against the saw, preventing it from slipping. The appliance strongly to farmers on account of their being able to use their tractors or other for running a feed grinder, grain separator, or pump, etc., after their winter's wood supply is cut.\n\nA Multiple Disc Clutch Built for Service\n\nFour steel discs do the work on the Model B WADE and are so designed and constructed that they will last the life of the saw itself. No wear on the discs when the saw is idling. It has friction bands or linings to wear out first. The discs require no oiling whatsoever, not even oil. Keeping them well lubricated assures an easy turning, steady, reliable clutch.\n\nSIMPLE\u2014PRACTICAL\u2014EFFICIENT. Built to last.\n\nNever Slips\u2014Trouble Proof\n\nThe WADE Disc Clutch can never slip nor stick for any reason. With proper adjustment, provided for by the means of taking up possible wear, simply tightening or loosening lock nuts on the end of the shaft prevents slipping from occurring or sudden release should the occasion arise. Spring centered release automatically throws off clutch without damaging machine should saw blade become pinched in log.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWade Service Only Begins When You Buy Your Wade Saw\n\nPERHAPS one of the reasons for the success of the WADE SAW all over the world is the interest that this old established house takes in its customers. R. M. Wade & Company, as well as all WADE dealers, stand squarely back of the WADE SAW. YOU must be satisfied\u2014that is the first consideration. THE WADE must live up to its reputation, by giving you the same perfect service that it is giving to thousands of other satisfied users.\n\nLOOK at its lubrication system, for instance. The action of the motor keeps a constant oil vapor bath on all inside working parts under nine pounds pressure. All outside working parts are lubricated by large grease cups. The thorough and correct system of lubrication means long life for the WADE.\n\nThree-point support\u2014two points on the log and a locking wheel, rigid on the ground. Saw automatically lines up with log, regardless of ground conditions. As easy to move as a wheel barrow. As solid and firm in operation as a rock!\n\nTHE WADE is EASY STARTING. A high-grade Champion automobile PRIMING SPARK PLUG is regular equipment. The famous WADE Columbia Hot-Shot Waterproof Battery furnishes the spark. No single dry cells used. Starts easily and surely in hot or cold weather.\n\nA Power Pulley can be furnished for a slight additional cost. Its powerful, valveless motor will supply adequate power for all light farm work.\n\nBUY A WADE\n\nTHE PRACTICAL ONE-MAN MACHINE FOR WOOD SAWING AND LIGHT FARM POWER WORK\nN.S.

By Beaver Boarding your rooms you give them additional stability as well as a more attractive appearance.\n\nWith Beaver Board the result obtained is surpassingly pleasing and artistic. The paneling may be subdued or prominent. The paint decoration may be elaborate or modest. In any event, the finished effect will convey a distinct impression of originality and good taste.\n\nBeaver Board transforms the walls and ceilings of a room from blank but necessary nonentities into decorative factors which add character and distinction to the entire surroundings\u2014and this is true of the office, store or other business building as well as the home.\n\nYet Beaver Board is not merely artistic\u2014it is also the most practical of all wall and ceiling materials since it is crack-proof, jar-proof, and permanently fall-proof. It is always repair-free, clean and sanitary, and adds genuine comfort to the home as it alike repels the severe coldness of winter and the scorching heat of summer.\nWhat Beaver Board Is.\n\nBeaver Board is manufactured lumber. That is, logs from the spruce forests of Northern Canada are ground into pure wood fibres which are built up by continuous pressure in presses. The result is large knotholes and crackless boards. These boards are 1/4 of an inch in thickness and made in widths of 32 and 48 inches and lengths of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16 feet.\n\nThe boards are treated by a process of heat to kill drying out, then both the front and back of the board receive the patented \"Seal-tite\" sizing treatment. This treatment gives a double coating to the back so that when the board is applied, and the finish coat is put on, both are equally covered. Thus the board is protected against those seasonal or climatic changes of moisture or humidity which might otherwise cause warping or bulging.\n\nFor Old or New Walls.\n\nThe quick, orderly, clean way in which Beaver Board is applied is in marked contrast to the laborious work of a lathed and plastered room. And this is just as true when repainting, altering or remodeling. New can be constructed. In new work the boards are nailed direct to studding and joints. In remodeling the boards are placed right over the present walls whether plaster, concrete, brick or wood.\n\nImmediately after they are nailed in place, the boards are painted with any paint you may desire to make a fine. Then the decorative effect is completed and the room made ready for immediate occupancy by applying decorative wood trim over the panel intersections.\n\nYour Use for Beaver Board.\n\nYou will find it worth while to know what Beaver Board will do for you in whatever work you have on hand\u2014building or repairing; making additions or alterations; finishing rooms; or the utilization of waste space in attic, basement or other unused rooms.\n\nTell us about your plans and we will arrange to have the Beaver Board Department of Design and Decoration prepare, without charge, a complete design for your individual room and furnish a detailed list of all necessary material. By taking advantage of this service, Beaver Board will do for you before you go ahead with the work.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo The Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nNew Indian Residential School, Kamloops.\n\nIn accordance with instructions from Mr. Orr, the following detailed Estimates have been obtained from the Contractor Mr. Chen Company.

There has been practically no difficulty. We ourselves were slow in sending a criticism of the first plans. It was plain ignorance on our part of how to do it properly. When Mr. Macaulay, who is himself an architect, was appointed, the difficulty melted. His presence has obviated a thousand difficulties. I hope you may see fit to retain his services.\n\nThe contractor deserves much credit. He observes the eleventh commandment; he minds his own business. You know how we appreciate this; the children never go near the men; they never come near us, though they are working under our roofs. By the way, both he and the subcontractors often compliment us on the good conduct of our children.\n\nThe building has a good appearance. This fact removes much miserable comment. All public men point to it with pride. It improved the community; it created a good spirit. Here, where so many visitors congregate, adverse criticism would do much damage; the present structure rebounds to the credit of our Department. It is easy to feel the interest it created in the city.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nDr. D.C.

Several heavy rains have provided quite a good test for the roofing.\n\nNo brick work during this period except on the Clayed Packer in Kitchen. This work was suspended owing to lack of bull wood bricks; some of the defects complained of in connection with this work have been rectified, if not still however unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Bricks work complained of is still as reported. The Contractor for this work apparently has made no effort to replace the defective work or materials. However, the contractor, has I believe, strongly urged the necessity of this work being replaced as soon as possible.\n\nThe Board Room also all single roofs are practically complete, this includes flanking. Consequently the building is now weatherproof.\n\nThe plastering is a fair job only, the two upper floors are complete and the basement well advanced.\n\nThe Carpenter are doing their best work in proceeding satisfactorily.\n\nThe Masons are working on the framing coat.\n\nI am faithfully,\n\nR.M.

I am most willing to undertake this instruction and hope you approve.\n\nThank you for reply to my letter of the 14th, which duly arrived on the morning of the 20th.\n\nIn reference to the telegram enclosed, I am instructed that in view of the fact that I am endeavoring to compel the Contractor to live up to the specifications, it is rather important that the Department affords him no opportunity for complaint, real or imaginary; it therefore appeared advisable to send the telegram referred to.\n\nIn conclusion, however, enclosed, I am asking for interpretations etc., of certain items in the Specifications and should be glad if Mr. Orr could join me with the necessary information as soon as convenient.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.

The local municipal lighting company have condemned the line and will not permit their employees to work thereon.\n\nThis line was built some years ago, the Department supplying the material and the labour was performed by the staff of the school. The defects are as follows:\n\nCertain poles principally on the river crossing require replacing, and the construction of the cross arms is defective.\n\nThe wires are of soft drawn copper instead of hard drawn copper, consequently sagging is general.\n\nThe spacing of wires is incorrect, and fails to comply with the Government Regulations.\n\nMr. Macaulay has taken the question of repairs up with the Public Utilities Department of the City of Kamloops and they are prepared to put this power line from the city to the School in a good condition, and will charge only the actual cost of the work. The cost of the work will be approximately $865.00, and I beg to recommend that Mr. Macaulay be authorized to have the power line put in good condition by the Utility Department of the city of Kamloops.\n\nArchitect.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nReverend Father McGuire is very anxious to have an outside bell installed in connection with the new Kamloops School.\n\nSpace can be found for this bell in the belfry built on the roof, and the cost will be approximately $100.00.\n\nI would recommend that the contractors be authorized to install the bell, as I believe it would be of great assistance to Reverend Father McGuire in regulating the hours at the School.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, June 14, 1924.\n\nSir:-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the work on the new Kamloops School, I beg to say that I have noted your remarks with reference to the quality of the granite being furnished by the contractor. The Department approves of the action you have taken and you should inform the contractor that no future payment will be considered on his contract until the quality of the granite has been brought up to meet with your approval. I also approve of your action in not accepting the glazed brick work in the kitchen.\n\nWith reference to the colour for the finishing of the wood work external and internal, I would be glad to have your recommendations after consulting with Reverend Father McGuire.\n\nWith reference to the window in the front of gable, I approve of your action in having a window placed here to allow light and air in the attic.\n\nWith reference to the installing of a bell I will advise you in the course of a day or so regarding this item.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Macaulay,\nInspector of Construction.\nSir,\n\nAs stated in my report covering the latter half of May, I have submitted a report dealing with items on which information is urgently required, as follows:\n\nContractor: From the copy of my letter to the Contractor, forwarded with my reply to your request, it is obvious that I am far from satisfied with the granite supplied.\n\nThe quality is decidedly inferior, and the workmanship defective; the granite is badly stained, contains a large proportion of knots, unevenly shipped, broken and cracked, has been pitched, polished, and filled, and generally the composition is such as to strongly indicate cutting from builders.\n\nIn addition, some of the blocks sent are anything but satisfactory.\n\nI feel it necessary to complain to the Contractor about the quality of the granite supplied many times during the past three months as referred to in some of my reports to the Department.\n\nThe last shipment of granite was such that I was forced to refuse acceptance of same, and inform the Contractor that no certificate would be issued by me in connection with same.\n\nOn the last certificate issued by me, No. 57, forwarded to the Department on the 2nd of June, I made up a deduction of approx. $2,500 on account of the defectuous granite complained of.\n\nThe Contractor, failing, despite what he claims, to take any action, I should be pleased to learn exactly what view the Department is likely to take of the matter.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ........................................... 192\n\nAnd request of possible suspension of approval,\nor otherwise, of the action taken.\n\nBrushed Brickwork in Kitchen. The letter enclosed\nwith my last report gives the necessary information.\n\nExpanded Metal Lath. My letter is fairly clear, I\nbelieve, but it seems to state that a mistake occurred\nand by adhering strictly to the specification it was\nexpected to delay the completion at least one month.\n\nGalvanized Iron Gutters. Some little difference of\nopinion as to the exact requirements of the specification\nhas occurred. I hope however to get this matter\nsatisfactorily adjusted in the course of a day or so.\n\nVentilation to Chapel Roof. I have instructed the\nContractor to trim ceiling 2-0 x 2-0 for ventilators,\ntwo in number. This will allow plenty of ventilation desired.\n\nShipplaps for facing Metal Buildings. These items were probably\noverlooked, as no mention of same can be found in the\nspecification, in any case, a No. 2 quality has been\nspecified as the assumption that it might normally be\ninterpreted as necessary for good construction.\n\nShingle Stairs to Roof. Nothing is specified, is it the\nintention of the Department to omit; may I suggest that\nthis matter be considered.\n\nColumns for finishing woodwork external & internal.\n\nWill you please advise me as to the various columns\ndesired.\n\nStair. This has been arranged in accordance with\nMr. Oron's telegram, viz., the Office door retained on\nthe Landing.\n\nWindows & Front Gables. I have had the brickwork\nto the blind windows in Gable left out, this is the\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, 192\n\nI have opportunity for getting light and air into the Office, should I not be better to put in a window or small metal wire screen.\n\nBells Electric. The bell only is specified, I have made provision for two, one from each staff. Dining Room; these are of course in addition to Bells from Front & Side Entrance Door.\n\nBell Co. per request from Rev. Father McGuire I have obtained an estimate for the installation of a Bell in the Cupola, the Contractor's price for this work is $115.00. The bell is 24\" and costs $57.00 F.O.B Vancouver, leaving $58.00 for materials, fixing and freight. Will you please advise me as to acceptance.\n\nThe Cupola offers more facilities than a bell, so over Chapels, have included provision for rope being brought down into dining through conduit, which, with very slow hands, will I think be quite satisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.J.G. Macaulay\nInspector of Hospitals\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| May 31 | In Services rendered in connection with duties pertaining to Inspector of Contractuals for the above building May 17th, 24th, 31st, June 5th, 10th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 26th, 28th, 31st inclusive, viz: 25 days at $6.00 per day $150.00 24 meals at 25 cents each $6.00 | $156.00 |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF May 1924\n\n1.

Many times during the past three months, the expected improvement has not materialized, in fact, the standard has deteriorated; the last shipment received decidedly inferior and defective.\n\nConsequently, in confirmation of my verbal instructions, the setting of this or any defective granite is entirely at your own risk, as it is quite impossible for me to accept same.\n\nAs pointed out, the granite has obviously been cut from Boulder and includes most of the joints, associated with defective granite; in addition to which the setting on many of the stones is decidedly faulty.\n\nIt certainly should not be necessary to lose 5% points for the class of work specified.\n\nThe steps to chapel buttresses, as pointed out, are improperly cut and will have to be rectified.\n\nI am reporting this matter to the Department and shall advise that no further payment is made in respect of the granite work complained of.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nMr. Owen Carson\nContractor\nKamloops, BC\n\nOttawa, 27th May 1924\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\"New Indian Residential School Kamloops BC\"\n\"Referring Plaster Work in Kitchen\"\n\nI respectfully inform you on the 25th and\nthe 26th inst., the plaster work in the kitchen\nis not satisfactory and cannot be accepted until\nthe defects complained of are rectified.\n\nThe joints are out of line and a spot of the\nangle blocks being untrue, a much better job was\npossible, and will be required.\n\nThe horizontal joints are out of line, in certain\nspots they are actually wrong, the stumps are\nnot plumbed, and the work generally will not stand\nthe application of a straight edge.\n\nThe specification requires a first class\njob and I most request you to take such\nsteps as will ensure same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nP.O.

The weather has been favourable and work has proceeded without interruption.\n\nWith the exception of chimneys and gates to chapel, all brickwork of foundation and superstructure is complete.\n\nThe granite in forming a basement course of stonework is nearly completed. The quality is not too hard and it has been compelled to be used.\n\nThe carpenter work is well advanced. The main roof is ready for shingling and the flat roofs for the dormitories.\n\nThe doors from the basement are ready for installation.\n\nThe heating main and plumbing are being installed.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining the necessary for sanitary purposes, due to the lack of skilled labour, is being overcome by the use of imported labour.\n\nThe difficulties in connection with the electric lighting installation are being met by a separate lighting system.\n\nThe system serves both the administration, for which reason I assume the responsibility to report.\n\nThese were investigated, and it is anticipated that foreign funds will be forwarded in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNew Indian Residential School, Kamloops B.C.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nReference No. OM letter 154-0-53 dated April 9, 1924\n\nEnclosed herewith I am submitting for your consideration a letter from The Manager, Public Works Department of Kamloops giving estimated costs of making good the main supply line.\n\nI note approval of the various suggestions made in my letter of 2nd April, but would point out that these changes cannot be effected without incurring extra expenditure. I do not anticipate more than a nominal additional cost, some however cannot be avoided. The Specification and Drawings make no provision for connecting up the two wings and this work can be executed now with a minimum expenditure and also obviate cutting and patching of the present building. The Sub-Contractor for Electric Installation is expected in Kamloops in the near future, I will inform him at once as possible and report further on this subject.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.

H.

The existing telephone wire would also be used on the new line. #6 copper wire would be substituted for the old wire and the whole line built up to the requirements of the\nProvincial authorities.\n\nThe present line could be remodeled by rebuilding the river crossing, replacing the old cross-arms with new ones of the proper spacing, and substituting #6 copper wire, for about $643.00.\n\nThis estimate however does not include the cost of any new poles which may be required along the line.\n\nIf this is not all quite clear to you I will be in the office Tuesday morning and will be very glad to go further into the subject if necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF April\n\n1.

It is noted that in the estimate submitted by you some time ago for this work, the cost of the changes in the roof, and the providing of metal ceiling would be approximately $550; but by amending your sketch it would be possible to reduce the cost to the above mentioned amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The Department is opposed to extra expense.\n\nThese two views, Doctor, are not irreconcilable. I wish the architect to change the style of roof. He can do so easily and not incur more expense.\n\nI would ask him to omit everything concerning sacristy, sanctuary, altar, railing and burlap. After all we must put in these things together with the pews when the contractor is finished. And we are content to do so. Is it such a huge undertaking while doing these things to put on something in place of the burlap or add something to the ceiling?\n\nYou would give me much relief if you could give me an affirmative reply by wire and have Mr. Orr sent instructions at his convenience to Mr. Macaulay.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McEwan, O.M.S.\n\nDr. D.

I can only suggest that the items comprising the same may be discarded together with the Dunlop plans be cancelled and the money saved expended in the provision of a ceiling.\n\nThe roof has shown at Drawings does not lend itself to economical heating and I doubt that the academic proposition will be satisfactory still as before mentioned, whilst at all times willing to assist in obtaining a building satisfactory in every way, my duties do not include changes in design or plan arrangements; rightly or wrongly I shall continue to draw the attention of the Department to any plan considered by me defective or unsuitable further than this however I am not disposed to go.\n\nAny alterations or amendments must at all times be made by the Architect to the Department together with the necessary constructional details.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.H.

I note your remarks with reference to its present condition, and would ask you to please report to the Department the approximate cost of putting this line in a condition satisfactory to the local lighting company. Also advise me if the local company are prepared to contribute anything towards the overhauling of the line.\n\nWith reference to the wiring of the interior of the building, in specifying the three wire system consideration was given to the use of motors, etc., but in view of your suggestion that all motors be connected on a separate line, I am quite agreeable to having the wiring done on the two wire system. I also approve of using a sub-divided main system as suggested in your letter.\n\nWith reference to the clause in the specifications governing the number of watts per circuit, I would say that this is in accordance with the Rules and Regulations covering such work in this province and in other provinces in the Dominion, but it will be satisfactory to me, however, if the circuits are arranged in accordance with the rules and regulations covering this work in the Province of British Columbia, and with the approval of the local electric lighting company and inspectors.\n\nIn approving of these changes in the wiring it is of course understood that no extra cost will be entailed.\n\n......With\nMr. MacAulay ........

The Local Municipal Authorities have condemned the line and will not permit their employees to work therein.\n\nGenerally the defects are as follows:\n\n1. Certain poles, particularly at the River Crossing require replacing and the construction of new towers etc. is defective.\n2. The wires are of soft drawn copper instead of hard drawn copper, consequently sagging in general.\n3. The spacing of wires is incorrect and fails to comply with the Government Regulations.\n\nMr. Davis, Manager of the Local Municipal Utilities may be depended upon to give any possible assistance and will, no doubt, co-operate with the Department in the adjustment of this Matter.\n\nSystem of Wiring. The Specification calls for a three wire system and whilst admitting certain advantages confined to this system, I beg to point out that same is regarded by the Local Municipal Authorities with considerable\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nConcerning the three wire system in a regular three wire system, the connecting up of a three wire system is considered unnecessarily inconvenient.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe existing Power line supplies current for the motor in use at the pumping plant. However, it is self-contained with separate motor etc. Accordingly, I would suggest that all motors installed in the new building be connected up with this existing power line and maintained as a separate installation. This system would obviate the necessity of buying to the building a new direct board circuit for purposes other than the lighting system.\n\nSpecification of Electric wiring. I am somewhat inclined as to exactly what method of installation you desire. The specification is somewhat formal in character, and though wide in scope, it appears to me, to the type of building in question, is rather indefinite. So before concluding, the three wire system is not favorably regarded by the local municipal authorities, and under the circumstances, it would, I believe, be wise to revert to the two wire system.\n\nAssuming that your decision will be in favor of the two wire system, the plan devised (1) The tree or single main system, or (2) The subdivided main system.\n\nThe three wire system specified could of course have been applied on lines connected analogous to the two two-wire systems above mentioned.\n\nThe Specification under \"Clause 9. Arrangement of Duddes\" calls for \"The wiring on each floor must start from one central point of distribution.\" From this we naturally infer that the general distribution is by \"Floor.\" In this case it would be necessary...\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nNecessary to include at each floor level, provision for extending the wiring to both the Boys' and the Girls' wings. The Specification makes no provision for this work rather than the general layout of the building lend itself to such an arrangement.\n\nMay I suggest that the general system of distribution be \"Black\" instead of \"Povesh\" and that the Subdivided Main System be adopted.\n\nThe Small Store Room to the right of corridor, leading to chapel, could be arranged somewhat, and a portion thereof utilized as a lock up room for electrical services, affording a convenient centre of distribution, and a safe suitable place for the installation of cabinet main switch distribution Board etc.\n\nThe Service Mains to be brought to the Main Switch Board and subdivided as follows:\n\nFeeder of the necessary capacity to be carried in conduit to both the Boys' and Girls' wings on this (ground) floor level and connected up with a Subsidiary Distribution Board at convenient point to be arranged. So far this arrangement has provided a Main Distributing Board in the Centre or Administrative Block and a Subsidiary Distributing Board in each wing.\n\nDraw these three principal centres of distribution wiring to be carried to minor distribution Boards conveniently located on each floor (as required by present Specification).\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nThis system would I believe give a very satisfactory installation and afford excellent facilities for testing purposes, faults would be easy to locate and the cost of repair consequently reduced.\n\nThe decision to the wings would of course be a matter for later consideration, the necessary conduct of adequate pipe should however be included and placed in position under this contract.\n\nSee Specification Page 66 Clause 6. CAPACITY.\n\nI believe the old time regulation confining any set of lamps to 660 watts has been definitely abolished, may I delete this clause from the specification.\n\nMr. Macdonald, the Provincial Authority, has requested that an electrical fire alarm system be installed, details of this and any other requirements he may submit will be forwarded for your consideration in due course, at present exact details are not available.\n\nMay I request that you favour me with the necessary instructions as quickly as possible, as the building is now being pushed ahead.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\n\nProgress Report Covering Period 15th to 31st March\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Honorable\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nThe weather during the past fifteen days has been favourable for building operations and the work has, as far as possible, been pushed ahead. Delay in arrival of granite caused a lay off for Masons on the 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th.\n\nThe Sixth Elevator has been carried up to an average height of 14'-0\" from the finished grade line. The Dining & Store are ready for occupying whilst the Chapel Block is held up, at chapel floor level, owing to non-arrival of granite.\n\nAll important work is well advanced of the Brick work.\n\nThe Plumbing & Heating is progressing as rapidly as the building will permit; the work under this heading is very satisfactory indeed.\n\nElectric. The Sixth Elevator worked, with Assistant, from 24th to 29th. This work is held up pending decision and instructions. Please see letter herewith enclosed addressed to Mr. Orr.\n\nThe Oak Concrete floors are being laid in the Elevator, including polished floor ready for Martin's Dining Room & First Dining Room.\n\nThe quality of work has improved but the quality of Brick work is still more or less unsatisfactory.\n\nDuring present month I shall arrange for a number of Photos, these will perhaps more readily convey an idea as to the general progress.\n\nA Certificate in favour of the Contractor was forwarded to the Department 25th March.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.

Macaulay\nInspector of Construction.\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\nMonth End Report.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nAugust 1st, 1924\n\nTo the Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have to report as follows:\n\nDuring the past fifteen days work has proceeded fairly satisfactorily and the building is hopefully nearing completion.\n\nThe plasterwork is in a way complete but as I submitted to previous reports, this work is not satisfactory; many patches have been cut out and repatched and the paint is not as good as it should be; I informed the contractor today and propose following this up with a formal request to strip and replace certain portions of walling.\n\nThis work is proceeding satisfactorily, all trim is in place and the hardwood floors are being put down.\n\nPlumbing & Heating: The work too, is satisfactory, the plumbing fixtures are in place and practically all piping, supply and return, is in position, together with most of the radiation. The boiler with most of the fittings are connected up and the pumps so will have placed in position.\n\nElectrical: This work is now ready for running the wires on the various circuits. Contractor is very anxious to receive the fixtures (please see page 69) (see) are supplied by the Department but charged by the contractor, I have already referred to this, and should be glad to receive information as to when these fixtures may be expected.\n\nPower & Light Lines: This work is being satisfactorily carried out and without incurring extra expenditure, have arranged for (with Mr. Fraser) a general cleaning out of the plant.\nPower & Light Line, etc.\n\nOf poles at present connecting the yard. The new pole line runs from the new pole immediately adjacent to and North of the Sleeping quarters, the line passing between the New and Old Buildings.\n\nThe pole at the Refrigerator now becomes the main distributing point and will receive the Western Transformer. From this pole a wire will be carried to the Control Board in the New Building for lighting purposes; a second wire will be run direct to the Boiler Room for Power, other power lines will be run to the Pump House and Barn, etc.\n\nGenerally the new layout in addition to being safe and convenient, will convey the impression of being in accordance with up to date practice and system.\n\nFourthly, this Grade is carrying some little worry both to myself and the Contractor, Placid Dunn, the Kamloops Heating and Plumbing Co., are the Sub-contractors, and to me they undoubtedly convey the impression of a very strong tendency to beat the Specifications.\n\nThursday morning it was necessary for me to complain about the metal buildings being erected in the Dormitory floor. This work, both as regards the workmanship, the type of corners, and the absence of margins around the ventilation of the doors, in the case of the four sides of each room; generally the effect produced from these defects is unsightly.\n\nFurther, in reference to the Skylight Ventilators over Kitchens, I have a decision to communicate to the Department, Mr. Orr, refusing deviation from the Specifications in favour of the locally made but decidedly inferior skylight.\n\nThe result is that the firm discontinued work at Noon, on Thursday, and I learn, immediately, that...\nThey propose taking up the matter with Mr. McRea. \nAdvising I am awaiting developments and, failing \nDepartmental orders to the contrary, propose that \nadherence to the line of action taken, as it is both \ntenable and in the best interests of the Building.\n\nNothing has been done, so far as I am aware, about the \nlandowner's request, apparently the contractor is awaiting \na move by the Sub-contractor, the man went up from \nVancouver, by the latter, about ten days ago, as they \nto fix up matter, but eventually admitted that the \ntask was beyond him, and returned to Vancouver.\n\nPainting: This work is satisfactory and well advanced, in \na few days this work will have to be suspended owing to \nthe delay in getting metal ceilings.\n\nDuring Mr. O'Con's visit to Kamloops last year, a somewhat \nmodest layout was authorized; this layout included \nthe provision of a screen partition in the Dining \nRoom, also Cupboards, Pan and shelves etc in the \nNew Store. Should he pleased to secure instructions \nregarding these matters at an early possible date.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Father McGurk, also the Sisters \nSuperior approached me relative to the provision of \ntemporary heating arrangements for the Girls, in the \nRoom allotted for an additional Gallery. Urged that \nRev. Father McGurk to communicate with the Department \nin my authority did not cover this matter.\n\nThe Building will I believe look well, and judging by \nthe condition of most of the rooms during the late spell of \nhot weather, will be both cool in summer and warm in \nwinter. All local comments are favourable.\n\nG. H.

Macalay AGENT\nInspector of Construction\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\n\nReport September 1st\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nP.O. Box 453\n\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nI have to report as follows:\n\nWork has proceeded fairly satisfactorily during the past two weeks and excepting for the plaster work the building is nearly completed.\n\nMasonry. No attempt has been made to replace the defective brickwork. No attempt has been made to repair the defective glazed brick walling in the kitchen.\n\nPlaster work. Apparently no attempt is being made to obtain a finish equal to specifications.\n\nNo work has been done on the metal ceiling, so plaster has been laid on the building during the past month. This work has been suspended temporarily due to the builder's inability to complete his work and certainly he has a considerable loss.\n\nContractors should be asked to secure instructions from the Department in reference to the above trades.\n\nElectrical. All work practically complete.\n\nHeating. Practically complete but cannot be tested until water is laid on.\n\nPlumbing. Practically complete, except the metal fittings above referred to.\n\nPainting. Practically complete except for running the trim and framing fittings. These fittings or features are supplied by Mr. Rappold and I should be pleased to learn when these may be expected.\n\nNew Water Supply Line. This is practically complete and as referred to in a former report. The line has been\nKilnlochpo New Indian Residential School\nProgress Report 1st September\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Kilnlochpo, Oct. 1923\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nbrought to the Refrigerator Plant and a general\ndistribution point established there. This point\nis about 100 feet from the East end of the old\ndistribution pole to which the line was to have been brought, but\nthe advantages were so obvious and outstanding\nthat I gave the necessary instructions for this work\nto be done, and have by consequence of Mr. Brown that we\nchange other than that covered by their Question will\nbe made. New poles have been supplied all along the\nline and the system is now in first class condition.\n\nIn connection with the installation of this new\nelectric power and light line I have given instructions\nfor additional work to the value of $125.00. There\nwas no time for advising the Department in connection\nwith this work as the expenditure of $125.00 was dependent\non this work being done whilst the Municipal Engineer\nwere engaged on this work.\n\nThe work required to completed as tearing out\nthe whole of the old system of poles and wires from\nthe old Transformer pole site and connecting up the\nvarious buildings, barns, shop house etc. with the\nnew distribution poles.\n\nA very important part in connection with\nthis work, in fact what necessitated this work was\nordered without the necessary authority from the Department\nwas the absolute necessity of promptly bringing to an\nend the illegal practice of lighting and fire building\nand the Refrigerator Plant the power supply watered\n& the light supply. This condition has existed for\nmore than a year and of course is quite illegal.\nThe Manager of the City Utilities Department brought this matter formally to my notice and after a somewhat lengthy discussion the matter was satisfactorily settled by the giving in order for the additional work.\n\nYou will note that the work covered by the question given by the Municipal Utilities Department was finished at the Transformer Pole. Consequently this work ordered by me is entirely in addition thereto.\n\nThe result is that a new pole line has been run from the new Distribution Centre to the Barns, and the Pump House and other buildings connected up thereto; no work has been done which was not required under the permanent scheme.\n\nThe Manager of the City Utilities Department whilst admitting that the unfortunate circumstances may prove to increase these charges, clearly indicated that such conditions could not be tolerated and with a view of doing the whole system of light power supply in a permanent and satisfactory basis connected to carry out this work for the sum stated, such amount being strictly the cost of labour and material.\n\nI trust that the action taken will meet with the Department's approval and shall be glad to receive the necessary confirmation.\n\nThis matter I may state has not been referred to the Hon. Mr. Justice Wood Patten who will give advice as to your requirements as further connection therewith.\n\nP.S. Please see separate report.\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nKemalampoo New Indian Residential School\n\nOttawa, August 31st\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nReference: Mr. Maclean\n\nAs stated in my report of the 15th instant, the sub-contractor had arrived on site late and has worked ahead with the work in a satisfactory manner. The above finish caused them quite a little difficulty, but the result is satisfactory and without some little fault.\n\nSome confusion and perplexity was experienced for a time owing to the fact that the sub-contractor had not included the Dining Room floor in his calculations, and as this item represented approximately $1,100.00 I was anticipating some difficulty.\n\nThis matter was eventually satisfactorily settled and the work proceeded with.\n\nAll floors excepting ours are now finished.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nW.

When this is received consideration will be given to this matter.\n\nI note your remarks under a separate letter with reference to sub-contract for the plumbing and heating. At the present time I do not wish to interfere with Mr. Claydon and his subcontractors, but as soon as the heating work is commenced if this firm do not carry out their work in a satisfactory manner, I would ask you to please report same to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the electric lighting fixtures I beg to say that you may purchase the fixtures as outlined in your letter at a cost of $669.16.

Consequently it is essential that the Department make it quite clear as to whether my work is considered sufficiently satisfactory to justify the confidence of the Department.\n\nPersonally I am prepared, even anxious, to meet the wishes of the Department in every respect and should a change be considered, in any way advisable I would suggest that my work terminate on the 15th day of November or a month from the present date.\n\nShould the Department desire me to carry on with this work I find the necessity for me to request an allowance for transportation as, owing to injuries sustained during the late war, the necessary walking, at times, almost impossible.\n\nMay I request an early reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\n\"Girls Wing\"\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nP.

His foreman arrived on Friday the 15th and is now proceeding with the excavation.\n\nI very much regret that the Heating and Plumbing work will probably be sublet to The Kamloops Heating and Plumbing Co., Mr. Clayton informs me that their price is $6000.00 below the prices submitted to him by Mr. Earl Reek, the Subcontractor for the installation of the Heating & Plumbing for the Ladies' Section.\n\nIn the best interests of the building I would very strongly advise that the Department give this matter very serious consideration; as an employee of the Department I take the liberty of suggesting that a strong effort be made to secure the services of Mr. Reek for the installation of the Heating and Plumbing required for the Girls' Wing.\n\nMr. Reek's work has been perfectly satisfactory in every way, and the Department would obtain from him the installation including the minimum expenditure in upkeep or maintenance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nM.W.

For instance:\n\n(a) The metal flues to chapel have been on the job for more than a month, but no attempt has been made to finish them in position.\n\n(b) The skylight for the new kitchen has not been delivered on the site.\n\n(c) With the exception of the C.F. corridor, and staff rooms, and the smaller stores and bath house, not a metal ceiling is complete.\n\n(d) The necessary materials are not here on the site.\n\n(e) Some of the ceilings put up are out of square and will have to be replaced.\n\nThe delay in this trade normally prevents any attempt at finishing the kitchens work.\n\nGenerally the situation during the past two weeks has been most unsatisfactory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.W.

He shall within twenty-four hours after receiving written notice from the said Architects or Contractor to that effect, proceed to remove from the grounds or buildings all material condemned by the said Architects; whether worked or unworked and to take down all portions of the work which the said Architects or Contractor shall have like written notice directed in any way failing to conform to the plans and specifications set forth herein. No materials brought on the grounds shall be removed without the consent in writing of the Contractor. The whole of the works contemplated in this agreement are to be executed in the most substantial, workmanlike and perfect manner, unless otherwise provided for in said specifications. The Sub-Contractor shall be responsible for all loss or damage to the works comprehended in this agreement and to the rest of the works adjoining property caused by his neglect as provided in this agreement, until such time as the works comprehended in this agreement are completed, unless due to fire or tempest or to the instructions or negligence or lack of judgment of the said Architects or Contractor or to defective or incomplete plans or specifications or caused by other trades, provided that the Sub-Contractor shall be responsible for reasonable wear and tear of the works comprehended in this agreement, if caused by other trades, and the Sub-Contractor shall make good any damage he is liable for, as aforesaid, with as little delay as possible, delivering the whole work comprehended in this agreement clean, complete and perfect in every respect in accordance herewith and with the plans and specifications and said contract.\n\nARTICLE V. Should the Sub-Contractor at any time refuse or neglect to supply a sufficiency of properly skilled workmen, or of materials of the proper quality, or fail in any manner to perform the work comprehended in this agreement with reasonable dispatch, or fail in the performance of any of the agreements herein contained, such refusal, neglect or failure being certified by the said Architects, the Contractor will be at liberty (after three days' written notice to the Sub-Contractor) to provide any such labor or materials, and to deduct the cost thereof from any money then due or thereafter to become due to the Sub-Contractor under this contract, and if the said Architects shall certify that such refusal, neglect or failure is sufficient ground for such action, under the terms of this agreement, the Contractor shall also be at liberty to vacate the premises occupied by the Sub-Contractor for the said works comprehended in this agreement, and to enter upon the premises and take possession, for the purpose of completing the works comprehended in this agreement, of all materials, tools and appliances thereon and to employ any other person or persons to finish the works and provide materials therefor; and in case of such discontinuance of the employment of the Sub-Contractor, the Sub-Contractor shall immediately receive any further payments due under this agreement until the works comprehended in this agreement shall be wholly finished, at which time if the unpaid balance of the amount to be paid under this agreement shall not exceed the expense incurred by the Contractor in finishing the work comprehended in this agreement, such excess shall be paid by the Contractor to the Sub-Contractor, but if such expense shall exceed such unpaid balance, the Sub-Contractor shall pay the difference, and if the said balance shall remain unpaid by the Contractor as herein provided, either for furnishing materials or finishing the works comprehended in this agreement and any damage incurred through such default, shall be audited and certified by the said Architects but appeal from their decision may be made to arbitration, as herein provided.\n\nARTICLE VI. The Sub-Contractor shall complete the whole of the works comprehended in this agreement by the ___________________________ day of ___________________________. Time where herein mentioned to be strictly of the essence of this agreement. The Sub-Contractor acknowledges that in agreeing to complete the works comprehended in this agreement within the time herein stipulated he has in contemplation the Contractor's obligations to complete the entire works mentioned in the said heretofore in part recited contract within the time therein stipulated and the necessity of his performing this agreement in order to enable the Contractor to perform the said in part recited contract.\n\nARTICLE VII. Should the Sub-Contractor be obstructed or delayed in the prosecution or completion of the works comprehended in this agreement by reason of the act, neglect, delay, or default of the Contractor, Owners or Architects, or of any other Contractor or person employed by the Owners upon the works, or of the workmen of such other Contractor, or by reason of extra work being directed to be done, or by reason of failure to supply the materials by him delivered, or by reason of the Sub-Contractor's own default or neglect, including delays in obtaining materials caused by strike through no default or negligence of the Sub-Contractor and delays in transit or by reason of any damage which may happen by flood, fire, lightning, earthquake or cyclone then the time herein fixed for the completion of the works comprehended in this agreement shall be extended for a period equivalent to the time lost by such default or all of the causes herein mentioned, and allowances shall be made if in consequence of the Sub-Contractor's omission to present a claim therefor to the said Architects within a reasonable time after the occurrence of said delay the said Architects or arbitrators are unable to make a fair estimate of the extension of time the Sub-Contractor should receive hereunder. The duration of such extension shall be certified to by the said Architects, subject to appeal to arbitration as hereinafter provided.\n\nARTICLE VIII. The Contractor agrees to provide all labor and materials not included in this contract and the further detailed drawings and explanations mentioned in Article III, and agrees not to delay the material progress of the work comprehended in this agreement, and in the event of unreasonable failure to do so, expressly promising loss to the Sub-Contractor, agrees that the Contractor will reimburse the Sub-Contractor for such loss; and the Sub-Contractor agrees that if he shall unreasonably delay the material progress of the work so as to cause any damage for which the Contractor shall become liable, then he shall make good to the Contractor any such damage. The amount of loss or damage to either party hereto shall in every case be fixed and determined by the said Architects, subject to arbitration as hereinafter provided.\nARTICLE IX. It is hereby mutually agreed between the parties hereto that the sum to be paid by the Contractor to the Sub-Contractor for the said work and materials mentioned in Article I. shall be:\n\nDollars ($ ), subject to additions and deductions as hereinbefore provided, and that such sum shall be paid in current funds by the Contractor to the Sub-Contractor in fortnightly instalments as the works progress, such instalments to represent per cent. of the amount of the work done and materials supplied on the ground, subject to the Architects issuing progress estimates therefor.\n\nThe final payment shall be made within twenty eight days after the Sub-Contractor has substantially fulfilled this contract, if the Sub-Contractor shall have given satisfactory evidence that no liens or claims other than his own or liens of which he holds discharges exist in respect of the said works. All payments shall be made only upon the written certificates of the Architects to the effect that such payments are due. PROVIDED that if the Owner shall abandon or abandon any portion of the works referred to in the hereinbefore mentioned agreement as if otherwise said contract shall be terminated by either Owner or Contractor the Contractor shall be at liberty forthwith to terminate this agreement and the Sub-Contractor shall only be entitled to payment for the material supplied and the work done under this agreement to the date of such abandonment, estimated upon the basis of the contract price hereinbefore mentioned.\n\nIf at any time there shall be evidence of any lien or claim in respect of the works comprehended in this agreement, for which, if established, the Contractor might become liable, and which is chargeable to the Sub-Contractor, the Contractor shall have the right to retain out of any payment then due or thereafter to become due an amount reasonably sufficient to completely indemnify the Contractor against such lien or claim. Should there prove to be any such claim in respect of the works comprehended in this agreement after all payments are made, the Sub-Contractor shall refund to the Contractor all moneys that the latter may be compelled to pay in discharging such claim in consequence of the Sub-Contractor's default.\n\nARTICLE X. No certificate given or payment made under this agreement except the final certificate or final payment shall be conclusive evidence of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Sub-Contractor, either wholly or in part, and no payment shall be construed to be such an acceptance of defective work or improper materials as would entitle the Sub-Contractor to payment therefor.\n\nARTICLE XI. The Sub-Contractor must fully protect the Contractor against all claim for personal injury caused by the Sub-Contractor or his employees to any person engaged upon the works, or to the persons public, for which the Contractor might be liable, and for this purpose shall obtain adequate casualty insurance in some company to be approved of by the Contractor and shall produce evidence when called upon by the Contractor, that such insurance is in force, and the Contractor may at any time that he sees fit provide such casualty insurance at the expense of the Sub-Contractor and the Sub-Contractor shall pay the same and the same may be charged up by the Contractor against any moneys then or thereafter to become due from the Contractor to the Sub-Contractor.\n\nARTICLE XII. Any arbitration herein provided for shall be as follows. The Sub-Contractor and Contractor shall each appoint an arbitrator and such arbitrators shall appoint a third. The decision of any two of the three arbitrators shall be final and binding. Each of the parties hereto shall pay one-half of the expenses of such reference. A party who has not appointed an arbitrator after the other party has appointed one shall do so within two days after being notified in writing by such other party to do so. If the arbitrator of either party shall fail to proceed within thirty days of the request of the party, within three days after being requested in writing by the party's arbitrator so to do, such other party's arbitrator shall, if a third has not been appointed, be at liberty to act as sole arbitrator and his decision shall be final and binding or the other two arbitrators, if a third has been appointed, may forthwith appoint an arbitrator in lieu of the one who has failed to proceed as aforesaid, and the decision of two of these arbitrators shall be final and binding. If either party has done all in its power to comply with the provisions herein contained as to securing an arbitration by reason of the default of the other party or of the said Architects or of an arbitrator appointed by such other party or by reason of the Architects failing to certify in respect of any matter or thing upon which he should under the terms hereof adjudicate or render a certificate or by reason of the arbitrators being unable to agree on an award, it is made within a reasonable time, such party or party's arbitrator shall be deemed to have waived in the courts in the same way as if no reference of the matter in question either to the said Architects or to arbitration had been made. Either party and the other party shall not be at liberty to object that the adjudication of the arbitrators or a certificate from them is pre-requisite or that the remedy is only by arbitration or that arbitration is a pre-requisite to such action being taken or that the appeal to arbitration having proved abortive the decision of the said Architect is final and binding. An award under the provisions of this Article may be made a rule or judgment of the Court of King's Bench.\n\nARTICLE XIII. The covenants herein contained shall apply to and be binding on the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and each of them.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have caused these presents to be executed.\n\nIn the Presence of\n\nWitness\n\nWitness\nNovember Eleventh\nNineteen-Twenty-four.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst.

C.\n\nWe trust we may be able to complete contract to the satisfaction of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\nThe work under the supervision of the above School is going on in a splendid manner and the building promises to be a real credit to the Department. Already one unit is completed. The second unit is being proceeded with.\n\nI therefore request that an amount be included in the Estimates in view of completing the building by the construction of the third unit. Moreover, the furniture of the building is to be looked after and an amount to that effect must also be included in the list for Estimates.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 382-5, part 3)\nOctober Thirtieth\nNineteen-Twenty-four.\n\nR. Guernsey Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nRE KAMLOOPS SCHOOL\n\nWe are submitting the following sub-contractors for your approval.\n\nCut Stone - Keast & Allan, Vancouver, B. C.\nMillwork - Robertson & Hackett Co., Ltd.\nStructural Steel - Dominion Bridge Co., Winnipeg, Man.\nStairs and Miscellaneous iron work - Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, Man.\nPlumbing & Htg. - Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., Kamloops, B. C. (Provisional only)\n\nEnclosed herewith is blue print showing lay-out of structural steel. We would be glad to have your comment on same.\n\nRegarding the plumbing and heating contract. While we submitted the name of the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., it is only provisional as we are not yet satisfied as to the wisdom of giving them this work. Their figure is the lowest by $600.00 and we used it in making up our tender, but Mr. Macanley has registered such a strong objection to us about employing them, that we are trying to find some way of avoiding awarding contract to them. They are very anxious to do the work and have promised the very best possible service.\nThis firm did the Sheet metal and Roofing for Mr. Carson's contract of last year. The roofing seems to be a first class job, but they seem to have taken some liberties with the sheet metal work. This may be due to a certain extent to their being in regular sub-contract form between them and the general sub-contractor Carson. If we gave them the contract, it will only be on our regular form of sub-contract which we think would amply protect us and give us full power to take the work out of their hands if they were not carrying it out satisfactorily.\n\nWe enclose copy of one of our regular sub-contract forms for your perusal and would like to have your opinion on this matter as a guide for our future action.\n\nIf any other sub-contract figure is obtainable at about the same price as the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating, we will award them sub-contract, but as we have taken the Kamloops School on such a narrow margin we are averse to paying an extra Six Hundred Dollars, ($600.00) above the price figured on.\n\nWe have been very successful in finding a match to the Clayburn Brick. During the time we were figuring this job, I met Mr. Sellhorn of the Redcliffe Brick & Coal Co., in Medicine Hat, On Sept. 24th, to talk over the matter of supplying brick and tile and to arrange a price for it. Mr. Sellhorn was so confident that he could match clayburn brick, stating that he had already done so, that we took his word for it and figured accordingly, and it is now very gratifying to find that when four samples of clayburn brick are built into a sample wall in our office together with about twenty Medicine Hat and Redcliffe brick, the Clayburn brick cannot be identified by any brick man who is asked to pick them out.\n\nThe matching is made very easy by reason of their being several different shades in the Clayburn brick as they range from the medium light to the average dark of the Medicine Hat samples. We can send you a range of samples if you wish, though we can assure you we are covering the point you want exactly and we think possibly it would be best to have the samples in our office as we are placing our orders on a distinct guarantee that the range of color is lived up to.\n\nMr. Ernest Claydon is leaving for Kamloops in a few days and will complete the organization of the work on such a scale as to insure its being covered in before the severe weather strikes Kamloops.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\n\nEnc.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Nov. 15, 1924.\n\nH.F.

The system is now working satisfactorily, with a main distribution board adjacent to the existing water (the most convenient point). Mr. Brown of the City Utilities promised to carry out this work on a time and material basis.

From the formulae Ext. = 110 x 36.4444, or this is figured after and away from what the peak load can possibly be, I have added for the following:\n\n- 500 Amperes, 110 Volts, 133.100 Kilowatts, which is more than sufficient to 150 amperes carrying from the Transformer Pole to the Entrance (N.E. wall of Centre building adjacent).\nAdjacent to East Side of Chapel Roof. This service will be approx. 150 ft. in length and is covered by Mr. Carson's contract; to facilitate matters however, I have arranged for the connection to be made by the City, also on a time basis material, labor, and the cost to be deducted from Mr. Carson's contract.

It is just possible that he may contend that his contract does not make provision for the two 100 Amp. Switches required on the Main Switch Board for the two buildings.

The provision of a Switch Board in the Closet on Ground Floor, in addition to the Switch Board located at Mr. Maclean's No. 4 (two) wires from the Switch Room of Centre Building to the Switch Board referred to under No. 1.\n\nReference No. 2.

It is possible that the Cabinet unit may contain the reduction in the current required for the three Switch boards, allowing of No. 6 wires being used, thus saving laborers' time to be applied to authority for including lights where they are called for, under the Specification and Drawings; should any changes be authorized an adjustment can be arranged later.\n\nReference Mr. Maclean, as no Switch to Light Bath, I would point out the omission of this Switch is noted, same will be included in the adjustment above referred to.\n\nSigned\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nReference is made of water from Bath and Sink stand tubes.\n\nIn view of the great amount of water used per week for above the same will also apply to the Purgatory River.

Instead of being connected into the Septic Tank some could be connected up with the pipe line carrying the effluent to the disposal trenching at about thirty feet to the outlet of Septic Tank.\n\nThis would of course necessitate a small additional expenditure, the advantage would I think be more than sufficient to justify such a change.\n\nInspection Chamber.

With reference to this I would say that Mr. Macmillan, Inspector of the Work wrote to Mr. Carson, the contractor, on the 26th of May with reference to the granite, and notified him that the granite being delivered was decidedly inferior and defective, and if any of the granite was set it was entirely at his own risk, as it was impossible for him to accept same.\n\nAs I said before I will receive shortly a full report from the Inspector, and I will keep your communication in mind and see if a settlement can be arrived at without delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMrs. W. B. McDonald,\n1191 - 12th Ave. W.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nWith reference to the granite specified for the new Kamloops School you will remember that this was discussed with Mr. McBride, and he advised us that the sandstone would not stand up under the weather conditions of Kamloops, due to the great difference in temperature between the day and night during the winter months. While I was in Kamloops I personally inspected several buildings where sandstone had been used, and found that it was not proving satisfactory. Mr Macaulay who has practised Architecture in that district for some time was also of the opinion that the granite was far superior to the sandstone when used in buildings in Kamloops. From Mr. Macaulay's reports it is evident that he has had some difficulty in getting the contractors to furnish the granite of a satisfactory quality, and I beg to quote hereunder from his reports.\n\nReport May 1st: \"The granite is proving a constant source of worry. The quality is not too good and I have been compelled to refuse permission for the caps to the chapel buttresses to be used.\"\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter which Mr. Macaulay wrote to Mr. Carson, the contractor on the 26th May. \"Reference granite. As you are fully aware it has been necessary to complain as to the quality of granite supplied to the above mentioned building many times during the past three months. The expected improvement has not materialised. In fact the standard has deteriorated, the last shipment is most decidedly inferior and defective. Consequently in confirmation of my verbal instructions, the setting of this or any defective granite is entirely at your own risk as it is impossible for me to accept same.\"\nLetter of August 16, as follows: \"Two new granite caps for chapel buttress arrived and have been placed in position. A little painting has been done to the coping, otherwise no apparent effort has been made to rectify the work complained of.\"\n\nOn the twelfth of this month a letter was received from J. A. and C. H. MacDonald, Cut stone contractors of Vancouver, complaining that they have not been paid for the granite supplied to the Kamloops School, and on the 24th instant I enclosed a copy of their letter to Mr. Macaulay asking him to submit a full report on the granite supplied to the school at the earliest possible date.\n\nFrom the above you will see that the contractor has had a lot of trouble with the sub-contractors, supplying the granite for the building.\n\nARCHITECT.\nMr. W. Scott,\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nDear Sir,\n\nMy son has asked me to write to you in connection with their contract of the stone work on the Indian School in Kamloops. It has been completed about six months ago, but the inspectors will not pass the work, nor will he tell them what is wrong with it.\n\n11/91 - 12th Ave N.,\nVancouver B.C.\nNov. 18, 1924.\nI explained to you\u2014when in Ottawa\u2014the trouble between the two unions (Granite & stone cutter union).\n\nThe granite cutter refused to cut the granite unless they could be allowed to cut the candelabra too!\n\nHowever, the Inspector would not let the candelabra be used, and we had to have the granite cut by candelabra cutter.\n\nWhen it came to near the finish of the work, they (the Granite cutters) refused to allow the granite quarry men to supply us with the granite, otherwise they would go on strike on all the granite work being erected, and therefore we were forced to complete our contract with what granite we could secure.\n\nWhat the boys want to know is if the stone was not all right why the Inspector allowed it to be put into the building, and after a lapse of six months he refuses to issue the estimate?\n\nMy sons did bid two thousand dollars of their original price to help the contractor\u2014Mr. Baren\u2014get this contract.\nMr. Carey has not helped the boys to get this matter straightened out; there is about three thousand dollars due to them and they need the money to carry on.\n\nI do wish that the architect could have used New Castle Island stone\u2014like the sample I left with you. It would have saved all this trouble.\n\nBy the way the Government is using this stone (New Castle Island) in the Federal Building (Post Office) at Kamloops now under construction.\n\nWill you kindly help to straighten this matter as soon as possible.\n\nThe boys have written to you but I thought I had better write and explain this to you.\n\nI thank you for your last courtesy. I do appreciate what you have done for me. I try to remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDr. W. S.

Progress has been made on\nthe portion of the building during the past fifteen days.\nWe are still awaiting the delivery of the bricks,\notherwise all work is rapidly moving forward.\n\nThe connection of water supply has not yet been\ncompleted due to the heavy snows. The necessary\npipes have been laid.\n\nVery good progress has been made with the portion\nof the building in spite of several delays due to the\nweather conditions, delays, and defective shipments of materials.\n\nCertain difficulties have been encountered, but\nhave been satisfactorily overcome or submitted\nto the Department under separate reports.\n\nSome delay caused by the heavy snows. The\nclay bricks are being supplied by the Red River Co., authorized\nby the Board. Approximately 4,500 clay bricks have been\nreceived from the Central Building site at the date mentioned.\n\nI have arranged with Mr. Brown to take over\nbrick yard. At the same time, I discussed with the Board\nthe possibility of purchasing the yard's inventory.\n\nThe ground floor is progressing well and is now in place.\n\nWeather permitting, the ground floor joints will be\nin position in the course of a few days.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 832-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJ.

We have a credit with the Bank of Montreal and it is very difficult to convince him that we will get our money as soon as Mr. Carson does. One of Mr. Carson's men was in here this morning and told us the stone work is now awaiting the O.K. of Mr. Orr. I told the manager this but even that would not satisfy him, so if you will be kind enough to just drop a line which we can place before him we shall appreciate it very much.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Macdonald was sent off to the school to fix up the defective goods, but after working approximately eight days he informed me that it was useless him staying in Humber River as it was impossible for him to take the goods to an acceptable destination; he stated that he was ashamed of the goods sent, and that same should never have left the yard. He admitted that same had not all the products had been cut from Canada.\n\nThis employee requested these remarks to the Rev. Father MacLaren whom I had requested to see as witness to the event of said incident, signature below.\n\nThis employee is the owner of a dog or so returned to Valenciennes and subsequently me.\neffort has been made to replace or rectify the\ngrants work complained of.\nI have spoken to Mr. Brown, the naval contractor\non several occasions about this defective grants,\nwithout however, any satisfactory result of information.\nPractically the whole of our grants has been\nplaced in question.\nFrom time to time I have referred to this grants in\nmy usual Monthly & Mid-monthly reports.\nFor your information I would add that:\nThe total cost of the grants to be\nsupplied in accordance with Drawings\nand Specifications amounted to approx $12,000.00\nThe amount paid by the Department, in\nrespect of the various shipments made,\nin accordance with the amount included\nin the various certifications is $6,856.00\nwhich being at the rate of 90% = equals $4,800.00\nI may add that Mr. Molson during his visit here examined\nthis grants and agreed with the action taken by me.\nHe also remarked apply to Col. Macmillan Inspector of\nGrants.\nIn conclusion I would mention that the defects to\nChapel Buttenworth which I referred to as being improperly\nfixed, have not been rectified.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.

J. & C. H. Macdonald.\n\nSir,\n\nThe letter from Messrs. Macdonald to me dated 21st Nov., and referred to in the enclosed copy mentioned above, is forwarded herewith for your information.\n\nIn reference thereto I would point out that under the circumstances I did not consider it wise to forward the letter asked for; as such would have, more or less, been construed into an acceptance of the grant complained of, and I was not prepared to commit the Department to that extent.\n\nI explained matters to Mr. Carson however and asked him to explain matters to Messrs. Macdonald on his next visit to Ottawa, which took place shortly after the receipt of the letter.\n\nIn any case, Messrs. Macdonald were in a better position than I, to decide when the defective grants would be replaced, and the point most certainly determined the date on which a certificate would be issued to me.\n\nDelays cannot be tolerated, and I am convinced that Messrs. Macdonald had no intention of accepting the grant complained of.\n\nThey are and must be keen to protect the Department and this could only be accomplished by withdrawing the certificate in question until the materials supplied complied with the terms of the specifications.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.

Father McGuire was in town, but I was met by the Rev. Superior, who gave me the following information.\n\nAt 10:30 P.M. on the 23rd., after all had retired and she and Rev. Father McGuire, after ascertaining that all stoves in the building were safe, as far as they could see, themselves retired for the night. About one o'clock A.M. Sister Mary Ann D'Aberg, being awakened by the smoke, aroused the inmates of the building. The children were all called and dressed as quickly as possible in what clothes they could gather and were removed from the building without any mishap. They were then taken over to a small building used as a laundry, which was not heated at the time, and several of the children had only escaped only with very meagre clothing, and some without even shoes and stockings.\n\nIn the meantime the alarm was raised and the City Fire Brigade volunteered to go from Kamloops to the School, some three miles distant, with a view to try and extinguish the blaze, but the fire had too much of a hold to do anything, and the only thing to do was to concentrate on saving the new school which stands only a few yards distant from the one destroyed.\n\nOwing to the fact that the power lines were destroyed by the fire, the school pumping machinery, of course ceased operations, leaving them absolutely without water except what could be carried in buckets from the river, and in spite of the low temperature a bucket brigade was organized, and with the assistance of the City Fire Brigade, they kept men on the roof of the new school which is only covered with cedar shingles, and extinguished any sparks or chunks of burning timbers which might blow over.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nover to the new school roof and endanger that building. Owing to the persistent and determined efforts of these workers, the new school was saved, but the girls' class room which stands in a separate building some twenty or thirty yards distant from the girls' residential quarters, caught fire and was completely destroyed.\n\nUpon my arrival, the 38 girls and four sisters were all herded in the small building used as a laundry, with no heat and only the clothes they stood in. All their provisions had been destroyed, and their kitchen utensils and dishes, together with the shipment of new aluminium and enamel ware, dishes and utensils for dining room and kitchen use, which had only arrived at the school the night previous and had never been unpacked.\n\nI immediately took steps to provide an emergency measure, four dozen knives, forks, spoons, plates, cups and saucers, also a few pots and pans and kettle, to enable them to make some hot coffee and cook themselves a meal when provisions had been rushed out from Kamloops.\n\nLater on, with the sanction of the Department, I purchased 75 Hudson's Bay blankets, and also sent to them 26 military overcoats, and 42 sweaters which we had on hand in the office for the relief of indigent Indians. These were only loaned until such time as the school has been re-established. I also purchased four dozen kitchen chairs and six Singer Sewing Machines, as the sisters were anxious to have these to enable them to start in making clothing for the girls as soon as they are able.\n\nThrough the kindness of the Rev. Sister Superior of St. Ann's Academy, (Sister M. Agatha), and owing to the fact that the Christmas holidays were in progress, 20 of the girls were removed from the laundry building, and housed for the night of the 24th, in the Convent in Kamloops, thus making conditions very much easier to contend with at the school until we were able to get the heat in the new building and set up beds and arrange matters before the whole staff could be transferred.\n\nDuring the day of the 25th, I again transferred these 20 girls from the Convent to the new building, and they are at present comfortably housed in the new building pending the adjustment of their immediate needs.\n\nOwing to the relief which the Department authorized me to give them, they are not suffering for the present, and are able to carry on for a short while, until I can manage to supply them with their regular cooking utensils and household furniture, but I most respectfully submit that no time be lost in having these matters attended to, in order that the school may proceed when the Christmas holidays are over, without interruption.\n\nOn the authority of Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, I also ordered four large tables to be made for the dining room, in order that the children might be able to be served with their meals, as at the present time, there is not a table in the place. These tables, I expect, will be ready by Wednesday, the 31st inst.\nIn my opinion, as well as in the opinion of Rev. Father McGuire and the Sister Superior, the fire must have originated from an overheated stove-pipe, which must have become overheated after they had retired and set fire to the ceiling above it. I can understand that this could be, as I understand there were some eleven or more stoves in the building to keep them hot, and the Department will readily see that there must have been considerable length of stovepipe feeding these stoves.\n\nIf anything further develops I will immediately communicate with you, and I trust that my actions throughout will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI shall do nothing further in the way of purchasing furnishings until I hear further, and I might add that I have wired Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn stating this, and suggesting that if, convenient to him, it might be better if he could come in and see their actual wants and order the same, thus avoiding duplication.\n\nAll of which is most respectfully submitted.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\nAt Kamloops, B.C.,\n\nDecember 31st., 1924.\n\nDepartment file 154-0-5, December 17, 1924.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith further reference to the above matter, I beg to re-enclose herewith voucher 323-24, in the sum of $285.00 payable to the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Company, Kamloops, B.C., together with a copy of a letter received from E.H. Tredcroft, Esq., Division Engineer, Dominion Water Power Branch, Kamloops, in response to a letter from this office asking him for an explanation as to whether or not tenders were called for, and I trust that the explanation given by Mr. Tredcroft will clear up the matter and everything will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 22nd, re account for installing new water main at the Kamloops Industrial School, I would state that a letter received by this Department from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa dated August 30th, 1924 contained instructions for this office to call for tenders for the construction of the sewage disposal plant, and that the specifications for these tenders were to include connecting the new school building with the present water main. These instructions were carried out and tenders received from two firms, the contract being awarded to the lower, i.e. the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Company, as follows:\n\nConstructing sewage disposal plant $2,976.00\nConnecting new school with present water main 75.00\n\nTotal $3,051.00\n\nAfter construction had been commenced it was found that the existing water main from the pump house to the old school building, with which we intended to connect the new school building, was so badly rusted away that it was impossible to make a proper connection with it and that the whole main would have to be replaced in a short time. It was considered best, therefore, to request permission to install a complete new water main from the present pump house to the new school building instead of trying to connect with the old main. Authority to do so was received by wire from Ottawa. As the contract for connecting the sewage disposal plant and connecting the new school building with the old water main had already been entered into and work commenced, this alteration of the original plan had to be regarded as extra work covered under Sections 1 and 2, Page 3 of the original specifications submitted in my report dated March 7th, 1924.\n\nThe price ($285.00) was fixed by this office and a deduction of $75.00 will be made in the original contract price to offset the amount charged by the contractor in the original tender. Current prices charged for 2\u00bd\" diameter W.I. galvanized water main and fittings were obtained both from Vancouver and Kamloops before the extra amount to be allowed for this work was decided by this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.H.

The weather is fairly favorable about 34\u00b0, but operations are hampered by the heavy falls of snow, approx 3-5\".\n\nAll work in connection with this contract is proceeding smoothly. The Redcliffe trucks are however very disappointing as far as claims are concerned and I have already refused acceptance of a car load on 27th Dec.\n\nClydesley - The contractor together with heating oil hunter in compliance with my urgent telegram of the 24th Dec., arrived (from Vancouver) on the 26th Dec. The heating plant is working fairly, and the fires and fans have fixed.\n\nPatwarden's work and expenditure mentioned by the fire are respectfully tendered in another letter herewith enclosed.\n\nYours faithfully,\nP.M. Macdonald\nKawartha New Indian Residential School\nReport on Fire and Extraordinary Work\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, January 1925\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nThe Indians Agent forwarded this Telegram etc. particulars\nin General, of the Fire in the 2nd Oct., Consequently I\nhave delayed my report until the air had cleared somewhat.\n\nThe Fire was discovered about 12.15 am on the\nmorning of the 2nd Oct., it originated in the Kitchen, probably\nfrom a defective stove or pipe.\n\nThe flames spread with such rapidity that it was\nimpossible to do more than save the occupants, the Sisters\nand Girls. Fortunately no lives were lost, but very little\nclothing was saved, the Sisters & Girls were very scarcely\nclad indeed.\n\nThere was little or no panic, which probably accounts\nfor the absence of injury to the inmates.\n\nThe weather conditions were severe, 15\u00b0 approx\nbelow zero, fortunately there was little or no wind.\n\nThe fire alarm was telephoned to the Local Fire\nBrigade and men from nearby rushed over, and took charge\nof the fire fighting work.\n\nWithin approximately 40 minutes the roof and walls\ncollapsed. Practically all work was devoted to saving the New\nBuildings and the Old Laundry.\n\nGreat credit is given to the Staff and Boys\n(By the Local Fire Brigade) for the splendid manner in which\nthey behaved and worked.\n\nThe fire embraced the portion containing the Girls\nliving, including Dormitory, Dining Room and Recreation Room,\nthe Kitchen, Bath, and Office quarters including Parlour;\nThe Dining Room, the Kitchen, the Chapel, the Bakery, Store\nRooms, the Bakery, and generally the entire Steam Block.\n\nA main line, electric light & power, also became\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\n\nIquith and the living district, this was fortunately unfortunate in reaching us the group and water supply being out of action, every attempt has been made to save this.\n\nBucket lines were run from the river to the roofs of Main New Building and the detached Laundry and these buildings were protected to such an extent that only minor injuries were sustained.\n\nI received a message from Father McGuire shortly after 6 am (of the 24th Dec) and immediately took necessary action as follows:\n\nThe contracts for the centre or administration block together with the sub-contractors for the heating & plumbing were at Vancouver. Consequently I engaged the services of Mr. Carson and Sons, a local firm, as sub-contractors for the heating & plumbing of the new building.\n\nAt 7:30 am, Mr. Carson and two assistants were on their way to the school with instructions from me, to get the heating plant of the new building into operation.\n\nI then telegraphed to Mr. Carson and the heating engineer Mr. Beck at Vancouver, but did not get a reply until 7:30 am Xmas Day (24th Dec).\n\nI had asked Mr. Beck to come to Kamloops at once, the telegram from him, which I have not received, will give you the necessary information as to general conditions.\n\nAt 9:30 am (24th Dec) I had to send a cable to the splendid assistance from the Manager of the Union Hotel, who, a principal cause of mine, has been dispatched to the school to renew the light and power wires, etc. By 3 pm the electric power was available, but heavy leakage there, proper to old building kept the supply limited of water very low.\n\nAs the debris was still blowing furiously I put...\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOctober 192...\n\nOn three of Clayton's men at 5pm, fires had worked through the night keeping the flames under control as far as possible; practically no water was available so that their efforts were confined to shovelling on snow.\n\nI may add that all the McCann men and boys were practically exhausted by the efforts during the night of the 25th-26th.\n\nAt 10pm 24th water was supplied to the boiler and shortly before midnight McCann had the building comfortably warm. The gate valves proved defective and the pump could not be started; this refers to pumps in heating system.\n\nMcCann and his two helpers worked throughout the day and eventually handed over to Mr. Beck on his arrival on the morning of the 26th.\n\nThe gate valves had repaired and the connection to the pump cleared, since then everything has worked very satisfactorily indeed, the only complaint has been that the building was too hot.\n\nOn the 26th I employed McCann and his men to locate and plug up the water pipes to the old main building, the difficulty in this work was locating the pipe and the debris was still burning.\n\nBy 5pm 26th everything including the water supply and heating was in good condition.\n\nA temporary cooking stove was obtained on the evening of the 25th so that during dinner day it was possible to supply warm meals with the exception of the time and service arising from a total absence of furniture. The inmates were quite happy and contented.\n\nIn conclusion I would add that the extraordinary expenditures for work authorized by me will comprise the following items:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ........................................... 192\n\n(1) Mr. J.

I have acknowledged receipt together with an expression of appreciation.\n\nThe various amounts of the above items will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nThe Chief of the Local Fire Brigade, a purely volunteer organization, has requested me to suggest that an acknowledgment of their efforts by the Department, in the form of a subscription to the Brigade fund, would be most appreciated. I should add that the school is practically 2\u00bd miles beyond the city limits, that the weather was so below zero, that it was necessary to hire a motor car to take the men over, as the roads were quite impassable for fire engines and the usual fire fighting apparatus.\n\nI would take the liberty of submitting that a subscription of say $50.00 would be most appreciated by the Brigade.\n\nI would further suggest that, at least an expression of thanks from the Department be forwarded to Mr. Kelly, the Foreman of the Municipal Gang, who in addition to valuable work during the day of the 24th rendered valuable\nReport on Fire\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa,\n\nAssistance at the fire from 1 am to 3 am, and has been conspicuously prominent in the effort to save the light and power lines.\n\nThe telephones have been temporarily installed in the New Building, but they appear to be in working order.\n\nWhilst the fire is occasion for regret, it is also a matter for congratulation, not only in view of the prompt action taken by those concerned, but in particular to the absence of injury to the occupants of the building.\n\nOf something or learned from each disaster there is a highly probable that the lesson learned from this fire will be \"The absolute necessity for the storage of sufficient water and fire fighting appliances such as cannot be interfered with in the event of fire.\"\n\nThe lack of supply of water was totally inadequate. The fire fighting appliances, excepting the small chemical fire extinguisher, were absolutely nil.\n\nIt would also seem desirable that the men of isolated schools, the boys should be instructed in, and practice of, fire fighting methods.\n\nVery faithfully,\n\nP.H.

I am pleased to note that you were able to be of much assistance, and your action throughout is approved by the Department. I have learned with satisfaction that the Reverend Sisters and the girls of the school are comfortably housed in the new building, pending an adjustment of their needs.\n\nI note that you have telegraphed to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn regarding the further furnishings that are required immediately, and the Department will await a communication from either his office or yourself before taking any action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Dec. 29, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Helmsing:\n\nTo your other kindnesses after the fire could you add the extra one of requesting Miss Smith to send a copy of this letter to Inspector Pragnell, Commissioner Ditchburn, and Dr. Scott, our Deputy Superintendent General?\n\nFire is a good servant, but a very bad master. Everyone tried to prevent him from becoming master; but at times he comes; he comes without warning, orders people out and creates confusion. People in charge of schools must realize this fact and realize that when it comes they must put up with the trouble and inconvenience. We are no better than others; our turn has come and we must be patient under the circumstances.\n\nThe night was very cold, and the Sisters and girls escaped with very little clothing. Along you came with coats and sweaters! In the afternoon you were here to take the little girls to the Convent and to bring them back next day! In the evening there were seventy-five blankets and dishes and knives and forks and chairs; latest sewing machines arrived and tables were ordered! When we see our girls playing and singing and dancing in their new dining room without even a cold as an after effect, both the Indian people and ourselves know how to appreciate your timely action.\n\nWe do not know what other people would expect of the Agent, or his staff, or the Inspector, or Commissioner, or the Officers of the Department in such conditions, but for ourselves we are more than content, more than satisfied and we are seizing our first moment at a desk to convey to them our assurance of our contentment and satisfaction.\n\nA fire is a time of confusion. Here the confusion is probably minimized by the fact of the Sisters and girls occupying the new administration building and continuing the school work as usual.\n\nThere is, however, a delicate position created for us at School, and we are much pleased that you saved that position by a bold stroke.\u2014 The new unit is complete but not furnished. Generally the Department furnishes a new house. But it surely ill becomes me, Agent, to rush at you at this moment and using the fire as a lever, shout: \"We must have this, we cannot get along without that!\" This is precisely the cry of every agent and merchant for miles around as he flaunts his wares in our face and pesters us for orders.\n\nI would very probably be the very first to raise an outcry if anyone meddled in my business here at School. The building and furnishing of the school is not my business and I sedulously avoid offering any suggestions except when asked. Any other course just causes the Department endless trouble.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nYour suggestion of calling a halt to all kinds of orders and requesting a visit from our Commissioner saves the situation beautifully! We are very thankful indeed to you for it. When he, or any other Officer, comes he will attend to his business of furnishing the school, or of saying what he will or will not purchase. I consider this move of your excellent strategy!\n\nWe need a great many things at School, Agent, either before or after a fire. But what we need particularly just now is patience. And we intend to exercise it.\n\nWith renewed thanks to the different officers of the Department, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF December 1924\n\n1.

December the 24th. The old Residential school was entirely destroyed.\n\nOnly the presence and work of the Kamloops Fire Brigade which rushed to the scene of the fire, saved the new building that is partially erected.\n\nThe fire which was occasioned by an overheated stove. The power wires which connected the school with the City of Kamloops were seen burned out, and water had to be carried by hand. The Indian boys were a very big factor in saving the new building.\n\nThere are enrolled in this school Seventy-five pupils.

I must congratulate you all upon the good will and kindness which overcame a difficult situation. I trust you will present to the Sisters of the convent my thanks for their temporary accommodation of the children, and I note with pleasure your statement regarding the confidence that the Indians have in yourself, the Agent and the Sisters. When you get a moment's time a little later on, I hope you will write and let me know what the arrangements are, where the children are housed, etc., etc.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nKamloops, B.C.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Jan 2, 1925.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nOn Tuesday night or at one o'clock on Wednesday morning before Christmas, the main building of our old house was completely destroyed by fire. It comprised the office, parlor, two dining rooms, kitchen, bakery, girls' recreation and the sisters' community room and girls' classroom on the lower floor; on the upper floor, the chapel, the sisters' dormitory, the large and the small girls' dormitory and the washrooms. The groceries, the provisions, the canned goods, of tomatoes, corn and fruit, as well as the new dishes of kitchen and dining-room for the new house disappeared in the flames.\n\nThe fire came as a terrible shock, which I cannot care to revive by reciting too many details, in fact I have driven it as much as possible from my mind, but it did not come as a surprise. We had impressed it a thousand times on our own minds and those of the children. They proved of immense value. We worked; we did not need to think.\n\nAs I bounded from my bed and dashed for the dining-room to go up and alarm the sisters, such a bed of smoke met that I closed at once the door again and dashed for the men and boys. They followed all at my heels, and as we stood in formation to scale the gallery and bring out the sisters and girls, we heard a key turn in the girls' recreation hall door and out stepped a large girl in her night-dress followed...\nby all the little girls in rank and large girls and sisters,\nand a cloud of smoke forth came! A sigh of relief went up\nas they assured us on their way to the classroom that they\nwere all there!\n\nWe rang in a fire alarm, emptied the office,\nand knowing the fire would cut our power line recently\ninstalled between the old and the new house and stop our\npump, we filled the laundry pails, some cutting a hole\nin the ice while others scaled the new chapel roof, and\nformed a bucket brigade to protect the roof and fight off,\nif necessary, the flames from a hundred and fifty cords of\nwood piled near the new building. As it was getting pretty\nhot for us, the heat stripping some paint and cracking some\npanes in the chapel windows, the city men streamed\nacross the yard, encouraged me with strong hands and\nturned the dubious battle in our favor.\n\nAs the front wall caved in, the heat fell on\nthe brick wall of the chapel and eliminated danger\nfrom the roof. Meanwhile the girls' classroom was well\nunder way of destruction, but as danger for the new\nbuilding was past, we directed our attention to the\nlaundry. Wet blankets were used, snow and water applied,\nand shortly after the roof of the classroom fell in, a few strong\nhands pushed in the burning wall and held the fire in check.\n\nHow the fire started we do not know. If you re-\nmember how I begged of you to build one unit. The idea was to have one building where the water would not freeze, and from that one supply warm water to the house and laundry. The big bear was not merely the work of thawing out pipes; it was the danger, especially in the kitchen and househouse. If hot water were used, it fell on the ground or a window and freezing itself increased the difficulty next time; if a blow torch or paper was used there was danger of fire. I generally aided in the kitchen myself. I did so that morning. The weather was very cold and in the evening the children had put a little too much fire in the bakery. Sister was sitting up watching it at nine when I went into bring some wood for my own stove. I requested her to retire saying I would look at it after finishing my office. I did so about ten; the fire in the stove was practically out. Now did the Trade Instructor and I start a fire in the wall and it remained hidden all day? Or was it a defective pipe or flue, or a spark from some stove or chimney? We do not know.\n\nPermit me a remark or two for your own consumption. Next day the Agent and I were looking at the chapel roof. \"Lay, it certainly cleared the snow off, didn't it?\" \"Yes, indeed. I was afraid it was going to clear the roof too!\" \"You're lucky; if it had been in dry weather, the whole thing might have gone. It may be a blessing that it went just at this time.\" I answered with a non-committal. \"Well,\" There\nwords of course are not exact; they may not even be fair. Probably\nthe Agent used them only to cheer me. However, Doctor, had\nyou been standing in my place and seen the snow disappear\nfrom the roof, and on that cold night beheld the steam rise\nin a cloud after the snow and water, and known the degree\nof roofs in summer, as we know them, had you thought\nand said a dozen times to your staff as we have said:\n\"If that old house takes fire, how in the world will we ever\nsave our new house?\" and had them shake their heads and\nanswer: \"Impossible, Father, as soon as you are out of it,\ntear it down,\" you would have felt the full force of Mr.\nHelming's words. I have never said this, I am not saying it\nto others, but I do feel that you should know it.\n\nA lesson of this kind emphasizes the necessity\nof training children to stand in rank and to call for\nmissing units before starting. The girls lined up immediately;\nthe names of two very small girls were called out; they\nwere picked out of bed by two big girls in a jiffy and the line\nstarted as quietly and orderly as usual!\n\nThere are schools here in B.C. with better build-\nings and better equipment than ours; they took just as\nmuch pains and taught just as well as we. But through\nno fault of theirs they lost a child through fire, flu or\nsmallpox......Then their trouble with their school began\nwith these poor people. The day after the fire the\nIndian Agent and Mr. Barber were along with sweater and great coats helping the Sisters to bundle up the little girls in the laundry and pack them off to the convent. We were busy trying to bring water into the new house. Several Indian people were standing around. I could hear them, \"Well, ask the Father to take our girls home.\" \u2014\u2014\"Leave those people alone, don't you think they can take care of the children?\" \"That's right!\" And comments on the fire followed. They bothered none of us for their children; they mixed up laughing and talking with the Sisters and Agent and Mr. Barber and children. Now, Doctor, this is worth something. It was plain to see then and since that their confidence in the Agent, the Sisters and Father is increased, not diminished. This is a great blessing. We noted with much pleasure that both you and Commissioner Ditchburn commented on the fact of six having lost no children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McLean, M.D.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

From thereon, work has been difficult though difficult, the temperature was about 30\u00b0 average but the unusually heavy falls of snow had made the roads almost impassable rendering transportation of materials impossible.\n\nBricks: We have had very considerable trouble with the Redcliffe facing bricks owing to the defective color and I have obliged to condemn an unfit another van load on the 6th inst.\n\nThe Manager from Redcliffe arrived in Kamloops on the 12th inst. and expressed regret at the inconvenience caused. He readily admitted that the bricks contained were unsuitable and made arrangements for the disposal of same elsewhere. I have to express my satisfaction with the fairness and spirit of cooperation in which the gentleman treated this affair.\n\nToday new samples have arrived, same are much more satisfactory.\n\nPoveshell\n\nInspector of Construction\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\nApplication for Stationery\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nP.O.

As stated above, the amount due the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Co., for material supplied and work carried out up to January 22nd., 1925, is $2,885.00, as per attached statement, which has been certified correct by Mr. Tredcroft himself.\n\nMr. Tredcroft requests that the Department pay this amount, as it does not appear to be reasonable to expect the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., to wait for so large an amount until the whole school is completed, as there only remains the amount of $400.00 to complete the whole contract price, and it is possible that the buildings may not be completed for some eighteen months or more.\n\nI would therefore respectfully submit that the Department honour this account in the sum mentioned.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

Claydon Company was for labour only, during the nights of Dec. 24th and 25th, and Mr. Riley's work was still burning and almost continually bursting into flames, and at the same time the water was limited, I resolved myself to a portion of shovelling an area and keeping guard generally.\n\nThe amount due to Messrs. Old & Sons covers two items, 1st Work on Boiler Room and Heating Plant generally, necessary to operate the Heating System. This I have charged to the Heating Contractor (under Mr. Carson's contract) who was at that time in Vancouver and from whom the amount of $29.00 will be collected.\n\nI do not think that any of this...\nKamloops New Indian Residential School\nExtraordinary Expenditure to Date\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, ........................................... 192\n\nThis expenditure could be charged against the\nBuilding operations as such can only be\nattributed to unforeseen and unfortunate\ncircumstances created by the fire.\nDesiring that the action taken in this\nmatter meets with your approval.\n\nFaithfully,\n\nW.H.

Statement for your information.\n\nIn connection with this contract I beg to state that Mr. Carson requests that, in addition to the amount for which I enclose Certificate, that the 10% deduction allowance, or the amount of his deposit be now paid to him.\n\nThe points may be regarded as salient features:\n(a) The work covered by this contract is not complete.\n(b) The Department, owing to the fire, has been compelled to take possession of the building.\n(c) Other points emanate therefrom.\n\nSome of the work required to complete will have to await favourable weather.\n\n(a) From the standpoint point of view it would be a very decided advantage to hold back the unfinished work on the Centre Building until the \"Girls\" can be transferred to their new Government Quarter. In this way, which should be finished early in May next.\n\nThese points are suggested for your consideration therein.\n\nYours faithfully,\nH.M.

I may say that this explanation was given the Manager of the Dominion Bank here and it was expected that he would have passed it on to you but seemingly did not.\n\nAs to the Interest on the Bond the Finance Department pointed out that it is not due until 1st May and therefore in the meantime cannot be regarded as part of the security deposit.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant.\n\nMessrs.

Kindly accept our thanks for the prompt action.\n\nOur letter of the 10th inst., explains that accrued interest to date on coupons amounted to about $120.00 which added to Bonds would make security deposit fully 10% of our contract of $76,200.00. In addition to accrued interest on Bonds the Department has the accrued interest on deposit cheque being 3% on $8000.00 from say October 1st to January 31st $60.00, so we think all conditions necessary to ensure the return to us of the $8000.00 asked for in our letter of the 10th inst. have been filled.\n\nIf there are other reasons for retaining the exact amount required ($76,520.00) instead of depending on accrued interest will you kindly deduct a further $120.00 from the $500.00 you have on hand, and send us a cheque for $360.00. Our deposit on the Kamloops contract will then be Bonds $7500.00 cash $120.00 Total $7620.00 exactly 10% of our contract of $76200.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Claydon\n\nF. H.

McDonald.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I think it better to send these papers, rather than to draft a letter for the Minister's signature.\n\nIt will be impossible for us to pay the balance due Messrs. McDonald Brothers until the defective granite has been replaced to the satisfaction of our Inspector of Construction.\n\nThe use of granite in the trimmings of this building was specified at the special request of Mr. McBride, M.P.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to V.C. 33-25, forwarded from this office on January 18th, 1925, in favour of N.S.

Tredcroft, Division Engineer, Dominion Water Power Branch, Kamloops, B.C., which is self explanatory.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of Mr. Tredcroft's letter, I most respectfully submit that the Water Power Branch might be given a little more freedom with reference to making minor alterations and changes as might become necessary when doing any work of this nature, without having to hold up the work while authority is obtained from the Department at Ottawa, as suggested by Mr. Tredcroft, and I will be glad to have your instructions in this matter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of February 16th, having reference to extra expenditures on the Kamloops Industrial School sewage disposal plant, and would state that the decision to install the 4\" land tile at a depth of 4' instead of 1' 6\" was made by this office after excavation of the ground had been commenced and the nature of the soil at various depths determined.\n\nA letter re my intentions in this matter and requesting authority for same was forwarded on October 14th. by my head office at Vancouver to the Director of Water Power and Reclamation Services at Ottawa. The letter was duly acknowledged, authority from the Department of Indian Affairs for these changes, I presume, having been obtained.\n\nWith reference to the charge of $160.00 for the installation of two concrete inspection chambers which were not included in the original plan, these have not yet been installed, and though their installation is not absolutely essential, they would, in my opinion, greatly minimize the danger of any stoppage occurring in the pipes. Their construction, however, cannot be undertaken until the school building is further advanced.\n\nNo requisition for authority re these inspection chambers has yet been made, but requisition re this matter stating the reasons that make their installation desirable will be forwarded in the course of a few days.\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the fact that the new school building is being constructed in three sections, and although only one section is completed it is already occupied. This necessitated the sewage disposal plant being designed, constructed and made ready for use when the building was only one-third completed. Under these conditions, minor changes may be necessary from time to time in order to conform with the completed structure.\nI think it would be a good thing in future if in work of this nature I were given authority to make such minor changes as might be necessary without referring the matter to Ottawa at the time, as it is often impossible to cease work and wait while this authority is being obtained, provided, of course, that these changes do not increase the cost of the project beyond the original estimate that has already been approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) E.H.

Maclean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFeb. 25, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal Plant,\nKamloops Industrial School.\n\nWith reference to the construction of the Kamloops Industrial School sewage disposal plant, this work has now been completed in so far as it is possible until the school building is further advanced. There remains yet to be installed two outside lines of sewer pipe, having a total length of 240 feet, to connect the two wings with the present inspection chamber.\n\nEach of these outside sewer lines will be 120 feet in length and buried beneath the surface of the ground in front of the building at a depth of approximately 10 feet.\n\nIt is recommended that an extra inspection chamber be placed on each of these sewer lines close to the buildings, as shown by the accompanying plan (in duplicate). This will permit the cleansing out of the pipes should anything happen to cause a stoppage in either one of them. The two inner ones are not so long and do not require any additional provision for cleansing. The cost of the inspection chambers will amount to $30.00 each, or a total of $60.00.\n\nThe total expenditure on this plant, including the above mentioned additions, will be $3,385, whereas the original estimate was for $3,700.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nJ.T.

Sherry, O.C., Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\n\"Kawartha New Indian Residential School\"\n\nI very much regret that we are having a great deal of trouble with the drain gutters on both the main floor and chapel and I thought it would be advisable to communicate with you personally.\n\nNew Roof. The box gutter filled up with solid ice and hurt the drain, the downspout became frozen solid, the result of insufficient space and drain; consequently the water flowed down the face of the external walling and quickly formed a coating of ice on face of brick work, in places 3 inches; in addition to this very considerable amount of water came through the wall at the plate level and damaged the plaster, the two lowest places being top floor (ceiling wall) and top floor (outside wall).\n\nThe defect is, however, general on all four sides of the building, the two positions mentioned above having suffered most, so far as the condition of the building is concerned.\n\nI am convinced, as a general way, this question during your visit to Kawartha, and would have very strongly urge that the rainfall be charged as far as the girls living is concerned, without doubt this, the present method can only produce most unfortunate results leading to vexatious complaints every winter.\n\nFrom 15 years local experience I have found it absolutely necessary to discard both drain gutters and downspouts, that the most satisfactory job is to bring the eaves at least 2' beyond the face of the brickwork (or stuccoed wall as the case may be) and let them drip; a layer of roofing felt along the lower edge of roofing, immediately under chimney or gable cornice, usually affords sufficient protection against backing up of water during winter.\n\nIn this, the dry belt, the rains during spring and summer and autumn are quite negligible.\n\nThe enclosed sketch is a suggestion for your consideration, and shows a treatment which will, I think, give satisfactory results without interference with the appearance of the general design. This method also away with both box gutter and downspout, consequently is very much cheaper.\n\nI am somewhat at a loss as to a permanent remedy for the existing box gutter and should be pleased to learn what you would have me do, I am getting them made good as far as possible but whilst\nThey will be OK during the Spring & Summer. The Winter next year will undoubtedly cause us a repetition of the trouble.\n\nChapel Roof: In this case the downspout and gutter filled with cold ice and hurt every joint, in places even forced the gutter away from the fascia.\n\nFortunately very little water found its way into the Building and this all at plate level; it may be necessary to make good the plaster at this level.\n\nThe East and West walls were however externally a mass of solid ice, in places of considerable thickness. I employed three of Messrs. Clayton's men for the greater part of three days in clearing gutters and sawing off the roofs. The extent of the damage to these walls is of course difficult to see but must be considerable.\n\nIn the Empire Theater here we have a roof treated in a similar manner to the Chapel Roof and every location we got the same result, external walls a mass of ice and men employed keeping the roof clear of snow.\n\nIn the case of the Chapel I would strongly urge an immediate change and give this roof a projection of 2'6\". This can very readily be done by removing the buttress caps and carrying up the buttresses to the level of present bottom of gutter (about eight courses) the caps can then be treated somewhat as at present with the fascia being approximately placed on face of buttresses, discard the gutter and fix corresponding wood moulding. This mould would be at the same level as existing gutter and the roofing iron at eaves would be curved slightly from the singles downward, a treatment similar to that adopted on shelter for the roof of Girl Wing, but rather more thrown to the iron.\n\nThere is little doubt that the fire on the 1st Dec., very materially aggravated matters on the West Wall, where some minor repairs have been necessitated thereby.\n\nAs mentioned in my report, \"repairs,\" the granite caps to buttresses were improperly set and will have to come off and whilst the change I suggest will give a treatment somewhat different to the existing appearance, I will look fairly good (I treated the Catholic Church here in the same way three years ago and it gives absolutely no trouble).\n\nThe cost of this alteration need not be very considerable, but at the same time I am aware that owing to the extra re-bricks and other changes this Building will cost more than you anticipated; with this fact in mind I am sending you a copy.\nof the final statement showing exactly how matters stand from a general point of view, one or two matters are still under discussion but I do not expect any additions, but rather a slight deduction. The formal statement will be forwarded to the Department in the course of a few days.\n\nOn the other hand, if you decide to make the suggested change on the bricks being guttering, the saving likely should be sufficient, or nearly so, to make the necessary change to Chapel Road.\n\nWe shall be at roof level on bricks being in about ten days (weather permitting) consequently I should be glad to receive your decision as to bricks being lower as soon as possible, per telegram preferred.\n\nMr. Jennings, the foreman in charge for Mason Clayton (he was also at Hardiston) is purchasing the bricks being at a good rate, and with the exception of our difficulty with the pressed bricks, everything is going smoothly; he is I may say very anxious for a change of detail for the brick treatment.\n\nI expect to send you a few photos in the course of the next few days.\n\nUnder separate letter I am writing to you re the Dining Room Partition etc., I have taken the liberty of holding back this work for reasons I will explain in my letter.\n\nThe weather continues fairly mild, from 30\u00b0 to 36\u00b0 during the day to 26\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 at night, transportation is however greatly hampered by the excessive amount of snow still on the ground.\n\nWith kind regards and good wishes for the New Year,\n\nFaithfully,\n\nW.H. Macaulay.\n\nP.S. Please advise me as soon as possible. W.H.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Jan. 30, 1925.\n\nW. H.

James McGuire, O.M.I., drew to my attention the fact that the front door of the School is exposed to the sun from early morning until late in the afternoon the year round. He is afraid that once summer is here, the heat from the sun, which in this district is very severe for at least two months in the summer, will completely destroy the front door of the school, and made a request that I approach the Department with regard to having an awning placed to protect the door from the rays of the sun.\n\nI strongly recommend action along these lines being taken, and if I may be permitted, I would suggest that the Department approach Mr. MacAulay, the Building Inspector in charge of the erection of the school, with regard to having an awning placed before the heat of the sun has destroyed the door in question.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

This payment is being held up owing to the unsatisfactory condition of some of the granite furnished under this contract.\n\nWith a view to coming to some agreement I would ask you to arrange for a meeting at the building between yourself, Mr. Carson, the contractor and the representative of the firm who furnished the granite, and endeavour to reach a settlement. I am prepared to accept the granite that has been built into the building providing you can come to a reasonable settlement as to its value. If this can be done and the balance of the work has been satisfactorily completed, kindly forward at the earliest possible date a final certificate for the payment of Mr. Carson's contract. If, however, you cannot reach a settlement you should issue a certificate for all of the money due to Mr. Carson, holding back an amount to cover the defective granite, and furnish me with a report of the meeting. I am extremely anxious that if at all possible you will arrange a satisfactory settlement.\n\nKindly give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nW.

Macaulay\nArchitect of Contractor\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYour undated letter in reply to ours of the 20th ultimo was received here several days ago.\n\nSince receiving your letter we have given further study to the problems involved and correspondence, and have taken matters up with our sub-contractors to see if there is any way we could prevail on them to accept any responsibility regarding base.\n\nWe have had to admit, however, on a full discussion of specifications and drawings, and after laying the matter before competent authority in Winnipeg, that we have absolutely no ground for demanding that base, either asphalt, terrazzo or cement, be supplied.\n\nIn addition to the above we were actuated in trying to do all we reasonably could to relieve the situation, but a further review of this feature of it brings us to the conclusion that we have already gone the other mile.\n\nThe Kamloops work has been full of difficulties. The weather was so exceptionally severe, being, according to all local reports, one of the worst winters known since settlement began in the district, and had it not been for the fire we would have closed the work down until later. We feel sure you will understand we have made a heavy contribution by keeping the building operations going continuously.\n\nWith regard to the base question, we submit the following prices for base in lieu of the wood specified:\n\n- Asphalt base to go with asphalt floor - $96.00\n- To go with Terrazzo floor - $174.00\n- Cement base to go with Terrazzo floor - $140.00\n- Terrazzo base to go with Terrazzo floors - $320.00\n- Red quarry base to go with asphalt floor - $230.00\n- Red quarry base to go with terrazzo \" - $460.00\n\nThe above are all net prices and we have not charged any commission for them.\n\nWe trust from these figures that if you care for an additional base to that specified, you will be able to make a selection.\nWith regard to the wood shingles, we note the reference in your letter is to \"Perfection\" shingles. If the reference in specification had been in like manner, we would have concluded when tendering on the work that something more than quality was denoted. It is quite true, as you suggest, that we were not acquainted with the term, and we regret very much that our introduction to it, through the way it has been set forth in your specification, has cost us $175.00, and as your building has received the benefit of this $175.00, we trust that you will be able to remember this in our favour at some future time.\n\nRegarding the remarks about septic tank in our letter of the 26th ultimo, we note with pleasure that Mr. Macauley had nothing whatever to do with the awarding of the contract for this piece of work.\n\nWith reference to ambiguity in plans and specifications, we trust you will agree with us that this is a very difficult and often delicate situation to handle. They crop up on almost every job. Some architects and engineers expect them, and being prepared to meet them in a fair way, look with disfavour on a contractor who raises them immediately after receiving the contract. Our experience along this line had led us to meet matters of this kind as we come to them, especially where we think we are in fair hands. That is how we regard the work for your Department, and up to now feel that the experience has justified such an appraisal of it, and we trust the pleasant relations thus established will continue.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nE.C.R.\n\nE.

Matters are now proceeding fairly satisfactorily.\n\nLaundry Machinery: This is now in place and working out very well excepting the Laundry tubs which have rather unfortunately tilted, hence I have taken the liberty of changing with satisfactory results.\n\nElectric Lighting: This work has proceeded smoothly and is quite up to date.\n\nPlaster: I believe two plasterers taken have been away, I had intended sending in a newer; cleaning down the backwork however has been delayed away to local shortage of materials and immediately the work is completed I will follow as promised.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMcKenzie\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 832-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, 1st May 1925\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that nothing has been done on the Centre Building since my last report.\n\nAs to the question of floor finish with Messrs.

Father McQuaid expressed a wish that any work on the Cottage Building be executed during May when he proposes to grant the Ladies and Girls a vacation.\n\nAnother point in connection with the Building is that the pressure of the water supply is at times barely sufficient to flush the toilets on the upper floor and has at times caused inconvenience in carrying out building operations on the lower floor.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM.

Mr. Benson came up from Vancouver and the question was discussed from the different points of view. Finally we reached an agreement subject to confirmation first from the Department second from the sub-contractor who supplied the granite. By this Agreement the Department will accept the granite supplied as \"defective granite\" in consideration of which, the Contractor Mr. Benson will allow the sum of One thousand dollars any other to be deducted from his contract amount.\n\nTo-day I have received your telegram stating that the above agreement will be satisfactory to the Department in reply to your wire of the 14th inst.\n\nOn Thursday last the 16th inst. I received a letter confirming the arrangement from Mr. Benson. I am forwarding herewith the original for your information and record, the duplicate being retained for filing.\n\nWith the settlement of the granite question the outlook is much clearer and I have good prospects of getting this contract completed in the near future.\n\nI fully discussed all outstanding matters in the way of incomplete and defective...\"\nOctober\n\nWork, with Mr. Carson and he has promised to complete or rectify same in the near future; these items comprise portions of defective plastering, glazed brick work in kitchens, new building to chapel external stonework, metal building in central rooms, the master floor, ventilating to corridor floor and certain external doors, making good or replacing the main entrance door which have checked badly, and generally cleaning down of concrete steps etc.\n\nThese items are chiefly the concern of the sub-contractor and could more conveniently be carried out during the vacation. The Rev. Father McGavin proposes, consequently I am trying to arrange matters with due regard to the convenience of all concerned.\n\nIn any case I feel that it is most necessary to retain the $1000.00 shown on the enclosed statement until these several matters have been adjusted.\n\nWith this exception I think it now in order to issue a certificate for the 10% viz $9178.60 and will forward this tomorrow.

Carpentry this trade is also satisfactory. Doors, including the attic, floors are now closed and a large proportion of the trim is in place. The finisher will apply the doors and finishing lumber generally was hurled to the ground on Wednesday last, it is therefore expected that some delay may occur on this account. The final shipment of doors etc. was expected this week end.\n\nHeating Plumbing Ventilation.

Sprange mentioned therein called at our office yesterday and gave us further particulars with respect to his interview with Mr. Orr regarding terrazzo flooring. We will arrange to put in a 14\" border and an 8\" base as suggested in your letter.\n\nWith reference to the mastic asphalt flooring, we cannot agree that was the true intent and meaning of the drawings and specifications - that asphalt base be provided. If we had had no other dealings with the Department of Indian Affairs, excepting our experience at Kamloops, we would on no account compromise from our stand that this work if put in should be paid for as extra.\n\nWe based our tender on Kamloops on the treatment accorded us by the Department with respect to Edmonton and Cardston schools, and if you will look over your records you will find that on the closing date of the Kamloops tender a reduction in price of nearly $3,000.00 was wired to Mr. Scott. This was done after the writer had visited Cardston, and was based on our experience there, although when the correct costs at Cardston were ascertained we found we were too sanguine in making this reduction.\n\nOur experience at Kamloops has not been nearly as satisfactory as at Edmonton or Cardston. We will, however, instal the mastic base as outlined in your letter, and trust it may be remembered in our favour at some future time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nEC/E.\n\nJ.

Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nJune First Nineteen-Twenty-five.\n\nDear Mr. Scotts-\n\nThis morning on opening our mail, we found there was no remittance from the Department as suggested by your last letter of the 26th inst. We therefore wired you and enclose confirmation of the message. The registered mail this afternoon brought us the return of the deposits amounting in all to $13,500.00, so had we waited a few hours, we need not have sent the telegram.\n\nWe were very surprised that our tender on the Blood School at Cardston, was not the lowest. We left our plant on the reserve last fall in the hopes that it would be of use to us there this summer. The fact that our tender is not the lowest cannot be on account of not trying hard to secure the contract, for we gave the tender for the proposed school, the benefit of all we had learned from our previous work for the Department. We trust at some future time we may have the pleasure of securing other contracts on work under your charge.\n\nIt is hoped that you will soon have funds available which will permit the payment of the Kamloops certificates. At the time of writing, there is lodged with the Department, unpaid certificates No. S & P, amounting in all to about $14,000.00. The latest advice from Kamloops informs us that approximately another $4000.00 has been earned. As it is only by special arrangement with our bank that we were able to put up deposit on the Blood School while waiting for payment on Kamloops, we are sure you will realize that we will be very pleased indeed, to receive payment of these outstanding amounts. Will you kindly wire us as soon as funds are available.

You are authorized to purchase, after securing competitive prices, materials for painting the outbuildings at the school. The sum of $200 should not be exceeded. The school management should be responsible for all labour required.\n\nI regret that there are no funds available for the purpose of assisting with the purchase of a truck for the use of the school. It has been the practice of the Department to ask principals to finance this type of equipment from the per capita or other earnings. Please inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Rule 154-0-12, March 26, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter above referred to I beg to enclose herewith copy of letter received from Rev. Father McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops Residential School, in which he makes a request for authority to expend a sum not exceeding $200.00 in the purchase of paint to complete the painting of the buildings on the Kamloops school site. With regard to this I might state that the buildings to which the Rev. Father refers are very badly in need of paint and I would strongly recommend that favourable consideration be given to this request.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of the Rev. Father's letter, I might state that I am as yet without the itemized statement of the goods and tools required.\n\nRegarding the third paragraph of the letter in which the Rev. Father requests information stating to what extent the Department would assist him in the purchase of a motor truck, I might state there is reasonableness in Rev. Father's suggestion, owing to the fact that he has to take a team off the land and also utilize the services of two or more of the larger boys in the hauling of freight, etc., between town and the school. Whether or not the Department would consider assisting the Rev. Father in this matter, I cannot say, but leave the question entirely in the hands of the Department, and would ask you to advise me as to what decision you arrive at. I might state that the Rev. Father has expressed his willingness to pay the balance of the purchase price on the motor truck if the Department would assist him to the extent of $700 or $800.00.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian School, Kamloops, B.C.\nMay 7, 1925.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nOur requisition for paint last fall left one side and one end of our barn unfinished.\n\n1. We are now asking you to present a request to the Department for paint not to exceed $200.00 to finish the painting of the barn, two silos, the boys' class room and the cottage for the farm instructor, besides the ceiling in horse and dairy barn.\n\n2. We are also enclosing the list for tools which has been revised.\n\n3. Would you oblige us also by giving us information stating to what extent the Department would aid us in purchasing a motor truck? On the different roads and from every point of the compass we receive daily freight, trunks and baggage of all kinds, besides mail and express packages from as many more quarters. It has come to such a pass that we can no longer cope with the situation with a team without encroaching on the boys' class or being in one continual war over demurrage charges.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

C.\nJune 20th., 1925.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Kamloops Industrial School, situated on the Kamloops Indian Reserve, on the north bank of the South Thompson River, at a distance of three miles from the City of Kamloops, is at the present time in the course of construction. It is a brick building 57 feet in height and when finished will cover an area of 520 feet by 90 feet. It is being constructed in three units as follows:\n\n1. centre portion,\n2. left wing,\n3. right wing.\n\nBoth the centre portion and left wing are practically completed, but there yet remains the right wing to be constructed. When finished this building will be capable of accommodating 250 persons.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES\n\nThe maximum daily water requirements for domestic purposes in this institution, assuming 250 persons resident in the building, will amount to 40 U.S. gallons.\n40 U.S. gallons per capita, or a total of 10,000 U.S. gallons per day.\n\nWATER REQUIREMENTS FOR FIRE PROTECTION PURPOSES\n\nThe building, as stated above, is 57 feet in height and will cover an area of 28,800 square feet. It will have a value when finished, including fittings, of over $200,000 and should therefore be supplied with sufficient water to afford protection in the event of fire. The minimum amount of water necessary to afford proper protection to a building of this kind is 500 U.S. g.p.m. (i.e., 2 standard fire streams of 240 U.S. g.p.m. each, playing simultaneously). This amount should be available for a considerable period in order that a possible outbreak of fire, no matter how severe, may be subdued.\n\nPOSSIBLE SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY\n\nThe only possible source of water supply for the Kamloops Industrial School is the South Thompson River, and this river being at a lower elevation than the ground on which the school is constructed, no water for either domestic or fire protection purposes can be obtained except by pumping.\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY\n\nWater is obtained from the South Thompson River by means of a 4 x 5 reciprocating pump, belt-connected to a 2 H.P. 220 volt induction motor. This pump has a capacity of 20 U.S. g.p.m. and supplies water to a steel tank having a storage capacity of 1200 U.S. gallons. This storage tank is what is known...\nis what is known as a pneumatic storage tank, water being maintained in it under an air pressure of from 45 to 60 pounds per square inch. No water supply other than the above is at present available for the new school building.\n\nREMARKS RE PRESENT WATER SUPPLY\n\nThe present water supply was designed for domestic use in the old school building, which building was recently destroyed by fire, and it is in no way adequate to provide water for either fire protection or domestic purposes in the new institution. It is far too small and not capable of satisfactory enlargement for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The storage capacity of the present tank (1200 U.S. gallons) is too small to supply the new building, and additional tanks would have to be provided. These extra tanks, which are expensive, would only be of use in the event of fire.\n\n(2) The existing pump house is too small to house the present pumping equipment together with additional storage tanks.\n\n(3) The present pump, with capacity of 20 U.S. g.p.m., would have to be replaced with a larger pump, capacity 80 U.S. g.p.m.\n\n(4) A fire pump, capacity 500 U.S. g.p.m., would have to be provided and pump house constructed to house same.\n\n(5) With a pneumatic storage system it is not possible to install one pump with large capacity (i.e., 500 U.S. g.p.m.) for use in the event of fire, and\nfire, and arrange same so that it would also deliver water economically to comparatively small capacity pneumatic tanks operating under low pressure.\n\n(6) A large pump suitable for fire protection, operating on a voltage of 2200 volts, cannot easily be arranged to commence and cease operation automatically as in the present system where the voltage is 220 volts, and it would therefore require to be started by hand several times a day in order to replenish the 1200 gallon tank, unless additional tanks are provided. (The average daily consumption of water in the institution being approximately 10,000 U. S. gallons).\n\n(7) The cost of remodelling the present system so that it would be suitable for both domestic and fire protection purposes would be so great that for practically the same amount a complete new water system of different type and more suitable for general use by the above institution can be constructed as outlined below.\n\nPART 2.\n\nPROPOSED CONCRETE RESERVOIR AND FIRE PUMP\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nWater to be obtained from the South Thompson River by means of a centrifugal pump direct connected to a 60 H.P. 2200 volt A. C. induction motor, situated in a concrete pump house on the north bank of the South Thompson River immediately behind the new school building. (See accompanying plan No. 1) This pump will have a capacity of 500 U. S. g.p.m. and will supply water to a concrete reservoir of 18,000 U. S. gallons\ncapacity to be constructed on the high ground situated behind the school.\n\nThe reservoir will be for domestic purposes and for immediate use in the event of fire, until such time as the pump may be placed in operation. After this has been accomplished, the reservoir may, by means of valves, be cut out of the system and the pump used to supply water at high pressure to four hydrants situated near to and outside the new school building. (See accompanying plan No. 1) By this method water will be available for domestic use at a pressure of 40 pounds per square inch and for fire protection purposes at a pressure of 75 pounds per square inch, both pressures being suitable for the purpose for which they are required.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nMachinery\n\nWater will be obtained from the South Thompson River by means of a centrifugal pump having a capacity of 500 U.S.g.p.m. and capable of delivering this amount against a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch at the discharge (with no suction lift), direct connected to one 60 H.P., 2200 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle, induction motor, equipped with starting compensator, overload and no voltage release.\n\nPump House\n\nBoth pump and motor will be situated in a concrete pump house to be installed on the north bank of the South Thompson River immediately behind the new school building. This pump house will be 11'6\" x 11'6\" in size and will be connected with the river by means of an intake pipe.\nIntake Pipe\n\n120 feet in length, constructed of\n12\" vitrified sewer pipe.\n\nReservoir for Domestic Purposes\n\nThe above pump will supply water against\na total head, including friction head, of 212 feet\nto a concrete reservoir 25' x 10' x 11' having a\nstorage capacity of 18,000 gallons, by means of an\n\nPipe Line\n\n6\" diameter wood stave pipe line, 1750\nfeet in length. (See accompanying plan No. 1)\n\nThis pipe line will serve as both intake\nto and outlet from the reservoir and 6\" diameter\nwood stave pipe will be installed from the pump\nhouse to the school buildings to connect with the\nproposed fire hydrants and inside piping for\ndomestic supply.\n\nHydrants (outside)\n\nFive standard, two-plug, frost-proof\nfire hydrants will be installed in the school\ngrounds, as shown on the accompanying plans,\nfour in close proximity to the school building\nand one in the vicinity of the barn and out-\nbuildings. These hydrants have been located far\nenough away from the building so that in the\nevent of fire no interference with their proper\noperation through heat, falling debris, etc.\nneed be anticipated.\n\nHydrants (inside)\n\nThe above building being already\nequipped on the inside with suitable piping, fire\nhydrants, hoses.\nhydrants, hoses, nozzles, etc., no additional inside equipment will be necessary, beyond a suitable connection between the interior piping and the outside supply mains.\n\nGate Valves\n\nGate valves have been placed on all lines at positions where their installation is considered necessary. (See accompanying plan No. 5)\n\nCheck Valve\n\nA check valve has been provided on the main discharge pipe to protect the pump from water hammer should the power be cut off at any time when the pump is being operated.\n\nPressure Reducing Valves\n\nA pressure reducing valve has been installed on the by-pass between the main supply pipe and the school mains in order that water for domestic purposes may be obtained in the building at all times under low pressure, even though the pump is operating and the reservoir being filled at the time this water is required.\n\nAir-Relief Valve\n\nAn air-relief valve has been located on the main supply pipe at the top of the vertical curve in order to minimize any danger of interruption to the service through the accumulation of air in the pipe. This valve has been protected by a gate valve to facilitate repairs, etc. (See plan No. 4)\nFoot Valve\n\nA foot valve has been provided at the bottom of the suction pipe to allow of easy priming.\n\nRelief Valve\n\nA relief valve situated in a concrete valve box will be installed (See accompanying plan No. 1) so that should the pump at any time succeed in building up an excessively high pressure swing to the reservoir having been cut out of the system and all hydrants closed, same will operate and relieve the pressure in the mains.\n\nDrain Pipe\n\nA 4\" diameter drain pipe leading to the intake well in the pump house and connected with the main supply pipe has been provided, in order that the reservoir may be emptied at any time to allow for repairs, cleaning, etc.\n\nScreens\n\nTwo screens of large area have been provided, one situated in the intake well and the other on the suction pipe.\n\nBy-Pass (priming)\n\nA by-pass with valve which draws its supply from the discharge side of the check valve has been installed on the main pipe line to allow the pump to be primed.\n\nPower Line\n\nThe present transmission line which supplies the school with power and light is too near the new building and a portion of this line must be...\nmust be relocated to avoid the danger of same being burned down in the event of fire. (See accompanying plan No. 1)\n\nOutside Equipment\n\nThe outside equipment necessary to complete the installation will be as follows:\n\n- 500 lineal feet 2\" diameter, grade 2 fire hose,\n- 4 standard fire nozzles, 1 1/8\" diameter,\n- 1 50' telescopic fire ladder,\n- 4 fire axes,\n- 1 wooden shelter for hose, etc.\n\nOperating Conditions\n\nPressure (Domestic)\n\nFrom a study of the accompanying plans it will be seen that the elevation of the surface of the water in the reservoir will be 150.00 and that the elevation of the pipe where it enters the school building for domestic supply is 50.00. The static pressure in the domestic supply pipe at the ground floor will therefore amount to 45 pounds per square inch, which is a suitable pressure for domestic purposes in a large institution of this kind.\n\nPressure (Fire)\n\nAs stated above, in the event of fire the reservoir may be cut out of the system and the pump can supply water to the most distant hydrant through 650 feet of 6\" diameter main. The static pressure in the hydrant will be 70 pounds per square inch, which is sufficient to allow of two 1 1/8\" diameter standard fire nozzles, each attached to 100 feet of fire hose and discharging 240 U.S.g.p.m., being operated at the same time, the pressure of and the amount of water discharged by each of these nozzles being what is known as a standard fire stream.\nstandard fire stream. The height above the ground at which water may be applied from either of the above streams is equal to 65 feet. From this it will be observed that no part of the building will be without adequate protection in the event of fire.\n\n**EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION**\n\nThe proposed plant has been designed so that the pump and motor will operate at maximum efficiency when performing their average daily work, and a pump will be selected whose efficiency is greatest when delivering against a pressure of 85 to 100 pounds per square inch. When the reservoir is being filled, the pump will deliver against a total head of 212 feet, as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Feet |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Static head                                      | 150  |\n| Friction loss in 1750 feet of 6\" diameter main    | 31   |\n| Friction loss in fittings, gate valves, check    | 19   |\n| valves, etc.                                     |      |\n| Friction loss in pump and suction                | 12   |\n| **Total**                                        | **212** |\n\nwhich is equivalent to a pressure of 91 pounds per square inch at the discharge.\n\n**COST OF OPERATION (Power)**\n\nThe above pump will deliver to the reservoir at the rate of 500 U. S. g.p.m. and assuming an average daily consumption of 10,000 U. S. gallons, the cost of power for operation for a month of 30 days would equal the cost of power for 450 Kilowatt hours. At the rate at which this institution is charged for power by the City of Kamloops this charge will amount to $16.00 per month.\n\n**COST OF INSTALLATION**\n\nThe cost of installation of the above plant\nplant, including purchase of machinery, material and fittings, and the construction of the reservoir, pump house, concrete valve boxes, etc., will amount to $9,680.00 (See Appendix \"A\") but against this total cost must be placed the value of the equipment at present in use and which will be released for sale or for use at some other Government institution should the above scheme be carried out. The value of this equipment at a conservative estimate is $500.00 (See Appendix \"D\") and the final cost of the above project will therefore amount to $9,180.00.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS\n\n(1) Under the proposed scheme, water for domestic purposes will be available at a pressure of 45 pounds per square inch and for fire protection purposes at a pressure of 75 pounds per square inch. An adequate supply under gravity will be instantly available in the event of fire to last until the pump can be started. After this has been accomplished an amount of 500 U.S. g.p.m. will be available continuously.\n\n(2) A centrifugal pump has been specified for this installation as these pumps are satisfactory for fire service, are simple and easy to operate and may be started by persons not ordinarily familiar with the operation of machinery.\n\n(3) 8\" diameter wood stave pipe has been specified for this installation owing to its comparatively low first cost, and the life of wood stave pipe in this locality may be assumed as being 7 years while...\n7 years, while the life of the remainder of the plant may be considered as being 30 years. Should it be desired, however, to install cast iron pipe throughout in place of the wood stave pipe specified in this report, thus making the life of the whole plant equal to 30 years, the cost of the above project will be increased by an amount of $2,800.00.\n\n**DISPOSAL OF PRESENT EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe present pumping equipment consisting of\n\n1. 4 x 5 reciprocating pump, capacity 20 U.S.g.p.m.,\n2. 2 H.P. induction motor,\n3. steel pressure tank and fittings, capacity 1200 U.S. gallons,\n\nand having an estimated value of $800.00, may either be disposed of by sale or removed for use at some other Government institution.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the above scheme as outlined in this report be installed at the Kamloops Industrial School and that the work be undertaken as soon as convenient, this institution being at the present time without adequate water supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDivision Engineer.\n\nC.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince our last communication with respect to Kamloops Indian School, we have heard from Mr. E. Claydon, Jr., that Mr. Macauley has given him an acceptance of the building and submitted the final report to the Department.\n\nUntil the day before this was done, we understood that Mr. Macauley was well satisfied with everything and that he had no reservations to make that would deter from an unqualified approval of everything in connection with our work for the Department. Until Mr. Claydon returns to the City, which will be this week, all we can say at the present time is that our experience with Mr. Macauley has been very disappointing.\n\nWe trust however, that such an acceptance as has been given, places our account in such shape that you will be able to pay us the 10% retained and return our contract deposit without further delay.\n\nWe understand the question of the additional work amounting, we believe, to about $4000.00, will have to be the subject of correspondence after Mr. Claydon returns, but we would be very glad if the other payments can be made now. Will you kindly arrange this and advise if we may expect it within the next few days.\n\nIt is reported that Father Maguire has expressed himself as being extremely well satisfied with everything about the building and is happy to take possession.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE. Claydon\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn going over the settlement of work with Mr. Macauley, we find that it is an utter impossibility to arrive at a reasonable basis for settlement and in spite of making concessions to him in carrying out the work which he was not entitled to and further reducing some of the items for additions to the contract in the hope of getting him to accept our statement, we have been obliged to close up at Kamloops and leave the whole question of payment for additional work to be taken up ourselves with the Department.\n\nOur statement on this matter is now being prepared and we hope to despatch it in a few days. In the meantime, as the amount is rather large and as stated before, a lot of the work having done a number of months, will you please favor us with a speedy settlement of the 10% remaining on the contract.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE. Claydon\n\nEC/A.\nJuly Eighteenth Nineteen-Twenty-five.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE ZAMLOOPS SCHOOL - Reference 150-0-5\n\nWe note from your letter of the 8th inst., that our deposit security will be released thirty days from the date of the acceptance of the building. We have what purports to be Mr. Macauley's acceptance under date of July 10th, so we trust we may expect that on August 10th, you will be able to return our deposit.\n\nThere still remains the question of the 10% retained. You will notice that Mr. Macauley's certificate only gives us 90% of the contract amount and nothing whatever on the additional items. We think that we should at least, have had some kind of a certificate on such additional items as Mr. Macauley has passed.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Macauley's acceptance has prepared the way for you to pay us the 10% retained. We trust we are correct in this understanding and that if payment is not already on the way to us, may we ask you to kindly arrange to let us have the benefit of it at once.\n\nOur account for additional work after deducting the credits allowed, is approximately $4000.00. A number of these items have been passed and agreed to by Mr. Macauley and the balance left for us to take up with the Department direct. Some of these items have been completed for months.

Macaulay\n\nReference Item 8\n\nNo ventilation (except one to the Dairy Roof) was included in either the Contract for Centre portion or the Girls Wing. In this climate ventilation are absolutely essential.

We are well content to bear such losses as come our way when we find they are made through our own mistakes, but in this particular case where the loss is the result of the circumstances mentioned herein, we trust we may receive your cooperation in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Clayton\n\nPresident.\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nJuly Twenty-third Nineteen-Twenty-five.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThe final account with respect to the work at Kamloops which has been the subject of discussion between ourselves and Mr. Macauley, is being sent to the Department today. In addition to the account rendered Mr. Macauley, we invite your consideration of another situation which confronts us.\n\nYou will remember that when we placed our bid on this work, it was based on completing contract in about five months and further, that on the day the tenders closed, you received a wire from us stating that we could reduce our written tender by $2,112.00. Will you kindly note the estimated length of time in which we could complete contract and the most of the reduction offered from our tender, was based on being able to work continuously through the winter without serious climatic hindrances.\n\nUnfortunately last winter Kamloops was visited by the most severe weather and continued cold on record. So much so, that our work might have been carried out on the prairies where continued low temperature is to be expected.\n\nWe had under consideration the question of closing down the work owing to the severe weather, but cancelled these when we were aware of the situation brought about by the fire in December last. We felt there was an urgent need for the building and in the hope that the weather at that time would prove to be only of temporary severity, we adopted the policy of continuous operation. We have spent an additional $650.00 in wages and other expenses, to offset the winter weather and suggest that the Department bear $4000.00 or two thirds of the loss.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit that I am in receipt of a request from Rev. Father McGuire, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, that he be supplied with 1200 feet of flooring for repairs to the floor of the recreation hall and the outside platform leading to same, in the old building at present occupied by the boys at the Industrial School.\n\nRegarding this matter I might state that while Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn was visiting this Agency last week, both he and I took the opportunity of going through the old building and Mr. Ditchburn authorized me to state that, in view of the fact that it is not the intention of the Department to construct the boys' new wing in the immediate future, that he would recommend that the 1200 feet of flooring be supplied as requested.\n\nI would therefore ask you to authorize me to make the necessary purchase in order that the floors may be repaired, as the same are in very bad condition.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

To date, we have received no reply to our communication and as there is a very large sum of money involved, may we ask you in the event of funds not already being on the way to us, to take such steps as will result in us receiving payment at a very early date.\n\nWe are anxious to close out matters with our subcontractors. Kamloops is a long way from here and we shall be very sorry to have to keep our subcontractors waiting beyond the usual period for your final payment.\n\nIn addition to the percentage retained on the contract and our account for additional work, you still have our contract deposit. We have a communication under the signature of Mr. MacKenzie, which promises release of this deposit thirty days after the building was taken over. As the building was taken over July 10th, we trust we are correct in assuming that security deposit would be automatically released to us on August 10th and as result, is now on the way to us.\n\nThe above items roughly enumerated are as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Contract Deposit and Interest | $8200.00 |\n| Percentage Retained           | 7600.00  |\n| Additional Items Approximately| 4000.00  |\n\nTotal: $19800.00\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 4)\nThis makes a very large sum of money in comparison to the size of our contract and amounts, as you will see, to about 25% of the amount of contract. It is no doubt needless for us to state how much we would appreciate payment of all or at least part of this amount.\n\nYour kind co-operation will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWe have received over the signature of Mr. MacKenzie, under date of August 11th, a statement of various items which are deducted from our account rendered with respect to the above building.\n\nIt is impossible for us at this time, to make a full reply to this remarkable document, but we must state most emphatically that the allegations made by the Inspector as reported therein, are a tissue of garbled half-truths and deliberate misrepresentation throughout.\n\nWhile we are not surprised at anything Mr. Macauley may do, it is a matter of amazement to us that the Department would make such deductions from our account in what appears to us, an arbitrary fashion, without giving us an opportunity of replying to the statements reported to have been made by Mr. Macauley. In fact, we cannot at this time believe it is really the intention of the Department to make Mr. MacKenzie's letter, a final statement.\n\nOwing to the absence from the city of all our men who took part in this work, may we ask you to kindly hold the account open until we are able to make a further detailed reply to the statements made in Mr. MacKenzie's letter.\n\nThe writer is prepared if need be, to visit Ottawa and take this matter up in person with the Department.\n\nWhy should Mr. Macauley give us his final certificate of acceptance as having earned the full amount of the contract, if he had these deductions to make and if there was any vestige of truth in them? Our representative was at Kamloops with the express purpose of dealing with him, yet he made no mention of such deductions as are shown in Mr. MacKenzie's letter.\nAugust Fifteenth Nineteen-Twenty-five.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRE GIRL'S BUILDING, INDIAN SCHOOL, KAMLOOPS\n\nWe have received over the signature of Mr. MacKenzie, under date of August 11th, a statement of various items which are deducted from our account rendered with respect to the above building.\n\nIt is impossible for us at this time, to make a full reply to this remarkable document, but we must state most emphatically that the allegations made by the Inspector as reported therein, are a tissue of garbled half-truths and deliberate misrepresentation throughout.\n\nWhile we are not surprised at anything Mr. Macauley may do, it is a matter of amazement to us that the Department would make such deductions from our account in what appears to us, an arbitrary fashion, without giving us an opportunity of replying to the statements reported to have been made by Mr. Macauley.

We have completed our work, but we are not satisfied with the manner in which the General Contractors are settling the accounts. We ask you to protect us against loss, as we cannot afford to take a chance on losing the balance that is due us, which amounts to $3480.00.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter we sent Claydon Company Limited, also a copy of their reply.

We shall expect the final payment of the contract to reach us before that time expires, which is the fourth of August.\n\nI was over at the Indian School this morning and would say that it is still there and everything looked O.K.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCARR & SON,\n\nF.W.C.: NJ\n\n(cop)\nCARR & SON\n\nPLUMBERS, STEAM and HOT WATER FITTERS\n\n365 Seymour Street,\nKamloops, B.

We cannot agree with you that the final payment is due, for while the contract does state twenty-eight days after completion, it is also provided however on the written certificate of the Architect.\n\nAs Mr. Macauley has certified to the 80% only, leaving it for the Department to make a ruling with respect to the final certificate, we are unable to state how the matter will be disposed of. We expect, however, that the Department will, in a very short time, signify their acceptance by the payment of the 20% still held and as soon as this is done, you will receive your share of it.\n\nWe have had no certificate with respect to the additional work, nor do we know how the department will handle it. Owing to the way in which Mr. Macauley handled it, we think it will be the subject of separate payments, but will advise you of this as soon as we hear from the Department about it. The additional items account went forward to Ottawa from Winnipeg, July 24th and up to the present, we have not had any reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY, LIMITED.\n\n...........\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 832-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, Aug. 27, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the heating contract for the Kamloops School, I beg to say that the twenty percent held back from Clayton Co.'s contract was paid to them on August 13th, as this was thirty days after the completion of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The class rooms are very comfortable, well lighted and well ventilated, and the teachers and pupils alike appear to be very comfortable and happy in their new quarters.\n\nThere are, however, one or two recommendations which I would like to submit, and to which I would ask the Department to give favourable consideration, and if possible, grant same.\n\nDuring the course of my visit to the Senior Girls, the Sister in charge of the class, Sister M. Armella, had the girls sing, and I must admit that the performance of the children would do credit to an advanced white school. Sister M. Armella appears to be very competent, not only in instructional ability, but also in singing. The same applies to the boys who have Mr. Pollock as teacher. Both Mr. Pollock and Sister M. Armella are musically inclined, and I regret to state that neither the boys' side nor the girls' side has a musical instrument of any kind to assist, either in the musical tuition, or in the conduct of church services.\n\nUpon taking the matter up with the Rev. Father and teachers interested, I ascertained that for the girls' side, a piano would be preferable, and for the boys' side a small reed organ, and I most respectfully submit that the Department supply the Kamloops Residential School with the above mentioned instruments. I am of the opinion that, if I am authorized to make purchase of these articles, that a very good second hand piano and organ can be purchased at the Heintzman Agency at Kamloops, for a reasonable figure. I am sure the Department will agree with me that it is essential that they, at least, should have one musical instrument on each side of the school, and I therefore ask favourable consideration of this request.\n\nAnother matter which attracted me was the fact that the teachers have no desks in the class rooms, for themselves, and no shelves on which to keep their class-room books. The only desks they have are improvised ones, made by the boys themselves, and which are very inefficient. The class-room books are all stored in a corner of the class room in a pile made on the floor. I most respectfully submit that I be authorized to supply a teacher's desk in each class room, of which, at present, there are four, and also a small shelf or case in each room for the teacher's use.\n\nAll of the above most respectfully submitte\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\nOttawa, October 22, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the request made by the authorities of the Kamloops Indian Residential School to be supplied a piano for the use of the girls and a small reed organ for the boys, as well as a teacher's desk and shelves or a bookcase in each room to store classroom supplies.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department does not supply pianos or organs to Indian schools and it is regretted that we will be unable to comply with the request to furnish same.\n\nThe Department will approve of the purchase of two teachers' desks and two small cupboards for the classrooms and you may arrange for the purchase of this equipment. You should obtain competitive prices from a number of firms and purchase the desks and two cupboards of a size that would be suitable for the storing of classroom books. Procure the articles from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is not intended that an expensive type of teacher's desk be obtained. When the above purchases have been made, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Nov. 21, 1925.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nAs the accommodation at the School is proving insufficient, I am asking you to request the Department to place in the estimates an item to cover the construction price of the boys' wing which should be completed during the coming summer.\n\nAs you know, we have spent practically no energy in recruiting, and yet our numbers in about three months, have gone from seventy to pretty nearly twice that number. We thought first that, probably our house would be too spacious. Such is not the case. There are plenty of children to fill it as experience proves. Hence our request that the boys' wing be erected next summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.,\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nOttawa, November 24th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School requesting that a quantity of varnish be supplied for the floors of the new wing.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that varnish is not a suitable finish except for the floors in the staff rooms. The floors in the classrooms, dormitories, etc., should be oiled. You may purchase one barrel of suitable oil after securing competitive prices. The school management should be responsible for the applying of the oil. In future, the Rev. Principal will have to make purchase of the oil that is necessary for the floors, as it is our practice to allow first coat only in new buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter this day received from Rev.

Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nHFH/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian School, Kamloops, Nov. 12, 1925.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWould you oblige me by calling the attention of the Department to the fact that the floors in the new wing have not received sufficient varnish? These floors are of good material, B.C. Fir; they are not supposed to be washed.\n\nBy what we can learn the English Varnish No. 61, gives most satisfaction, and we would require about a hundred gallons. If authority cannot be secured to purchase the entire amount, please let us know what quantity they would authorize us to purchase now, and we will apply it where most necessary at present and secure the remainder later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n( James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\nOttawa, November 5, 1925.\n\nGeorge S.

A.\nOttawa, November 5, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in which he requests authority to expend a sum not exceeding $60 in the purchase of material for the purpose of installing a temporary shower bath in the new laundry for the use of the boys. In reply I beg to confirm the following night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"May incur expenditure not exceeding sixty dollars in providing bathing facilities Kamloops School.\"\n\nThe amount authorized is to provide the material only, as it is expected that the school authorities will perform the labour without charge to the Department. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded in the usual manner, covering the cost of the material. The above authorized amount should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. S. Fraschell, Esq.,\nInspector, Indian Agencies,\n39 Clerk St.,\nKamloops, B. C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to submit herewith copy of letter received today at this office from Rev. Father McGuire, O.M.I., Principal of the Kamloops Industrial School, which speaks for itself.\n\nThe Rev. Father has impressed on me the necessity of having this addition at once, and has asked me to request that a reply be sent by wire or night letter, in order that no time may be lost in installing these necessary facilities.\n\nMr. Helmsing is at present ill at home, and I am therefore forwarding this request in his absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Oct. 31, 1925.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWith the influx of new pupils, we find it impossible to give the boys baths in their old house from a thirty gallon tank. We have had to separate the big boys from the little ones and it is our intention to arrange bathing facilities for all of them, by installing a temporary shower bath in the new laundry where hot and cold water come from the heater in the furnace room.\n\nOur plumber will do the work. But we are asking you to secure for us authority to spend for material in this regard a sum not exceeding sixty dollars.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., with reference to voucher 354-25, in favour of Messrs. Weller & Weller, Kamloops, in the sum of $347.20, regarding the matter of attaching abstract of tenders received, this is an impossibility, as tenders were not called for through this office, but were, I believe, called for by the Department or by Mr. Macaulay who was at that time Resident Architect in charge of construction of the new school in Kamloops. As stated in my letter of September 23rd, file 35-25, you will note that I state that Mr. Macaulay had previously forwarded this account with the request that Messrs. Weller & Weller be paid for the work of installing the electrical fixtures as per his tender, complete with insulating joints wired with lamps at the Kamloops Industrial School. As this was not paid at that time, Mr. MacAulay instructed Mr. Weller to forward the account to me to be reforwarded with a request that settlement be made as he has already waited a considerable time for payment after the completion of his work.\n\nFor your information I might state that Mr. W.H. Macaulay has now left the district, so that it is impossible for me to obtain any information as no tenders were submitted to this office, and I do not even know what firms tendered. These tenders, no doubt, have been forwarded to the Department when the contract was awarded by Mr. MacAulay or the Department, to Messrs. Weller & Weller for the above mentioned work.\n\nIn view of the fact that payment has been delayed for such a considerable time, I most respectfully submit that the account be honoured and paid at your earliest convenience.\n\nI return herewith the voucher, as I am not in a position to attach any abstract as requested.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F.

O. Box 463,\nKamloops, B. C.\n18th July 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\n\"Girls Wing\"\n\nAs information contained in my letter of the 11th inst., this Building was taken over on the 10th as authorized by your Telegram of the 9th inst.\n\nThe Electric light fixtures are not fixed, an exception was allowed in respect of this item as the delay was not due to Contractor.\n\nMr. E. Claydon has been here during the major portion of this month, the Building has, with this exception and a short period let the commencement of the work, been run by a Foreman Mr. Jennings.\n\nMr. Claydon compiled a list of Extras and general claims against the Building which he submitted to me for approval.\n\nThese claims appear to me to be extremely extravagant and utterly unreasonable.\n\nIn discussing this matter Mr. Claydon lays particular stress on the fact that the Firm did not visit the site before tendering and consequently could not be expected to know the actual condition; this fact should be clearly noted as it has a considerable bearing on certain items.\n\nI have explained to Mr. Claydon that I consider his claim extravagant and his attitude unreasonable and in view\nof these facts nothing remained but to submit the whole question to the Department.\n\nConsequently I forward herewith (a) copies in duplicate, of the claims in question with certain Deductions. (b) A list of Deductions prepared by me together with a criticism and explanation of each particular claim or deduction.\n\nI would point out that in every Building the best results are obtained by a \"Give and Take\" policy, also that in the best and true interests of the Job, minor changes or alterations have to be made on the spot and without the least delay.\n\nDuring the progress of this Building it has on many occasions been necessary to make prompt decisions under the following headings:-\n\n(a) What was required in accordance with the true intent and meaning of the Plans and specifications.\n\n(b) Alterations or additions which were materially favorable to the best interests of the Building.\n\n(c) Alterations or additions which were more or less insisted upon by The Rev. Principal Father McGuire or the Sister Superior.\n\nUnder these headings decisions have oft times been difficult, in some cases embarrassing; under heading (a) I have given decisions which I considered reasonable and insisted upon being carried out with the proviso that the Department would either confirm or correct same in the final adjustment of accounts.\n\n(b) Under this heading alterations or additions have been made involving extra cost, always however with due regard to the cost incurred being covered by a Deduction.\n\n(c) On many occasions both the Rev Father MacGuire and the Sister Superior have been most insistent on certain changes or additions, where possible these requests have been granted in other cases refused.\n\nDeductions--- With this explanation I will proceed with the\nStatement of Deductions which can reasonably be made from this Contract.\n\nItems 1 and 2. The Main South West wall, although shown on the Drawings for Girls Wing, was partly built under the Contract for the Centre portion; it is absurd to suppose that the Department should pay for this walling twice, under the Contract for the centre portion and again under the Contract for the Girls Wing. Messrs Claydon Company have claimed (Item 15) for increasing the thickness of this wall 4\" but make absolutely no Deduction for the walling built; it is obvious that their contention that they were unacquainted with the Site and existing Building applies with equal force to this walling as to the nature of the excavation.\n\nI may point out that this item clearly demonstrates the peculiar views entertained by Mr. Claydon with regard to Extras and Deductions.\n\nItem 3. This deduction is fair and reasonable and arises from the fact that Contractors absolutely refused to use Cement mortar as specified. I reported on this matter to the Department when the brick work was commenced. Mr Claydon insisted that lime mortar, with a portion of Cement added, was good enough and had been accepted on the other two schools built by them.\n\nIn any case the cost of lime mortar is less than cement mortar, and the cost of laying (disregarding other difficulties) bricks or tile in cement mortar is undoubtedly worth $3.00 per M. more than in lime mortar, and the Department cannot be expected to pay for what it does not receive.\n\nItem 4. The Contractors insisted upon laying a fir floor in the Recreation Rooms instead of Maple, raising a quibble over the interpretation of Paragraph No. 22. Granted that this clause is contradictory and leaves a doubt as to what is required, a reference to Drawing (Sheet No.3) clearly shows that Hardwood\nfloors are intended.\n\n**Item 5.** That portion of the Corridor running North and South, I changed to a Fir floor. This enables us to get at the heart of the Plumbing System without taking up the floor, a trap door having been arranged here; in addition to this the ground was \"made up\" consequently cracks would have been probable. Further this mastic could be used to much better advantage as will be shown later.\n\nThe Contractors according to their own figures see \"Trades Summary\" allowed $524.00 for complete Mastic floors.\n\nOne man only came from Winnipeg to lay this floor consequently $124.00 very easily covers the cost of transportation of men and materials. There is actually 100 lin.ft of Corridor consequently after deducting $124.00 for expenses leaves the cost of this mastic floor, including cove treatment at wall, at $4.00 per lin. ft of Corridor. 30 Lin. ft of Corridor was cut out which accounts for this deduction of $120.00\n\n**Item 6.** Owing to the change under Item No. 5 the concrete sub floor was unnecessary hence this deduction.\n\n**Item 7.** The bolts specified 5/8\" x 16\" for roof plates at 5 ft centres were useless for tile work, they formed no anchorage and this roof is exposed to extremely violent winds, further owing to the windows they could not be put in at 5\"-0\" centres. To gain the necessary anchorage I cancelled these bolts and ordered No 50 bolts 3\" x 3' 0\" and had these built in where they would be effective.\n\nThe contractors charge for these 3\" bolts but make no deduction for the 79 bolts specified, hence my deduction under this item.\n\n**Item 8.** This weeping tile was quite unnecessary owing to the fact that the ground, being either coarse or fine gravel will not hold water at any time or under any conditions.\n\n**Item 9.** This item covers the substitution of concrete\nfor the granite plinth at the North East corner of Laundry. It was at an altogether different level to the major portion and the appearance more or less neglected.\n\n**Item 10.** This deduction covers the change of roof treatment authorized by the Department and is not nearly as much as I anticipated, at least $100.00 was reasonable but could not be obtained.\n\n**Item 11.** These breaks were taken over from the centre portion one thousand remain for buttresses to chapel.\n\n**Item 12.** The doors at the bottom of steps to Laundry, in the North wall, were not required by the Sister Superior consequently were not fixed, but stored with the storm sash. These remarks explain the deductions. The Extras are treated separately as follows:\n\n**EXTRAS**\n\n**Item 1.** This item is incorrectly stated, at no part of the Building has the excavation been carried below the levels or grades shown on Drawings, excepting only where a change of level was required in footings as at the junction of Laundry walls with Main Building.\n\nIn these cases owing to the sliding tendency of the foundation it was obviously necessary to come down in steps instead of abruptly as shown on Drawings.\n\nThis is probably what the Contractor refers to and is admitted as reasonable.\n\n**Item 2.** This item cannot be approved by me, it is true that the excavation was treacherous and the sliding tendency abnormal, at the same time the Contractors omitted the usual and necessary precautions to hold the sides in place; no shoring, except of a very primitive character, was done, and the sliding tendency in no way checked.\n\nI pointed out to Mr. Jennings the Foreman in charge the absence of the usual precautionary measures but he replied that it was cheaper to take it out and afterwards fill in, as it was all scraper work.\nGenerally no excavation could have been easier except for the sliding tendency complained of.\n\n**Item 3.** This item may be regarded as the result of Item 2. The natural foundation to these walls running North and South (The Building faces South) had been destroyed and it was absolutely impossible to allow the footings for these walls to be placed in \"made up\" ground. Consequently I insisted upon these walls being carried down to a good bearing and then stepped back to the level shown on Drawings.\n\nThe specification is quite clear on this point (see paragraph (1) page 12 Specification) I do not therefore see any justification for this claim.\n\nI readily admit that some arrangement or allowances was necessary to offset stepping these concrete walls from the lower to the higher levels and this was done at the time by allowing the Contractor to use for all concrete a mixture of one part cement to five parts gravel, instead of the four parts gravel specified.\n\nThe concrete specified is exceedingly rich, for this class of work, one Part cement to six parts of gravel is adequate as the foundation will not stand a pressure of much more than 1\u00bd tons per sq ft.\n\nThe Contractor evidently claims the above concession as a right and not as the quid pro quo intended.\n\n**Item 4.** This item constitutes nothing more or less than a quibble, and was reported to the Department at the time, in my usual report.\n\nThe footings referred to are under the internal walls forming the Corridor etc., and are clearly shown under the wood partition forming the Corridor. They are not only drawn but figured at 3' 0\" x 1'-6\" please see Sheet No 2. Left side elevation.\n\nParagraph 7 Page 15 calls for footings 12\" wider than walls.\nunless otherwise shown on Section Drawings.\n\nI insisted upon these footings being put in 3'-0\" x 1'-6\"\nThe drawings called for it and the nature of the foundation demanded\nit. The contractors claim is to say the least utterly absurd.\n\nItem 5. This wall is a continuation of the North West\nwall of Entrance Lobby (on the North Elevation) to Laundry.\nThe natural grades falling North and East were more suitable\nfor Father McGuire's requirements than the arrangement shown on\nDrawing No. 2. Rear Elevation. He desired a cart road between\nthe Laundry and Refrigerator Plant leading to the kitchen door and\nthis object could be secured very easily by the wall in question.\n\nI authorized this wall owing to the necessity of a prompt\ndecision and the fact that there was sufficient money from\ndeductions to defray the cost of same.\n\nItem 6. Here we get a change of grade of approx. 12'-0\"\nwe also have, inclining East, towards the River, alternate layers\nof coarse and fine gravel approx 4 feet thick each. Immediately\nit is disturbed this fine gravel, varying from a coarse sand to\na fine pea gravel, runs almost like the shifting sands found in\nmany parts of Ontario.\n\nWhen the excavation for the retaining wall shown on\nDrawings was commenced it was obvious that there was a very real\ndanger of this Bank moving and thus causing a severe settlement\nof the Southern part of the East Elevation, from the Laundry to\nthe S. East Corner.\n\nI also add that practically all the excavated material\nfrom the whole Building was dumped in a line parallel with the East\nwall of Building and before this was moved it was essential to\nget in this retaining wall.\n\nAfter a careful examination of the Extras authorized and\nthe estimated deductions I found that there were sufficient funds\nto extend this retaining wall and consequently gave instructions\nfor it to be built.\n\nThe fact that this retaining wall shows a settlement\ncrack from top to bottom clearly shows the absolute necessity of protecting the South East wall of Building.\n\nItem 7 and 8. These items were necessary owing to the change of grade required to meet Rev. Father McGuire's requirements on the North side of Building.\n\nItem 9. No provision was included in the Contract for the disposal of Water from Laundry. The difference in Laundry floor level made it impossible to convey this drainage to the South. The only practical way of disposing of this drainage was to convey it Eastwards towards the River into a Sack Away Pit. I consulted the Local Engineer of the Water and Power Branch who advised me to put in this Pit and necessary tile drain before the grading was completed, as in no way could it be included in the general system of drainage to the septic tank. This item therefore really comes under the heading of Sewers and Drainage rather than the Building Contract.\n\nItem 10. This item is unreasonable, the grade is clearly denoted on Drawing 2 Rear Elevation. Further this grade has been maintained 12\" above the level shown on drawing. As before mentioned practically all the excavated material was dumped parallel with the East Wall of Building and the Contractors claim shows a tendency to claim for moving this material which should have been distributed at the time of the excavation.\n\nWhilst the excavation was in progress I drew attention to the Foreman Mr. Jennings to this fact, he however contended that it was cheaper to do it that way as he thereby secured a good bank from which he could handle his Building operations to better advantage.\n\nItem 11. This was authorized by me at the urgent request of the Sister Superior who was very anxious to utilize this area as a play ground for the Girls.\nItem 12. This item belongs to the Centre Portion of the Building and was necessitated by the omission to provide drainage from the flat roof. This item has been fully reported to the Department.\n\nI may add that two additional sump holes are required one for the Barber Room Roof the other is desired by Rev. Father McQuire to take care of the Drainage from the Dairy and Vegetable room.\n\nThis item does not constitute a change against this Contract.\n\nItem 13. This item has been fully reported to the Department and does not constitute a change against this Contract.\n\nItem 14. I authorized this item owing to the nature of the foundation.\n\nItem 15. This item refers to the West wall adjoining Centre portion. The Contractor increased the thickness of a portion of this wall to conform with the existing work.\n\nIn connection with this claim Item Nos. 1 and 2 of List of Deductions must be considered.\n\nItem 16. This item was authorized by me.\n\nItem 17. This item was authorized by me, the 2\" x 10\" joist at 12\" centres for an 18 ft span were not adequate, excessive deflections or spring was particularly noticeable; as no alteration to the ceiling level was possible the joists in question were trussed, the result being quite satisfactory.\n\nItem 27. This item is in no way correct. I was asked about these doors by Mr. Jennings at the beginning of March and informed him that I expected them to conform with the Corridor doors of the Centre portion, as such was intended by the Drawings and specifications.\n\nA letter was forwarded to the subcontractors by Mr. Jennings on March 5th the doors did not arrive here.\nItem 18. I insisted upon the rough floor in Attic being carried through to walling all round the Building. With the absence of through cross walls and the change of direction of joists at the N. East corner it was essential as a tie between the external walls. The Contractor claims that Drawings show this rough floor only between the partitions, in other words, only under finished flooring.\n\nThe price charged is excessive. The prevailing rate of shiplap floor locally layed does not exceed $45.00 per M.\n\nItem 19. Authorized by me. As explained in my reports the Heating Main from the Boiler had to pass through these Transoms necessitating a change.\n\nItem 20. Authorized by me. Please see Deduction No. 6. and explanation thereof.\n\nItem 21. Authorized by me. The cost being covered by Deductions. No ventilation was provided to either of the Dormitory floors. The Sisters strongly objected to this omission. A number of these Ventilators were also required under roofing at Eaves as per the change of treatment adopted by Department.\n\nItem 22. Authorized by me. In this climate of dry hot weather two layers of paper are essential and are included in even small cottages.\n\nItem 23. Authorized by me. The position of the radiators shown on Attic Dormitory floor was very strongly opposed by the Sisters, their contention being that such an arrangement left no place for the Beds etc. consequently the Radiators were placed under the windows necessitating opening being left at side for access to piping.\n\nItem 24. Authorized by me. The Sister Superior insisted upon additional windows in the North Wall of Laundry. I compromised by having two lights put in the West wall near Stairway.\n\nItem 25. The Contractor claims that these are not covered by the specification. My contention is that unless they open they are useless, and that the same might reasonably be inferred.\n\nItem 26. It is unreasonable to suppose that this Burlap Rail is not called for under the true intent and meaning of the Plans and specification. It is clearly covered by Par. 5 Page 4.\nuntil May 25th., nearly 3 months. In any case practically\nthe lighting of the Corridors depends on these glass panels.\n\nI may add that until the question was raised by\nMr. Jennings I had not even entertained the idea of the upper\npanel being wood.\n\nItem 28. This item was insisted upon by the Sister\nSuperior offer a request by Rev. Father McGuire. It was\nauthorized by me.\n\nThe charge made for this work is unreasonable and\ncannot be approved by me. It is admitted that the ordinary\nshelving was fixed on one wall only before this work was\nordered.\n\nAn interesting comparison may be drawn between this\ncharge and the tender of Mr. Davis for exactly the same\namount and description of these so called lockers on the Girls\nLocker Room on Basement Floor. You will note that Mr. Davis\nundertakes to duplicate this work for $96.00.\n\nItem 29. This work was authorized by me. The baluster\ntreatment was objectionable to the Sisters. The ceiling of\nV joint I regard as merely a necessary finish.\n\nItem 30. This item was authorized by me. It was found\nnecessary to steady the roof of the East portion of Dormitory\nat two places (a) at the big opening containing three windows\nand door in West wall (b) at the point of intersection of\nGable and South East Wall.\n\nFurther the door (fire escape) did not work out as\nshown on Drawings, there was insufficient head room.\n\nThe stiffening of roof at intersection of Gable was\nmade without extra cost by moving the Staff Duty Room into this\nGable.\n\nItem 31. This was authorized by me and necessary to keep\nareas clear of water from Main Roof.\n\nItem 32. The Contractor claim and I agree therewith that\nthere was not sufficient height for the Boiler, a Pit was\nnecessary and it was essential for the footings of the Main West Wall to be safeguarded.\n\nItem 33. Authorized by me. The Sister Superior insisted upon this change to obviate workers standing in their own light. The change is a big improvement.\n\nItem 34. This item was a point of contention and was the last work completed.\n\nUndoubtedly the shingle roof was a mistake and Mr. Jennings the Foreman offered to put on a Mastic roof at 40 cents per foot. He withdrew this proposition and $18.00 was quoted for tar and gravel ($15.00 per square is a reasonable price) Near completion of these roofs Mr. Claydon discovered that a mistake had been made and charged $40.91.\n\nItem 35. I wrote to the Department about these ventilation shafts but received no reply. These shafts are shown in Basement Ground and First floor (Between Girls Dormitories) but do not appear in the second floor (on attic Plan)\n\nThe Contractor claims for carrying these through to Roof space also lining same from the Basement up to Second floor.\n\nI contend that the lining be regarded as reasonably intended, a space between studs cannot be regarded as a flue, consequently whilst I disagree with any charge being made for lining the flues I think some allowance should be made for carrying flues from the attic floor to Roof.\n\nItem 36. This was authorized by me in accordance with Rev Father McGuire's insistent demand for such arrangement as would allow all Bath water and water from Wash Table being run on to the land instead of into the septic tank.\n\nItem 37. This was authorized by me. The Laundry could not be heated as shown on Drawings owing to the return being too low consequently I ordered this particular return pipe to be drained into the gulley under Laundry Machinery.\n\nItem 38. This was authorized by me. The stair (Metal) treads only allowed for 1/2\" of cement, this is I think insufficient\nand Mr. Jennings the Contractors Foreman informed me that the cement treads at the Cardstone School were badly cracked before they left the Job.\n\nWith the deduction of $120.00 from the Corridor I accepted Mr. Jennings quotation of $64.00 for Mastic in lieu of Cement.\n\n**Item 39.** Authorized by me. Obscured glass requested by the Sister Superior.\n\n**Item 40.** Authorized by me. The Sisters requested this to allow of sample papers being pinned above Blackboards.\n\n**Item 41.** Authorized by me at the urgent request of the Sister Superior.\n### Schedule of Deductions\n\n| Item | Description | Amount |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| (1)  | Deduct for Footings under part of West Wall 6 c yds at $11.50 | $69.00 |\n| (2)  | Deduct for Brickwork in part of West Wall 25,500 bricks at $45.00 per M | 1047.50 |\n| (3)  | Deduct for Lime instead of Cement Mortar say 290 M Bricks at $5.00 | 870.00 |\n| (4)  | Deduct for Fir instead of Maple flooring 23 squares at $14.68 | 337.64 |\n| (5)  | Deduct for Mastic flooring 30 lin. ft of Corridor at $4.00 | 120.00 |\n| (6)  | Deduct for concrete roughed floor in corridor 6\" thick 30' -0\" x 6' -0\" 3 1/3 c yds at $11.50 | 38.33 |\n| (7)  | Deduct for 79 Bolts 5/8 x 16\" at 25\u00a2 each | 19.75 |\n| (8)  | Deduct for Weeping tile omitted 476 ft run at 14 cents | 71.40 |\n| (9)  | Deduct for concrete instead of Granite Base | 105.00 |\n| (10) | Deduct on account of changing to roof gutter | 75.00 |\n| (11) | Deduct 3,000 brick taken over at $50.00 per M | 150.00 |\n| (12) | Deduct omitting fixing one pair of doors in Laundry | 10.00 |\n\nTotal: $2,913.62\nOttawa, February 17, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 30/4/6500 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the proposed enlarging of the irrigation system and domestic water supply at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I am pleased to learn there is not the slightest doubt water licenses can be secured.\n\nI note that it is advisable to make application for a license covering both proposals and that you have asked the District Engineer to prepare a report, which will give you the information needed in connection with the irrigation.\n\nI have also your telegram of the 16th instant and have to assure you, in reply, that no purchase of machinery will be made until the Water Power Engineer's report is in hand. Further, it is likely that the Department will ask the Dominion Water Power Branch to have their District Engineer undertake the purchase and installation in this connection. I might state that I have officially requested the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch to let me have a report concerning the proposed extension of the irrigation system.\n\nRelative to Engineer Tredcroft's report on the domestic and fire fighting system, I have to inform you that the Department hopes to carry out his recommendation when the last wing of the building is erected. At the present time there are no funds for the purpose. You may make application for the water required in this connection when you are dealing with the irrigation license. I note that you have a copy of Engineer Tredcroft's report of June last, and therefore the information needed for the application is available to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSir,\u2014  \n\nAbout the middle of October, 1925, I forwarded voucher No. 389-25, in the sum of $80.10, in favour of the City of Kamloops, for labour and material required in connection with the installation of a power line to the electric motor in the boiler room, as arranged by Mr. W.H. MacAulay, at that time your resident architect in charge of the building of the new school.\n\nI am advised by the City Clerk today that they have not, as yet, received payment of this account, and I would ask you to be kind enough to look into the matter, with a view to having the same attended to at an early date.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(H.F. Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Feb. 3, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nIn the final settlement with the Clayton Company Limited of Winnipeg on their contract for the girls' wing of the Kamloops Indian Residential School at Kamloops, they take exception to the final report and comments of Mr. Macaulay, who was the Inspector of Construction on this work. Mr. Macaulay has recommended that certain deductions be made from their contract price, and he does not approve of certain items contained in their list submitted of additional work performed in connection with this contract. Mr. Clayton of the Clayton Company Limited has been in Ottawa for the past two days, and we have discussed in detail the above mentioned items, and from information submitted by Mr. Clayton it would appear that he has grounds for objecting to the recommendations of Mr. Macaulay.\n\nI am enclosing herewith extracts from Mr. Macaulay's final report, covering the above mentioned items, also extracts from letters received from the Clayton Co. covering the same items, and I would ask you, if possible, to arrange a meeting with Mr. Macaulay, who I understand is now residing in Vancouver, and make recommendations to the Department as to whether you think these items should be allowed. If you cannot conveniently arrange a meeting with Mr. Macaulay your report without his opinion will be quite satisfactory to the Department.\n\nWith reference to items No 1 and 2 in the list of deductions covering footings and brick work, I do not think Mr. Macaulay is correct in his statement that the Clayton Co. had included in their tender an amount for the portion of the wall of the first unit already built, as they could readily see by the plans and specifications that this wall was already in place. With regard to deduction No 3, Mr. Clayton has stated in the Department that they did not substitute lime for cement mortar.\nFeb. 3, 1926.\n\nAs the Clayton Co. are pressing for a settlement of their account on this contract, I would appreciate it if you would forward your comments as early as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. Malcolm\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. DITCHBURN, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nJanuary Twenty Seventh,\nNineteen Twenty Six.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nre Girls' Building, Indian School, Kamloops.\n\nCircumstances attending our work at Cardston, and other matters prevented us taking up outstanding items on our work at the above building, and we regret very much that we were unable to do so until this date.\n\nOur letter of the 15th August 1925 stated our general attitude. We cannot believe that any one of the deductions made as shown by Mr. MacKenzie's letter of 11th August 1925, have been duly considered by the Department.\n\nOur letter of 23rd July 1925, covered the facts of our case. We offer additional comment dealing with the items as they appear in Mr. MacKenzie's letter already referred to.\n\nItem No. 2, $454.00.\n\nOur statement in letter of 23/7/25 is correct. The Department's letter reports the Inspector as warning our foreman about the way he was handling the earth. He did not warn our man. The two of them discussed the problem and Mr. Macaulay mentioned sheet piling, and our man pointed out that this method of handling it as unsuited to the case, and would likely have cost more in the event of its being used. Mr. Macaulay admitted this, and professed a sympathetic attitude toward our receiving compensation for the expense we were put to irrespective of how it was handled. The same ground was covered later with our Mr. Ernest Claydon, and Mr. Macaulay then said that while he could guarantee payment, he would, in view of the circumstances and the nature of the soil, recommend that we receive payment for the work done.\nItem No. 3. $246.17. The Inspector's statement on this point is absolutely false. No such agreement or arrangement was even suggested. The concrete was made as specified, and these additional footings and greater depth of wall work were put in solely for the reason given in our letter of 23/7/25., viz., to make a proper footing where the earth had fallen away from the levels where the plans showed the work in question to be placed. Further Mr. Macaulay definitely promised that this would be paid for before it was ever started.\n\nItem No. 4. $206.25. The facts are as stated in our previous letter (23/7/25). It is not fair to claim this item as covered by specifications. An unbiased perusal of our letter just referred to, and the drawings, will surely substantiate our claim.\n\nThere are further deductions of items not covered by our statement, but which are listed in Mr. MacKenzie's letter under numbers one to six.\n\nNos. 1 & 2. re West Wall. These refer to the corner of the existing west wall of the centre unit, but the deduction is made without justification of any kind. The new building was to join up to the existing work, and the plan showed the line of the building already there. It is obvious that the end wall was built with the first unit, and we naturally figured to join up to it. The absurdity of such a deduction is immediately apparent, as, to support it, it would be necessary to imagine the first unit built without an end wall, and standing waiting for our section to be built on to it.\n\nThe question of such a deduction was never raised by Mr. Macaulay to any member of our organisation, and we cannot express ourselves strongly enough on the injustice of deducting money from us for work which we knew to exist, and which in no way entered into our contract.\n\nNo. 5. Deduction for lime. $870.00. The mortar was not changed to straight lime mortar, but owing to the cold weather our bricklayer put in more lime than called for, as it is well known that mortar with a heavy lime content is necessary for successful winter work. The fact remains that the cement content was not impaired, and this deduction is as unjust as the former one.\nNos. 4 & 5, re Mastic.\n\nThese two items are the result of a change in the mastic flooring in the basement corridor leading to the senior girls recreation room. This was done in order to give Mr. Macaulay mastic stair treads, and a wood floor in this end part of the corridor was put down to help offset the additional cost of stair tread work. Our superintendent made an estimate with the mastic worker, and it was agreed that in view of the extra wood floor we would have to put in and the much more expensive labour on mastic stair treads as against plain floor work, the whole question would make an additional cost of $64.00. Mr. Macaulay agreed to pay this, but at the finish of the job insisted on a credit for the work omitted. This credit had all been allowed for in good faith when we gave the addition of $64.00, but in an attempt to satisfy him, we made a further adjustment which appears in our statement of credits, viz., $22.70.\n\nAs things stand now the charges against us are this $22.70 plus your deductions nos. 4 & 5, of $120.00 & $6.33, making in all a deduction of $121.03 against which we are paid $64.00 for doing a more expensive piece of work than the contract calls for. Thus we are being forced to forfeit about $120.00 for doing more than specified as well as having against us an unsatisfied account for a further $100.00 from the mastic people, which they are claiming as the additional labour cost of the work they did.\n\nItem No. 6, $19.75.\n\nMr. Macaulay asked us to supply additional larger bolts to hold down roof timbers in place of those called for in contract. This was done, and he agreed to pay for them. The point about credit for bolts we had brought to the job was raised, but Mr. Macaulay was told that they were no use to us, and if he wanted them on the building we would leave them. We could not give credit as the bolts were worth no more to us than freight to Winnipeg. He appeared to be satisfied with this, and no more was said about it until time of settlement, when he again raised the point. He was given the same explanation as before, and again accepted it; and Mr. Ernest Clayton again offered to leave them to Macaulay's order. Mr. Macaulay's answer was that he supposed it was alright, and the matter was regarded as disposed of.\n\nWe cannot believe but that the Department will fully agree that obvious injustice has been done us by\nMr. Macaulay in making these deductions, and in view of the information herewith, which is given in good faith, will restore to our credit all that has been deducted, as well as give the most generous consideration possible to our request for payment for services rendered by carrying on the work through the winter weather.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPresident.\nJuly Twenty-third\nNineteen-Twenty-five.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE GIRL'S WING, INDIAN SCHOOL, KAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nWith further reference to our recent communications, we are now in a position to review the whole circumstances of this building, as Mr. E. Claydon, Jr., has returned from Kamloops bringing the details of the settlement with Mr. Macauley.\n\nAs already mentioned, Mr. Macauley took the stand that a ninety per cent certificate was final so far as he was concerned and that the Department would automatically dispose of the balance of the account on receipt of his report that the building had been taken over. This we regard as most unusual and unsatisfactory, as we were, on finishing, entitled to receive from Mr. Macauley, a certificate of final completion.\n\nWhen the whole of the work had been finally gone over and brought to the point of satisfactory completion, Mr. Macauley qualified his acceptance of the building by saying that he could only report on it and leave the acceptance to the Department. He has several times expressed his satisfaction with everything in the building. This has been done to our superintendent and to Mr. E. Claydon, Jr. separately, and to both of them in the presence of Father Maguire, the Principal. In addition to expressing satisfaction, Mr. Macauley has gone so far as to say, that it had been a pleasure to work with us on a job which had been handled so well.\nWe now come to our account for additional items. Mr. Macauley maintained he had no authority to make settlement on these although he acknowledged having given orders for the work covered by most of our accounts. There are others which arose as a result of differences between plans and existing conditions at the site, and still others which are a matter of interpretation of specifications which are left for the Department to give a ruling on. We propose to deal with the account in the same order as the items appear and in explanation of the way the charges are made up, we have charged on time and material basis, plus commission for such items as could be kept distinct from contract work and where additions were carried out along with contract work with which they were incorporated, we have charged for them at rates equal to similar work in the contract. Items which are noted below as being agreed to, are those which Mr. Macauley initialled as being in order on a copy of the account returned to us.\n\nItem #1. This item together with #2 and #11, are classed by Mr. Macauley as being covered by the clause in specifications calling for an examination of site. We submit that any inspection of a site will not give details of earth levels. No contractor can be held to make a survey and stake levels on any site for the purpose of submitting an estimate. He can only figure to levels shown on plans and is not responsible for setting levels. Where there is any difference between finished grade and original grade of site, it is a recognized practice that both levels shall be shown on plans. This particular site was of a sloping nature with a high side where the deepest excavation came, the nett result of which made an average excess of three feet to be excavated from the rear portion of the building over the finished grade lines shown on plan. We were able to join up to the centre unit without much difficulty so far as grade was concerned, but it was at the rear where the sub-basement came, that we were faced with the marked difference between level of site and grade shown on plan.\n\nItem #2. This charge was made to cover cost of handling material due to caving of the banks of excavation. The soil at the site is made up of a very thin layer of fine top soil and everything below it is a fine dry gravel and sand mixture, which could not be made to hold up by shoring, so that it was almost equal to handling quicksand. This is a condition on which no information was furnished to contractors, no test holes had been dug before tenders were called and a contractor could not therefore have any knowledge of, or allow for such conditions. The question of visiting site is not applicable as there was nothing to see to indicate such soil conditions as were met with. The only way the banks could have been held and caving prevented, would have been by solid sheet piling all round the deep portion. Shoring would not hold it and piling would be a great deal more costly than handling the extra material. Where such conditions\nare met with, it is the custom of the trade for a contractor to be allowed payment for the extra material moved, or if sheet piling has to be used, the owner pays for it. We have had previous experience along these lines and have received payments as outlined. It was necessary to take out the earth, sloping it back from footing line to 17' wide at top on west side and 14' on south. When concrete was placed the earth had to be backfilled and we consider the charge made a very reasonable one, and that it should be allowed to us.\n\nItem #3. The work covered by this item was necessary in order to place the footings on solid foundation. It applies where the banks caved and footings could not be placed on backfilled earth. At the time the work was done, Mr. Macauley said it would be paid for, but at finish of the job, he said it would have to be settled by the Department. The facts are, that this is clearly work which is additional to plans and specifications.\n\nItem #4. Paragraph 7, page 15 of specification, calls for footings to be 12\" thick and to project 6\" on each side of the walls they support. The footings covered by item #4, are those carrying A, stud walls enclosing corridor between store room and staff rooms on opposite side; B, brick walls enclosing same corridor where it runs between bath rooms and C, stud partitions between locker room and junior recreation room. We figured on all of these footings as laid down by the specification. The cross section on sheet 2 of drawing shows a footing 18\" x 3' which we took as being intended to mean a column footing as we could not think that this dimension could apply to footings for stud walls as it made them bigger than the footings for the 20\" masonry walls outside. We therefore, followed the specification rule for figuring these footings. In any event this cross section could not be made to cover the footings under the brick walls mentioned above, nor that of the stud wall at the other end of the building, yet Mr. Macauley insisted that this heavy size be carried right through. We had no alternate but to put it in or close the job down and lose good weather while waiting for a decision from Ottawa. We preferred to keep going and leave it to the Department's usual fair treatment to protect us against the Inspectors' unreasonable ruling.\n\nItem #5. Ordered and agreed to by the Inspector.\n\nItem #6. Ordered and agreed to in all except charges for excavation. Mr. Macauley claims that we had dumped the material excavated from basement in such a position that some of it had to be moved for the retaining wall. This argument does not fit the case. Had the wall gone in as shown on the plan, the question of moving the earth again would not have come up as we had it placed far enough out to allow for original retaining wall. Owing to the extra length, about which we did not know when the basement\nexcavation was done. We did have to move some material taken from the basement, but this was solely owing to the extra length of the wall. The nature of the soil again arises in this cost. Instead of a trench about 4' wide, we took out and backfilled a hole varying from 15' to 20' wide. As a matter of fact, our account stands at less than the time actually expended on this particular piece of work. In our original bill we charged actual cost and Mr. Macaulay took exception to the charge. In an effort to arrive at a settlement which at the time we thought could be arranged, we cut out part of the actual cost and did so thinking this would satisfy Mr. Macaulay, but this is something we have since found to be utterly impossible to attain.\n\nItem #7. Ordered and agreed to by Inspector.\n\nItem #8. Ordered by Inspector but not passed for some unknown reason. The work was done and should be paid for.\n\nItems #9 & 10. Ordered and agreed to by Inspector.\n\nItem #11. This work had to be done owing to the level of the site being in line with the top of the header course over laundry windows. The earth simply had to be graded away from the windows and no visiting of the site without surveyor's levels, could have established the necessity for it. We did not figure on anything of this nature and think it nothing but fair that we should be paid for it. Work such as this appears to us to be quite apart from contract excavation for a building, but is landscape treatment of site.\n\nItem #12 & 25. Ordered and agreed to by Inspector.\n\nItem #26. Ordered by Inspector and payment promised for it, but apparently through an oversight not initialled on copy of statement returned to us.\n\nItem #27. This material is not in any way covered by the specification nor shown on section. Our sub-contractors for millwork on this account, did not include it in their estimate and refused to supply unless paid for it, and on going over the matter thoroughly, we had to admit the justice of their claim and pay for it. In turn, we think we are entitled to payment.\nItem #28. This change was ordered by Mr. Macaulay, but he takes exception to the cost per door. Our sub-contractors received the change too late to put it into effect before the doors were made up and in any case, their charge of $2.50 per light for the glass is not excessive. We were unfortunate enough to have the glass in one of the doors broken and the replacement piece of glass cost $2.40 without any question of labor to glaze it. We showed the invoice for this glass to Mr. Macaulay, but he still would not admit that the price charged by the Robertson & Hackett Company was a fair one.\n\nItem #29 to 34. Ordered and agreed to by Inspector.\n\nItem #35. This change was necessary because the roofs were too flat to allow use of shingles. The roof over laundry entrance is much larger than shown on plan, owing to changes made in entrance which were done at considerable expense and without payment to us. Messrs. Carr and Son, our sub-contractors, supplied metal fascia, gravel stop and more flashing than required for the shingle roofs and actually spent over fifty hours time on the job, although only thirty are charged for. Mr. Macaulay claims this class of roof is only worth about fifteen dollars per square and while this may be right for large roofs, it cannot be made to cover tiny jobs with eight corners to the hundred square feet, nor does this fifteen dollars per square cover flashings and other metal work. In lieu of a credit for shingles, we supplied tar, pitch, gravel and 75% of the felt used. There can therefore, be no reasonable criticism of the cost of this item particularly in view of the changes made to entrance which cost us around $100.00 and for which we get no payment.\n\nItem #36. There is nothing in plans or specifications to call for metal lining of vent shafts. Mr. Macaulay ordered them lined and our sub-contractors did it on the understanding that they would be paid. It was not until time of final accounting that Mr. Macaulay raised any question about it being additional to contract. Had there been any doubt on this point, Carr & Son would not have done the work without a ruling from the Department. Mr. Macaulay claims that the shaft has no ventilation value unless it is lined, but that has no bearing whatever on what is called for by plans and specifications, which in this case, do not cover metal lining. Further, the plans do not even provide for continuing the shafts past the first floor and the lining was put in to carry past the attic on Mr. Macaulay's instructions.\n\nItems 37 to 42. Ordered and agreed to by Inspector.\nIt places us in a very unpleasant position to have to write a report of this nature at the close of a job. All the charges made for additional work are justified by work done at the building and a settlement could have been arrived at had Mr. Macauley made any attempt at a reasonable disposition of the various questions involved. We made a draft of the account and submitted it to him for approval. He criticised some points and in an effort to arrive at a settlement without friction, we made revisions. This was done solely in an effort to satisfy him and was a matter of a straight loss to us, as in each case we cut actual costs to arrive at figures which we thought would bring a settlement. The result is, that our account as it reaches the Department from Mr. Macauley, does not represent true costs on all of the items, but such less amounts as were offered for the reason already stated, although these reductions were actual loss to us.\n\nMr. Macauley made the statement that in the matter of mutual adjustment in the life of the job, we were not giving anything, but this is quite inaccurate. We went to Kamloops prepared to meet any ordinary conditions at least half way and as an example, started out by awarding the plumbing and heating contract to a firm which Mr. Macauley favoured. When we figured the work, our price was based on using a firm to whom we found Mr. Macauley took violent exception. Their bid was given us in good faith and from our present knowledge of the Kamloops situation, we believe their work would have been satisfactory. This change, done only with a view of the good of the work and Mr. Macauleys' satisfaction, cost us nearly $300.00. Throughout the job there were many items on which we gave more than was called for, or made substitution at Mr. Macauleys' request, which cost us more than the original item and these are not shown in our final account so that there is no justice in the statement that we have not met him in any way.\n\nWith the information contained in this letter at your disposal, we trust you will now be able to pass on our accounts and let us have payment theron at your early convenience. If there should be any further question you wish to raise, we shall be pleased to do anything we can to supply you with the necessary information.\n\nTrusting that the matter will receive your usual kind consideration, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED\n\nE. Clayton\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant referring to certain claims made by the Claydon Company, Ltd., in connection with the contract for the construction of the Girls' Wing of the Kamloops Indian Residential School amounting to $2,502.22, all of which are protested by Mr. Macaulay, who was the Inspector of Construction. On the other hand, Mr. Claydon, in his letters of the 23 July, 1925, and 27 January, 1926, disputes Mr. Macaulay's statements. This, therefore, places me in an awkward position in endeavouring to arrive at an opinion as to whether or not the claims of the Claydon Company should be allowed.\n\nYou ask that I should arrange, if possible, to meet Mr. Macaulay to discuss the several points of contention, but I may say that I am of the opinion that no good purpose would be served by my seeing Mr. Macaulay, if such were possible, for he would, in all likelihood, hold to his original objections; in fact he would be stultifying himself if he were to go back on his original objections in the slightest degree. So far as meeting Mr. Macaulay is concerned, I may say that I have every reason to believe that it will not be possible to do so in view of the fact that some two months ago, when I was in Vancouver, I met a friend of his and he informed me that Mr. Macaulay had been residing in Vancouver for a short time, but was leaving for the United States where there was a larger field for his profession as an architect.\n\nAs regards Mr. Claydon's replies to Mr. Macaulay's objections, I beg to say that they appear to reasonably explain away the contentions of the Inspector of Construction and are entitled to receive very careful and, if possible, favourable consideration by the Department. This Firm has, I believe, constructed at least one other residential school for the Department of Indian Affairs and you should be in a favourable position to know whether they carried out their contracts in a satisfactory manner and without disputes with the Inspector of Works such as have arisen in connection with the building of the School at Kamloops.\n\nIt, therefore, appears to me that the proper course to follow would be to judge the merits of the claims of the contractors in the Kamloops' case with what has taken place on other works which they have performed for the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Que.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nApproximately a year ago we supplied to Messrs. Claydon & Company of Winnipeg the millwork for the Girls' Wing of the Indian Residential School at Kamloops, and up to the present time we have been unable to get a settlement in full for our account of this work.\n\nWe have taken the matter up with them from time to time ever since the work was completed, and have always received the reply that your Department had not given a definite ruling in connection with our Bill of Extras. The amount outstanding on our Books at the present time is $208.94. This amount is our invoice of May 30th 1925, copy of which we attach, less the sum of $86.00, the latter amount being a credit allowed Claydon & Company, for lavatory doors, and 3 other doors and one frame included in our original contract and not furnished.\n\nThe last communication we had from them was to the effect that Mr. E. Claydon was in Ottawa arranging for the final closeup of this contract and that upon his return to Winnipeg, which they expected would be in the course of two or three days, they would forward us any settlement arrived at. That letter was dated 9th February last. To date we have heard nothing further from them, although we wrote them very recently in respect to it.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware we are unable to protect ourselves with the process of a lien on Government work. Therefore we are appealing to your good offices in the hope that we may be afforded some protection as to the settlement of our account.\n\nIt appears there is a matter of controversy between the Contractors and ourselves in regard to the stair work specified in Paragraph 43, Page 39, of the Specifications, also in the footnote on Page 40, which distinctly states that Par-\nagraph 43 does not apply to Girls' Wing. Our contention is that\nthis footnote entirely eliminates the staircase from the millwork\nand includes it in the special steel staircase specified on Page\n28A. The material under dispute is the hardwood handrail which\nwe supplied for this staircase under a threat from Claydon &\nCompany that they would secure it elsewhere and deduct the same\nfrom our original contract. We wrote them fully at the time and\nexplained that rather than delay the process of the work we would\nfurnish same, but charge it to them as an \"extra\" to the original\ncontract. We have consulted local architects in connection with\nthis matter, and their interpretation of the specifications concurs\nwith ours. Namely, that the footnote on Page 40 eliminates entire-\nly Paragraph 43, and that the staircase specified on Page 28A\nshould be supplied complete as detailed. Without prejudice, in\nany way, we would greatly appreciate having the opinion of your\nArchitect in the matter.\n\nAny assistance your Department can render us in the matter\nof final settlement of our account, as hereinbefore stated, will\nbe appreciated by,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nROBERTSON & HACKETT SASH AND DOOR CO.

The amount of the Claydon Company's tender as accepted was $76,200.00. Their original tender as submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs was $78,312.00, but a telegram was received from them prior to the opening of the tenders, asking that $2,112.00 be deducted therefrom, reducing the amount of the above mentioned sum of $76,200.00. The next lowest tender received was from Thomas Carson of Vancouver, and was for $79,970.00. It will, therefore, be observed that the Claydon Company's tender was the lowest received even irrespective of the deduction.\n\nThe Claydon Company made this deduction after inquiry with regard to conditions in Kamloops, which had been in the past favourable for winter building. It would appear that owing to weather conditions during the winter of 1924-25, which had not been experienced in the vicinity of Kamloops in the past forty years the Company had great difficulty in carrying out their work and have finished their contract with a loss of $4,500.00. It was the intention of the Company to ask the Department for permission to abandon the work until favourable weather in the spring; but a serious fire occurred in the old school building which completely destroyed the Girls' Wing; and in order to relieve the situation caused by this fire they continued with their building operations throughout the winter and satisfactorily completed the building in the spring of 1925.\n\nIn these circumstances it would seem only just that some consideration should be shown the Claydon Company and the undersigned accordingly has the honour to recommend that authority be granted to reimburse them to the amount of $2,112.00 being the sum which was deducted from their original tender.\n\n(Sgd) Alex Stewart\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFeb. 5, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nOn the 8th of October, 1924, an Order in Council was passed awarding the contract for the building of the Girls' Wing of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, Kamloops, B.C., to the Claydon Co.

A.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Indian Education.\n\nIn my letter to you of the 30th ultimo, dealing with residential schools, I omitted to mention anything in connection with the residential school at Kamloops.\n\nWhen in Kamloops in June last, I made a special visit to the school and the Sister Superior brought to my attention that there were no benches or lockers provided in the girls' recreation room. She also desired to have a cupboard built and divided into small sections for their hats, shoes, etc. Apparently she had visited our school at Kuper Island, which is very thoroughly fitted out in this respect. I looked over the room to see what would be necessary to bring it up to the same standard as the one at Kuper Island and gave a description to Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing, asking him to get the figures from the Kamloops Sash & Door Factory as to what the cost would be. The Agent forwarded the report to me on the 15th of June which showed that the cost of the lockers, benches and cupboard would be $326.00.\n\nI found that the furnishing of an office for the Sister Superior had been overlooked during the purchasing of the furnishings for all the other rooms in the building, and I came to the conclusion that it was essential that a room should be equipped for the special use of the Sister Superior, and furnished with a desk, three chairs and a congoelum rug for the floor.\n\nAs Parliament dissolved about that time without passing the Estimates, I realized that it was futile to lay these matters before you, preferring to hold them over until the Estimates for 1927-28 were being dealt with.\n\nIn August during my vacation, the Rev. James McGuire, Principal of the Kamloops School wrote to Mr. Inspector Pragnell pointing out the necessity for the installation of a cupboard for the dairy, two boxes in the pantry for bread, a wood box for the kitchen, a cupboard and shelves for dishes in the scullery, which should have a sink in the centre, also two long tables.\n\nThe press reports state that Parliament will meet on the 5th of December, and it is expected that the Estimates for 1926-27 will be passed by the 18th.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand, therefore, I would strongly recommend that if money is at all available that the fixtures and furnishings mentioned above should be installed.\n\nFor your information I am hereto attaching a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Helmsing's letter of the 15th of June, to which is attached a sketch of the lockers, benches and cupboard for the girls' recreation room, and also a copy of the letter received from the Reverend Principal, dated 16th of August.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.DITCHBURN\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn compliance with instructions received from yourself while visiting Kamloops recently, I approached Harry Turner of the Kamloops Sash & Door Factory, with reference to the proposed cupboards and benches for the girls recreation room at Kamloops Residential School.\n\nOn the 14th inst., I visited the School, in company with Mr. Brown representing Harry Turner, and we looked over the whole situation. The enclosed rough plan represents the girls recreation room A.M.F.C. At the time of our visit, it was our intention only to put in lockers from the points D to C and E to A, but upon measuring out these two walls, it was discovered that it would be impossible to put in the necessary number of lockers required by Sister Superior, namely 20, and allow sufficient room in the locker to be of any value at all. We therefore decided that, in addition to these lockers mentioned, it would be better to run lockers from E to F. By doing this, you will note that we are able to get in 11 lockers, each of 12\" width, namely A to B 23 lockers; C to D 20 lockers; E to F, 28 lockers.\n\nUpon measuring up the walls for the benches, we have discovered that we will need 11 benches in all, namely 1 thirteen foot bench; 1-11 foot bench; 4-9 feet benches; 4-8 feet benches and 1-4'6\" bench, the reason for the different lengths being the different distances between bulkheads at various intervals around the walls of the recreation room.\n\nI also attach herewith quotations from Mr. H. Turner, in which he agrees to supply the material and do the work of installing the 71 lockers of dry fir, each locker to be supplied with a dry fir V-jointed door, brass hinges as per tracing on plan, each door being also fitted with a brass catch. At the places marked Dr. and HI and the pigeon holes referred to by Rev. Sister Superior, would be installed, each locker containing 42 pigeon holes 10\"x12\" in dimension. These are the press----to which Sister Superior referred when speaking to you. Each of the lockers would be fitted with 3 hooks, one on each side of the locker and one at the back. The lockers are to be stained and varnished dark oak.\n\nAt the lower left hand corner of the plan you will see the detail of the cornice for the entire length of the cupboards installed. The figure quoted by Mr. Turner for this work and material is $566.00. At the lower right hand corner of the plan I have made a rough sketch of the benches which are to be constructed. These are the same as the ones already supplied for the dining room of 2\" dry fir.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to follow the plan around the recreation room, and appreciate the idea I am intending to convey to you, and also the possibility of utilizing the wall for cupboards, in place of crowding them all into the space from A to D, and awaiting your instructions in the matter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n\"H.F.

Last year the linoleums, desks, tables, bedsteads, mattresses and blankets were furnished for the corridors, offices, dormitories and sewing rooms. To complete that list I would suggest a desk for the Superior's room.\n\nThere were, however, furnishings or fixtures for the provision rooms, dining rooms and sculleries which should have fallen under a collateral contract. For one reason or another these furnishings or fixtures were left in abeyance. They comprised, roughly speaking, a cupboard for the dairy, two boxes for bread in the pantry, a box for wood in the kitchen, all of which should be lined with zinc, a cupboard and shelves for dishes in the scullery which should have a sink in the center and two long tables requiring the attention of a carpenter and a plumber for a few hours; tables for the girls' wash room and benches for their recreation. Would you kindly learn from the department how far they would wish to go in these matters and instruct the Agent here accordingly, as it appears to me that most of these fixtures would have to be manufactured by the carpenter in the different rooms? Attention to this matter would fall under the domain of the Indian Agent.\n\nWith best wishes, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n\"James McGuire, O.M.I.\"\n\nColonel Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nNovember 11, 1926.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell:\n\nI wish to acknowledge and thank you for your comprehensive report on the situation at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note that the present accommodation is being used to the best advantage and that you recommend the other wing be erected as soon as possible. When we are preparing our Estimates, your representations will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. G.S.T. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 758,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nOctober 25th, 1926.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI am in receipt of your 184-0-5 of the 13th inst., and in accordance with your instructions, I visited the Kamloops Residential School on the 22nd inst., and went carefully into the matter of accommodation there, whether any better arrangement made of the present accommodation, and the advisability of proceeding in the near future with the other wing of the School. I discussed the matter lengthily with the Agent and Principal, and also looked into the matter myself by going over the whole of the dormitories and class rooms.\n\n1. With reference to the best method of using the present accommodation, I find that there are now resident at the school 71 boys and 80 girls, a total of 151. They are distributed as follows in the new wing:- 30 of the younger boys, up to about 10 years of age sleeping in the top storey dormitory of the new wing, i.e. the girls' wing. If there were more younger boys, about 10 more could be placed there, but it must be remembered that they have no inside toilet accommodation, except the two night closets.\n\n28 and 33 girls are sleeping in the big dormitories and 13 in a little dormitory. This is full capacity, and the balance of the girls are sleeping in the infirmaries.\n\nAll the classrooms in the girls' wing are in use to their capacity, and the smaller male children have had to be accommodated in the staff dining room, a crowded and poorly lighted room for 27 children at school work. The new wing is, therefore, filled to capacity.\n\nIn the old buildings, there are 41 of the older boys sleeping in the dormitory, which is overcrowded. They have only outside lavatory accommodation, with very poor ablution tables inside and practically no cupboard room. They have only one classroom in an old building, using double desks with room for 40. Their recreation room is in the old building and very small. The whole of the above mentioned buildings are heated inadequately with stoves, and in extreme cold I don't know what could be done to keep the place warm.\n\nThis accounts for the present accommodation, and although we all three went into the matter thoroughly, I cannot see how the present accommodation can be better apportioned. In other words, it is being used at the present time, to its very best advantage, though with various drawbacks and difficulties that cannot be overcome without further and improved accommodation.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDr. D.C. Scott.\n\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\nHaving in view this fact, and for the hereinafter mentioned reasons, I can only advise the building of the new wing as a solution.\n\n1. The mixing of boys and girls dormitories in the same wing, as at present, is not at all desirable, on moral and disciplinary grounds alone.\n\n2. The boys that are accommodated there have, of necessity, to use outside toilets, which, at their best, are a serious menace to health in an institution of this kind, apart from the discomfort occasioned these younger children during the cold weather.\n\n3. The necessary use for want of other accommodation of the staff dining room as a school room for these younger children is not advisable. The room is not built or lighted for such purpose, is far too small, and deprives the staff of a room where they can get their meals.\n\n4. By having to accommodate boys in this wing, the number of girls that can be taken at the school is restricted.\n\n5. The old building where over 40 now sleep, is not suitable for that purpose. It is crowded, difficult to heat, owing to its age, and dangerous from the point of view of fire, being heated with stoves, which, in addition, cause extra labour. It has no fire escapes and I have to point out that a fire already occurred in the girls' old wing. Overheating of stoves in attempting to keep the place reasonably warm, is a very probable danger.\n\n6. The sanitary accommodation is very inadequate, and dangerous to health. There are no water closets in the building, and night pans have to be used, a poor and dangerous makeshift in crowded dormitories. The closets are all outside and are open pit ones, very difficult, despite the use of disinfectants, to keep clean. Serious contamination of the ground is likely to occur after all these years of use.\n\n7. The wash room and ablution table is inadequate and subject to a total freeze-up.\n\n8. Cupboard accommodation is practically nil.\n\n9. The recreation room is very small, being the old laundry, and is in such a poor condition that it is very difficult to heat with a stove.\n\n10. The bigger boys' classroom is heated by a stove and owing to its smallness, double desks have to be used, which system is not considered good by educational authorities. It might also be better lighted.\n\n11. Owing to the isolation of these old buildings from the main building and one another, the difficulty of supervision is largely increased, and discomfort caused to all in cold, wintry weather, as all communication is in the open.\nDr. D.C. Scott.\n\nOctober 25, 1926.\n\n12. Under present conditions, the water pressure in the hydrants in the new building is very slight, and would be useless in case of fire.\n\n13. The use at times of the infirmaries for sleeping accommodation is not desirable as they may be required in case of sickness.\n\n14. Finally, the Principal assures me that he can easily find many more pupils to fill the new wing if it is built. He, of course, would have 71 boys to put into it straight away, which would then leave the two dormitories in each wing to be filled. Mr. Agent Helmsing also informs me that there are a number of children in his area who might get a chance to go to school, and I myself know that in the Northern part of the Lytton Agency, there are a number of children who are not getting any schooling.\n\nHaving in view, therefore, all the above facts, and at the same time, bearing in mind that it is of urgent necessity that the Lytton School be rebuilt, which will mean double expenditure, I still can only recommend that construction of the new wing be proceeded with in the near future.\n\nI am really somewhat reluctant in making this recommendation as I do not want the chance of the Lytton building being made to be held up, but after examining all details as specified above, I cannot make any other recommendation.\n\nHoping that this report is fully understandable,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo.

Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, B.C.,\nOct. 25, 1926.\n\nDear Agent:\n\nWe are making a request for some material to finish our potato cellar; for the walls and part of the roof we brought logs some fifteen miles. They were cut at the Timber Reserve outside the Indian Reserve.\n\nWe are requesting you for authority to purchase four thousand feet of shiplap, one thousand feet of two inch plank, one keg of two and a half inch nails, four barrels of lime, twelve sacks of cement and rubberoid roofing to cover sixteen hundred feet. The shiplap and planks would run $21. from the Kamloops Lumber Company. The nails about $5.65, and the rubberoid roofing, sixteen rolls at $4.25 a roll. The cement would run about $1.35 from Johnston & Gill, and the lime $4.00 a bbl.\n\nThe Kamloops Lumber Company and Johnston & Gill are practically alone in the field here to supply lumber, lime and cement, so we are purchasing everything from them.\n\nIf an answer to this could be obtained from the Department by a night lettergram at our expense I would be pleased, as we are hastening to put our potatoes under cover.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCITY.\nOttawa, October 13, 1926.\n\nDear Col.

I am today writing Mr. Inspector Pragnell, asking him to make an inspection of the school with a view to a full report concerning the use of the present accommodation. He will also make a recommendation as to the advisability of erecting the other wing at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDear Doctor,\n\nIn view of the pressure of business at the end of the year, I have belated some of my correspondence, the enclosure included.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of Oct. 6th, I may say that my letter was not intended as an argument for the erection of the boys' wing; in fact I think I have not yet written to you concerning that matter.\n\nThe object of my letter was to learn whether or not you intended to place an item on the estimates covering the cost of the boys' building. I wished to know your attitude before placing before you any further information, or before taking any definite action.\n\nIn regard to the disposal of space at the school, I believe of course that we are making the best possible use of it. I have never done anything else besides school work, and feel quite sure that we are using room to the best possible advantage. However, it is the obvious that very often escape a man: a man too close to a church may be a stone instead of a building! So here. Why not ask the agent, the Inspector of Agencies, the Chief Inspector, or Indian Commissioner to pay me a visit with this end in view?\n\nThe information of these officers would have\nthe advantage of being first-hand; they would know whereof they spoke.\n\nMy ordinary duties occupy too much of my time to allow me much time for correspondence. However, when I learn whether or not you intend to build our building in your coming estimates, I may set down in order some of this scattered information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire\n\nDr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nOttawa.\n\nOut.\nOttawa, September 23rd, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the request made in November, last, for authority to purchase 1 barrel of oil for the floors in the classrooms, dormitories, etc., at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of one barrel of suitable oil after securing competitive prices. It is understood that the school management will be responsible for the labour in applying the oil. In future, however, the Rev. Principal will have to make purchase of any oil that may be necessary for the floors.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the barrel of oil.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. F. Helmsing, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. 154-0-5, under date of November 24, 1925, authorizing the purchase of one barrel of oil for use in the dormitories, classrooms, etc., I beg to say that the Rev. Principal has not as yet purchased the said oil, owing to his desire to get a suitable oil, that is, an oil that will not darken the floors.\n\nRev. Father McGuire, today phoned this office asking if it would be in order to purchase this oil now. As the fiscal year for which this expenditure was authorized, has expired, Mr. Inspector Pragnell and myself are both of the opinion that a new authority is now necessary.\n\nI should be much obliged, therefore, if the Department would re-authorize this expenditure at as early a date as possible.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n(Alfred H.

Stewart, Kamloops, B.C., for repairs to the floors, etc., at Kamloops Residential School, owing to scorching from the pipe leading from the boiler in the laundry room to the main chimney, as referred to in my wire of the 5th inst., I beg to advise you that Mr. Stewart, upon opening up the floor in the girls' recreation room which is situated immediately above the laundry, discovered that the stringers in the floor were badly scorched, and also some paper and refuse which had been left in below the floor in the recreation room, and over the ceiling of the boiler room of the laundry, had also become scorched. The pipe leading to the main chimney was situated quite close to the ceiling in the boiler room. Over the pipe there was placed metal nailed to the ceiling. This pipe, while the fire was burning in the furnace, on wash days, naturally became very hot, heating the metal which is nailed on the ceiling. There was no air space allowed between this metal and ceiling, consequently the ceiling had become scorched causing smoke to penetrate through the floors and baseboards in the girls' recreation room, causing the fire scare which we recently had.\n\nMr. Stewart removed this piece of metal and has replaced it with another piece of sheet metal, allowing an air space between the ceiling and the metal, and below this metal he has placed a sheet of asbestos, with another sheet of black iron below that, so that now there should be no danger of scorching the ceiling of the boiler room, and no danger of fire under ordinary conditions.\n\nThe voucher enclosed is in the sum of $24.95 which includes material supplied, together with 19 hours labor and three trips between Kamloops and the School. I most respectfully submit that the account be honoured and paid forthwith.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW. H.

You may arrange for the purchase of a desk, three chairs and a conglomerate rug for the office of the Sister Superior. Competitive prices should be secured.\n\nYou may also arrange to have built by day labour a cupboard for the dairy, two bread boxes for the pantry, a woodbox for the kitchen and a cupboard and shelves for dishes in the scullery. Further, you may arrange for two long tables in the scullery with a sink in the centre. The Indian Agent or yourself should purchase the materials and the work should be done under his supervision, on a day labour basis. Time sheets, in duplicate, showing the receipts of the carpenter, should be kept. If Mr. Helmsing requires an accountable cheque for payment of labour, he should make application to the Department.\n\nWith reference to benches and lockers in the girls' recreation room, I have the offer with rough sketch of the Kamloops Sash and Door Factory. Is it possible to secure competitive prices for this work? Is there another local firm who would like to quote?

The Principal of the school should arrange for the payment of the drum which contained this oil, and when the same is empty, he could have it returned to the above firm and a refund obtained. Please inform the Reverend Principal accordingly. We note that a charge of $5 was made for the drum. We will forward a cheque to the above firm to the amount of $61.10 covering the cost of the oil in the course of the next few days. We note from the copy of the letter which you enclosed from the Principal that this oil was considered by him to be the best he could obtain for the purpose for which it is required.\n\nAs you were informed in our letter of September 23rd, last, any further supply of oil required for the floors will have to be purchased by the school from their per capita grant or other receipts. Please explain to the above firm that payment is being made by the Department for the oil only.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nF.

Snowdon, Calgary, for one 47 gallon drum of Sanispray oil, shipped to Rev. Father McGuire, f.o.b. Kamloops, at the rate of $1.30 per gallon.\n\nI also attach herewith copy of Rev. Father McGuire's letter, in which he requests that the oil quoted on by C.C. Snowdon of Calgary, be purchased as, in his opinion, it is the most suitable oil for the purpose required, consequently, this oil was ordered and I trust that my action will be approved.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH.F.

The floors were bright; the oil was dark. Since then we have found several oils which we think will preserve the wood and at the same time not darken it. We renewed permission through Mr. Barber, Acting Indian Agent in September, as you see by the enclosure.\n\nWe are sending the prices submitted. We are of the opinion that the oil supplied by Mr. C.C. Snowdon, Calgary, Alta., is the most suitable.\n\nAs usual we are leaving the actual ordering to your office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McGuire, O.M.I.\n\nMr. Helmsing,\nIndian Agent,\nCity.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nKAMLOOPS AGENCY.\n\nTo C.C.

Helmsing)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, March 14th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School to have a cupboard built in the second scullery of a similar type to that recently constructed in one of the other sculleries. We note that the contractor will build this cupboard at a cost not exceeding $135.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this cupboard being erected, and the sketch plan which you forwarded is returned herewith as requested for the use of the contractor.\n\nWhen the work has been completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Box 732\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\nApril 28, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to report that on Monday, April 25th, a fire occurred at Kamloops Residential School, in which the slaughter house and implement shed were burned down, becoming a total loss. As luck would have it, the wind was blowing away from the main buildings, otherwise it is more than probable that they would have caught fire as well.\n\nThe Kamloops Fire Brigade took a chance against the advice of the Public Works Engineer, and crossed over the bridge to the School in order to deal with the fire. When they arrived there, it was found that they could do nothing, as their length of intake (suction hose) was not long enough to get down to the river in the low state of the water. They were, therefore, powerless to help in any way.\n\nThe fire originated from some sparks in connection with the boiling of some chicken food in a small iron boiler some 30 feet or more away from the building, but there was a strong wind blowing at the time.\n\nI am reporting this matter because I wish to again draw your attention to the fact that this school, a valuable new building is now without any fire protection whatever, and it is naturally a very anxious job for the Principal to be responsible both for the property and life in a building of this sort.\n\nAt the time of my visit over to the School to see what had happened, my attention was drawn to a matter that I have not noticed or heard of before. The chimney from the laundry is not sufficiently high to carry off the sparks. Apparently an attempt was made to rectify this matter by placing a spark arrester on the top of the chimney, but from what was shown me this spark arrester is evidently not sufficient, and the chimney should be heightened at least ten feet. The shingles on the top of the school building are already drying out and beginning to curl. This is due to excessive heat of the sun and radiation from surrounding rocks and sand. Sparks, therefore, from this laundry chimney are liable to lodge in the turning ends of these shingles and start fire, and if a fire should be started at the present moment, nothing could stop it.\n\nI should recommend, therefore, that authority be wired this Agency to have this chimney heightened as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nGSP/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, May 3, 1927.\n\nGeo. S.

McLEAN.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\nOttawa, May 4th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, reporting a fire which occurred in the slaughter house and implement shed at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. It is noted that the fire originated from sparks from a small iron boiler in which chicken food was being boiled. The Department is pleased to learn that under the circumstances as mentioned by you at the time no further damage occurred.\n\nWith reference to your recommendation that the chimney of the laundry be heightened some 10 feet, I beg to confirm the following telegram to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"You may add to chimney laundry building Kamloops school.\"\n\nYou should arrange for the purchase of any material required and for the labour. When the work is completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nIn connection with fire protection for the buildings, I may say that arrangements will be made to install adequate fire escapes, fire protection, etc., when the new wing is completed. I shall be pleased, however, if you will state what fire extinguishers, if any, are on hand at this school and if you would recommend that a further supply be installed at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 23rd., 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose copies of the letters just received by me from the Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School and the Medical Health Officer respectively. The latter, I have to point out, is also Medical Officer for the Indian Department.\n\nThe matter has arisen over the fact that the Boys' Wing of this school is not to be erected immediately, and the question as to what is to be done with the boys during the coming winter.\n\nYou will notice from the letters of both these gentlemen, that they consider the present accommodation and arrangements for the boys at the school, most unsanitary and unsuitable from the health point of view, in addition to the extreme difficulties and discomfort over the heating in the cold weather, to which I might add the great danger from fire, and possibly loss of life.\n\nThey attribute, as you can see, a lot of the ill health amongst the children during the last eight or nine months, to these conditions.\n\nIf you will refer to my report, dated October 26th, 1926, I think you will find that I have covered the ground as completely as possible, and allowed the necessity for immediate improvement in the accommodation for the boys.\n\nI have nothing to add to this except to say that probably both these gentlemen are right in attributing the infection, colds, pneumonia, etc., that has been prevalent among the children, to the conditions complained of.\n\nYou will note in the Principal's letter that he asked me to pay an early visit and make arrangements for the housing of the boys.\n\nI therefore made the visit, discussed the matter with him, the Sister Superior and the Medical Health Officer. It is a very hard matter to make suggestions in this case, except that I agree with them that something should be done, and that it would be very risky, if not cruel, to keep the boys during this coming winter, under the present conditions.\n\nI take it that in order to save time, I am in order in laying before you, the alternatives and suggestions in the matter, as they occur to me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 822-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe alternatives appear to be three.\n\n1. To close the school during the winter, anyhow as regards the boys.\n2. To improve, if possible, the present accommodation.\n3. To make fresh accommodation, even if only temporary.\n\nNo. 1 is for many reasons not desirable, and I take it, it might lead to the closing of the rest of the School, owing to want of necessary boy labour.\n\nNo. 2 would cost quite a lot of money, due to the age of the present buildings, and their detachment from the new building. Even then, it is doubtful if they could be made sanitary as the surrounding ground is honeycombed with old cesspits. Any money, too, spent in this way would be a total loss, having in view the probable erection of the new wing in the near future.\n\nNo. 3, seems to be the only solution other than closing, that I can see.\n\nMy suggestion in this matter is as follows:\n\nHaving in view the fact that at some future time a building will have to be erected for work shops and manual training, which I understand is considered of importance by the Department, that the said building be erected immediately, and used for the winter to accommodate the boys.\n\nI should suggest a two storey, concrete walled building about 20'x 50' with gravelled roof, abutting on to the concrete engine house of the new building. I attach a rough sketch to help explain my suggestion. This building I estimate, very roughly, should cost about $5000.00, but please do not take my figure, as Mr. Orr can probably estimate the cost very quickly. Some money is, of course, saved by the fact that one wall, the end one, would abut against the concrete wall of the engine house. Again, the heating of the building could be done by connecting up the present heating plant. This also applies to the plumbing, which would be of the simplest and most temporary. Rough ablution tables, after the style of those used in the barrack hutsments during the war. I attach sketches of same.\n\nThe ground floor could be concrete floored at one end, and could ultimately be used as a blacksmith shop, but temporarily as an ablution and wash room. The remainder of the ground floor, where the carpenter, shoemakers, harness repair shops, and possibly garage would ultimately be could be used temporarily as a recreation room, and not partitioned off.\n\nUpstairs could be used a dormitory for the boys during the winter, and then finally used as sleeping quarters for the male help on the farm, who at the present time, have no decent sleeping quarters.\nLarge windows would not be required, nor any expensive inside fittings. Any partition required could be of a temporary nature.\n\nThis building would be fireproof, with easy access to the engine room roof from the dormitory, and so to the ground in case of fire. It would be sanitary, away from any possible source of contamination, and would be handy for administration. It would be attached to the boys' wing, which would be desirable in the future, as such training and work would be in the boys' curriculum. It would not disfigure the main building. The money would not be wasted, and finally, I do not think it would be a costly matter, and could be erected, I expect, at short notice.\n\nThe above is the only solution that I can think of, though tendered with due respect to your more mature judgment or the situation.\n\nI have sent a copy of this correspondence to Mr. Ditchburn, as I have already done with my previous report already mentioned.\n\nHoping that I am in order in tendering my summing up of the situation and suggestions,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, June 17, 1927.\n\nDear Colonel:\n\n1. The enclosure from our Medical Health Officer explains itself in its own line. Dr. Archibald, Dr. H.L. Burris, the Sister and I have been following these outbreaks in a quiet and determined manner for some time past. So these findings are nothing new.\n\n2. We have removed the old laundry and the little boys' toilets and are giving the ground a copious coat of lime before harrowing or spading thoroughly.\n\n3. Where the laundry water overflowed last year we have cultivated the ground and planted a small vegetable garden.\n\n4. In the face of these difficulties I would suggest that you pay us an early visit and make arrangements for the housing of the boys.\n\n5. We may consider ourselves extremely fortunate that we have succeeded in carrying out these investigations without the news spreading among the Indians. The nearest approach to it was when Joe Jules, during the cold weather, removed his children from school. Their commentaries on the little boys in the old laundry caused me much alarm indeed. I'll have no more of it.\n\n6. The children leave for holidays on June 21st and return Aug. 1st.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) James McGuire O.M.I.\n\nColonel Fregnell,\nInspector of Ind.

The wood about the floors is water-soaked and the surrounding soil is saturated with the accumulation of years. It is most unsanitary besides being very cold in winter. The younger boys going from this room to the heated dormitories of the new building where they sleep are subjected to conditions very detrimental to their health, and we have had experience of numerous infections, colds, bronchitis and pneumonia during the past winter.\n\nThe dormitories and school room of the older boys consists of two buildings which are scarcely an improvement on the old laundry. They are cold in winter and absolutely unsuitable for the purposes for which they are intended. I looked over the wash-room of the dormitories yesterday which is in a decidedly dilapidated and unsanitary state.\n\nBesides this, these old buildings have outside toilets which are in a tumble-down, rotten condition; the soil about them is saturated with sewerage and the stench from them is unbearable. These toilets are a distinct menace to the health of the children and not at all in keeping with the appointments of a modern school. I would advise that these be demolished at once and some new arrangements made.\n\nDuring the past year we have had a succession of infections in the school which it is impossible to eradicate in the presence of such unsanitary conditions.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) M.G.

BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 16th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to the matter of heightening one of the chimneys at Kamloops Residential School, I now beg to enclose vouchers for $25.00, covering charges for installing a proper spark arrester in order to avoid danger from sparks from the said chimney falling on the shingle roof.\n\nThis matter was gone into very carefully and the local builders here inform me that with a proper spark arrester placed on this chimney as has now been done, there is no need of heightening the chimney as was originally considered by me. There is also some doubt whether, without great expense, this chimney could be heightened. Therefore, having in view the said expense and the opinion expressed by the builders on this point, I came to the conclusion that if, as stated, the spark arrester of a certain mesh was placed on the chimney, it would eliminate the danger, and there was no need of going to a much greater expense in strengthening and heightening the chimney. I trust that my decision will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nI notice, with reference to back correspondence on this matter with the Indian Agent, that your 154-0-8 of the 3rd of January, authorized the Indian to expend the sum of $10.00 for a spark arrester. Now $10.00 would properly install a proper spark arrester, I don't know, as it is utterly impossible to put one in at this price. Having the urgency of the case in view, and the danger involved by delay as well as the saving effected by not having the chimney heightened, I took it that my authorizing an extra $15.00 would be in order.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo.

Would you oblige me by learning whether or not it could be installed here during the present vacation?\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain,\nVery truly yours,\nJames McLean, O.M.I.\n\nColonel Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nKamloops, B.C.\nTRUCK DRY ROOMS\n\nTRUCK DRY ROOMS will at once appeal to those who are looking for a strong, well built and symmetrically proportioned dry room. The outside wood cabinet is constructed of the most carefully selected white pine, tongued, grooved and beaded, and finished with two coats of yellow shellac. Built in sections which bolt together and thus can be easily transported and erected. The inner surface of the wood is sheeted with asbestos, which in turn is covered with a lining of bright tin. The tin used is of heavy plate and the sheets (10 x 14 inches) are lock-jointed rather than being soldered together. This construction makes the Truck Dry Room absolutely fire-proof on the inside.\n\nThe steam coils are of $1\\frac{1}{4}$ in. pipe, 18 pipes high, and are made up in sections with return bends, so that each is a complete coil in itself. After being made up, each coil is tested to 150 pounds pressure before leaving the factory.\n\nThe trucks are constructed entirely of metal and are supplied with galvanized iron carrier bars. Furnishings for a Truck include three all-metal collar and cuff bars and six plain bars. If the three collar and cuff bars are not desired, we will substitute six plain bars therefor, provided this is specified when ordering. Each truck will be fitted with three pairs of cleats arranged for four bars each, so that there will be more openings for bars than there would be bars furnished.\n\nThe proper circulation of the air in each compartment is effected by means of a fan suspended from the roof. This fan has four metal blades and is driven by a horizontal countershaft and bevel gears.\n\nThe equipment also includes a floor covering of galvanized iron, to be used when dryer is placed on a wood floor, or anchor bolts where dryer is placed on cement floor.\n\nThe kind of floor on which dryer is to be placed should be specified when ordering. Suitable angle iron tracks for guiding the trucks are also provided.\n\nFurnished in \"Canadian\" diversity of control - Belt or Motor Driven.\n\n| No. | No. of Openings | No. of Trucks Dry Room Holds | No. of Trucks Sent | No. of Coils | Front | Depth | Height Over All | Shipping Weight |\n|-----|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|-------|-----------------|----------------|\n| 3420| 1               | 1                             | 2                 | 3           | 11\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" | 8' 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" | 9' 2\"          | 2225 lb        |\n| 3421| 2               | 2                             | 3                 | 6           | 10\"   | 8'     | 9' 2\"           | 3525 lb        |\n| 3422| 3               | 3                             | 4                 | 9           | 9\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" | 8' 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" | 9' 2\"          | 4725 lb        |\n| 3423| 4               | 4                             | 6                 | 13\"         | 8'     | 9' 2\"  | 9' 2\"           | 6250 lb        |\n| 3424| 6               | 6                             | 9                 | 10' 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" | 8' 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" | 9' 2\"          | 9300 lb        |\n\nPulley to drive fan, 9\" dia.; Speed Pulley, 140 R.P.M.; Belt to drive fan, 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" wide.

The #3420 and 3430 will weight approximately 3000 lbs. The #3421 and 3431 will weigh approximately 4000 lbs. We bring carloads of machinery through from the factory quite frequently, and no doubt could have one of these Dry Rooms enclosed for you, and could offer you the carload rate of $2.20 per 100 lbs.

Principal would like to have installed at the School. These I am enclosing herewith in order that you may decide as to whether or not they should be built.

Mr. Helmsing was to have included with these sketches a quotation for the building of the same.

C.\nOttawa, May 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to fire protection at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. I note that you are securing a report on the possibility of heightening the laundry chimney.\n\nThe Department is today ordering a full supply of chemical fire extinguishers. An extra quota of the 2\u00bd gallon size is being supplied, as these are considered more useful than the large extinguishers that are on wheels. One quart size extinguishers are also being supplied. Three of the large size should be placed in the basement and three on each of the other three floors, at convenient and easily accessible places. The six extra of the large size should be placed where they can be quickly used in the event of fire on the roof. The small size extinguishers should be placed in the more remote portions of the building. A total of 18 large and 20 small ones are being ordered.\n\nYou may let me have an estimate of the cost of installing a simple fire alarm system in the building. Nothing elaborate should be estimated on, as I consider it sufficient to have two gongs and two push buttons on each floor. When you have received a quotation on this installation, you should forward it to the Department without delay. You may also arrange to have fire axes placed in inexpensive cases at the exit points of the building, which are ordinarily kept locked at night.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. S. Pagnell, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nP. O. Box 752,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\nMay 17th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your 164-0-5 of the 4th inst., with reference to fire protection at Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI am awaiting the builder's report upon the possibility of heightening the laundry chimney in question, but, in the meanwhile, as a temporary expedient, a spark arrester has been placed over the top of the said chimney. You probably know that authority has been granted for a spark arrester before, but it had not been properly erected, and even then, I shall not be satisfied until the said chimney is heightened, as I believe that is the only safe method during the extremely hot weather here.\n\nIn the last paragraph of your letter, you mention that adequate fire protection will be installed when the new wing is completed. I had hopes, and so had Father McGuire, that the new wing would shortly be started, but I hear a rumor to the effect that it is not going to be done this year. I much regret this, in more ways than one, as I am constantly in fear of an outbreak of infectious disease, owing to the unsatisfactory accommodation now being used by the boys.\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, particularly having in view the fact that the school, apparently, is not going to be started this year, I am very strongly in favour of a reasonably powerful chemical fire extinguisher being placed on each floor. This might save incipient fire started in the building, but, as I have already pointed out, the chief danger from fire is in connection with the roof, and whether these extinguishers would be of any use in the case of fire on the roof, I cannot say.\n\nAs you know from my reports, wood shingles up here in the Dry Belt, are very apt to curl, in the extreme heat and allow sparks to lodge underneath them. After four or five months, without a drop of rain, or even dew, these shingles become like kindling. An instance of this was the fire in the roof at Cranbrook Indian Residential School.\n\nI notice that you ask whether I would recommend a further supply of fire extinguishers. Apparently there is some error in this, as according to Reverend Father McGuire, there are none at all.\n\nI should also strongly recommend that some system of fire alarm be installed in the building. I should\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary.\n\nMay 17th, 1927.\n\nsuggest that gongs be placed outside each door, and that an electrical button (push) to ring these gongs, be placed in the Principal's room, and in that of the head sister on each floor.\n\nThis should not be an expensive business to install, and would, in case of fire, ensure the children getting out of bed immediately and proceed to their nearest fire escape. As it is, in case of fire, somebody is liable to run along the passage shouting that there is a fire and this, naturally, would only lead to confusion. In addition too, it would be useful for fire drill.\n\nFinally, outside each fire escape an axe, in a glass case, should be placed, in order that, in case of fire, in the confusion, the keys to the exits, should be forgotten, there is something handy to break open the exits. I might say that these exits have to be kept locked at nights, owing to the fact that some of the children would leave for other parts during the nights, if they were not locked in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

At the first opportunity, you should determine exactly what is required, and forward your recommendation, with prices, if possible. I may say that Father McQuire has written that he would like the wash stand and lockers for the girls' side installed at the first opportunity.\n\nThe sketches you forwarded which have to do with further work requested by the Reverend Principal are being returned to you. Some of this appears unnecessary to the Department, but you may make a recommendation, with estimate of the cost, regarding whatever you consider is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nAs the children return from vacation on Aug. 15 and at the same time two more Sisters are added to our staff, I am requesting authority:\n\n1. To furnish two more rooms and put a wardrobe and dresser with drawers in the Sisters' cell in the medium girls dormitory. The prices would not exceed those enclosed.\n\n2. To install the washstand and lockers for the girls. The enclosure says the plans are with you. These plans cost us much time and money. Please return them and permit us to install the washstand and lockers at least immediately.\n\n3. To put in the door between the kitchen and dining room to control the fly pest.\n\nYours very truly,\nJames McQuire O.M.I.\n\nTo Duncan C.

I am told that they have actually only been in use for two winters, this being the third one.\n\nThe grate on the second furnace will soon be out of business as well. The bars are all bending downwards, one having already broken away and the others are likely to break off very soon.\n\nI thought that you would like to have this information.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nGeo.

It would appear that the school authorities have neglected to keep the ash pit clean, which of course would immediately cause the burning out of the grates.\n\nPlease let me have a full report on these boilers, and if the grates were defective I think the Vulcan Iron Works of Vancouver should replace them without cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nNovember 18th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn yesterday's date I visited Kamloops Indian School, and met the new Principal, Rev. Father Duplantil. I am glad to say that he has managed to work out a method of housing the boys as regards their sleeping quarters, anyway during the winter months.\n\nHe proposes to use the top storey of the girls' wing. In the interests of discipline, and in order that there be no contact between the boys and girls, he will use the fire escape as a staircase for the boys to get up and down to their dormitory. However, we find that a few necessary changes will have to take place to make this possible. The fire escape, as it is, would be dangerous to use during the winter time, as the iron gets very slippery under feet, and also the hand rail, owing to the extreme cold, would be likely to hurt the hands. It is therefore necessary that a hand rail 2x4, planned, be wired to the present iron rail, and also that the platforms be covered with boards, and that boards be fastened to each step.\n\nIn addition, it would be necessary to build a further flight of about ten steps from where the fire escape ends to the ground. Finally, a double sided Yale, or other patent lock would be necessary on the door communicating between the upper dormitory and the flight of steps leading to the second floor where the girls are.\n\nHaving in view the fact of the difficulty of accommodating the boys, and the present bad state of their other accommodation, I would strongly recommend that authority be granted to do this work.\n\nThe Principal also drew my attention to the fact that the scullery shelves, lockers and ablation tables, as already planned for, have not been installed. I wrote Mr. Ditchburn upon this matter today, as I understand he has it in hand.\n\nThe Principal also asked that I get authority to purchase some strips of matching linoleum about one foot wide to place above the blackboards that are now being installed. This linoleum is to take the children's work and drawing pins, and is exactly the same thing that was placed above the blackboards originally put in the school.\n\nFinally he requested that a door be built in, at an estimated cost of $35.00, from the second floor just at the head of the staircase. This board would serve two purposes:\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\nThe Secretary,\n\nNovember 18th, 1927.\n\n(1) It would cut off the girls' dormitories from the staircase in case the boys may have to use that in very bad weather;\n\n(2) It would be very useful in acting as a check draught in the case of fire.\n\nAs, apparently, the new Principal is doing his best to make a success of the school, using what accommodation he has available, I think it would be as well to encourage him by granting these requested improvements.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nNovember 30th, 1927.\n\nK-16-2565.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your 154-0-5 of the 21st inst., regarding necessary replacement of grates at Kamloops Indian Residential School, owing to their being burned out, I have to report that my enquiries on the subject resulted as follows:\n\nFirstly, it is alleged by the authorities at the school that the ashes have always been kept clear. Secondly, that nothing but wood has ever been used in these boilers. Whilst I, myself, am not technically clear upon the matter, having in view the fact that only wood has been used in these boilers, I should not think that the grates should have burned out so quickly, even if they there had been a certain amount of wood ash left in the pits. This neglect, however, is denied by the school authorities. Certainly when I visited the School and saw the boilers in use, the pits were quite clear of any ashes whatever.\n\nWhen making the order to the Vulcan Iron Works, I pointed out that I did not think that these grate bars would have burned out and bent in such a short time. Their answer was that they thought that probably the grates had not been cleaned out often enough and ash allowed to accumulate. They did not, however, comment upon the fact of which I informed them, that only wood had been used. I am writing them again upon the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed)\n(Geo. S.

BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nDecember 1st., 1927.\n\nK-16-2576.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to enclose in triplicate, an account handed to me by Rev. Father Duplanil, Principal of Kamloops Residential School. He does not know whether this account was authorized by yourselves directly to the late Principal, Rev. Father McGuire. Whilst the work was apparently very necessary, and had to be done, the matter was not referred to this office. No authority was given to Mr. Giddens to do this work, by me.\n\nI am therefore enclosing same to find out whether you know anything about the matter at all. If you have no correspondence upon the matter and want to save time, I can only recommend that the account be paid as it was for work that was done and absolutely necessary, the said work being in connection with the lavatories at the school, and in explanation of the necessity of same, Mr. Giddens, the plumber, informs me that the defects were probably caused through some foreign matter, possibly sand, in the water pumped from the river.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nNov. 25, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to placing the boys in the top floor of the new girls' wing, I beg to say that I do not think it is necessary to make use of the fire escapes as a means of access to these dormitories. If the corridors on the ground and first floor are closed by doors, as indicated in red on the accompanying blue prints, the boys could use the general stair case, without being able to obtain access to the girls' portion of the building.\n\nYou may purchase the necessary battleship linoleum for placing above the black boards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McGuire, Principal, and others on sketches which have been lost, I hasten to report that on a visit to this School on September 15th last, the matter was taken up with Principal McGuire and I asked him to have new sketches prepared for the fixtures shown or those sketches which could not be found. These were for the lockers in the wash room, wash room tables, etc., etc., and it was arranged that he should do this, after which he should turn them over to Constable Barber (Inspector Fragnell being absent) who was to obtain estimates from the local factories for the different fixtures. After waiting until the 11th November, I wrote to Mr. Inspector Fragnell on the matter and then learned that shortly after my September visit to the School, Father McGuire had been replaced by Reverend Jno. Duplainier. On the 17th instant I went to Kamloops to see the new Principal and on other Departmental business.\n\nIn discussing the subject with the Reverend Principal, he informed me that he believed that what he considered to be necessary in the way of fixtures could be constructed on the premises at a great deal less expense to the Department than if the work were given out by contract and manufactured in one of the local woodwork shops. He estimated that by carrying out the elaborate ideas of Reverend Father McGuire it would cost fully $1,200, or $1,500, but he felt that if he were allowed to employ a joiner himself and purchase the material, he could have the work done for about $700.00. He stated that he had arrangements whereby he could purchase lumber and other material in Vancouver at much cheaper rates than the same could be obtained in Kamloops.\n\nI, therefore, would recommend the matter be handled in this manner, as the new Principal is a very practical man with considerable experience. He was principal of St. Mary's School at Mission and the Sechelt School before going to Kamloops.\n\nAfter going all over the building, I recommend the following fixtures be installed:\n\n- Lockers for the wash rooms,\n- Wash tables in the wash rooms,\n- Table for the fruit room,\n- Two cupboards for the pantry,\n- Lockers for the girls' kitchenette rooms,\n- Cupboard in the store room,\n- A few more lockers in the girls' recreation room,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRoom closets,\nClosets for the pupils' goods,\nCupboard for the Sisters' dining room,\nShelving for the Sister Superior's offices,\nBook cases for the class rooms,\nLockers for the Sisters' Community room,\nDivided shelving for the linen closet.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

The inspection was made at the request of the Dept. but before my taking over the school, and, though I know that the inspection was made, I cannot sign the vouchers.\"\n\nI presume that these documents were forwarded by the Provincial Government, but I do not know. Beyond the fact that I was informed by the authorities at the School that a boiler inspection had taken place, I know nothing of the matter.

The ground floor joists are on above the wash-rooms and lavatories and the rest of the building is up to the height for the joists, but the steel for this has not yet arrived. They have been promised delivery of this by the end of the week. All the granite work and the metal lath are on the job and plumbing supplies are being delivered.

Two or three of the suggested alterations were so expensive that he could not sanction them but he asked me to write and say that the following have his approval providing the architect approves them too.\n\nBasement. Increase the number of showers from six to twelve and shorten the wash table.\n\nInstal Shanks #4547 Seat Actuated Closets in place of range P9801.\n\nGround Floor. Decrease the size of the two bathrooms, put in extra partition and door and instal extra toilet next to the outside wall.\n\nAt the end of the corridor next to the existing building, leave out the partition between Stores and Staff room and make one room. Also leave out one door.\n\nFirst Floor. The stud partition about sixteen feet six inches long, between Staff Duty Room and the ventilating\nshafts to be left out.\n\nThese changes will probably cost in the neighbourhood of one thousand dollars, but I will let you know definitely as soon as I receive the contractors' prices.\n\nIf these changes are approved by the architect I shall be glad if you will wire me as the plumber is ready to start his work and will need to prepare for these.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to confirm my wire to you today as follows\n\n\"CONTRACTORS ANXIOUS TO KNOW IF FIRST CERTIFICATE PAID AND MAILED\"\n\nyours truly\n\nJ.

I may add that it will be necessary that an Order in Council be first obtained by this Department before a contract is awarded and I would ask you therefore to kindly inform your district Engineer accordingly.\n\nWill you please advise me whether it will be possible for one of your local Officers at Kamloops to undertake on behalf of this Department the supervision of the above mentioned installation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Johnson, Esq., C.E.,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 5)\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI had an opportunity of inspecting Kamloops Indian Residential School building with the Contractor. The foundation is finished and they are beginning the brick work. I believe he is having some difficulty in finding bricklayers, and the work is not progressing as rapidly as I had hoped.\n\nOne matter, of first importance, was brought to my attention, and that is provision of an adequate water system. I think you find on file a report from Mr. E.H. Tredcroft of the Water Power Branch, of the 13th of June, 1928, with plans and specifications for a complete water system. He estimated the cost at between $11,000 and $12,000. Cast iron pipes are to be used. At present the building has no fire protection excepting the chemical fire extinguishers.\n\nI am not aware whether we have provided in our estimates for the cost of this system, but it must be constructed at once, and if necessary, we will obtain a supplementary estimate for the amount. Will you kindly ask the Water Power Branch to instruct Mr. Tredcroft to call for tenders for this work at once? If we begin action now, the water system should be in good working order when the building is completed.\n\nWhile we have many good schools, I think this establishment at Kamloops will be the premier school when it is finished.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

Our total price of $355.92 is for these units complete with wired safety type holders, except lamps. Delivery - approximately three weeks.\n\nThere has been some delay in getting these prices to you. The reason for this was that we had trouble in getting the particulars of the fixtures that they have now in the old building and also the writer made the mistake of sending the plans to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. I wish to apologize to you for doing this.\n\nWe trust that you will find our prices O.K. and that we may have the pleasure of entering your order for these units.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFrank Petz\nLIGHTING SPECIALIST.\n\nFR: JF\nEnc.\n### List of fixtures required for Boys' School Kamloops\n\n#### Basement\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Entrance         | 1        | $3.25      | $3.25 |\n| Centre 12\" C.C. #9106-704 | | | |\n| General Repair & Carpenter Shop | 2 | $4.46 | |\n| #4980 O.B.

The tenders were obtained in the usual way by advertising in a Vancouver newspaper.\n\nAccording to the District Engineer's report it is recommended that the contract for the construction of the water supply system, that is the pipe line, intake work and reservoir, be awarded to the firm of E. J. Ryan Contracting Co. of Vancouver, at their price of $12,691.00, and that the contract for the pumping machinery be let to Messrs. Fernie Bros. of Kamloops for the sum of $3,100.00. The above mentioned tenders were accepted on account of being the lowest which complied with the requirements of the plans and specifications. It is estimated that the total cost of the work will amount to $17,000.00 owing to the fact that the fire fighting accessories are not included in the above mentioned contract and will have to be purchased direct by the Engineer in charge.\n\nAs the prices quoted are reasonable considering the extent of the work provided for, I beg to recommend that the necessary Order in Council be obtained confirming the awarding of these contracts, which have already been signed by both contractors and the District Chief Engineer on behalf of this Department.\n\nFunds are available from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-5\n\nIn further reference to Dr. Scott's letter of the 12th instant regarding the water supply system at Kamloops residential school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Webb, our District Chief Engineer at Vancouver, regarding the letting of contracts for this work. You will notice that the work has been divided into two parts, one covering the material for and the construction of the water supply system, and the other the material and machinery for and the installation of the pumping plant.\n\nThe contract for the water supply system has been let to the E.J. Ryan Contracting Company of Vancouver for $12,691.00, and that for the pumping unit to Messrs. Fernie Brothers of Kamloops, for the sum of $3100.00. In addition to these contracts, fire hose and accessories have to be provided, and including cost of advertising and supervision will bring the total cost to about $17,000.00. Mr. Webb requests that he be supplied with the sum of $17,000.00 to cover the cost of this work at your early convenience.\n\nI am sending you herewith one copy each of the signed contracts and specifications, list of tenders and the advertisement for the information of the tenderers which appeared in the Vancouver and Kamloops press.\n\nThe plans referred to in Mr. Webb's letter have not yet been received but they will be sent as soon as they are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

All the walls will be properly insulated and will be lined with galv. sheeting.\n\nThe necessity of a drier is obvious. At present we have no dry room in our laundry and clothes are spread along the corridors, near and on the radiators. It is most unsatisfactory and dangerous. The Dept. of Indian Affairs, some time ago, agreed to install the drier upon the completion of the boys' wing. The need of it is urgent.\n\nThe extractor and the thumbler can be used only for certain pieces of clothing.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) John Duplanil.\nThe American Wood Truck Dry Room\n\nSize\n1 Section 2 Doors 3 Coils 3 Trucks.\n\nCabinet\nShall be constructed of kiln-dried lumber, tongued, grooved and beaded, and built in sections securely bolted together. Inner surface shall be covered with sheet asbestos and lined with heavy tin plate sheets, lock-jointed and blind nailed, making same heat retaining and fire-proof on inside. Outer surface shall be finished with two coats of yellow shellac. Doors shall be constructed in similar manner, hung on heavy coppered hinges and fitted with malleable-iron latches.\n\nCoils\nShall be provided with vertical stands of 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)-inch steam coils of the circulating type, 18 pipes high, with suitable supply and return connections and located on either side of door opening.\n\nCirculation and Ventilation\nA fan suspended from roof and constructed with four metal blades, and operated by a horizontal countershaft with bevel gears, shall be furnished for proper circulation of air.\n\nVentilation shall be arranged by intake of air at door opening and outlet of damp air through funnel-shaped galvanized pipe connection in roof.\n\nTrucks\nShall be constructed with metal bases, mounted on casters, and galvanized-pipe uprights carrying iron cleats for holding metal clothes bars, and tied with galvanized pipe-ties. Shall be provided with wood handles for convenience in handling and angle-iron floor tracks for guiding trucks into room.\n\nThe above is a cut of the kind asked for at the Kansas City Industrial School.\nI have the honour to report that I wired you today as follows: \"If drying tumblers from Stanley Brock Limited Winnipeg have not yet been shipped hold order until my letter mailed today reaches you please.\"\n\nIn sending the foregoing telegram I was prompted to do so for the reasons as herein. Rev. John Duplanill, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Industrial School advised me some time ago that he needed a drying outfit for the School besides the drying tumbler now in the school laundry. He said that he wanted a wood truck drying room, and that he had already spoken to some of the Departmental authorities about it and that he was promised that the matter would be given the necessary consideration before the new wing to the school was completed. I then asked him to get quotations from various firms of the cost of the dryer.\n\nYesterday he wrote me a covering letter about the matter, a copy of which is herewith attached. I also attach copy of the quotations he received. The originals are here in my office.\n\nThis morning the matter came up again when the Reverend gentleman phoned me that he had just received a letter from the Department dated October 24th, stating that a 30'x 42\" Junior Drying Tumbler motor driven, had been ordered from the Stanley Brock Limited of Winnipeg, Manitoba, for the school, and that he did not want this. What he wants is a truck drying room. I then visited the school and laundry in particular, in order to see for myself just what was meant and what is required.\n\nI find that owing to the present position of the laundry machinery, in order to install a new tumbler, some considerable alterations will have to be made, the cost of which is placed by Father Duplanill at about $160.00. There is a space in the corner of the Laundry that will be suitable for the proposed truck drying room. The Rev. Father states that if the Department will allow him the tumblers they have ordered from Winnipeg and the Truck Drying Room the good use may be made of both, and if only one of the two articles is allowed, then by all means, he wants the truck drying room and wants the Department's authority to build himself as his quotation is so much lower than any of the firms that quoted. I do not pretend to be an authority on this subject, but the situation is as herein described. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nEM/S.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 644B, file 882-5, part 5)\nOttawa, November 8, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith two accounts which have been received from our Indian Agent, Mr. E.

It will be very expensive to use the large irrigation plant for these purposes. Moreover, the water taken directly from the river is too cold in the springtime and retards growth.\n\nThe extra expenses will be very small indeed, but the benefit will be very great.\n\nI shall be greatly obliged to you for recommending these changes to the Dept.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"John Duplanil\".\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of the Interior  \nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\n\nBox 330, Kamloops, B.C.  \nOctober 26, 1928.\n\nSir:- Re - Kamloops Industrial School.  \nYour file #174-2C.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter from the Rev. Father Duplanil, principal of the Kamloops Industrial school, in which he asks to be supplied with a small pump to be used for irrigation purposes on the school garden, trees and lawn.\n\nFather Duplanil claims that the amount of water delivered by the present irrigation pump, i.e., 2,000 gallons per minute, is too large to be handled when the garden only requires irrigation, and that during the spring the water from the South Thompson river is too cold to be placed directly upon the land.\n\nHe therefore suggests that a small pump (100 gallons per minute capacity) delivering into an open concrete tank, capacity from three to four thousand gallons, would be of great assistance, as it would enable the water to have the chill removed from it before being used.\n\nFather Duplanil mentioned this matter to Dr. Scott when he was here, at which time I was present, and asked Dr. Scott if he could retain the existing pump and tank for this purpose after the new one was installed.\n\nI objected to this at the time on the grounds that the pump was not suitable for his requirements, and the tank was a high-pressure tank too valuable to be used for such a purpose; and that the complete system could well be used in some other school.\n\nThe matter, however, was not discussed any further at the time and Father Duplanil now informs me that when he left Dr. Scott he was under the impression that arrangements would be made for the installation of this pump.\n\nI informed Father Duplanil that I had had no instructions from you regarding this matter, and if such a pump was going to be installed authority for its installation should be obtained immediately in order that provision could be made to have it placed in the new pump house, and informed him that, in view of the short time available, if he would write to me I would forward the letter to you for your consideration.\n\nG. E. Webb, Esq.,  \nDistrict Chief Engineer,  \nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,  \nVancouver, B.C.\nI am of the opinion that a small pump for irrigating the garden and lawn should be supplied, as the large irrigation pump is undoubtedly too big to operate satisfactorily unless general irrigation of the farm lands is being carried out at the same time, and I would therefore respectfully suggest that a small pump as outlined above be supplied for this purpose.\n\nWith regard to the installation of a concrete tank for the purpose of removing the chill from the water before it is used, not being familiar with the cultivation of these crops, I am unable to say definitely whether same is absolutely necessary, but I see no reason for doubting Father Duplanil's good judgment in this regard.\n\nWill you kindly notify me what action you intend to take, or wish me to take, in this matter.\n\nAn estimate of cost of the proposed installation, together with blue print showing its location, is herewith enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.)

I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. E. H. Tredcroft, dated October 26, wherein he encloses a copy of a letter, dated October 18, from the Rev. Father Duplanil, Principal of the Kamloops Indian School, from which you will note that Father Duplanil requested be supplied with a small pump, etc., to be used for irrigation purposes on the school garden. Mr. Tredcroft has estimated that it will cost some $500.00 to provide the small irrigation system requested.\n\nEnclosed you will find:\n\n(1) Copy of Mr. Tredcroft's letter of October 26.\n(2) Copy of Father Duplanil's letter to Mr. Tredcroft of October 18.\n(3) Copy of Mr. Tredcroft's estimate of cost.\n(4) Copy of plan of proposed water supply system for Kamloops Industrial School showing location of small garden irrigation system.\n\nI would ask you to take this matter up immediately with the Department of Indian Affairs and ascertain if it is their desire that this work should be undertaken. If it is to be done at all, it would be advisable to have it put in while the water supply system for the school is being done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. E.

In reply I beg to say that this matter will be given definite consideration as soon as I am furnished with a detailed report from Mr. Fredroft giving the reasons why the following pumping plants cannot be used to supply irrigation water for the above mentioned garden:\n\n1. The present irrigation system.\n2. The water supply system for domestic purposes which is now being installed.\n3.

No doubt this is where the error occurred.

The pumping plant which is now used for general irrigation purposes on the reserve has too great a capacity, and it would involve unnecessary expense should it be used to supply such a small amount of water as is required for the garden.\n\n2. The domestic water supply system which is now in course of construction could also be used, but this scheme is not recommended owing to the fact that the water is being pumped to an elevated reservoir, thus requiring extra lift which is not necessary in the case of an irrigation system.\n\nIt would not, therefore, be practical or economical to adopt either of the above mentioned systems, which are costly to operate simply to supply the water necessary for an open concrete tank, which would be slightly above the level of the ground and of the capacity suggested by the Principal.\n\nAs to the use of the old pneumatic water supply system which has been discarded, I have to rely on the statement given by the Engineer in charge that it is not the proper type required for irrigation purposes. I have asked the local office of the Dominion Water Power Branch to furnish me with a more detailed report on the matter. In the meantime will you please advise whether this question should be left in abeyance or the installation of the additional pump authorized.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-5.\n\nI enclose herewith copies of correspondence received from Mr. Webb regarding the contract for the construction of a water supply system for the Kamloops industrial school by which you will see that the Page Hersey pipes are to be used in place of the Stewart and Lloyd steel pipes specified in the contract.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 15th NOVEMBER 1928.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 2nd November, 1928, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating that the Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior by public advertisement asked for tenders for the construction of the water supply system for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in the Kamloops Indian Agency in the Province of British Columbia, upon plans and specifications prepared by the Branch. A schedule of the tenders received is submitted.\n\nMr. C. E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Water Powers Branch, resident at Vancouver, recommends that the tender of the B. J. Ryan Contracting Company of Vancouver for $12,691 for the water supply system; and the tender of Messrs. Fernie Brothers of Kamloops for the pumping unit, including the pump and motor for $3,100 be accepted.\n\nThe Engineer of the Department of Indian Affairs has reported that the above tenders are fair and reasonable. The Minister, therefore, recommends that they be accepted pursuant to the requirements of Sub-section 2 of Section 56 of the Public Works Act. Funds for this purpose are available from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nNovember 13, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nRe - Garden Irrigation Supply,\nKamloops Industrial School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th inst., re the above mentioned project. From our recent correspondence you will gather that the Department of Indian Affairs does not appear anxious to install further machinery at this school and, therefore, it has occurred to me that it might be possible to get away from the necessity for a further pump by the construction of a reservoir to be filled from either the present irrigation system or the fire and water supply system which is now being installed for this institution. If a reservoir could be constructed at the end of the present irrigation ditch it might collect sufficient water for use on the garden and if not, it would only be necessary to operate the irrigation pump for a short time to fill the reservoir. The same might apply if using water from the water supply and fire protection system.\n\nWithout being fully conversant with conditions at the school, it is difficult to say whether this proposal is feasible or not, considering that one would have to know the quantity of water required, by the garden, the size of reservoir necessary, cost of same, cost of water supply and possible location of reservoir and method of drawing off. In any connection I would consider that the reservoir should not hold more than one day's supply and if water was not to be held for more than one day, the question of seepage should not be a serious factor so that an excavated reservoir might be considered. This could easily be constructed if the location is suitable, with slip scrapers. If the seepage was not unreasonable it might be cut down by lining the reservoir with clay. I am not, of course, advised as to whether clay is convenient, nor do I know the type of soil which one might expect in such an excavation. The presence of a lake on the school grounds, however, leads me to believe that losses would not be excessive.\n\nThe construction of a reservoir such as outlined above would slightly improve water temperature (even if not necessary) and in this way we could to a certain extent, meet the contentions of the school authorities that a water pump direct from the river is too cold for irrigation purposes. However, against the construction of a reservoir one should consider the resultant damage from seepage losses, although as previously stated, I do not consider that such losses would be serious.\n\nOn receipt of this letter will you kindly let me have immediately by wire your opinion as to the feasibility of handling the matter as outlined above. It is rather unfortunate that we were not instructed to consider a comprehensive water supply system for all purposes in the first instance so that we could have obviated the necessity of constructing the several separate systems which now are necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.H. Tredcroft, Esq.,\nSenior Assistant Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Reclam. Service,\nBox 330, Kamloops, B.C.\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your telegram of Nov. 10th re proposed pump for the Kamloops Industrial School garden I would state that it will not be possible to use the new fire protection pump for this purpose in view of the fact that this pump is designed to deliver against a head of 231 feet, whereas the head which the garden pump will operate against will be approximately 50 feet.\n\nIn addition to the above it would not be good practice even if it were possible, to provide a pump for fire protection and domestic supply and allow same to be used for general irrigation purposes; the fire protection pump has a definite function to perform in the case of an emergency and if it is being used for general utility purposes then it is impossible to guarantee that it will be in good operating order at the time it is required for fire protection.\n\nWhen it would be quite possible to supply water from the new reservoir to the school garden for irrigation purposes it would however be most uneconomical in view of the fact that the reservoir is situated at an elevation of 200 feet while the garden is at an elevation of approximately 50 feet and any water used on the garden would have to be pumped first into the reservoir at an elevation of approximately 150 feet higher than would be necessary if it is pumped to the garden direct. This would mean that the school would be paying for raising water 200 feet when 50 feet would be sufficient.\n\nWith reference to the proposal to use the existing irrigation pump for garden purposes this is exactly what they have been doing up to the present time and the reason that the principal of the school asked for a separate pump was that they found that unless general irrigation of the other farm lands was being carried out at the same time as the garden was being irrigated, the volume supplied by the irrigation pump i.e., 2000 U.S.G.P.M. was too large to handle satisfactorily, and as the garden contains an area of only 10 acres this contention of the principal's would appear to me to be quite reasonable.\n\nOne other reason against allowing the garden to be irrigated from the domestic supply is that if this is permitted then it is quite possible that should a fire occur the reservoir supplied for fire protection might be found at that time to be empty.\n\nAfter considering the matter very carefully I have come to the conclusion that unless they are prepared to carry on under the old method i.e., irrigating the garden only when irrigation of other farm lands is being carried out, then a separate pump is the only economical and safe method of handling the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. H. Tredcroft,\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDist. Chief Engr.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-5.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant regarding the proposed additional pumping plant for the irrigation of the garden at Kamloops industrial school, I enclose herewith copies of an exchange of correspondence between Mr. Webb and Mr. Tredcroft regarding the proposal which, if suitable, will do away with the necessity of putting in an additional pump.\n\nMr. Webb states that he is awaiting a reply to his suggestion from Mr. Tredcroft and will wire when that is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Tredoroft,\nSenior Assistant Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and\nReclamation Service,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nNovember 23rd., 1928.\n\nSir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 21st. regarding the proposed installation of a pump to supply the garden at the Kamloops Industrial school with water for irrigation purposes, and requesting information as to why the present irrigation pump or the proposed new fire protection pump cannot be used for this purpose, in this connection I would report to you as follows:\n\nIrrigation of the garden at the Kamloops Industrial school is carried out at the present time by means of the large irrigation pump (capacity of 2000 U.S. gallons per minute) which was installed in 1927 for irrigating the farm lands.\n\nIt is now claimed by the principal of the Industrial school that this pump is too large to be handled satisfactorily when the garden only is being irrigated, for unless general irrigation of the other farm lands is being carried out at the same time, the volume of water supplied by this pump, i.e., 2000 U.S. gallons per minute, is far more than can be\nmore than can be utilized on the garden at one time and a large portion therefore has to be allowed to go to waste.\n\nThe principal also claims that whereas ordinary farm lands when being irrigated can be flooded with water with beneficial results, in cultivating a garden such is not the case, and what is really required is a small and continuous supply of water.\n\nHe also points out that in cultivating farm lands it is possible to run the large irrigation pump for a day or two and give these lands a thorough flooding or saturation, after which they require no more water for a week or ten days, whereas in the case of the garden it is desirable that water be applied to the land daily and without flooding.\n\nIt is for this reason that he has requested that the school be equipped with a small pump having a capacity of 100 U.S. gallons per minute, so that in irrigating the garden the operation of the large irrigation pump, having a capacity of 2000 U.S. gallons per minute, would not be necessary, and after having considered his request quite carefully I am of the opinion that same is justified.\n\nWith reference to the proposal to use the new domestic water supply, consisting of a fire pump and reservoir, for this purpose, I would state that whereas this is possible it would nevertheless be a most uneconomical method, besides being particularly bad practice from a fire protection point of view.\n\nThe fire pump which is about to be installed is a high-grade, high-pressure pump and is supplied for one...\nsupplied for one purpose only, i.e., that of keeping the reservoir filled for the domestic supply and for use in case of fire.\n\nTo permit this pump to be used for other purposes, such as general irrigation of the school garden or farm lands, would in my opinion be very bad practice from a fire protection point of view, and would probably mean that after a while, the pump having been used continuously as an irrigation pump, it would come to be regarded by the operator as such, instead of as a fire pump, and after continual use might in case of a fire quite possibly be found to be out of order or working badly at a time when it is most urgently required.\n\nWhen it is remembered that the value of the school buildings is in the neighborhood of a quarter of a million dollars, it would not seem as though we were justified in using this pump or water supply system for any purpose other than those for which they were originally designed, i.e., domestic supply and fire protection.\n\nIn addition to the above, the pump, as stated before, is a high-pressure pump designed to pump water to a reservoir against a pressure of 91 pounds per square inch, whereas the elevation of the garden above the source of supply is only 50 feet. It would therefore not be possible to pump water to the garden direct by means of this pump without throttling down the discharge to prevent overloading the motor, which would be very wasteful of power, while to use water out of the reservoir for irrigating the garden would mean that the water would be pumped four times as high as is necessary, which would also be very uneconomical from an operating point of view, and in addition would give\naddition would give the extra hazard that were a fire to occur just after irrigation of the garden had been carried out it is quite possible that the reservoir, which is provided to supply water for domestic purposes and for immediate protection in case of fire, might be found to be empty and no water supply would then be available until the fire pump could be started, which operation might occupy an inexperienced operator ten or fifteen minutes.\n\nI would therefore strongly recommend that no proposal to use either the fire pump or the domestic water supply reservoir for irrigation purposes be considered in any way.\n\nWith reference to the proposal of the principal of the Industrial school that the existing pump and tank might be used for this purpose, I would state that whereas the completed garden will have an area of from eight to ten acres, which will require a supply of water of from 80 to 100 U.S. gallons per minute for its cultivation, the capacity of the existing pump is only 20 U.S. gallons per minute, which amount is far too small for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to the above, the existing pump is of the reciprocating type designed to operate intermittently and is not a heavy-duty pump suitable for continuous operation, as is the case when being used for general irrigation purposes.\n\nThe existing plant as it stands is compact and in fairly good condition and could no doubt be transferred to some other school or institution requiring a small domestic water supply system, which disposal would, in my opinion, prove to be far more\nto be far more economical than attempting to use it for a purpose for which it was never designed and in which we could not hope for its successful operation.\n\nIn conclusion I would state that unless they are prepared to carry on under the old system, i.e., that of irrigating the garden at the same time that irrigation of the other farm lands is being carried out, which method the principal of the Industrial school claims is very unsatisfactory and uneconomical, there is no way other than by the installation of a small separate pump for this purpose that we could recommend as being both safe and economical.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

With regard to the other items for extras amounting to $666.80, also recommended by Mr. Tredcroft for labour and material required to meet the unusual conditions on the construction of the coffee-dam for the intake pipe, I should like to be advised, before giving the matter any further consideration, whether, according to the requirements of the specifications and contract, this Department is actually responsible, and would be justified in granting this extra payment to the contractors. As requested I am enclosing herewith a copy of a telegram sent to Mr. Tredcroft at Kamloops.\n\nIt will be necessary that the Department be furnished with copies of final certificate issued by your Kamloops Office, in connection with the above mentioned work, as was done for Onion Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

From this you will note that there is a sum of $2334.86 due on the contract price, together with two accounts for extras amounting to $259.47 and $511.28 respectively.\n\nMr. Webb recommends payment in full of the first account for extras and suggests that the second should be paid, deducting a sur-charge of ten per cent, leaving an amount of $464.80.\n\nMr. Webb asks that instructions be given him by wire so I shall be obliged if you will advise me in regard to this as soon as possible.\n\nIn replying will you kindly return the final account and statements herewith in order that they may be returned to Mr. Webb with your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This account is recommended for payment by Mr. Tredcroft, who states in his letter that the work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\nWith reference to the account for extras, the first one amounting to $239.47 covers work ordered by our engineer in charge, Mr. Tredcroft, and has my approval for payment. The second account for extras, $511.28, is recommended by Mr. Tredcroft and, considering the extremely adverse weather conditions and the fact that the contractor made every effort to rush the job to completion in order that the school might have the earliest benefit of these works, I would suggest that this account be paid for $464.80. The sur-charge of 10% is hardly justified.\n\nI am withholding payment of that part of the account (extra $511.28) in the meantime pending your instructions, and I would be obliged if you would wire those instructions in order that the account may be disposed of as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

The estimated cost of providing this additional fire line amounts to $400.00 and should, in my opinion, be carried out, for while it is not absolutely essential, the inside fire protection as it is today does not conform to good standard practice which demands that all inside fire protection systems should be separate from domestic systems which supply bathrooms, washrooms, kitchens, etc.\n\nI would ask you to kindly refer this matter to the Department of Indian Affairs and inform me if they wish this change to be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Mr. Webb refers to his letters of October 17th, 1928 and March 27th last, copies of which were sent you at the time. He also refers to a letter from Mr. Tredcroft of April 19th and a certificate of completion of contract of the same date, copies of which are enclosed herewith.\n\nI shall be glad to have your instructions as to whether payment of the second extras amounting to $464.80 should be made to the Ryan Contracting Company.\n\nENCLS.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Your reference to that Department's letter of April 9th regarding the payments to the E.J. Ryan Contracting Company in connection with the work they performed on this project is noted.\n\nI would ask you to refer to my letter of March 27th and also copy of Mr. Tredcroft's letter of March 26th which was attached thereto. The original contract price was $12,691.00. Extra work authorized by this Service amounted to $239.47. The Ryan Company claim an additional payment on account of unforeseen contingencies of $511.28. The Department of Indian Affairs under the contract is not legally bound to pay this claim for $511.28. Due to the extremely adverse weather conditions which existed during the greater part of the construction period, and fact that the contractor made every effort to rush the job to completion through this bad weather in order that the school might have the earliest possible benefit of the water system, I suggested that this account be paid, less the 10% surcharge indicated by the Ryan Company.\n\nIn order to make this quite clear, if you will refer to your copy of the contract with Ryan Company which was attached to my letter of October 17, 1928, and the Ryan Company final account which accompanied my letter of March 27th last, you will see that the total contract amounted to $12,691.00. This account was paid in two progress estimates and a final account as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| 1st Progress Estimate, 27th November, 1928 | $7820.00 |\n| 2nd Progress Estimate, 9th February, 1929 | 2536.14  |\n| Final payment under contract, 21st March, 1929 | 2334.86  |\n| **Total**                            | **$12691.00** |\n\nEnc.\n\nJ.

Johnston, Esq., - 2 - April 23, 1929.\n\nExtras as per list attached to Ryan's final account were as follows:\n\n1st. Extra, $239.47. Authorized by engineer and paid less credits.\n\n2nd. Extra, $511.28. According to Ryan Company's bill. Has not been paid nor is the Indian Department responsible for it, but I am recommending for reasons previously stated that this extra be paid, less 10% surcharge of Ryan Company, making the sum which I recommend for payment $464.80.\n\nFor your further information in the matter I am enclosing copy of a letter in duplicate, dated the 19th inst. from Mr. Tredcroft, relative to the Ryan Company's work; also two copies of certificate from Mr. Tredcroft of same date, accepting the work performed by this company.\n\nI trust this information is sufficient to allow the Department of Indian Affairs to decide as to whether or not payment for second extra shall be made to the Ryan Contracting Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) C. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nSir:\n\nRe Kamloops Industrial School\n\nI am enclosing herewith in triplicate certificate of completion of contract with reference to the installation of a domestic water supply and fire protection system at the Kamloops Industrial School, which was carried out by the Ryan Contracting Co. under their contract dated October 15th, 1928.\n\nIn this regard I may state that this work, which included:\n\n1) the supply of material for and the construction of\n   1 reinforced concrete reservoir (capacity 18,000 U.S. gallons),\n\n2) the supply of material for and the construction of\n   1 reinforced concrete pump house and intake well,\n\n3) the supply and installation of\n   120 lin. ft. of 12\" dia. vitrified intake pipe,\n\n4) the supply and installation of\n   3000 lin. ft. of 8\" dia. steel water main,\n\ncomplete with hydrants, valves, fittings, etc., was satisfactorily carried out by the Ryan Contracting Co. in every respect and upon its completion by them was thoroughly inspected and tested by me and found to be operating satisfactorily.\n\nThe original amount of the Ryan Contracting Co.'s contract was $12,691.00 and the amount claimed by the Ryan Contracting Co. at the completion of the work was $13,399.25, made up as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Original contract price                          | $12,691.00 |\n| Extra work authorized by this office             | 349.47   |\n| Claim for additional payment on account of unforeseen contingencies | 511.28   |\n| Credit for material (manhole frame and cover and round steel) supplied by the department | 42.50    |\n| Bal. due                                         | $13,399.25 |\n\nWith regard to the third item, I may state that it is the claim of the Ryan Contracting Co.\nthat these extra charges were incurred during the installation of the intake pipe, it being their contention that owing to the time of the year at which this work had to be undertaken and the unknown nature of the ground which was necessary for them to excavate, together with the fact that in laying this pipe it was necessary for them to carry out excavation at a depth of seven feet below the water level, it was impossible for their engineer to estimate accurately what the final cost would be, and while they do not contend that they have any right to this additional amount, they have asked that the department give consideration to this claim to save them from actual loss.\n\nWhile I have not been supplied with any figures from the Ryan Contracting Co., showing the actual cost to them of installing this intake pipe, I know from personal observation that they experienced considerable difficulty in carrying out the work, and must, in my opinion, have run very close to, if they did not actually exceed, their original estimate.\n\nIn addition to the above, I would state that while the work was not always carried out in exactly the manner I would have adopted myself, nevertheless it was carried out by their engineer in good faith and in accordance with his ideas of what was most suitable, and was brought to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nBefore payment of this account is made, however, it might be advisable for the department to request further details from the Ryan Contracting Co. with reference to this extra expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. H. Tredcroft\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that while at Kamloops Indian Residential School recently, the Reverend Principal John Duplinal, O.M.I., drew the fire escape situation on the Girls' Wing of the School, to my attention from the exit. The door on the rear of the building (above the entrance to the laundry) is approximately 8' high and should be provided with an iron ladder without delay. The fire escape ladder now provided is also eight feet off the ground and should be added to by the addition of another twelve feet, that is to say, the School now requires two pieces of fire escape stairways in addition to that provided, each piece to be about twelve feet long. This is necessary for the safety of the children while using the fire escapes for practice or emergency.\n\nI may also state that the proper fire alarm systems are now provided in the old wing of the building.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., May 1, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen attending the public opening of the Indian Residential School, at Kamloops, on the 17th ultimo it was brought to my attention that while an efficient fire alarm system has been installed in the boys' wing, that in the girls' wing is only a temporary one put in some time ago. This temporary system while working alright has no connection whatever with the one on the boys' side of the building. Thus, in case of a fire two sets of alarms would have to be handled which might lead to confusion. I am of the opinion that a system be installed in the girls' wing similar to that of the boys', all working under single control.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian School Opened\n\nAt a largely-attended gathering, the Industrial School, administered under the Indian Department by Roman Catholic teachers, was formally opened at Kamloops this week. For several months the administration building in the centre and the dormitories have been in operation, and the ceremony on Wednesday marked the completion of the other (boys') wing.\n\nThe whole building, except one dormitory, is now occupied. The whole building, except one dormitory, is now occupied.\n\nW. J. Moffatt, Indian commissioner for the province, gave some interesting data concerning the progress of education among Indians affairs in British Columbia. He said that in 1917 the Kamloops school could not have been in worse condition; today there is only one school that is better in the province, in fact, and undoubtedly that is the one at Chilliwack.\n\nThere are 200 children resident in the school, with room for 250 eventually. Conditions are of the best; the school rooms and dormitories being huge and airy.\n\nAddress was given also by R. McLeod, Indian agent; Rev. J. Duplanail, principal; and Mayor W. J. Moffatt of Kamloops. Col. G. S. Pragnell, D.S.O., inspector of Indian agencies, also attended.\n\nThe school was full of wonder at the children, and well they sang it. \"O Canada\" was also rendered, and the pupils turned and saluted the flag as it fluttered to the top of the high mast.\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-5.\n\nI have received your letter of the 10th instant with reference to claim for extras by the Ryan Contracting Company in connection with the contract for the water supply and fire protection at Kamloops industrial school.

Although it is realized that the amount claimed by the contractors was actually unforeseen, the Department would not be justified in granting any extra payment, as this work was awarded after publicly inviting tenders. I would ask you to kindly explain the Department's situation to the contractors, who are, however, at liberty to furnish your office, as stated in Mr. Webb's letter, with further details with reference to the additional work which has been performed by them in the installation of the intake pipe, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Nicholson, of Kamloops, for the manufacture and erection of a flag pole at the Kamloops Indian School.\n\nWhen at Kamloops on the 17th, the Reverend Principal drew my attention to the pole which he had had erected and asked if the Department would bear the cost. I stated that I felt sure that it would, if a regular account was submitted. The pole is a very fine one having been made with two pieces spliced together, as long pole timber is not available in the Interior.\n\nI would recommend that this account be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 5, 1929.\n\nSir,-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the new Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to say that you may arrange for the immediate installation of the additional lengths of fire escape required. Please have the work done as economically as possible and on completion submit the vouchers in the regular way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops,\nB.C.\nAt various times I have visited the Kamloops Residential School, and am pleased to report an enormous improvement throughout. The principal, the Rev. John Duplaini, seems to understand how to handle the Indians, and instead of having to force the parents to send their children to the school, they are now only too eager to send them. There are about 200 children there now, and I do not doubt that the premises will be able to fill the school to its capacity, possibly next term. However, he states, and I agree with him, that it is not advisable to have too many newcomers all at once.\n\nThe new wing (Boys') was officially opened a short while ago. This completes the building, and the many visitors who went over the building were agreeably surprised at the completeness and efficiency of the school. The children all seem happy, and swings, games, etc., are now supplied. The grounds have all been tidied up and grading and planting are now in process. When complete, the grounds will look a credit to such a fine school. The addition of a fine flagstaff has given quite a finished and patriotic look to the place.\n\nI was present during a demonstration, under Mr. Engineer Tredcroft, of the new pump, reservoir and water plant, as to its fire fighting capabilities. I am glad to say that under both conditions, gravity and direct pumping, the hose streams could easily reach the roof, the danger point in such a dry climate.\n\nThe electric fire alarm system wants extending to the girls' wing, and the small temporary alarms in use for a number of years, should be removed. The girls' fire escape needs to be extended to the ground, and also that part of the escape, now separate, which leads to the girls' classrooms. Two short iron staircases should be sufficient, and I have asked the Agent to take up this matter. The Principal now informs me that he will be able to proceed to organize a system of fire drill in the school.\n\nAs far as I know, no arrangements have yet been completed for a regular inspection of all the valuable pumping and electrical machinery in the school. I wrote you upon the matter before, and asked that authority be given the Agent to employ Messrs. Fernie Bros., who installed most of this plant.\n\nSome trouble has occurred with the sanitary drainage system. This also should be regularly inspected, or reports made as to when cleaned by the school authorities.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF COMMISSIONER DITCHBURN,\nP. O. BOX 666, VICTORIA, B. A., dated May 21, 1929.\n\nPlease find attached hereto copy of Inspection Report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell, dated the 18th instant, dealing with conditions in the Kamloops Agency.\n\nThe fire escape and the electric fire alarm system for the girls' wing of the Kamloops School are, no doubt, receiving the attention of the Department, as these have been referred to before.\n\nI think it is important that some arrangement should be made for a regular inspection of all the valuable pumping and electric equipment at the school in order that the Department may be assured that it is properly taken care of. This matter was referred to some time ago by District Chief Engineer Webb, of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND RECLAMATION SERVICE\n\nOTTAWA, ONT., July 3rd, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 154-0-5\n\nIn further reference to your letter of May 10th regarding extra payments claimed by the Ryan Contracting Company as compensation for unforeseen contingencies in connection with their contract for the construction of a water supply system at the Kamloops Indian school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Webb together with copies of letter from Mr. Tredcroft, who supervised the construction, and a statement from the Ryan Contracting Company showing details of the work involved.\n\nYou will notice that both Mr. Tredcroft and Mr. Webb are still of the opinion that on account of the extremely adverse weather conditions which existed during the greater part of the construction period, and the fact that the contractor made every effort to complete the work in order that the school might have the earliest possible benefit from the water system, that some consideration might be given to the contractor's claim although it is realized that under the contract the Indian Department is not bound to pay the claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND RECLAMATION SERVICE\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nJune 25, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 14th ult., regarding the Ryan Company's claim for compensation to the amount of $464.80 to cover unforeseen contingencies in connection with their contract for the construction of a water supply system at the Kamloops Indian School, Kamloops, B.C. In accordance with your instructions, I have obtained from the Ryan Company an itemized statement as to these extras, copy of which is enclosed herewith, dated May 30th. You will note that their account is now the amount of $447.15 or, less the 10% surcharge, $406.50. I also enclose copy of letter, dated June 21st, from Mr. Tredcroft in regard to the Ryan Construction Company's account.\n\nI am still of the same opinion as Mr. Tredcroft and, as previously mentioned in my letter of April 22nd, feel that, due to the extremely adverse weather conditions which existed during the greater part of the construction period and the fact that the contractor made every effort to rush the job to completion during this bad weather in order that the school might have the earliest possible benefit of the water system, that the Ryan Company's account, less the 10% surcharge, might well be paid by the Department of Indian Affairs. At the same time I realize that under the contract the Department is not legally bound to pay this claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nC. E. Webb,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n(Sgd.) per G.H. Whyte.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 5th having reference to claim by the Ryan Contracting Co. for an amount of $447.15 in payment for extra work performed by them in connection with the installation of the domestic water supply system at the Kamloops Industrial school, and in this connection note that in submitting this claim the Ryan Contracting Co. have made it appear that this extra expenditure was incurred through changes made to the original plans and which were authorized by me in order to improve the general quality of the work, whereas the only changes authorized were made with the sole view of enabling the contractor to complete the work at a fair and reasonable cost and so that his expenditure would not exceed the amount of his contract.\n\nWith reference to the detailed accounts submitted by the Ryan Contracting Co., the first item, \"Extra excavation caused by change from vitrified pipe to cast-iron pipe - $210.00\" is not, in my opinion, a fair statement of the charge. No extra excavation was caused by the change from vitrified to cast-iron pipe.\n\nItem No. 2, \"Three extra concrete footings - $62.50\" is a charge that I feel should receive certain consideration, for whereas the contractor did not actually install concrete footings, nevertheless, acting upon my instructions, he placed concrete around the joint of each pipe to ensure its being held in place.\n\nItem No. 3, \"Extra cost of handling and setting cast-iron pipe above cost of installing vitrified pipe - $30.00\" is, in my opinion, too high a charge for this work. The labour involved in handling the cast-iron pipe was very little more than what would have been necessary in order to install 3 ft. lengths of vitrified pipe in its place. A charge of $15.00 would, in my opinion, be sufficient.\n\nItem No. 4, \"Extra depth of coffer dam necessary on account of silting nature of ground - $79.75\" is apparently a fair charge, but was incurred solely through the contractor's failure to install a suitable and substantial coffer dam in the first place, and is not the result of any changes carried out. It could, in my opinion, only be allowed under the heading \"Unforeseen Contingencies\".\n\nItem No. 5, \"Additional cribbing, shoring, planking, etc. for placing cast-iron pipe - $64.00\" may be considered as being reasonable in view of the fact that timber crib-work was driven under the end of the pipe.\n\nItem No. 6, \"Extra pumping, labour, gas and oil, etc. - $66.00\" is not, in my opinion, a fair statement of the charge. No additional pumping was required through the change from vitrified to cast-iron pipe.\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nFrom this it would seem that the only charges included in this account for which the company is justified in making a claim are as follows:\n\n1. Extra concrete footings $62.50\n2. Extra cost of handling cast-iron pipe $15.00\n3. Additional cribbing and shoring $54.00\n\nor a total of $131.50\n\nand against this charge must be set the fact that the cast-iron pipe was supplied to them free of charge and that no deductions have been made in payment to them for the equivalent of 3 ft. lengths of vitrified pipe. Also, it was felt at the time the changes were authorized and apparently agreed to by the contractor's representative, that these changes would assist the contractor, in view of the fact that the installation of 3 ft. lengths of vitrified pipe in soft wet silting ground would have been exceedingly difficult, and it would have been practically impossible to have made satisfactory joints to same owing to the type of coffer dam which they were using.\n\nI may also state that at no time was the excavation or the water level inside the coffer dam carried down to the required level as shown by the plans, owing to the fact that it was practically impossible with the equipment they had on hand to keep the coffer dam in a dry enough condition.\n\nWhile it is therefore impossible for me to certify these accounts as being correct and to recommend the additional amount of $447.15 for payment, owing to the manner in which the accounts have been submitted, nevertheless, should the appearance, each to the Ryan Contracting Co., the amount of their claim ($447.15), the Ryan Contracting Co. would not, in my opinion, be overpaid, for the reason that in submitting their original tender the Ryan Contracting Co. were forced to estimate on work, the exact nature of which it was impossible for them to ascertain, and that in carrying out work which entails excavation and construction under water it is only reasonable to allow the contractor a margin of from 20 to 25% each way.\n\nMoreover, the Ryan Contracting Co. at all times carried out their contract in good faith and brought the work to a satisfactory completion, notwithstanding the fact that the work had to be undertaken during the winter season when weather conditions were particularly severe and that the expenditure incurred by them in carrying out this work was undoubtedly far greater than was originally anticipated by them in their tender dated October 15th, 1928.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) E. H. Tredcroft,\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\n\nC. R. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Lower and Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter dated May 20th., re our account for Extras amounting to $511.25 in connection with the work we carried out for you at Kamloops Industrial School, Kamloops, B.C., we are sorry that this reply has been delayed owing to the writer's absence from the City.\n\nRegarding this Bill of Extras, we now beg to submit a detailed list of the costs, showing how this account was made up and regret that these details did not accompany our original bill as we feel sure that had you been fully informed of the conditions under which this additional work was created, the account would have been passed on for payment.\n\nThe plans and Specifications called for a vitrified pipe intake, but after the excavation had been made ready to receive same, it was found that on account of the peculiar nature of the ground, this type of intake pipe would be very unsatisfactory. It was then arranged with the Resident Engineer that we would return the vitrified pipe and supply cast iron pipe of the same size with no extra charge for the material, but you can readily understand that we had to make special arrangements to handle the cast iron pipe in 12 foot lengths instead of the vitrified pipe in 3 foot lengths.\n\nEven after the change was made from the vitrified to cast iron pipe, on account of the silting nature of the ground, it was found necessary by the Resident Engineer, to install concrete piers under each joint of the cast iron pipe, which we are sure will prove to you without any question of doubt the necessity for carrying out this additional work in order to make a satisfactory job.\n\nAdditional excavation was also required and we had to keep the channel clear until the total length of intake pipe was laid, which necessitated a great deal of extra labour and expense. Further work had to be done on the coffer dam and it was necessary for the pumping plant to be operated continuously during the progress of the work.\n\nIn attaching the details of this additional cost, all of which work was carried out under the supervision and instructions of your Resident Engineer who is quite familiar with the changes necessary in order to make a satisfactory job. We feel that, in order to obtain your approval of same, we would gladly remove the cost of the additional Sheet Piling, amounting to $79.75 and reduce the amount of Extra Pumping by $25.00, thus carrying a portion of this additional cost ourselves and reducing the total amount of the bill to $447.15, which we trust you will find in order and satisfactory, after taking into consideration the facts of the case as set forth above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

You mentioned in your letter that you had referred our claim to Mr. Tredcroft of Kamloops and you also suggest that if we wish we can make claim direct to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nWe do hope, however, that when you get your reply from Mr. Tredcroft that it will be favorable and that it will not be necessary for us to make claim to Head Office.\n\nTrusting to hear from you shortly,\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. RYAN CONTRACTING CO. LTD.\n\nper E.J. Ryan.\nSir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 7th, having further reference to the claim of the Ryan Contracting Co., Ltd., for additional payment in connection with the installation of a domestic water supply and fire protection system at the Kamloops Industrial School, and in this regard would state that the claims put forward in the second paragraph of their letter to you dated July 24th, 1929, a copy of which was enclosed with your communication to me dated August 7th, are incorrect and do not, in my opinion, represent the case at all fairly.\n\nIn the first place, the Ryan Contracting Co. state that we changed the plans and specifications in connection with the intake to such an extent that it was necessary to change the type of pipe used.\n\nThis is not correct. The only change to the intake works carried out was that the last 20 feet of pipe extending into the river was changed from vitrified pipe to cast-iron pipe, and this change was made, not because we desired to do so, but owing to the fact that the Ryan Contracting Co. was carrying on the work in such a manner that it appeared to me absolutely impossible that they could ever make a satisfactory job of same unless a different type of pipe were substituted.\n\nI may state that the original plans and specifications called for vitrified pipe, which necessitated a cement joint being made approximately every 2\u00bd feet. The coffer dam constructed by the Ryan Contracting Co. was entirely inadequate to keep the ground dry while this pipe was being installed. At the time I decided upon the change, the officials supervising the work for the Ryan Contracting Co. were attempting to lay these short lengths of vitrified pipe in a mixture of mud, water and silt which was anywhere from 18 inches to 2 feet above the required grade line.\n\nThis being the case, it was absolutely impossible for them to make a satisfactory cement joint, and this state of affairs, as mentioned above, was caused solely through their inability to maintain the coffer dam in a dry condition.\n\nRealizing that this work, if carried out in the manner in which they were proceeding, even if it could have been completed, which is extremely doubtful, could not prove satisfactory, I decided to substitute a different and more rigid type of pipe so as to give them a chance to make connections under water, and for this purpose I decided to substitute two sections of cast-iron pipe each 10 feet long.\n\nC.M. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\nBy this method I reduced the number of joints it would be necessary to make from 8 to 1, and this one joint had the advantage of being a bolted joint instead of a cement joint.\n\nI may state that this pipe was supplied to the contractor free of charge and no deduction was made from his contract for vitrified pipe which he agreed to supply and which was not required owing to the change.\n\nWith regard to their claim that in order to install the cast-iron pipe they were compelled to construct additional scaffolding and platforms, this is not correct.\n\nI was present at the time this pipe was installed and the cast-iron pipe was delivered on the ground and skidded by them into place without any additional timbering being required, with the exception of a few short pieces of 4 x 4 used to support the chain block by which means the pipe was being handled.\n\nTheir statement that I ordered that this cast-iron pipe be put together before being placed in the water is incorrect. I made no order in this connection, neither was this done.\n\nEach section of pipe was placed independently and a bolted connection was made after the last section of pipe was in place. It would have been impossible to have installed a 20 foot section of cast-iron pipe in one piece owing to the fact that the coffer dam was not of sufficient size to permit doing so.\n\nWith regard to driving and placing of timbers under the end of this pipe, this was insisted upon by me in view of the nature of the ground encountered after the excavation to grade line had been made, which change is fully covered under paragraph 7, part 1, page 4 of the original specifications.\n\nAs stated in my previous letter to you dated June 21st., 1929, I feel that the Ryan Contracting Co. were unfortunate in that, when tendering on this work, they did not allow a sufficient amount to cover unforeseen contingencies, and that owing to severe weather conditions the expenditure incurred by them in completing the job was far greater than was originally anticipated.\n\nThey have, in my opinion, a right to ask the Department to make them an additional allowance on the grounds that the work cost more than was anticipated owing to the fact that part of this work consisted of under-water excavation and about which they had no means of estimating accurately what the final cost would be at the time they made their estimate, but they are not, in my opinion, entitled to any extra payment on the grounds of additional work or material performed or supplied by them owing to changes made by us in the original plans, with the exception of those items mentioned in my letter to you dated June 21st., 1929, as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Extra concrete footings                   | $62.50 |\n| Extra cost of handling cast-iron pipe     | 15.00  |\n| Additional cribbing and shoring           | 54.00  |\n|                                           | $131.50|\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\nI may state that the reason that these extras were not included for payment when the accounts were forwarded to you at Vancouver was because I considered that by applying the cast-iron pipe to the Ryan Contracting Co., free of charge and by not making any deduction for vitrified pipe called for in the contract and which was not used owing to this change, I had more than offset any additional work performed by the Ryan Contracting Co.\n\nI may also state that the engineer for the Ryan Contracting Co. at no time gave me to understand that he considered this work as an extra. He did not ask for authority for this work in writing, and appeared at all times to regard it as the best means of getting out of a difficult situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.)

The Ryan Contracting Company replied under date of July 24th and I am enclosing herewith copies of the following correspondence for your reference:-\n\nLetter to the Ryan Contracting Co., dated July 22nd.\nLetter from the Ryan Contracting Co., dated July 24th.\nLetter to the Ryan Contracting Co., dated August 7th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd.

You will realize that the granting of the additional payment applied for would be an injustice to the contractors who have tendered on this work, besides creating an injudicious precedent if a similar case arose in the future.\"\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nE.J. Ryan Contracting Co.Ltd.,\n445 Granville St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nC.C. Mr. Tredcroft.\nJuly 24th, 1929.\n\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDominion Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nPost Office Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sirs: Attention Mr. C.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer,\n\nWe have your letter of July 22nd in reply to ours of May 30th dealing with additional work we carried out for you in connection with water supply for Kamloops Industrial School, Kamloops, B.C. We cannot understand the attitude your Department has taken in connection with this account, especially the last paragraph of the Director's letter which reads as follows:\n\n\"With regard to the above mentioned claim you will realise that the granting of the additional payment applied for would be an injustice to the contractors who have tendered on this work, besides creating an injudicious precedent if a similar case arose in the future\".\n\nSurely you do not consider that our claim comes under this category, and if you do, the writer would appreciate the opportunity of an interview with you in order that he may clear up any doubts which may exist as to the exact nature of our account.\n\nIn the first place, you changed the plans and specifications in connection with the intake, to such an extent that it was necessary to change the type of pipe used, thus creating an absolutely new arrangement for laying same and increasing the cost. The original intake pipe as specified was supposed to be laid in short lengths, but your engineer on the work decided that on account of the nature of the ground this would not stand and he ordered that this pipe should be made of cast iron put together before being placed in the water, which necessitated considerable additional labour and supplies to take care of putting this pipe in the water in long lengths. As you know this cast iron pipe is very heavy and we had to make special arrangements for scaffolding and platforms in order that same could be lowered into the water properly. The balance of our account as covered by invoices submitted, is based on similar arrangements to this and we still maintain that we are entitled to this additional cost.\n\nWhen we estimated on this work we were guided by your plans and specifications and we do not want for one minute to make a claim for any additional cost which was originally covered by them, but we do want you to pay for the additional work we carried out for you, which was caused through no fault of ours. In view of these circumstances we feel that we cannot allow ourselves to be placed in the category as set forth in the last paragraph of your Director's letter mentioned above.\nWe might add that we do not mind paying our just proportion of any additional work you require us to do, but we do feel that the balance of the cost should be properly distributed. We therefore again refer you to our account as submitted with our letter of May 30th and ask that you reconsider the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J.

H. Tredcroft,\nSenior Assistant Engineer\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nKamloops, B.C.,\nSeptember 12th, 1929.\n\nAPPROVED\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of August 28th regarding the claim made by the Ryan Contracting Company for extras in connection with their contract for the construction of a water supply system at the Kamloops Indian residential school, Mr. Webb reports that a conference was held recently in his office with two representatives of the contracting company, Colonel Keen and Mr. Hillier with Mr. Tredcroft and Mr. Webb.\n\nMr. Hillier, who was superintendent of this work for the contracting company, and Mr. Tredcroft had a long conference following which Mr. Tredcroft wrote to Mr. Webb under date September 12th, explaining the results of the conference and transmitting an account for $211.28 which Mr. Tredcroft had certified as correct for extra work performed under the contract of October 15th, 1928. Mr. Tredcroft's recommendation of the payment of these extras agrees with his original letter of July 21st, as to the amount of the extras which should be allowed, with the exception that he has now included an item of $79.78 claimed by the Ryan Contracting Company to cover extra depth of coffer dam, sheet piling, etcetera.\n\nYou will remember that when Mr. Webb originally transmitted Mr. Tredcroft's recommendation for payment of certain extras the impression was given that the increased cost was due to adverse weather conditions and other difficulties which the contractor had to overcome. This, of course, is not a sufficient reason for the payment of amounts additional to the contract price, but it is now clear from Mr. Tredcroft's statement that certain items are legitimate extras due to changes on the original specifications, made necessary by conditions met with during the progress of the work. For this reason I believe that the extras now recommended for payment by Mr. Tredcroft form a legitimate part of the expenditure covered by the contract and recommend that the amount of $211.28 be paid to the Ryan Contracting Company. You will notice that this is less than half of what the company originally claimed and appears to represent only valid claims.\n\nA copy of Mr. Tredcroft's letter to Mr. Webb of September 12th is enclosed, together with a statement of the account for $211.28.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6443, file 882-5, part 6)\nSir:\n\nWith reference to our recent interview at Vancouver, B.C., regarding the claim for extras put forward by the Ryan Contracting Co. for an amount of $447.15 in connection with the installation of a domestic water supply system at the Kamloops Industrial School, I would state that in accordance with your instructions I interviewed the representative of the Ryan Contracting Co., Mr. Hilyer, in this regard and discussed this matter with him at considerable length.\n\nI stated to Mr. Hilyer at the time, that this claim by the Ryan Contracting Co. for $447.15 could not be entertained by the Department, with the exception of those items mentioned in my letter to you dated June 21st, 1929, as follows:\n\n- Extra concrete footings $62.50\n- Extra cost of handling cast-iron pipe 15.00\n- Additional cribbing and shoring 54.00\n\nand that the following items included in his account, i.e.,\n\n- Extra excavation 210.00\n- Extra depth of coffer dam, sheet piling etc. 79.78\n- Extra pumping 66.00\n\ncould not be allowed, as these items were not, in my opinion, caused through any change in the plans.\n\nAfter a great deal of discussion, Mr. Hilyer agreed to waive their claim for the following items:\n\n- Extra excavation 210.00\n- Extra pumping 66.00\n\nbut maintained that the item \"Extra depth of coffer dam, sheet piling etc. - $79.78\" was a fair charge and was incurred solely through it being necessary for him to deepen the coffer dam at the point where the concrete was placed around the joints of the cast-iron pipe at my instructions.\n\nHe stated that in placing these footings it was necessary to carry the excavation from two to three feet below the required grade line in order to place the concrete, and after having given the case due consideration and hearing all his arguments in this connection I am of the opinion that this charge is justified.\n\nI would therefore respectfully recommend that in addition to the following items:\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B.C.\nExtra concrete footings $62.50\nExtra cost of handling cast-iron pipe 15.00\nAdditional cribbing and shoring 54.00\nTotal $131.50\n\nrecommended for payment in my letter to you dated June 21st, 1929, the item\n\nExtra depth of coffer dam, sheet piling etc. $79.78\n\nbe added, making a total due the Ryan Contracting Co. for extras under this contract $211.28, and for which a statement, duly certified by me, is here-with enclosed for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

John Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, with reference to improvements to the grounds of the Institution.\n\nThe work that I know the Rev. Principal has in view, the beautifying of the grounds at the Institution, entails a great deal of labour and time, besides certain materials to be purchased such as pipes and hoses for watering as he mentions. The cost of these materials is difficult to estimate at this time, but I would recommend that the Department assist the Rev. Principal in his efforts.\n\nI might say that the Rev.

(See accompanying plan)\n\nOn page 4 of my report it was clearly stated that this septic tank should be cleaned once every twelve months, and instructions to that effect were given to the principal of the Industrial school at the time the system was handed over.\n\nThis system, however, was permitted to run for over four years without the cover on the tank ever being removed, with the result that so much sludge accumulated in the settling chamber that the screened outlet from the settling chamber\n\nto the effluent chamber\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nVancouver, B. C.\nto the effluent chamber became clogged and the liquid in the settling chamber, instead of passing through into the effluent chamber via the screened passage provided for that purpose, was raised to such an elevation that it was forced through the air-vent between the two tanks, carrying with it a considerable amount of sludge.\n\nThis condition of affairs must have continued for so long a period and in the process so much sludge must have been carried into the effluent chamber that the automatic siphon provided to discharge the effluent at specified intervals also became blocked, and the only means of exit for the liquid from the second chamber into the disposal beds was through the overflow pipe.\n\nThe effluent, as a result of the above conditions, instead of being clear and in liquid form, carried with it a considerable amount of sludge.\n\nThe natural result was that the vitrified drain tile provided to dispose of the effluent became entirely clogged with sediment and the liquid, instead of draining away into the ground, forced its way up to the surface, causing a bad condition of affairs and much unpleasant odour.\n\nI may state that had this tank been properly cleaned, there is very little likelihood that the disposal beds would have failed to function properly, and in addition, I personally on several occasions warned the principal of the Industrial school (Father MacGuire) that the tank was due for cleaning, and each time he assured me he would attend to it.\n\nI may state that since\nI may state that since the management of the school has changed, the tank has been cleaned regularly, but of course it was too late for them to do anything to remedy the condition of the pipes, the above unsatisfactory condition of affairs having been allowed to go too far.\n\nWith the exception of the disposal beds which have become clogged, the remainder of the system (septic tank, inspection chamber, sewage pipes, etc.) is functioning perfectly, but I understand that a certain amount of trouble is experienced inside the building owing to the sewage traps clogging up. As these traps were installed by the contractor for the building, I have no knowledge as to how they were installed or just what should be done to remedy their conditions, but this can be attended to at the time the other repairs are carried out.\n\nProposed Repairs to System\n\nIn view of the fact that without taking up the drain tile it is impossible to tell exactly how much of this system is blocked, it is not possible to give an exact estimate of what the cost of repairs to this system will be.\n\nShould it be found after these tiles had been exposed that the entire system is blocked, then the cost of repairing same would probably amount to $1,200, but should the blocking of these pipes have taken place only at or close to the point where they leave the main sewer pipe, the cost of repairs will be considerably less.\n\nI would therefore recommend that a competent sewage contractor be employed under the supervision of this office on a cost-plus basis to expose and repair...\nexpose and repair that part of this drain tile system which may be necessary, and that in addition to these repairs the tank be thoroughly cleaned out and overhauled, and an auxiliary 6\" diameter vitrified pipe be installed from a point immediately above the tank to the centre of the garden, which pipe would act as a by-pass in the future for any repairs to the system that may require to be undertaken, and which would permit work being carried on on this system without sewage facilities in the school being interfered with.\n\nThe cost of installation of this additional pipe, together with a concrete diversion chamber, valves, etc. would amount to $400.00, and the total cost would therefore be $400.00 plus the cost of cleaning out the drain tile, which might vary from $100 to $1,200.\n\nI would point out that this school is located in a particularly difficult situation as far as sewage disposal is concerned. It is on the extreme edge of the river with the ground sloping only one way. The Department of Health will not permit the sewage to be drained into the river, owing to the fact that the city of Kamloops obtains its water supply a short distance downstream. The depth of the foundations of the school and the low elevation at which the drainage pipes leave the school building make it impossible to direct the flow of sewage in any direction other than the one in which it has already been carried, and the nature of the soil, which is a sandy gravel (mostly sand) makes it impossible to guarantee that these beds will not become clogged after five or six years unless great care...\nyears use unless great care is taken in the operation of the septic tank.\n\nIn addition to the above, the sewage in the school carries a large proportion of soap (from the school baths) which is very difficult to handle satisfactorily in disposal beds.\n\nThe only other method of handling this sewage would be by means of a system of mechanical filters, which would be expensive to install and which would require continual cleaning and care; and the cost of their operation, together with the cost of installation, would not, in my opinion, be warranted at the present time.\n\nIt would appear that repairs to the system as outlined in this report should first of all be carried out, and provided ordinary care is exercised in the maintenance of the septic tank I do not consider that further trouble will be experienced, but should it be found that after another five or six years the same condition occurs, then the department can consider the advisability of installing mechanical filters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

This investigation was made by Mr. Tredcroft and the report has been received which is enclosed herewith.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Tredcroft states that in his opinion, the necessity for these repairs is due to the fact that the septic tank was not cleaned at proper intervals. The repairs and improvements recommended will cost from $500. to $1600., depending on the damage which has resulted and which can only be determined when the disposal beds are exposed. It is recommended that a competent contractor be employed, under Mr. Tredcroft's supervision, on the cost-plus basis, to make such repairs and improvements as are considered necessary.\n\nA copy of this report has been sent to Mr. Bitchburn.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

John Duplanil, O.M.I., pointed out to me the difficulty he is experiencing in the matter of storage for fruit and vegetables, and school supplies, such as large quantities of canned goods, soap, etc.\n\nThey use, approximately, six tons of potatoes per month alone, and, of course, other vegetables in proportion. He wishes to buy about fifteen tons of apples at this time of the year for winter use. The storage provided when the school had 100 pupils is now inadequate, as the number of children at present in school is about 250, besides a larger staff.\n\nThe Rev. Principal wishes an appropriation of about $500.00 to make an addition to the store rooms. After investigating the situation, I am of the opinion that this request is reasonable, and wish to recommend that the Department assist to provide extra storage to that extent.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n(Ewen MacLeod)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEM/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nJune 26, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, and enclosures, with reference to alterations and repairs to the Kamloops Industrial School Sewage Disposal System.

Carr and Sons have been awarded the contract to install sewer pipe at a cost of $385.00. Mr. Tredcroft considered the balance of the tender too high and has arranged to do the rest of the work by day labour, employing Indians of the Kamloops Reserve, who are said to be urgently in need of employment.

They may have access to statistics which would advise us concerning the seriousness of the situation.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, February 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your telegram of the 19th instant, with reference to the irrigation well at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, and I wish to confirm the Deputy Superintendent General's answering telegram of yesterday's date, as follows:-\n\n\"Regret, no funds to deepen well, Kamloops School.\"\n\nI may say that the Department is writing to Mr. Commissioner Bitchburn, asking him to have the Dominion Water Power and Hydro-metric Bureau make a report concerning the danger of low water next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEwen MacLeod, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nKamloops Residential School.\n\nAt the time of my inspection visit there were 274 children at the school. The health there has been good, and so far, they have escaped the bad epidemics of scarlet fever and whooping cough raging in the town. This is probably due to the care of the Principal in keeping the children from contact in the town. He has installed a moving picture machine in the dining room, conforming to regulations. This saves any excuse for parents wanting to take their children to town for a show. What with the above, radio reception fitted in the playrooms, swings, slides, etc., all provided by the principal, the children in this school are lucky. At the meal at which I was present, the children had meat, vegetables, gravy, bread, peanut butter and cocoa. The school also this year, purchased and salted several truck loads of salmon.\n\nThe extinguishers and fire apparatus were all in place, and free, unlocked access to fire escapes allowed. Eight more chemical extinguishers are required, however, for the boys' wing. Refills for the sixteen extinguishers already installed are required.\n\nWhilst the boilers heat the building alright, they appear to be very extravagant. Anyhow, they use twenty tons of coal per month. The Principal showed me that his coal bill since the last of August was $2944.00. The hot water storage tank in the boiler room is now not adequate for the call upon it. Over 3000 pieces of washing are done every week. To my mind, it wants a second tank of equal capacity. There is great difficulty too, in the summer, to obtain really hot water, so necessary for dishwashing in the kitchen. I should advise the installation of two small jacket heaters right in the kitchen, for this purpose alone, leaving the larger jacket heater, in the boiler room for laundry or bath days alone, in the summer.\n\nThe dormitories, class rooms, kitchens, laundries, etc. I found in excellent order.\n\nThe barn wants repainting very shortly, if for nothing else than to preserve the wood.\n\nPractically all the ground surrounding the school has been graded and levelled, and young trees planted around. When these grow up, and with the addition of some lawn grass, the school will look a handsome building.\n\nHowever, the school is very short of storage room for supplies, such as potatoes, apples, etc., which\nnaturally, such a big institution required. Up to now, temporary use has been made of old outbuildings, but a storage shed should be erected.\n\nG. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nVictoria, B.C., Feb. 18, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder heading No. 5, school, I beg to say that I shall be able to purchase the eight additional chemical fire extinguishers for the Boys' wing and have the refills supplied for the sixteen already installed, if given the necessary authority to do so.\n\nThe matter of the boilers is one for attention of the Department's Architect it is thought.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nOttawa, February 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell on his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I have to say with regard to the additional fire extinguishers required for the boys' wing and the refills for the extinguishers at present on hand, that the Department will be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase and delivery of same. You may supply eight (8) extinguishers of the size and type considered necessary, also the chemical refills for the sixteen (16) extinguishers already in the school. The Principal should be instructed to have the refills installed in the extinguishers when received, and he should see that these extinguishers are in good condition and ready for immediate use if required. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned, and I have to request that the account covering the cost of the new extinguishers and refills be withheld until after the 1st of April, next, when our new appropriation will be available.\n\nConsideration is being given to the providing of an additional hot water storage tank in the boiler room and the installation of jacket heaters in the kitchen.\n\nThe repainting of the barn and the erection of a storage shed have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

He states even at this date it is very late to commence work of this nature, and it may be necessary to delay installation of the last two lengths of pipe until the water recedes in the fall.\n\nMr. Tredcroft has had further conversation with both Mr. Indian Agent MacLeod and the Principal of the Industrial School with reference to the advisability of carrying out this work. The principal of the school stated definitely that even if the work were to cost $1000.00 the benefit derived therefrom would more than compensate for the expenditure.\n\nIt is evident therefore, if your department wishes to have this work done before next high water authorization for the work should be immediately forthcoming.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) C.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to Departmental letter No. 154-0-5, dated February 21st ultimo, with regard to the proposed lowering of the irrigation pump well at the Kamloops Indian Residential School a further four feet owing to the shortage of water occasioned during the irrigation season which affects the school crops, more particularly as this year the water of the South Thompson River is very low.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter was taken up with the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau with the result that a report has been prepared by Mr. E. H. Tredcroft, Senior Assistant Engineer stationed at Kamloops, in which he advises that the cost of the proposed work would be $800.00.\n\nIn submitting a copy of Mr. Tredcroft's report dated March 14th, instant, to this office, further copy of which is sent herewith for the Department's information, Mr. Webb, District Chief Engineer, points out that his Bureau had nothing to do with the construction of this intake well.\n\nIt is recommended that the work be undertaken at once if the Department is able to furnish the funds therefor, for it is apparent that irrigation in the autumn season, impossible under the present condition of supply, would permit of a fair crop of alfalfa such as is much desired for cattle feed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. R. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of March 3rd having reference to the lowering of the intake well for the irrigation pumping plant at the Kamloops Industrial school, and am enclosing herewith estimate of cost of same.\n\nIn this connection, I would like to point out that this well, which the principal of the Industrial school now claims it is necessary to lower, was not constructed by this branch, but was built by the Rev. Father MacGuire, late principal of the school, on his own initiative, without this office ever having been consulted or asked for advice. Had I known that this work was being carried out, I would have informed the Rev. Father MacGuire that same was likely to go dry at the latter end of the season.\n\nAs both the Indian Agent and the principal of the Industrial school were under the impression that this work had been carried out by the Water Power Branch, I think it is a point which should be drawn to the attention of the department.\n\nThe elevation of the Thompson river at Kamloops at the present time is approximately 6\" above minimum low water, and in the vicinity of the pumping plant the water is now 6\" below the bottom of their present intake pipe.\n\nThere is no doubt, in my opinion, that before they find it necessary to irrigate this season the water in the South Thompson river will have risen sufficiently to fill the intake well, but Father Duplantil claims that it is the latter part of the irrigation season, from September 1st to 15th, that he requires water for his last crop, and is unable to obtain same.\n\nHe has therefore requested that the intake pipe and well be lowered an amount of 4'.\n\nAfter having examined this intake well, I find that if an extension has to be made to same, it will be necessary to purchase 110' of 14\" dia. wood stave pipe, as it would not be advisable to attempt to lower the existing culvert, which is a patchwork affair, partly of vitrified pipe, partly wood culvert and partly concrete culvert. The excavation for the lowering of the well itself would also be difficult, owing to the restricted area in which to work and the fact that water would undoubtedly be encountered. These features make the cost of carrying out these repairs comparatively high, i.e., $800.00.\n\nAs far as it is possible to judge from comparing gauge heights at our stations on the Thompson river at Kamloops and the South Thompson\nRiver at Chase, it is quite true that the water around September 15th is just low enough to make it difficult to pump, i.e., the well is not empty, but the suction pipe, which is approximately 12' above the floor, is only partially submerged.\n\nFrom this it would appear that the Rev. Father Duplanil's statement that he is unable to obtain water for irrigation purposes after September 15th is quite correct.\n\nJust whether the amount he loses by not being able to obtain this last irrigation and whether the expenditure of $800.00 is justified, I am not prepared to state, but Father Duplanil informs me that this last irrigation permits him to obtain a fair crop of alfalfa, on which they turn their cattle in to feed.\n\nFather Duplanil has also informed me that he would be prepared to carry out some of the work by school labour, but in view of the conditions we should encounter, i.e., great depth of the cut (19' at place), and the fact that excavation would be wet and difficult to handle, I have not considered it advisable to take this into consideration in preparing the estimate of cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nJune 9th, 1927.\n\nDear Colonel Pragnell,\n\nUpon my return to the office this morning I find your letter of the 2nd June regarding the Kamloops school. I am sorry that it has been impossible for me to include the last wing of the Kamloops school in our building programme for the present year. Our funds are limited and had to be divided as equably as possible. In the meantime, therefore, the school authorities will have to manage with the accommodation now provided.\n\nI was sorry to learn of your illness and I trust that the warmer weather will bring you relief.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLt.-Col. G. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nFather Maguire is hoping against hope that the east wing of the Kamloops School will be started this year. I promised him I would drop you a line to see if there is any chance. He is worried as I am about the boys accommodation. Rumour had it true it was going to be started!\n\nI hope you have been keeping well? Myself had another go of fever which left me with aching legs. However, when the warm weather came, I hope that it will go away again. I also hope that it won't be long before an agent is assigned for here. The work has been particularly pressing just lately, and I can't get along with my own job, what I would have done without Mr. Borden's able assistance. I don't know.\n\nOne thing I have been relieved of in the military...\nAugust 19, 1926.\n\nDear Father McGuire,\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the necessity of completing the Kamloops school building. I hardly appreciate the reference to Father Guy, who is so interested in the welfare of the schools in British Columbia and has done such useful work in supporting the claims for progress in Indian educational matters. Are you quite convinced that you are making the best use of the space at your disposal in the interest of the male pupils? I have not lost an atom of my interest in the Kamloops school, and hope that before long Parliament may provide the funds to continue the building operations.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. James McGuire, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\nIndian School,\nKamloops, Aug 12, 1926.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nYou know very well what it means to a staff to have construction spread over a period of four years, and then two or more years added. No doubt, construction troubles, like other school troubles, are part of my business and I must expect them and meet them with an even mind.\n\nYour policy of construction, to build by units, I am not discussing. That is your business entirely, not mine.\n\nThere was, however, one feature concerning the boys' wing, which should have been finished this year, that annoyed me profoundly. In a letter dated Dec. 14, Father Guy says: \"We have discussed this matter while preparing the estimates in the course of October, but found no immediate necessity for said work.\" I said nothing at the time, nor since; I have no intention of answering that letter. It might hurt you or the Hon. Dept. General. It was too late to rectify the error. But, Doctor, it was very unfair. Father Guy had absolutely no authority either from Very Rev. Father Welch or me to discuss the matter. Had even if he had, he might easily arrive at the conclusion that there was no immediate necessity for the work, or any other conclusion equally stupid: he knew nothing of the situation, not\neven the geography! So he concludes: \"It will probably be considered next year, or later, as the case may be,\" which for him is quite as logical as the first. Neither of us has anything to gain by making further mention of the matter.\n\nThe girls' house was burned. You remember the dilapidated condition of the boys' house five years ago. There are some forty odd boys still occupying that house! And there are thirty odd boys living in the old laundry!\n\nDoctor, if anything happens these seventy-five boys, what can either of us say? If their house burns or if this new house burns, what can you say to me? We are living now as we lived before, under impossible conditions when the thermometer goes twenty below. Or, will it be sufficient to say that some irresponsible person saw no necessity for the work?\n\nYou cannot hold me hard for drawing your attention to the critical condition of the boys and buildings here. I haven't had a week's holiday in ten years! I cannot take them. You could not yourself.\n\nWill you kindly oblige me by saying whether or not you intend to place an item\non the estimated to cover the boys' wing?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire, M.D.\n\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nSeptember 9, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Heidman,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum left by you yesterday as to furniture for the new wing of the Indian school at Kamloops, B.C., I beg to say that the furnishings are being purchased by Commissioner Ditchburn from local firms at competitive prices.

Mr. Ditchburn forwarded an account to the Department amounting to $365.37 covering articles purchased for the Kamloops School from the above mentioned firm.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS\n\nOttawa 23rd February, 1925.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nRe- N. S. Dagleish & Sons, Kamloops.\n\nOn the 4th of February, you wrote acknowledging my letter with reference to the purchase of supplies for the Indian industrial school at Kamloops. You stated in this letter that these purchases were made by the Indian Commissioner at Victoria after obtaining competitive prices, and the contract was awarded to the firm whose quotation was the lowest.\n\nUpon transmitting this information to my correspondent, I am advised that this statement would not appear to be quite correct, as Messrs. N. S. Dagleish & Sons were not asked to furnish quotations, although this firm had placed their name before your Department some months before the work on the building was completed, advising that they carried stocks of furniture and house furnishings.\n\nI would be very glad if you would make it a point to see that this firm is sent a tender form when the next call for tenders goes out, which will possibly be next summer on the completion of the Girls' Wing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 4, 1925.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nWhen tenders are being called for the furnishings for the girls' wing at the Kamloops school, after completion next summer, kindly see that Messrs. N. S. Dalgleish & Sons, of Kamloops, are advised.\n\nDuncan Macdonald\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nFebruary 4, 1925.\n\nDear Doctor King,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the purchase of supplies for the Indian industrial school at Kamloops.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the furnishings already purchased for this institution consist principally of kitchen utensils and a few articles of furniture for the central portion of the new building; these purchases were made by the Indian Commissioner at Victoria, after obtaining competitive prices, and the contract was awarded to the firm whose quotation was the lowest.\n\nWhen the girls' wing is completed next summer, it will be necessary to purchase all the furniture that will be required for this, and I have made a note of your recommendation in favour of Messrs. N. S. Dalgleish & Sons, of Kamloops. We will see that they are advised when tenders are being called for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. J. H. King, M.D., M.P., LL.D.\nMinister of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe furnishings required to date for the new Kamloops School were purchased by Mr. Ditchburn after obtaining competitive prices. They consisted principally in kitchen utensils and a few articles of furniture for the centre portion of the new building.\n\nWhen the girls' wing is built next summer it will be necessary to purchase all of the furniture that will be required for the furnishing of the girls' dormitories, sewing room, Sisters' dormitories and community room. These purchases can be made either by Mr. Ditchburn after obtaining competitive prices or direct from this office.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS\n\nGL\n\nOttawa 2d February, 1925.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nDear Doctor Scott,-\n\nIt would seem that, when the supplies for the new Industrial School at Kamloops were being purchased, the order for hardware and furniture was placed with J. L. Gordon at that point.\n\nI understand that you will be requiring furnishings for the new wing to be built, and I would be glad if you would give consideration to the firm of N. S. Dalgleish & Sons, Kamloops, B.C., when calling for tenders.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nNovember 30, 1927\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott;\n\nLet me thank you for your telegram approving of Father Duplanil's appointment to Kamloops.\n\nIn a previous communication you have spoken of Kamloops Indian Residential School as being the most important Catholic school in British Columbia. I quite realize this; have endeavored to give you as its principal, one of the most capable managers at my disposal.\n\nWriting from Kamloops, Fr Duplanil finds the school in a sound financial condition, but regrets that there are only one hundred children in attendance. This is due, he thinks, to a variety of causes, the chief one being a general feeling of unrest among the Indians of the Kamloops district.\n\nReferring to the last quarterly returns of Fr McGuire which were sent back, and only $4000.00 paid instead of $5142.50; Fr Duplanil says that his predecessor had a way of his own in granting holidays, and it is not easy to know how he stood. Nevertheless he sincerely believes that the greater part of the balance is honestly due the school. This being the case, I will ask you in this connection to deal as generously as you can with the new principal. At this time, support from your Department will be of great encouragement to him, and a pledge of your confidence.\n\nWith regard to your promise to ask Parliament for an appropriation to complete the fine building at Kamloops, I need not say what satisfaction this has given us. Further delay in finishing the School, to my mind and in the opinion of others, would be almost disastrous. Certainly until the building is completed, the school can never be run successfully, and the longer the work is postponed, the more I fear conditions will go from bad to worse.\n\nWe all sincerely hope and believe that you will succeed in procuring the appropriation, and that the Boys' wing will be begun and completed next year.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJuly 11, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Colley:\n\nIn the Honourable Mr. Stewart's absence, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 25, with enclosure.\n\nIn the original plan for the Kamloops industrial school a wing is provided for the boys' residence, and it is the intention of the Department to complete the building as soon as Parliament grants funds for the purpose. We are now in correspondence with our officers with reference to the present conditions at the school.\n\nThanking you for your interest in this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJas. R. Colley, Esq., M.L.A.,\nKamloops, B.C.\nPersonal.\n\nHon Chas Stewart,\n\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Stewart:\n\nYou will note from enclosed that a condition exists at the Indian School which requires some immediate consideration and attention.\n\nYou have in Father Mc Guire a real, live, and very much interested party. In fact he is a real Jew when it comes to buying anything for that institution, price being his only consideration.\n\nHowever he is much concerned as to present conditions. We tried to get hold of Mr Graham of Merritt to talk same over with him, but he is away. Therefore I am taking this matter up with you and paid a visit to the institution yesterday.\n\nThe Medical Health officers report requires attention. Accommodation for the boys is required, under present conditions they cannot take care of the boys in this district for which the building was built for.\n\nIf present conditions continue and when the Fall term at August 1st, starts if some changes are not made, it will cause not only unrest among your staff but also among the Indians.\n\nThe school was built to cover a large territory and a definite policy to Father Mc Guire should be made, and I would suggest that an independent official be sent to investigate conditions at once.\n\nIf you wish me to have Mr Graham write you I will do so, or anything that will help in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\nKamloops, B. C. June 15th, 1927.\n\nReverend Father McGuire,\nSuperintendent, Industrial School,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt your request I have recently examined the sanitary conditions at your school and find as follows:\n\nThe recreation room for the younger boys is the old laundry which is most inadequate and most unsanitary. The wood about the floor is water-soaked and the surrounding soil is saturated with the accumulation of years. It is most unsanitary besides being very cold in winter. The younger boys going from this room to the heated dormitories of the new building where they sleep are subjected to conditions very detrimental to their health, and we have had experience of numerous infections, colds, bronchitis and pneumonia during the past winter.\n\nThe dormitories and school room of the older boys consists of two buildings which are scarcely an improvement on the old laundry. They are cold in winter and absolutely unsuitable for the purposes for which they are intended. I looked over the wash-room of the dormitories yesterday which is decidedly dilapidated and unsanitary at best.\n\nBesides this, these old buildings have outside toilets which are in a tumble-down, rotten condition; the soil about them is saturated with sewerage and the stench from it is unbearable. These toilets are a distinct menace to the health of the children and not at all in keeping with the appointments of a modern school. I would advise that these be demolished at once and some new arrangements made.\n\nDuring the past year we have had a succession of infections in the school which it is impossible to eradicate in the presence of such unsanitary conditions.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nMEDICAL HEALTH OFFICER.\nJune 17, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nThe Department deems it advisable to have the property occupied by the Kamloops Indian Residential school, which was acquired in 1888 from an Indian holder surveyed, and I should like to be advised of the name of a surveyor to whom the work might be entrusted. The property is situated in the Cariboo Electoral district, close to the city of Kamloops, and the survey could be most economically performed by a surveyor from that city. It is thought that the area of the school property is in the neighbourhood of 160 acres. The Kamloops Band is most anxious to have the school property definitely defined as difficulty has arisen from time to time when leasing land adjacent to the school property.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6448, file 882-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 15th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nRe: Dalgleish & Sons, Kamloops.\n\nReferring to my memorandum of the 13th February, I have to make a report for your information on the two following telegrams:\n\n\"Ottawa, February 14, 1929.\nW.E.

Charles Stewart -\n\nSo far as I am aware all the necessary furniture has been bought for the new wing at Kamloops. It is invariably our practice to buy beds and standard furnishings of this nature from the wholesalers. It is quite impossible for Dalgleish and Sons to compete with them, and our experience has been that when wholesalers find that retailers are being asked to tender they withdraw. For this reason in 1925 Dalgleish and Sons cost the Department $95 on a consignment of 100 beds, as the Simmons people, whose price was $7.00 withdrew and we had to accept the tender of J. L. Gordon at $7.95; the price of Dalgleish and Sons was $8.75.\n\nIn your letter to Hon. Dr. King you stated that we would give Dalgleish and Sons an opportunity to tender on what they could supply; what is meant by that is utensils, etc., etc. As you know I am quite keen to look after the local merchants but not for purchases which we should make through the wholesalers.\n\nIf you so desire I can find out from Mr. Ditchburn whether there are any rooms to be furnished and with what articles.\nDecember 28th, 1928.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nKindly note the telegram which I sent to Mr. Ditchburn on the subject of purchases from Dalgleish & Sons of Kamloops, B.C. I explained to Dr. King that the orders may already have been given because Mr. Ditchburn has had this matter in hand for some time. He had the name of the Dalgleish Firm but as we are not supplying any small wares such as kitchen utensils etc., etc., it may not be possible to purchase anything from them.\n\nDCL\nOttawa, December 27, 1928.\n\nW.

The Principal has greatly improved the school grounds, etc., and made all tidy, but it has necessitated a tremendous lot of work.\n\nThe manual training has been very successful, and an extension to the building used for same, is being built. The boys are now doing most of this work around the school.\n\nThe survey of the school land has, I understand, just been completed.\n\nGeo. S.

Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools when dealing with his report on this School. I am attaching hereto copy of a letter I have received from the Rev. Principal in this matter and will be pleased to know what action the Department is prepared to take to meet the request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWED/KD.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKamloops Indian Residential School,\n\nKamloops, B.C.,\nFeb. 8, 1932.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nSome time ago during your official visit to the Kamloops Indian Res. School, I called your attention to the fact that the equipment for laundry work was not quite adequate for the number of children we have in the building. Both you and the late Mr. MacLeod agreed to the need of another washing machine, with electric motor and shaft. Since then Captain Barry has also recommended the matter. Over three thousand five hundred pieces of clothing go through the laundry each week. You may figure the work and time connected with it, at least as long as we have the present number of washing machines.\n\nWill you be kind enough to write the Dept. about this matter.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"John DuPlantil\"\nOttawa, February 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his inspection of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, states that on the day he visited the school the classroom was far too cold - there being no heat in the radiators - and that it seems absurd that small children should have to sit in such a cold room.\n\nI have to request that you will draw the matter of the proper heating of the classrooms to the attention of the Principal. It is thought that, with the heating equipment at the school, there should be no reason for not having the classrooms in a comfortable condition for the children. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nEXTRACTS from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the KAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL on November 30th and December 1st, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 154-0-6.\n\nThe IMPLEMENT SHED was blown into the river during a storm last September and became a complete loss. I am informed that one car load of lumber to the value of about $350.00 will be necessary if the boys are to rebuild the implement shed and construct a piggyery, which is badly required. I am under the impression that there is no way of avoiding the building of these sheds and have, therefore, to recommend the sanction of the expenditure of the above sum. The boys ought to be able to build the implement shed and piggyery with the help of their teacher of Manual Training and the farm staff.\n\nKitchen: The Sisters keep this kitchen in beautiful condition. The roof leaks all around the walls of the kitchen. I do not know if anything can be done to remedy this condition. The floor of the kitchen - 36 ft. by 27 ft. - should have some sort of efficient covering. I should like to suggest that the Department supply the school with a heavy Battleship Linoleum with a cork lining underneath. This will save the Sisters from the trouble to their feet from which they are now suffering from continuous walking on the hard floor.\n\nLaundry: All the belting and the machinery appears to me to be well guarded. The Principal requests the supply of one 7 foot Semi-Rotary Washing Machine with the necessary electric motor to work it. I understand that the Western Washing Machine made or sold by Colligthy Brothers of Vancouver and costing about $350.00 is the type that will work with the present equipment. About three thousand articles go through the laundry weekly. I am inclined to recommend the supply of the Washing Machine requested by the Principal.\n\nGeneral: The classroom was far too cold this afternoon. There was no heat in the radiators. It seems absurd that small children should have to sit in such a cold room.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nLast September, the former Agent, Mr. MacLeod, submitted Voucher No. 311-31 for $27.60, in favour of the Free Text Book Branch of the Department of Education, Victoria, covering the cost of books supplied to the Kamloops Indian Residential School. In this regard, I would point out that such vouchers should not be submitted to this Department as books and stationery supplied to Indian day and residential schools are ordered through the Government Stationery Office and, therefore, accounts received from firms supplying these books should be sent to the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, Ottawa. Please be guided by these instructions in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.

Under these circumstances, a refund of this amount should be made to this Department. I would appreciate receiving your cheque as soon as possible.\n\nWe have no information here regarding the exact books for which the amount of $3.60 was charged on sales slip No. 6287. No doubt, you can let me know for what books this charge was made and, also, the school to which they were supplied. It is possible that payment of this amount has also been made by the Department of Public Printing and Stationery, in which event a cheque for this sum should also be refunded to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It might be advisable to ascertain from the Principal details of the lumber required. After the purchase has been made please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified covering the cost, and you should state thereon that same is to be paid by B.C. Special Appropriation. As this material is to be used for manual training purposes, it is considered that it is properly chargeable to that Appropriation. In view of the recent orders for strict economy, our funds for General Appropriation for Indian Education will be extremely limited during the next fiscal year. It is understood that the school authorities will be responsible for the carrying out of the work as mentioned in the Principal's letter without cost to the Department.\n\nI might add that Mr. Inspector Barry further recommended that a quantity of battleship linoleum be supplied for the floor of the kitchen, but it is regretted that the Department will have no funds to provide this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith copy of a letter dated February 14th, instant, which has been received at this office from Reverend Father John Duplanil, Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, B.C. This letter will be self-explanatory.\n\nOn January 26th, a letter was addressed to the Department from this office covering the report of the Inspector of Schools. If the Department will kindly refer to Inspector Barry's report of his inspection on November 30th and December 1st, last, it will be seen that he recommended the purchase of $100.00 worth of lumber for manual training purposes, in addition to the car load of lumber to the value of about $350.00, together with other expenditures, in connection with which in my covering letter of January 26th, ultimo, I suggested that the Indian Agent be asked to furnish the Department with details of material required together with an estimate of cost so that the Department may be in a better position to authorize the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nOn Sept. the 26th 1929 I received from Ottawa a letter which read as follows:....... \"Materials with which to work, texts and benches have been directed to you and the Dept. wishes to make this phase of the school activity a real success. Please let me know what has been done and what is required to make the work as efficient as possible....\"\n\nLater on I had the following letter....\" Whenever it is possible to increase the efficiency (of the manual school) you should not hesitate to address a letter to the Dept......\" Both communications were signed by Mr. J.D. McLean, asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nAs you know, I have not asked and therefore I have not received. In preparing my work for the coming year, I find that I need a car load of mixed lumber, the approximate cost being $350.00. This material is to be used for building pig pens, implement shed and other out buildings. I do not know of any work more practical for our children. Last year they built an up to date chicken house (without any help from the Dept.) they painted the barn (no help from the Dept.) and built a great deal of the furniture used in the buildings. I wish to know how far you are willing to go in recommending this matter of help to the Indian Dept. I understand that Captain Barry recommended the purchase of lumber for the school. His report will show his opinion on the matter.\n\nThe manual school has been very practical and very successful, but I cannot make it as efficient and practical as I wish unless further assistance be given me by your Dept.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"John Duplanil\"\nFebruary 17th, 1932.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs: Attention: Mr. F.H.

He also informed me that five carloads of coal and 200 cords of wood have been consumed during the winter.\n\nHowever, from personal visits made during the winter, I may say that at all times I found the temperatures of the building very comfortably heated and well ventilated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W.J.

John Duplamil, O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, to the effect that the cesspool at the School is in a dangerous condition as a menace to health, and that something be done immediately to remedy the matter.\n\nI have visited the school and found that the cesspool had been overflowing and things were in a very messy state. Since then the sludge has been cleaned out and hauled away. After this was done, it was found that the automatic suction valve was out of order, and this will likely have to be replaced at a cost of $30.00. While this will relieve the situation somewhat, the main trouble will still continue which is, from all opinions, in the disposal beds which have been clogged with sediment, and the liquid, instead of draining away into the ground, is forced back through the overflow pipe.\n\nTo overcome this there are two alternatives. One is to dig up and clean out the drain tiles in the disposal bed. The other is to make a cut of about twenty to twenty-five feet down into gravel beds which underlie the sand in which the present disposal beds were laid, but I think that this is a matter for an engineer to look into and report on, and I would ask that it be referred to the Water Power and Reclamation Service.\n\nI have in the office here, a report on the proposed repairs to this system, by E.H. Tredcroft, late of the above service, which I am quoting hereunder insofar as the present situation is concerned.\n\nProposed repairs to system. (April 3, 1930)\n\n\"In view of the fact that without taking up the drain tile it is impossible to tell exactly how much of this system is blocked, it is not possible to give an exact estimate of what the cost of repairs to this system will be.\n\nShould it be found after these tiles had been exposed that the entire system is blocked, then the cost of repairing same would probably amount to $12.00, but should the blocking of these pipes have taken place only at or close to the point where they leave the main sewer pipe, the cost of repairs will be considerably less.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nI would therefore recommend that a competent sewerage contractor be employed under the supervision of this office on a cost-plus basis to expose and repair that part of this drain tile system which may be necessary, and that in addition to these repairs the tank be thoroughly cleaned out and overhauled, and an auxiliary 6\" diameter vitrified pipe be installed from a point immediately above the tank to the centre of the garden, which pipe would act as a by-pass in the future for any repairs to the system that may require to be undertaken, and which would permit work being carried on on this system without sewage facilities in the school being interfered with.\n\nThe cost of installation of this additional pipe, together with a concrete diversion chamber, valves, etc., would amount to $400.00, and the total cost would therefore be $400.00 plus the cost of cleaning out the drain tile, which might vary from $100 to $1,200.\n\nI would point out that this school is located in a particularly difficult situation as far as sewage disposal is concerned. It is on the extreme edge of the river with the ground sloping only one way. The Department of Health will not permit the sewage to be drained into the river, due to the fact that the City of Kamloops obtains its water supply a short distance downstream. The depth of the foundations of the school and the low elevation at which the drainage pipes leave the school building make it impossible to direct the flow of sewage in any direction other than the one in which it has already been carried, and the nature of the soil, which is a sandy gravel (mostly sand) makes it impossible to guarantee that these beds will not become clogged after five or six years unless great care is taken in the operation of the septic tank.\n\nIn addition to the above, the sewage in the school carries a large proportion of soap (from the school baths) which is very difficult to handle satisfactorily in disposal beds.\n\nThe only other method of handling this sewage would be means of a system of mechanical filters, which would be expensive to install and which would require continual cleaning and care; and the cost of their operation, together with the cost of installation, would not, in my opinion, be warranted at the present time.\n\nIt would appear that repairs to the system as outlined in this report should first of all be carried out, and provided ordinary care is exercised in the maintenance of the septic tank I do not consider that further trouble will be experienced, but should it be found that after another five or six years the same condition occurs, then the Department can consider the advisability of installing mechanical filters.\n\nIn the above report, in paragraphs 3 and 8, mention is made of an auxiliary by-pass pipe at a cost of $400.00. This pipe was installed some time ago, and at present being used to pass the sewage by the septic tanks.\nThe Secretary.\n\nJuly 16th, 1932.\n\nBefore closing, I would like to impress the Department with the fact that this repair work will have to start in sufficient time to allow completion before the opening of the School on August 25th next, otherwise, for sanitary reasons, the school would have to remain closed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 22, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 2543-W\"A\" of October 14, 1930, with reference to the sewage disposal plant at the Kamloops Indian Residential School. You will recall that repairs, at a cost of approximately $1400, were made two years ago. At that time, the by-pass was installed.\n\nThe local Indian agent reports that the disposal plant is again out of order. It appears that the automatic suction valve needs replacing and that the disposal beds are clogged. He writes in part as follows: \"To overcome this, there are two alternatives. One is to dig up and clean out the drain tiles in the disposal beds. The other is to make a cut of about 20 to 25 feet down into gravel beds which underlie the sand in which the present disposal beds were laid, but I think that this is a matter for an engineer to investigate\".\n\nAt present the by-pass is being used, but it is very urgent that the disposal plant be put in good condition at the earliest possible date. Will you please telegraph to your Mr. Webb, asking him to arrange for a report, with estimate of the cost, concerning what should be done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Electric Railway, and 286-32 in favour of Rev. John Duplanil, Principal, Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nThese expenditures were of an emergent nature, and were made in connection with the high tension wire, which crosses the South Thompson River and carries electric current from the B.C. Electric Railway Company to Kamloops Indian Residential School, and is school property.\n\nOwing to the high water and the slack which had worked into the sag of the wire, there was not enough clearance to allow a steamboat, the \"C.R. Lamb\" to pass under the wire, and while she was manoeuvring to get by, her smokestack caught the wire and stretched it down to within a few feet of the wire. As the wire was carrying a current of some 2000 volts, a man was put to work as guard to keep small boats and others away from the wire until the B.C. Electric were able to bring in a crew and equipment to make the necessary repairs.\n\nIn this connection, I do not think that the Department has any claim for the cost of repairs against the owners of the boat as the Thompson River is a navigable stream, and the boat would likely be built according to the specifications required by the Department of Marine and Fisheries. The owners of the boat claim that the height of the boat from the water line to the top of the smokestack at the time of the accident, was 33\u00bd feet, which does not seem to be out of reason.\n\nIn view of the past accident and the present height of this power line, I would be obliged if you could obtain for me the regulations governing the height of transmission lines across the North and South Thompson Rivers.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

H. Whyte\n\nVancouver, B. C.\nAugust 5, 1932.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nAugust 3, 1952.\n\nSir:\n\nInspection of Sewage System,\nKamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I inspected the above mentioned system on July 28th and 29th and beg to report thereon.\n\nThis system was installed originally in 1924 for the disposal of sewage from the school and to provide for an ultimate population of 250 persons. Until 1929 the system seems to have functioned in a satisfactory manner although it was badly neglected. In 1930 the system was overhauled and put in good repair and it appears to have given satisfaction until this year.\n\nAs described in previous reports, the system consists of a two chamber septic tank with the necessary disposal beds. A by-pass valve and pipe line installed in 1930 permits the direct discharge of sewage to pits situated on the farm near the school. Drainage water from the school laundry is carried through a separate pipe line direct to the land in the school orchard.\n\nEarly this summer the septic tank was cleaned and it was found the Anthes Syphon Valve in the septic tank was broken due to corrosion. How long it had been in this condition is unknown but it is possible that it had been out of order long enough to again result in the disposal beds.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nof slightly over 300 persons. This care must include the following:\n\n1. Cleaning of septic tank at least once every three months.\n\n2. Cleaning of grease traps in building at least twice each week.\n\n3. Prevention of newspaper and other deleterious material being put into sewage system.\n\nTo ensure the septic tank being cleaned frequently, it seems advisable to supply a small portable power driven trash pump. Such a pump unit could be procured for about $160.00. With a power pump there is more likelihood of this work being frequently carried out as the present system of hand cleaning is laborious and noxious.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION\n\nShould the system after a fair trial be still found to give trouble it will then be advisable to consider one or both of the following proposals or to consider the replacement of the present system by an expensive mechanical disposal plant.\n\n1. Soap, fats and oils from the kitchens of the school are to a certain extent caught in grease traps below the sinks but undoubtedly the waste water still contains a heavy percentage of such substances. This soap, fat and grease interferes with the proper digestion of the sludge in the septic tank and also forms a film over the inside of the land tile of the disposal beds thus preventing the ready seepage of the effluent.\nto the soil. If this kitchen waste water was diverted to the laundry waste disposal system it would thus relieve the septic tank and disposal beds. To make this diversion would necessitate the installation of 400 feet of 3-inch pipe from the kitchen to the sump pit where the pump now used in connection with the laundry waste water system is located. This waste water would then be passed to the school orchard with that from the laundry. To install this pipe and the necessary valves would cost some $600.00.\n\n2. As the present system has already to accommodate an excess of 25% over its designed capacity the installation of a second septic tank unit with the necessary disposal beds might well be considered in the near future. This second unit would be contiguous and parallel to the present one and of similar design. The cost of installing this unit would be approximately $3,000.00.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe question of installing a mechanical disposal system has not received serious consideration as the initial cost and cost of upkeep of such a system is much greater than seems warranted unless the school population is likely to greatly increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. Whyte\nAssistant District Chief Engineer\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the sewage disposal system at Kamloops Indian Residential School, Mr. Webb writes as follows, under date of September 1st:\n\n\"I am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. C.B.Corbould, Junior Power Development Engineer, dated August 29th, advising that the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Company have replaced the Anthes syphon valve in the septic tank for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Corbould further advises that he has been informed by the Principal of the school that the tank is now working in a satisfactory manner although he stresses the point that at the moment the children are not yet back at school. The cost of installing this valve was $40, and I would be pleased if you would advise me as to whether the account should be paid from our advance for Indian General Surveys or will a separate advance cover expenses incurred in connection with this work.\"\n\nWill you please advise me as to how the expenditure for this valve is to be met.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 22nd regarding the sewage disposal plant at Kamloops Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith a report received from Mr. Webb, which describes the existing conditions of the installation and makes some recommendations as to its future operation. The new syphon valve has been ordered through the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Company and will be installed as soon as it arrives. It is expected that with the installation of the new valve and some cleaning of the disposal beds that the system will function satisfactorily, although it may be necessary to make some further changes in view of the fact that the School is now accommodating over 300 persons in place of the 250 for which the system was designed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Electric Railway Company, for work done in connection with repairs to the power and telephone line to Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this respect, I wish to report that a bird had built a nest in the cross-arms on the top of one of the poles of the line, and owing to wet weather and friction, a short circuit was made, causing the pole and wires to catch fire. This happened on the evening of November 21st, and owing to the necessity of their supply of light and power for the school, a repair crew was ordered by the Principal from the B.C. Electric Company. Temporary repairs were made that evening, and the work ordered completed next day, by myself.\n\nIn this regard, I am enclosing a clipping from a local paper, in which a kingfisher is referred to as the culprit. The paper was in error, as a kingfisher, I think, generally builds his nest in a clay bank. However, it was a large bird of some sort.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, I trust that this report will be favourably received and the account paid.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J.

Tredorff supervised the installation of the new drains and the cleaning of the old ones, according to instructions, the Tank was cleaned and washed every three months. The School children used common pails for the purpose, but I do not approve of this method of cleaning the tank, as it is not sanitary or practical. I, therefore, cannot allow the boys to clean the tank in this way.\n\nI take this occasion to make a strong objection to the report sent by one of the so-called Engineers in the employ of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Mr. Whyte. When he came to the School, he complained that the Tank had not been cleaned and washed thoroughly. There was no sediment of any kind in the Tank, not even water. It had been thoroughly cleaned, scrapped and washed about two weeks previously to the Inspection.\n\nI would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the grease boxes in the scullery, kitchen and dairy had been thoroughly cleaned, as instructed, in the same manner as the Tank. My word is just as good as his and I certainly object to this Report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, November 3, 1932.\n\nW.

In this connection I have to confirm the following night lettergram to you of today's date:\n\n\"Reference your letter twenty-eighth ultimo. May arrange for purchase from indicated sources supply of small portable power-driven trash pump costing one hundred sixty dollars for use in connection sewage system Kamloops Residential School.\"\n\nThe Department regrets that the recommendation of the Inspector of the Dominion Water Power Branch in connection with the supplying of the above pump was overlooked. After you have made the purchase, you should forward an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIn connection with the report of the Water Power Branch, it is noted that it is recommended the care of the present sewage system must include the following:\n\n1. Cleaning of septic tank at least once every three months.\n\n2. Cleaning of grease traps in building at least twice each week.\n\n3. Prevention of newspaper and other deleterious material being put into sewage system.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the school authorities carry out the above recommendations of the Inspector of the Dominion Water Power Branch.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nK-L-3\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer you to a report dated August 3rd last, by Mr. G.H. Whyte of the Dominion Water Power Branch, in connection with the sewage system at Kamloops Indian Residential School of this Agency.\n\nIn this report, certain recommendations were made for repairs to the present system. One was the advisability of installing a small portable, power driven trash pump, at a cost of $160.00, which was to be used for the cleaning of the septic tank at least once every three months.\n\nUp to the present, no further word has been received by me or the Rev. Principal regarding this pump, and today, Rev. Father John Duplanil informed me that the tank requires immediate cleaning, and the only way to assure the cleaning being done in a sanitary way, and to protect the health of the children was by use of a pump. He also further advised me that should he have to clean the tank by baling with buckets which would create a smelly and unhealthy mess, he would not be responsible should typhoid fever break out amongst the children.\n\nI quite agree with the Rev. Father in his request for this pump, as I have been at the tank when it was cleaned by baling with buckets, and it was more than I could understand how the men employed could stand the stench and filth in connection with the work. The children also have to put up with this, as it is in the centre of their playground, while the staff get their share with a favourable wind.\n\nIn view of this necessity for this expenditure, I would ask that the Department please wire the necessary authority.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

The Department is pleased to note that, generally speaking, the whole of the plant is kept in good condition.\n\nWith reference to boiler No. 43711, the engineer recommends that the steam gauge be renewed, at a cost of approximately $10. He states that the glass front of the steam gauge on this boiler and also on boiler No. 43710 was broken and that moisture and dust had got inside and spoiled the interior mechanism. The school authorities should at once arrange to have the steam gauges on these boilers renewed, and you will see that this is done.\n\nThe engineer further states the blow down pipes of these boilers are in fair condition, but are connected together and have no check valve between each and the boiler, which is a dangerous method in case anyone is working around one of the boilers and the blow down valve is left open and the other one is blown down, the boiling water would blow back into the empty boiler and burn the one working in the boiler which is being cleaned. These pipes will need renewing in the near future, and when it is done check valves must be installed. You should draw this matter to the attention of the Principal, and he should in due course have check valves installed.\n\nRegarding boiler No. 43794, which supplies steam to the school laundry, the engineer states that, if a reducing valve was installed on this machine and 100 pounds carried on the boiler, it would increase the efficiency of the laundry plant. This matter should also received the consideration of the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. J.

They are a very economical boiler, but need a very careful inspection.\n\nBoiler No. 43710a.\n\nI inspected this boiler, giving it a careful hammer test, and found that all stays, shell, furnace plates and combustion chamber, were in sound condition.\n\nThe interior plates are in first class condition. Lime and soda has been used, added to the feed water, and I would recommend that the same treatment be continued.\n\nI then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 45 lbs. and found that all seams and joints were perfectly tight, and in good condition. The fusible plug was renewed, but the steam gauge must be renewed at an approximate cost of Ten Dollars ($10.00).\n\nThere are two spring loaded pop safety valves, one 3\" in diameter and the other 3 1/2\" in diameter, manufactured by Crane Co. I set them to blow off at 14 lbs., full, 15 lbs., cold water pressure.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs., and condition good.\n\nI understand that a new set of firebars have been ordered for both boilers.\n\nBoiler No. 43711a.\n\nOn the same date I inspected this boiler, giving it a careful hammer test and found that all stays, shell, furnace plates, and combustion chamber, were in sound condition.\nBoiler No. 43711, Cont'd\n\nThe interior of this boiler is also in first class condition. There were more loose scales in the bottom of the wet legs than in boiler No. 43710, and some on the tubes. These were removed and the same water treatment recommended.\n\nI gave this boiler a Hydrostatic Test of 45 lbs. and found that all seams and joints were perfectly tight and in good condition. The fusible plug was renewed. The steam gauge must be renewed at a cost of approximately Ten Dollars ($10.00). The glass front of both these gauges was broken and the moisture and dust had got inside and spoiled the interior mechanism.\n\nThere are two safety valves, one 3\" in diameter and the other 3 1/2\" in diameter, manufactured by Crane Co., spring loaded pop. I set them to blow at 14 lbs. full, 15 lbs. cold water pressure.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBlow Down Pipes.\n\nThe blow down pipes of these boilers are in fair condition, but are connected together and have no check valve between each and the boiler, which is a dangerous method in case anyone is working around one of the boilers and the blow down valve is left open and the other one is blown down, the boiling water would blow back into the empty boiler and burn the one working in the boiler which is being cleaned. These pipes will need renewing in the near future, and when it is done check valves must be installed.\n\nCondensation Pumps, Etc.\n\nThere is a duplicate set of condensation pumps working from one common cast iron receiver.\n\nThey are in good condition and have the appearance of being well kept. I tested them both and they were quite free.\n\nBoiler No. 43794.\n\nOn the same date I inspected this boiler, giving it a careful hammer test and found that the shell plates, furnace, furnace tube sheet, top tube sheet, rivets and longitudinal seam, were in sound condition.\n\nThis boiler is 34\" in diameter, 7'7\" high and has 54 - 1 3/4 tubes. The top end of the tubes have the appearance of having been slightly burnt. This could have been caused by raising steam too quickly. I pointed this out to the attendant and he promised to raise steam more slowly.\nBoiler No. 43794, Cont'd.\n\nI gave this boiler a Hydrostatic Test of 190 lbs. and found 27 tubes leaking. There was a tube roller at the school, so I rolled the leaking tubes and they are now tight, but they are quite thin. They will stand being carefully rolled two or three times more before they will need renewing.\n\nThe fusible plug was renewed, and the safety valve set to blow off at 75 lbs. cold water pressure. This boiler supplies steam to the school laundry and the safety valve is set at that pressure on account of the ironing machines. If a reducing valve was installed on this machine and 100 lbs. carried on the boiler it would increase the efficiency of the laundry plant.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 130 lbs. and condition fair.\n\nThe same water treatment should be continued as with the rest of the plant.\n\nThe whole of this plant is kept in a very clean condition.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

Telephone Co., Kamloops, B.C.\n\nfor Emergency repairs to telephone line Kamloops Indian Residential School. See my letter K-R-6, December 8th, 1932.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th file 154-0-6 regarding a report in connection with the raising of the electrical transmission line and telephone line which extends from Kamloops to the Indian Residential School, which the Public Works Department reports does not give sufficient clearance over the South Thompson River at extreme high water for the SS. C.R. Lamb.\n\nIn this respect I wish to report as follows:\nLast summer, I reported by letter dated August 26th, 1932, File K-S-7747, that the C.R. Lamb had fouled the line and pointed out that these wires would very likely have to be raised.\n\nIn connection with your above request, I have now gathered from investigations:\n\n1. That to raise the telephone line 4.8 feet, and the power line 2.1 feet, as required by the Public Works Department, and in accordance with sketch \"A\" attached hereto, the estimated cost would be $80.00.\n\nThe maximum height that these wires can be raised using the poles as at present is:- Telephone wires 5.0 feet, Power wires 4.0 feet. This estimate is based on the assumption that power will be cut off while work is in progress. If continuous power is necessary, the estimate would be doubled.\n\nI have interviewed the Rev. Principal, Father John Dugan, and he informs me that it can be arranged for a shift of six hours during the day. It will take two or three shifts to do the work. During this period that the current would be cut off, every care would have to be taken to guard the School against fire, as they would have only a limited supply of water in the reservoir. However, with everyone cautioned to be careful during the cut-off, and with the supply of chemical hand fire extinguishers that are in place over the building, I am sure that everything in this respect would be safe enough.\n\nIn the construction referred to in sketch \"A\", the present poles, anchors, wire and insulation will be used. The balance of the material to be supplied new, such as cross-arms, bolts, braces and some guy wire.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nWhile the estimate of $80.00 will likely be sufficient to complete the construction work as laid out in Sketch \"A\", there will also be a charge by the Power Company cutting the current off and on again, and possibly some other unforeseen expense, and I would ask that an allotment be made of at least $100.00 to cover the expenditure in connection with the raising of these lines.\n\nThe attached sketch \"A\" was prepared by Mr. M.L. Wade, a registered civil and electrical engineer, who was formerly Superintendent for the West Kootenay Power and Light Company, Ltd., and I feel certain that his survey and estimate of this matter can be relied upon. Mr. Wade has very kindly reported on the work for me without charge, and I would ask that he be allowed to tender on the work, if it is put up to competitive bids, which I would recommend be done, the work to be allotted to the lowest bidder, provided they have suitable equipment for the proper carrying out of the work. The other local firms who would likely tender are the B.C. Electric and C.J. Wain.\n\nI might add that this work should be under progress shortly and be completed not later than May 26th next, as the highest water of the year in the Thompson River usually occurs during the first week in June.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J.

Desjardins,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of March 30th with reference to the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School and note that owing to a shortage of funds it will not be possible to carry out the improvements suggested in Mr. Warren's report of March 10th. Copy of your letter has been sent to Mr. Webb, and he has been asked to carry out the suggestions contained therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, requesting authority to purchase three gallons of varnish, at a cost of $5.00 a gallon, for the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nOur funds for the next fiscal year are so limited, that the Department is unable to authorize this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nOttawa, March 30, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, with reference to the recent visit of Mr. W. C. Warren to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, in connection with the septic tank. This report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"The pump was not used, the sewage being allowed to run down to the garden by way of the by-pass. The Indian Agent suggests that the pump be returned to Messrs. Pumps & Power and a refund obtained. Apparently, the school authorities do not care to use it.\"\n\nIt is presumed that the above refers to the syphon, the purchase of which was authorized by official wire of November 8th, last, and payment for which was made on receipt of your voucher 12-33, for $61.85, on January 27th, last. If the school authorities do not intend to use this pump, the Department wishes you to communicate with Messrs. Pumps & Power, 40 Cordova St. East, Vancouver, and see if arrangements can be made to have it returned and a refund obtained. Please advise what action you take in this matter.\n\nFor your information, I may add that the Department is again communicating with the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, regarding the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops School. From the report received, it appears that, in order to insure the disposal system functioning with the least trouble, it will be necessary to incur an expenditure of approximately $1,100. As our appropriation has been reduced, it will not be possible to consider such a large expenditure. However, we are requesting the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau to give the matter further consideration, with a view to ascertaining if temporary measures could be taken to improve the sewage system at a considerably less cost than the amount mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, enclosing the report of your engineer regarding the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that, in order to have a disposal system that will function with the least trouble and with the least possibility of contaminating the domestic water supply of the adjoining municipality, it will be necessary to incur an expenditure of approximately $1650.\n\nI regret that, owing to the fact that our Appropriation for the fiscal year 1933-34 has been considerably reduced, this Department is not in a position to authorize an expenditure of the amount mentioned.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Department has only $500 available for the fiscal year 1933-34 for necessary repairs and improvements at the Kamloops School. I would appreciate if you would arrange to have your engineer give this matter further consideration. Possibly, the suggestion contained in the second paragraph of Mr. Warren's report would meet the situation for the present and, it is noted, would not involve any heavy expenditure.\n\nIt is also noted that the pump which has been recently supplied has not been used, and the Indian Agent is being written and instructed to make arrangements for returning this to the firm from which it was purchased, provided the school authorities do not intend to use it. Possibly our Agent did not purchase a suitable pump, and you might request Mr. Warren to indicate if he considers some other make of pump is necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nK-S-2.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father John Duplanil, Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, informs me that the doors of the building are badly in need of re-varnishing.\n\nIt will require three (3) gallons of Outside Spar Varnish at a cost of $5.00 per gallon, a total cost of $15.00.\n\nI would recommend that this varnish be furnished for the school, and that I be given the necessary authority to purchase same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of January 16 last regarding the sewage disposal system at the Kamloops Indian residential school, I enclose a report received from Mr. Webb in this connection resulting from a visit by Mr. Warren during the first week in March.\n\nIt will be noted that the system is not functioning satisfactorily in so far as the septic tank is concerned and that this is due to the rapid rate of the passage of sewage through the tank.\n\nOwing to the fact that the water supply intake of the City of Kamloops is downstream from the school site, septic tanks are the only available means for disposing of sewage from this institution. For this reason it becomes necessary to have a disposal system that will function with the least trouble and with the least possibility of contaminating the domestic supply of the adjoining municipality. It will be noted that Mr. Warren recommends the construction of an additional tank unit and re-arrangement of sewer pipes to provide for a slower rate of flow through the disposal system. The estimated cost of this work is $1650.\n\nMr. Webb concurs in this recommendation and asks that the matter be given early consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nVancouver, B.C.,\nMarch 10, 1935.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nKamloops Industrial School,\nSeptic Tank.\n\nIn reference to the above it has been necessary to clean out the septic tank again at the school owing to the solid matter being carried into the second chamber. This was completed just before I arrived in Kamloops. The pump was not used, the sewage being allowed to run down to the garden by way of the by-pass. The Indian Agent suggests that the pump be returned to Messrs. Pumps & Power and a refund obtained. Apparently the school authorities do not care to use it.\n\nIt appears to me that the septic tank has not sufficient capacity now that the school population is in excess of 300. I have suggested to the Indian Agent that an extension of the by-pass between the two chambers in a downward direction about 15 inches would stop for a time at least the conveyance of solids through the tank and also that an extension of the inflow pipe about the same amount would prevent the disturbance of the surface to the same extent as at present occurs. These alterations if made of a temporary nature would not be costly. They might help to stimulate the present very slow rate of conversion.\n\nThe present capacity of the septic tank, less than 20 gallons per head per day, does not correspond with the actual rate of sewage flow which is nearer 50 gallons per head per day. As a result of the lack of capacity the rate of change of the settling or liquefying chamber is from 2\u00bd to 3 times daily, and should normally be one change for best results.\n\nUntil one year ago the present septic tank was operating satisfactorily. The increase in population from 250 to over 300 recently has overtaxed the capacity of the tank to operate satisfactorily and it has now developed into considerable of a nuisance for the school authorities and will become more so when the warm weather arrives. The tank was cleaned out in the early part of December last and again about the first week of March. From my recent observations it is safe to say that little, if any, bacterial development takes place, due in my opinion to the high rate of inflow which disturbs the surface, and to the rapid rate of flow through the tank.\n\nI would suggest that an additional unit of the same capacity be provided so that the sewage flow could be equally divided between the two tanks.\nThe capacity of the system would then be sufficient to provide for the present population at a rate of about 40 gallons per head per day. Some slight changes would be required in the layout of the sewage pipelines to allow for the equal division of flow and for disposal of the effluent.\n\nIn regard to the sewage disposal beds, I was unable to examine them as the ground still remains frozen. I have, however, requested the Indian Agent to inspect the tile so soon as circumstances permit.\n\nThe cost of providing an additional tank unit and re-arrangement of pipes has been estimated at $1650. No outlay for the filter beds is included in this estimate as without examination it is impossible to say in what condition they are in. If in good shape now no further extension would be required.\n\nIt has been suggested that by the diversion of drainage from the kitchens and boiler rooms less unnecessary flow would pass through the tank, that is true, but I am doubtful if the amount diverted would be sufficient to reduce the amount going to the septic tank to a quantity well within its capacity.\n\nThe difficulty about disposing of sewage by means of septic tanks in institutions such as the Kamloops School is that there is no regularity of flow but rather a concentrated flow about three times daily which is each time in sufficient quantity to almost exactly displace the contents of the tank, thus allowing only a very short interval of time for bacterial action.\n\nW.C. Warren\nThe septic tank for the disposal of sewerage is not giving satisfaction now, and has to be frequently cleaned out. I think the trouble is that this tank was built for a capacity of 250 people, and counting the staff, there are about 300 people at the school. A large quantity of water is used, and I think, owing to this strong flow and overtaxing of its real capacity, the bacteriological action necessary in a septic tank is not getting a chance to work. It happened that Mr. Warren, Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Company was here, I drew his attention to the matter which, in short, is that this tank is now not working as a septic tank; but more like an ordinary cesspit. I asked him to report the matter to his Chief, Mr. Webb. My personal opinion is that the feasible solution is the building of another septic tank alongside, with a division in the main pipe from the building, so that the flow will be halved into each tank. Failing that, perhaps the diversion of some of the waste water from the kitchens, dairies, etc., might help lessen the strain on the existing tank.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the matter of the septic tank at the school has been the cause of conflicting views as between the Principal of the school and the engineers of the Water Bureau. There is no doubt that the use of this system is very extensive and I think the engineers should be looked to to see that the problem is adequately dealt with and what is wrong with the system duly corrected. Mr. Webb's attention has been called to the Inspector's observations in this report. When his answer is received, the same will be forwarded to the Department.\nMarch 16, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the transmission line from Kamloops to the Indian Residential School, I beg to say that I am writing our Indian Agent at Kamloops to report as to what should be done to remedy the present condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 6, 1933.\n\nSir: Re: Kamloops Indian Residential School, Septic Tank.\n\nOn August 19th a report was forwarded to you on inspection of sewage system, Kamloops Indian Residential School, dated August 3rd, by Mr. G.M. Whyte. This report contained several recommendations, one of which, being the installation of a new syphon valve, was immediately authorized and completed.\n\nLater, on the 10th of November, I received a telegram from Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson asking me to inspect a trash pump ordered for the school from the local firm of Pumps & Power, Vancouver. Upon inspection the pump was found to be unsuitable for the handling of raw sewage. An ejector pump was substituted on trial and used to clean out the septic tank early in December, under the supervision of Mr. W.C. Warren of our staff. The septic tank when cleaned out at the first of December was found to be out of order, due to the blocking of the screened passage between the syphon and settling chambers, which caused the settling chamber to fill and overflow into the syphon chamber. This situation was, of course, unsatisfactory.\n\nThe screened passage was cleaned out and at present the tank is functioning satisfactorily. You will note Mr. Warren suggests the tank be cleaned out at least twice a year under ordinary operating conditions.\n\nI am enclosing his memorandum in duplicate dated the 3rd inst., reporting his findings.\n\nYou will note it is suggested a basin be developed at the foot of the garden which should be fenced off and used as a bed to receive the sludge which may be used for fertilizer.\n\nThis latter may be done through the local officials of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nJ.T. Johnston, Esq.C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom.Water Power & Hydrom.Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\nVancouver, B.C.,\nJanuary 3, 1933.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Kamloops Industrial School,\nSeptic Tank.\n\nI visited the above school December 2nd to 7th and with a man supplied by the Indian Agent had the septic tank cleaned out using for this purpose an ejector pump purchased by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe septic tank was found to be not in working order due to the blocking of the screened passage between the settling and syphon chambers. This stoppage caused the settling chamber to fill up completely before allowing a flow to take place through the overflow passage between the two chambers, by which means a large percentage of solids passed to the syphon chamber. Normally the settling chamber should remain only about 75% full, overflowing to the syphon chamber by means of the screened passage.\n\nThe accumulation of solids in the syphon chamber congests the passages for the movement of liquid sewage and eventually clogs the sewage disposal beds. Unfortunately the ground had frozen solid at the time of my visit making an examination of the disposal beds impossible. As the plant has operated successfully since cleaning I do not believe a very great amount of solids got into the disposal beds. It would be desirable to have an examination made of the disposal beds to determine to what extent solids have been carried there so soon as the ground thaws sufficiently.\n\nDisposal of Sludge\n\nDue to the extremely cold weather during the cleaning operation the material from the septic tank was pumped into the by-pass sewer line from the school and allowed to run down to foot of the garden about five hundred or six hundred feet from the school. This procedure should not be carried on regularly as an acceptable method of disposing of the sludge. It would be preferable to have a wide shallow pond created in the garden at the end of the by-pass pipe so that the sludge would be confined to one location. A pond about 30 feet wide by 50 feet long would provide ample accommodation for the collection of the material pumped out of the septic tank. The area should be dyked with stout banks about two feet high and fenced. This sludge is of a harmless nature and all offensive odor disappears after a few hours of exposure to sun and air and may be used successfully as a fertilizer.\n\nCleaning of Tank\n\nThe septic tank including the passageways for the movement of sewage through the chambers...\nshould be cleaned at least twice a year. While it is possible for the tank to operate longer without cleaning, the passage of the liquid part through the congested tank after six months would increase in rapidity eventually resulting in a flow of undigested solids to the disposal beds.\n\nOperation of Pump\n\nThe pump provided for cleaning the septic tank worked satisfactorily. Some large solids which are bound to accumulate in such a receptacle could not be handled by the pump successfully. Some difficulty was also experienced due to the presence of small stones in the water line clogging the jets. The operation was however better than any other type of pump of reasonable cost which it is possible to supply.\n\nThe difficulties in respect to stoppages may be overcome by screening. To prevent large size solids accumulating in the tank a large mesh screen may be placed in the by-pass box adjacent to the septic tank and cleaned every other day or so. In connection with the stones a screen, Crane No.966, Standard 2 inch, may be employed in the water line.\n\nThe pump operates by means of the normal pressure of the water system. Additional power may be secured by using the water system supply pump to increase the pressure but is unnecessary. The school fire hose is the medium employed to connect the pump to the water system by way of a fire hydrant within 200 feet of the septic tank and a valve on the pump is employed to stop the operation or start it. The pump will under favourable conditions, evacuate the septic tank in from four to five hours.\n\nSummary\n\nSo soon as conditions will permit, an examination of the disposal beds should be carried out to determine to what extent solids have filled up the land tiles, so that if necessary they may be removed for cleaning.\n\nA basin or pond should be created at the foot of the garden and fenced off for the reception of sludge from the settling tank when found necessary to clean it. The septic tank should be cleaned twice a year. Screens as mentioned would make the cleaning operations by means of a pump less difficult.\n\nW.C.

Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nMay 26, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nKamloops School, Sewage Disposal.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st ultimo, regarding the above, I note that the Department of Indian Affairs will not have sufficient funds available this year for the addition to the septic tank, found to be necessary.\n\nWith regard to the request of the Secretary in his letter of March 30th, that further consideration be given to the possibility of alterations to the existing septic tank as suggested in the second paragraph of Mr. Warren's report dated March 10, 1933, be given. I wish to point out that the suggestions contained therein were offered to the Indian Agent with the recommendation that the changes be made when it is again found necessary to clean the septic tank, in order that the work be carried out as cheaply as possible. It would not be advisable to anticipate that the suggested changes would overcome the difficulty encountered in connection with the disposal of sewage at this institution. The only permanent solution may be found in either reducing the quantity of sewage or augmenting the machinery to handle it.\n\nMeans may be found for reducing somewhat the flow of sewage of a harmless nature to the septic tank. The reduction would, however, be insufficient to provide the low rate of flow through the tank which is desirable. I will, however, have further consideration given to this problem at an early date and advise you of the findings. I presume that funds up to the extent of $500. are available for whatever improvement may be warranted by an expenditure within that limit.\n\nRegarding the pump purchased for the cleaning of the septic tank. Mr. Warren informs me that it is the most suitable for the work which may be purchased within a reasonable cost. A power pump to pass solids of equal size, (slightly larger than 2\"), to that which may be handled by the ejector pump purchased, would cost in the neighborhood of $750. on account of the large power unit required to operate it.\n\nThe cost of the mechanical pump increases at a much greater rate than the increase in capacity, measured in size of solids, owing to this\n\nJ.M. Johnston, Esq., C.E.,\nDirector,\nDom. Water Power & Hydrom. Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA.\nsame factor. I do not believe that any other kind of pump would serve the purpose better than the one supplied. All have limitations or objectionable features with some kinds of material, especially so in small sizes.\n\nRegarding the recently adopted practice in clearing the septic tank or allowing the contents to run out the by-pass pipe to the ground at the foot of the garage, I am of the opinion that means should immediately be provided for containing it to a small area as suggested in Mr. Warren's memorandum of January 3rd under heading \"Disposal of Sludge\", as in the interests of health the practice above referred to should not continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nK-L-6\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of March 16th and May 4th last, file 154-0-5, regarding the raising of the electrical transmission line and telephone line crossing of the South Thompson River from Kamloops to Kamloops Indian Residential School to provide sufficient clearance at extreme high water for SS. C.R. Lamb.\n\nThe heights to be raised, required by the Department of Public Works Engineers were to be 2.1 feet for the transmission line and 4.6 for the telephone line.\n\nIn this respect, I now beg to advise you that I have had the B.C. Electric Railway Company do the work and the transmission line has been raised 5.0 feet and the telephone line 5.7 feet, which is well above the requirements of the Department of Public Works.\n\nVouchers for the cost of the work will follow in due course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nWJF/S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise the Department that I have been informed by Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson of the Kamloops Agency that he has been instructed to proceed with the raising of electrical transmission wires crossing the South Thompson River and serving the Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that on April 28th, ultimo, Mr. Ferguson reported to this office on the matter but he did not state who owned the line. As our files did not contain the information I wrote to Agent Ferguson on May 4th, asking him if he could give me the desired particulars. On May 12th, Mr. J.E. Webb, District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, at Vancouver, addressed a letter to Mr. Ferguson in reply to a letter received by Mr. Webb from him dated May 11th stating that he would be pleased to have Mr. Corbould obtain the necessary elevations and asking him to whom he had entrusted the work. It was my intention to have Mr. Webb's advice and to make a formal recommendation to the Department in view of instructions recently received that all requisitions for expenditure should be forwarded to the Department through this office with a recommendation.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Webb, who was here today in connection with a review of water licences in the Okanagan Agency, and he stated that he does not object to Mr. Ferguson having this work carried out himself provided it is understood that he will assume any responsibility in regard to the matter. Mr. Webb added that he had not received a reply from Mr. Ferguson to his letter of May 12th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP/KD.\n\nChas. G. Perry,\nAsst.

Wade.\n\nThis was an emergency expenditure. The line to the school was put out of order by a high wind on April 3rd last. A short circuit was caused, burning out one of the motors and immediate action had to be taken. This was reported upon by on under date of April 27th last, when reporting on the condition of this transmission line and electrical equipment.\n\nThe motor burned out is a 1\u00bd H.P. 1800 R.P.M. 3-phase, 60 cycle motor of Lincoln make, and the cost of repairs will amount to $660.00 re-installed.\n\nAuthority should be granted for this expenditure as soon as possible, as this motor will be required to operate the return feed pump to the boilers, and should be repaired before the cold weather sets in in the fall.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W.J.

The soda and lime treatment must be continued.\n\nThe bridges are in good condition and will need no repairs.\n\nThe firebars of both boilers are in very bad condition. One new set should be obtained as soon as possible, which will cost about Sixty-five Dollars ($65.00). The best of the bars of both boilers can then be made into a complete set, giving a complete new set for one boiler and a good set of old bars for the other.\n\nThe test gauges and water gauges are in good condition, the steam gauges are correct.\n\nThe blowdown cocks are in good condition but the blowdown pipes are very rigidly connected together which causes severe contraction and expansion strains on the boiler plates and pipe nipples. These should be disconnected and led separately to the sump. This will cost about Seven or Eight Dollars, the work to be done by the staff.\n\nThe safety valves work freely and are set to blow off at 15 Lb.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 Lb. and condition good.\n\nAttention should be given to the drains under the boiler room floor as from appearances when they were laid they were only carried to the walls of the building and then allowed to seep through the soil which has now become clogged. If they were carried to the nearest surface drain about 100 feet, good drainage would be obtained. This should not cost over One Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($150.00), and then the boiler room floor could be kept dry as at present water will stay for days which is very injurious to the plant.\n\nI would also suggest that consideration be given to the installation of underfeed Mechanical Automatic Stokers. If they were installed local coal could be used and a saving of at least 30% in the operation of the plant could be obtained as well as an increased efficiency of at least 20%, which in this plant would amount to quite a considerable sum.\nBoiler No. 43794 B.C.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all plates, rivets and crowns were in good condition.\n\nI then gave it a Hydrostatic test which I could not complete as several tubes were leaking at the top tube sheet. In my last report I pointed out that these tubes were getting very thin. They will need re-expanding and will only last this season but must be retubed next summer or replace it with a new larger boiler as this one is 30% too small for the work it has to do, and required forcings. If this is done then the old boiler can be retubed and used in another school where conditions are the same.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing 75 Lb. steam pressure and condition, on account of the tubes, fair.\n\nThe Laundry machines are well kept and also well guarded and from present appearances will need no repairs except for breakages.\n\nOne of the motors of the condensation units has been burnt out and is now under repair which must be done before the firing season starts.\n\nThe approximate cost of repairs mentioned is as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Firebars for boilers  | $65.00 |\n| Drain                 | 150.00 |\n| Blowdown repairs      | 8.00   |\n| Retubing boiler       | 100.00 |\n| 2 Fusible Plugs       | 4.00   |\n\n$327.00\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

Webb, Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Service for the return of the pump under the following conditions:\n\nPumps & Power Ltd., agreed to accept the return of the pump and issue a credit note for the full amount of the cost of the pump, $79.50, less a rental charge of $15.00 for the time the pump was in use, provided the pump was returned in good order, this credit to apply on future purchases made by this Department.\n\nAs the pump had to be in a condition to meet with their approval, before they would accept it and issue a credit note, I returned the pump to them on August 12th last, freight prepaid at a cost of $1.19, and have since received their credit note for the full amount of $79.50, along with a charge account for the rental of $15.00, which leaves a credit balance with them at present, in our favour for $64.50. Copies of these accounts are enclosed herewith.\n\nIn regard to the rental of $15.00, I beg to advise that as the pump was in use for several days in December, at the School, pumping the sewage out of the tank, this use would make it second hand, and in view of this, I think that Pumps & Power were very fair in taking the pump back and charging only $15.00 rental for the use we had out of it.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe Secretary\n\nSeptember 7, 1933.\n\nI would therefore ask the Department to please approve of the arrangement, and that I be authorized to obtain from Pumps & Power, Ltd., material that possibly will be required in the future, from time to time for repair work on the pumping plant on Kamloops Indian Reserve, or to the pump and motors at Kamloops Residential School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[W.J.

This estimate was based on figures prepared for me by Mr. M.L. Wade, an electrical engineer here, but even the amount of $60.00 now appears high to me for repairs of this nature to a motor of this type, and in view of this, I have written two firms in Vancouver for prices on a new motor and also prices on a second hand one, as I think it possible that a replacement could be made at less cost than to have the burnt out one re-wound.\n\nOne of the firms written to in this respect is Pumps & Power, Ltd., who have recently allowed the Department credit to the amount of $64.50 on the return of the sewage pump supplied the School last winter. A letter of application in connection with this is being mailed to the Department today, and if the Department approves of this credit, the repairs to the pump, or the replacement, as the case may be, could be placed with this Company, and advantages taken of this credit.\n\nHowever, rather than furnish you with a detailed estimate at this time, I would ask you to wait until I have their prices from Vancouver, when I will advise you further on this matter. In the meantime the School will be able to operate their heating plant at this time of the year with the other motor.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of the 7th, received this morning.\n\nWe are sorry that we cannot duplicate your Lincoln Motor as this make has not been generally handled here for some years, and moreover the 1\u00bd H.P. size is hardly ever kept in stock.\n\nThe best we could do would be to offer you a 2 H.P. Howell Timken bearing Motor at $42.50, complete with base and pulley, or we have a 2 H.P. Bullock at $35.00 complete. The latter is a sleeve bearing motor.\n\nA new 1\u00bd H.P. Westinghouse or General Electric Motor costs $55.00 plus $8.00 for base and pulley, if needed.\n\nWe would think that it would probably be worth your while to rewind the old motor, as we could do the job for $25.50. This would not include anything more than rewinding and if new bearings were required these would be extra.\n\nAll prices are for 220 volt motors and f.o.b. Vancouver warehouse.\n\nWe shall look forward to hearing from you again by return.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPUMPS & POWER LIMITED\n\nPer C. Notzel.\nOttawa, January 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, giving particulars concerning the range required to provide additional cooking facilities at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from Messrs. Marlatt & MacKenzie, of Kamloops, of a 7 ft. by 3 ft. extra heavy steel French range, with one firebox, two ovens and high warming closet covering this range and the old range in the school. You may also arrange for the work of installing and connecting the new range and for any plumbing required.\n\nIt is noted that the total cost of supplying the range, including installation, will be $360. After it has been installed to your satisfaction, please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is desired that this account reach the Department before our books close for the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st next, in order that payment can be made from the current year's Appropriation. The purchase and installation of the range should, therefore, receive early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nK-S-2.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, file 154-0-6, regarding an estimate in connection with the supplying of Kamloops Indian Residential School with additional cooking accommodation.\n\nIn reply I beg to advise that from Messrs. Marlatt & MacKenzie, of Kamloops, B.C., I have been quoted a price of $335.00 delivered at the School, to cover the cost of the range required, namely, a 7 foot by 3 ft. extra heavy steel French range, with one fire box and two ovens, 2400 lbs., with high warming closet covering this range and the old range in the school, (seventeen feet in all). This cost does not cover the price of the stove pipe to connect; nor the cost of the plumbing, just till necessary when the new stove is shifted. I have been unable to obtain an estimated price of these two items of work and material from the local dealers, but would say that in this respect, the cost should not exceed $25.00, making a total of $360. in all.\n\nSince writing the Department on the 5th ultimo, I again talked the matter of this additional new range for the school over with the Rev. Principal, and he was quite satisfied with my proposal as outlined in my letter to you as referred to above.\n\nIn comparing Messrs. Marlatt & MacKenzie's bid with wholesale prices which I have obtained, I find that their price is fair, and I would recommend that if the purchase is made, it be made from them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.F. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, January 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your voucher No. 644-33 amounting to $24.89, covering the cost of repairs to the motor at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of the credit which the Department has with Pumps & Power, Limited, Vancouver, this voucher is not being paid. Previous correspondence from you indicated that the total amount to our credit with Pumps & Power, Limited, was $64.56. Deducting the amount of $24.89, leaves a balance to our credit of $39.67.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J.

When the range was installed, I think the intention was to provide for a population of only 180. The present number, with the pupils and staff, amounts to well over 300.\n\nThe present range, which was made by the Albion Iron Works, has a cooking surface of 10 x 3 feet, with one fire box and three ovens 24\"x30\", and is still good for many years of service, if lining and fire box are kept in repair.\n\nBut, in view of its being too small, as already stated, I would recommend that another cooking unit of the same make and size, but with one fire box and only two ovens be installed in addition to the present range. A new unit of this size would have a further cooking surface of 7 x 3 feet and would be sufficient to take care of the increased population since the old range was installed. In addition to this, a warmer along the full seventeen feet of both the old and new range should also be installed.\n\nIn installing the new unit the old range will have to be shifted sidewise some four feet. This will entail changes of the piping for the hot water boilers at a corresponding cost.\n\nI am having an estimate of the cost of the new range, the warmer, repairs to old range and plumbing prepared, and as soon as I have it in hand, I will forward it on to the Department with further comments.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nWJE/S\nOttawa, November 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will report whether or not a new kitchen range is being purchased for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, and, if so, if the purchase is being made by the school authorities. You should also report as to the need for this equipment, giving particulars concerning the type of range and the approximate cost. Your early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.

Marlatt & McKenzie, of Kamloops, given an opportunity of submitting a price.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 20, 1935.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMy Bushard,\n\nIn response to a phone inquiry from your office with reference to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to say that on October 26th the Acting Indian Commissioner at Victoria forwarded a letter from the Indian Agent asking for authority to purchase and install new grate bars for the large heating boilers at the School. The boilers in this school are Birkfield boilers, and it is necessary to purchase the grates for these boilers from the Vancouver Engineering Works Limited, who have the manufacturing rights. The cost of the grates will be approximately $95.00, and the Commissioner was instructed to have same installed.\n\nThere does not appear to be any correspondence on file containing a request for a kitchen range.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the grates required for the boilers at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith E.R. 1145, which is your authority for an expenditure for grates to an amount not exceeding that shown on the Encumbrance Certificate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

October 25, 1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the original of a duplicate letter addressed to the Department and sent through this office by Agent Ferguson, dated October 19th, instant, in which request is made for authority to expend the sum of $94.80 on the purchase of 24 grate bars for two boilers of Kamloops Indian Residential School. In this connection I beg to say that attention is particularly called to the 5th paragraph in which 16 bars are referred to instead of 24. This suggestion would appear to deal with a recommendation made by the boiler inspector in his report to the District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, dated August 21st, copy of which was forwarded to the Department. The following is an extract from Engineer Arnall's report:\n\n\"The firebars of both boilers are in very bad condition. One new set should be obtained as soon as possible, which will cost about $65.00. The best of the bars of the boilers can then be made into a complete set, giving a complete new set for one boiler and a good set of old bars for the other.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances I would recommend that the sum of approximately $65.00 be authorized by Encumbrance Requisition for the purchase of these bars by Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson in accordance with the price which he has obtained and which is shown in Form No.55, which is attached to his letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnclosure\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a requisition for 24 grate bars for the boilers of Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nUpon request of the Principal, I inspected the fire boxes of the two main boilers at the School, and found that to put these grates in good working order for the winter months, 24 grate bars would be needed. There are 16 of these bars in each fire box, making a total of 32 bars in both fire boxes. Of these present bars, eight of them are in good shape, and can be used over again by setting them on the far sides of the grates. The two centre bars and the four end bars can also be used again.\n\nI might add that when in December, 1927, these grates were burnt out, complete new grate bars, end bars and centre bars were all installed.\n\nSince this replacement took place, six years ago, some improvements were made two years ago to this equipment, lowering the bottom of the man pit to 2 feet, six inches below the grates, which should, in future, lengthen the life of these bars.\n\nWhile I am recommending that the full number of 24 bars should be supplied, it is possible, should there be a shortage of funds for this purpose, for the school, to make-shift for a while, if only 16 bars are supplied, but they would be unable to keep the fires functioning with less.\n\nIn 1927, these bars were purchased from the Vulcan Iron Works. Since then, the Vancouver Engineering Works, Ltd., have taken over the manufacturing rights of Birchfield boilers, and I have had to obtain my price quotation from them, which you will note, are some 40 cents per bar higher in price than the ones formerly supplied by the Vulcan Iron Works, but in the event of the Department allowing the purchase, before ordering I will point this out to the Manufacturers before named, and get them to confirm the price quoted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J.

P. S. TENNANT,\nMedical Superintendent, Kamloops, B. C.,\naddressed to Dr. Stone, dated April 10, 1934.\n\nOrig. on 76-154.\n\nThe sewage disposal system at Kamloops Residential School is inadequate for present requirements. I believe the system was built for a maximum school population of two hundred and fifty. There are present at the school over three hundred, inclusive of the staff. This results in overworking the tank, and offensive odors as well as an unsanitary condition of the playgrounds.\n\nThe anaerobic chamber is too small and consequently the tank flushes a partially digested effluent. The disposal bed was placed three feet below ground surface as it was found that better drainage could be procured at this depth. As a result aerobic action which is necessary with a partially digested effluent is considerably slowed up. I believe that the present disposal bed would handle the effluent, provided that the anaerobic action had been complete on discharge of the tank.\n\nThe disposal bed is laid in silt. The silt runs down and readily blocks the drainage pipes necessitating relatively frequent cleaning of the bed.\n\nThe dairy drain pipe is blocked probably due to the large amount of fatty material which passes through it.\n\nI would make the following suggestions, which I believe would be the most economic in overcoming the present inefficiencies of the system at the school:\n\nThat a new anaerobic tank be installed between the present tank and the building to overflow into the present tank which discharges automatically.\n\nThat when it is next found necessary to clean the disposal bed that the joints between the tile drains be covered with a heavy tar paper to avoid silting of the pipes.\n\nThat the dairy drain pipe be cleaned and a grease trap installed to prevent the blocking of this system by fat.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA, ON HIS INSPECTION OF KAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON FEBRUARY 12th and 13th, 1934. - Report forwarded under cover of letter from C. C. Perry, Asst. Indian Commissioner, dated Mar. 13, 1934.\n\nOriginal on 154-0-6.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nElectric Light:\n\nThe Electric Light and Power are brought from the City of Kamloops. The voltage in this line is high of necessity, about 2000 volts. The wooden poles on which the wires are strung are very much worn, and might fall over at any time. Should one of these poles break off at the ground level, the place where they appear to me to be weakest, great inconvenience would certainly result. I consider that the Department would be well advised to have a survey made of this Pole Line from the school to the city of Kamloops.\n\n---\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM ASST. COMMISSIONER C. C. PERRY, forwarding Inspector Barry's Report, letter dated March 13, 1934.\n\nWith regard to the expenditures which are recommended in this report, I would refer to the Estimates of the Kamloops Indian Agency for 1934-35, in which the following items were provided for by the Indian Agent, viz.:\n\nRepairs to power line . . . . $300.\n\nIn regard to the power line serving the school, we do not appear to have any record of the arrangements under which the power line is operated but I would refer the Department to its correspondence No. 21154-12-3 and in particular departmental letter dated 10th February, 1933, addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Ferguson, in which he was requested to indicate on a blue print the approximate position of all transmission lines in the Kamloope Reserve and submit the same to the Department.\nKITCHEN: I wish to recommend that a proper floor covering be placed on the floor of the kitchen. Battleship linoleum, 40 feet by 30 feet, is required. This is an urgent matter, as the present covering is in pieces. When laid it is most necessary that the edges of the linoleum be cemented down and bound with metal. It ought to be possible to wash this floor easily with a mop to keep the kitchen in a sanitary condition.\n\nLAUNDRY: This is a poor place for children to work under the present unsatisfactory conditions. When the water is emptied from two of the washing machines and from one set of tubs, it simply covers the floor to a depth of an inch or two till it makes its way out by a drain on the other side of the room. The children working here have to wear gum boots all the time. With damp and steam, this is no fit place for children to work. I beg to recommend that a pipe be placed in the cement floor to carry into the drain the water from the two washing machines and the row of tubs.\n\nFrom the laundry the water runs into a cesspool, from which it is pumped out by an automatic pump. This is a poor system. To remedy these poor conditions, as well as those mentioned below, under the heading of Laundry, I recommend the construction of a drain from the Dairy and from the Laundry, to take off all this water. This new drain would be carried right down the hill, away from the school buildings. It would be quite easy to dig and lay, and the fall towards the river is quite sharp. The boys could do much of the work.\n\nDAIRY: The drain from the Dairy is blocked. I am informed that it never has worked well after the first six months. The Sisters have done their best to clean it out without success. This drain is smelling and should certainly be cleaned out at once. This is an urgent matter.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF G. H. BABY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE KAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON FEBRUARY 12th and 13th, 1934 - report forwarded under cover of letter from C. C. PERRY, Asst. Indian Commissioner, Mar. 13/34.\n\nOriginal on 154.-0-6.\n\nCHAPEL ROOF AND WALLS: The shingles on the chapel roof in some cases should be replaced. The rain often appears to make its way into the interior of the chapel and run down the walls, thus spoiling the plaster. When the necessary work is done on the roof, the walls inside will need to be repaired (plaster work) and kiln-dried. Looking from the ground, I believe that the water gets in under the last few rows of shingles, where they meet the metal with which the eaves are covered.\n\nDRAINAGE: The need for a drain from the laundry, in place of the present system, has been mentioned above. As the Principal reports that the Dairy is filled with flies in summer or when closed up for a time, and that the smell from this Dairy drain becomes unbearable at times, it is very necessary that something be done at once to improve conditions. New drains from the Dairy and the Laundry would solve the difficulty. About $200.00 worth of pipe is required and authority to do the work, and the boys, under supervision, can dig and lay these drains. The main cesspool is reported as too small and a source of trouble. Possibly it requires to be cleaned out. It should be examined by a qualified person.\nOffice of the KAMLOOPS Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 3rd., 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 737-33,\namounting to $384.20 in favour\nof Marlatt & MacKenzie, KAMLOOPS, B.C.\nfor French range for Kamloops Residential School\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\nLetter No. 154-0-5 dated January 25th, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| 1 - Steamboat French Range                      |          | $385.00 |\n| Closet Complete                                 |          | $48.20 |\n| Installing & Connecting                         |          | $384.20 |\n| 4 sheets iron                                   |          | $13.70 |\n| 1/2 days making pipe                            |          | $12.00 |\n| C.

G. S. Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for British Columbia, with regard to his official inspection of the Kamloops Agency, B.C.\n\nKamloops Indian Residential school.\n\nPerhaps the Department may wish to bring to the attention of the Principal or agent, the requirements as to the improvement of the sanitation in the dairy drains, the testing of fire hose, repairs of storm windows and toilets, stalls for the accommodation of cattle, and the proposed extension to the barn. No doubt some of these expenses will have to be taken care of from the per capita grant.\n\nG. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT NO.6 (Cont'd)\n\n6. SCHOOLS:\n\nKAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL: In company with the Indian Agent, I went over the school. The new Principal, Rev. Father Kennedy, seems to be doing very well, and I found everything as a whole, in very good order. There were 288 children in the school on the day of my visit, and all looked healthy and contented. The children were having meat stew, bread and vegetables for their next meal, with plenty of milk. The kitchen range, however, is totally inadequate for the requirements of the school, and I instructed the Agent to get in touch with the Department and try and get an extension. I understand that this has since been done. Heating accommodation for plates and food is also required. Why this was not originally asked for, I do not know for certain, but if I recollect rightly, for some reason, the then Principal did not want it. The kitchens were clean and tidy. The drain in the dairy does not, for some reason, seem to be working, and is most unsanitary, and smells. It seems to be hard to find out exactly where this drain actually drains out.\n\nThe chemical fire extinguishers have all been properly filled. The inside fire hose, however, wants testing. The fire alarm was rung, and all the children were out of the building in two and a half minutes, with the boys at the proper fire station, and the rolls called. This is very good. The storm windows of the building are badly in need of repair, and in some cases need re-glazing.\n\nThe dormitories and class rooms were all clean and tidy, as were the bathrooms and toilets. However, the girls' toilets downstairs are most unsatisfactory, owing to the fact that all work on a single flush system, not automatic, and it necessitates someone climbing up a ladder to start the flush each time one of the toilets is used,\u2014a waste of water,\u2014or if this is not done each time, it means an unsanitary condition with a bad smell. This should be converted to individual closet flush.\n\nThe outhouses, barns, styes, stables and cellars were all in very good shape and everything about the farm and grounds was well kept and tidy. Mr. Bann, the outside foreman, is to be congratulated.\n\nHowever, the cow barn is quite inadequate to contain the number of cows necessary to keep the school in milk and butter. Stalls for ten or twelve more cows are most necessary. This school has now got one of the finest Jersey herds in B.C.\n6. SCHOOLS: KAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL: (Cont'd)\n\nI should recommend that the Indian Agent be instructed to obtain plans and prices for possible extension and addition to the existing barn, perhaps in the form of a lean-to, or a separate barn built for horses, bulls and young stock. Possibly more of the building required beyond the cement work could be done by the boys, if material were supplied.\n\nThere seems to be a distinct improvement in the scholastic side of this school since my last inspection. The children speak up well, and seem more alert. In company with the Agent, I visited a number of the class rooms, and as far as the value of my findings goes, the following were the results of my inspection:\n\nGrades 1 and 2, boys: Sister M. Eugenia. The drawing was good though in this grade there were some rather oldish girls, and the language difficulty is still there.\n\nGrades 3 and 6, girls: Sister Mary Austin. All read very well and clearly, particularly grade 6. Spelling and writing good in grade 6, writing good in grade 3. Grade 6 good at mathematics. Drawing good all round.\n\nGrade 4 and 5, boys, Mr. Murphy. A very distinct improvement in this class. Both grades read well and distinctly. Grade 5 was very good at mathematics and grade 4 at writing.\n\nGrades 4 and 6, girls, Sister M. Austin. I heard these two grades reading only and they were very good and grade 5 had a good grasp of what they were reading about.\n\nGrade 1, boys, Sister Mary Bridget. All very well advanced with good discipline. Could read quite well and spoke up.\n\nGrades 2 and 3, boys, Mr. Murphy. Read well, spoke up, and excellent discipline.\n\nTaken in all, therefore, the principal seems to have a most excellent teaching staff.\n\nManual Training: This branch of the school work is also most excellent, though under a different instructor than at the time of my last visit. Personally, I was sorry to see the old instructor removed as he certainly brought the boys along very well. However, I understand the present man is also employed part time on other work at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nFeb. 13, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 27th, with reference to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to say that at present it is difficult to determine the amount of money that will be available for repairs, etc., to this school.\n\nIn the meantime, however, I would ask you to obtain a detailed estimate of the cost of the items included in your letter, with the exception of the cistern pool, drains, irrigation ditch, barn and land. The different items should be listed separately and in having this estimate prepared kindly consult Johnston and Company (James McGill) Kamloops or W. J.

A.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, file 184-0-5, in which I was authorized to arrange for the purchase of a range for Kamloops Indian Residential School, from Marlatt & MacKenzie, of Kamloops B.C., at an estimated cost of $360.00 installed.\n\nIn this respect I beg to advise that upon going into the matter of installation with the heating engineer employed by Messrs. Marlatt & MacKenzie, it was found that with the additional draft that would be required for the proper functioning of both ranges, the opening into the chimney would have to be enlarged, and to convey the smoke from both pipes into the chimney so that there would be no blocking of the smoke at the connecting point a bricken will have to be installed. Besides this there will be more 10 and 12 inch stove pipe required than was figured on in my estimate for the installation.\n\nIt will therefore be necessary to increase the expenditure by $25.00, making a total of $385.00 instead of $360.00 authorized, and before placing the order and proceeding with the installation I would be obliged if I be authorized to make this increased expenditure.\n\nThe estimate on installation of range at the School by Marlatt & MacKenzie is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| 4 sheets                     | $13.70 |\n| 1\u00bd days making pipe         | $12.00 |\n| C.

Fraser, M.P., relative to the request for the erection of a new barn at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would say that a communication was received today from the local Indian Agent, Mr. W. J. Ferguson, regarding the need for more barn space to provide accommodation for the cows.\n\nThe barn now being used can accommodate 22 cows. At the present time, the school is sheltering some of the cattle in the implement shed, and it was found necessary to sell a number of good cows, which were needed for the milk supply at the school, as there was no place to keep them during the winter. The Agent states while it is true that the school requires more accommodation in this respect \u2014 to double their present barn capacity, it would require a new barn as large as the present one. He recommends the erection of a lean-to on the east side of the present barn along its full length, with one row of stalls, and a re-arrangement of the bull pens in the present building into stalls for the cows and either arranging other accommodation for the bulls or erecting a small building apart from the cow barns for them.\n\nNo estimate of the cost of the work recommended by the Agent has been given. He has suggested that he obtain the services of a local builder to prepare an estimate and plans for the work. I may say that we have no funds available in the current year's Appropriation to cover the cost of any additional barn accommodation, nor has there been any amount for the purpose included in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe last return received shows the following stock at the school:\n\n12 Pure bred Jersey cows, 1 pure bred Holstein cow,\n4 Grade Jersey \" 5 Grade Holstein cows,\n8 pure bred Jersey calves, 2 pure bred Jersey bulls,\n1 Grade Holstein Heifer\n7 horses\n1 colt.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1934.\n\nMr. H.W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nInformation has reached me that the Kamloops Industrial School for Indian children had made requisition to your Department for the erection of a new barn.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would advise me if this requisition has reached you and if so, may I ask whether or not the Department proposes to provide funds to proceed with the construction of this barn.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAF: DW\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with a request from the Rev. Principal of Kamloops Indian Residential School, for certain improvements in respect to this school in general, I beg to submit my report as follows:\n\nWhile from previous correspondence with the Department, I have arrived at the conclusion that the Department has very little funds available at the present time for expenditure in this connection, it is thought as well to report on this request so that some provision may be made from the appropriation for next fiscal year, to take care of the improvements deemed necessary. While it was not included in my estimates for next year an amount large enough to cover the whole expenditure for all the improvements required, the following amounts have been included for improvements and maintenance:\n\n| Item                          | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Repairs building and maintenance | $500.00  |\n| Repairs machinery             | $100.00  |\n| Repairs Transmission line     | $300.00  |\n\nIn dealing with the individual improvements applied for, I will report them in order of importance, quoting the request of the school authorities, followed by my comments in each respect.\n\n1. \"Poles: The electric poles are in a very dangerous state and should be replaced. Should any of them fall it might mean a great loss and at least great inconvenience.\"\n\nElectrical transmission line from south Thompson River to school. These repairs were reported on by me to the Department under date of April 27th, 1933. Estimated cost at that time for allotting of funds $275.00. Owing to further deterioration during the lapse of time $75.00 should be included in this estimate making a total cost of $350.00.\n\n2. \"Chapel Roof and Walls: Shingles should be repaired and painted. The rain goes through the roof and runs down the chapel walls. The plaster is giving way. The walls are dirty and should be repainted.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe shingles on this roof have lifted in several places, which allows the rain to leak through and run down the Chapel walls. If this condition is allowed to exist, more shingles will be loosened by the wind, and the result is bound to be more damage. I would suggest that I be given permission to have a practical builder examine the walls and prepare an estimate.\n\nIt is also necessary that some maintenance work be done to the roof of the main building in the way of painting and repairs to the shingles. In my estimate for this year I included a sum of $500.00 for this purpose, and this could be estimated on at the same time as the Chapel roof.\n\nOwing to faulty materials and workmanship by the contractors, the mortar between the bricks in the Boys Building (new wing) is weathering and falling out, making the building drafty. This could also be examined at the same time, and an estimate prepared. All these estimates to be submitted to the Department with a further report.\n\n\"Cess Pool: The main cess pool is too small and is always a source of trouble.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, when Rev. Father John Duplanil was in charge at the school, considerable trouble was experienced with this cess pool, which, as you know, led to investigation being made by the Dominion Water Power Engineers and to considerable correspondence with the Department. The last word I have on file here in this respect, is under date of your letter of March 30th last, in which the Department referred to a report of the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, and also to the cost of the necessary repairs, in the amount of $4,000.00, and informed me that they were requesting the Dominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau to give the matter further consideration with a view to ascertaining if temporary measures could be taken to improve the sewage system at a considerably less cost than the amount mentioned. Since then I have had no further word on the matter.\n\nHowever, during the past summer, and up until the present, by giving the tank a thorough cleaning and flushing through the outlet valve at the base of the tank, while not functioning to the degree that is required, has been handling the sewage as well as can be expected; in fact, is working much better than was expected following the trouble we had with this system a year ago. The main trouble now, as in the past, is the disposal of the fluid that is delivered from the tank and the sludge when the beds are flushed out every few months. Without doubt, the tiles in the disposal beds have become clogged to some extent, due to improper functioning of the tank, and chiefly a result of the time that the siphon valve was out of order previous to a year ago.\nAt the present time the surplus fluid that cannot be disposed of in the beds, and the sludge when the tank is cleaned, passes down through a pipe which empties some 300 feet below the tank on to the open ground; and I would suggest that a basin be erected at the point, either of concrete or timber, to catch the solids and liquids. The installation of this basin can be considered as permanent works, as it will always be required to catch the sludge from the tanks when they are cleaned out, which, as far as I can see would still be required every so often, possibly only once a year, even though the tank was enlarged and the disposal beds improved.\n\nThe solids caught in the basin could be used for fertilizer, as well as improving the sanitary condition at this point. If this work could be done, I think that the enlarging of the tank and the improvement of the disposal beds can be left in abeyance for the time being, or until further funds are more easily obtained. However, before anything is done, I would prefer that the engineers of the Dominion Water Power & Reclamation Service be consulted and their opinion obtained on the matter.\n\n\"Drains. The drain in the dairy floor has no outlet and never gave satisfaction. The dairy is filled with flies in summer and when closed the odor becomes unbearable. It is impossible to keep it fresh and clean.\n\nThe drain from the laundry floor leads into a reservoir which is emptied by an automatic pump. It would be much more satisfactory if this drain were connected to a drain from the dairy into a cess-pool. At the same time more openings should be made in the laundry floor so that the children working there would not have to stand in running water all day.\"\n\nThe condition existing in this respect in the dairy is, without doubt, unsanitary, and the cost to rectify the trouble would not amount to a great deal. The work would consist of digging a trench in which to lay a drain pipe deep enough to be below frost, a distance of 250 feet, the digging of a pit, say 8' x 8' in the ground and cribbing it with logs, and I would suggest that this matter be referred to the Engineer of the Water Power Branch for a report and plans.\n\n\"Irrigation Ditch. It is gradually cutting its way through the soil. It should have a layer of gravel and concrete. The cost has been stated to be about $1000.00.\"\n\nI am of the opinion that the School can overcome their trouble in this respect without lining their present ditch with concrete by extending their present delivery pipe from the pump to an elevation of from 10 to 20 feet above the present outlet, and by digging an entirely new main ditch, well above the old ditch, to irrigate their land east of the school, where they are having their present trouble.\nBy doing this, they would somewhat increase their cultivable acreage, and I would recommend that the Department refer the matter to the Dominion Water Power Branch for a report.\n\n6. \"Barn. The present barn is built for only twenty-two cows. In order to have a sufficient supply during the whole year for the large number of children we have here, we should have from thirty-five to forty milch cows. We are sheltering some of our cattle in the implement shed, and we find ourselves forced to sell good cows which are greatly needed in a school of this size. We must sell them now while the price is low, as we have no place to keep them during the winter.\"\n\nWhile it is quite true that the school requires more accommodation in this respect, and to double their present barn capacity, it would require a new barn as large as the present one, and which would involve a larger expenditure at this time than the Department would be prepared to authorize. My suggestion therefore, in this respect, would be to build a lean-to on the east side of the present barn along its full length, with one row of stalls, and to rearrange the bull pens in the present barn into stalls for the cows, and either arrange other accommodation for the bulls, or build a small building apart from the cow barns for them. If the Department is prepared to assist the school in this connection, I would suggest that I be instructed to have a local builder prepare an estimate and plans for this work for your further consideration.\n\n7. \"Land. For a school of this size we should have more land. That part on the reserve to the west of us, now rented to Chinamen would be of no value were it not for the fact that it is being irrigated from the school. Were we to stop irrigation it would be of no value. Did it belong to the school we would be able to make good use of it as our system of irrigation brings the water on this land.\"\n\nIn this respect, if my suggested improvement to the irrigation system is carried out as contained in this report, the area that can be cultivated will be somewhat increased, and I would advise that this be left in abeyance for the present, or until such time as we have a report from the Engineers on the improvement to the irrigation system.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J.

I shall be pleased to have this information at an early date, in order that, when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, consideration can be given to providing funds for the purpose of installing a new boiler.\n\nBoiler No. 43710 - Found in good condition. The Engineer recommends that the water gauge be raised 1-1/2 inches, to give the tubes more coverage of water. The main stop valve is leaking quite badly and should be made tight. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nBoiler No. 43711 - Found in very good condition. The Engineer states the steam gauge is 2 lbs. light and also that the fusible plug must be renewed and that the same feed water treatment must be continued.\n\nPlease draw the recommendations of the Engineer to the attention of the Principal, and he should arrange to see that they are carried out. The Department understands that the certificates of inspection of these boilers have been forwarded to the Principal. He should see that they are posted up in a prominent place in the boiler room at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nPublic Building,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nAugust 29th, 1934.\n\nC.F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDist. Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers & Machinery,\nIndian Residential School,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nBoiler No. 43794.\n\nOn July 12th, 1934, I made a careful internal and external inspection of this boiler and found it in a poor condition.\n\nThis boiler has been reported upon before. I could not complete the Hydrostatic test on account of the tubes leaking on the top tube plate. There were also some rivets leaking on the firebox seam.\n\nI have reported before that this boiler is much too small and is forced almost beyond its capacity, and after this season must be replaced with a new one as its present condition is such that next year the allowable pressure will be so low that it will be useless for Laundry purposes and will not warrant any expenditure for repairs.\n\nWhen a new boiler is installed, I would recommend one of a submerged tube type.\n\nThe Safety Valve works freely by hand. I have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 75 lbs. and condition poor.\n\nBoiler No. 43710.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found it in very good condition.\n\nThe water gauge must be raised 1-1/2 inches higher up to give the tubes more coverage of water. The main stop valve is leaking quite badly and must be made tight.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic test of 40 lbs. and found the boiler quite tight. I set the Safety Valves to blow off at 15 lbs. water pressure. The fusible plug must be renewed. The steam gauge is fairly correct.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\nBoiler No. 43711.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar inspection and found it in a very good condition.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 40 lbs. and found it perfectly tight.\n\nI set the Safety Valve to blow off at 15 lbs. water pressure. The Steam Gauge is 2 lbs. light.\n\nThe brick bridges on both of these boilers has been repaired and is in good condition. The fusible plug must be renewed.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nThe same feed water treatment must be continued.\n\nMy attention was again drawn to the amount of fuel used and as before reported, the only way to reduce it is to install automatic underfeed coal stokers, which, in this particular plant, will make quite a large saving as a much lower and cheaper grade of coal can be used.\n\nAuxiliary Machinery.\n\nThe auxiliary machinery is in good condition and is well kept.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nF.J. Amall.\n\nEngineer.\n\nTJA/IM\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\nKamloops, B.C.,\nOctober 11, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, file 154-0-5, regarding an estimate for the next fiscal year on a new boiler for the laundry for Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that I have had the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Co., examine the present equipment in this respect at the school, and they have prepared an estimate as follows:\n\nTo supplying and installing new 20 H.P. Vertical Tubular Boiler, 150 lb working pressure, diameter 38\", height overall 9' 3\", complete with all fittings and fixtures to comply with local inspection, 1\" Pembury Injector (upgraded), self-ginding globe valves and check valves; also removing and rebuilding brick wall, complete with transportation, cartage, and all materials and labour for........$1,275.00\n\nBesides the replacement of the boiler the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., engineer recommends that owing to the higher pressure of a new boiler that a new main should be installed to be slightly larger, and with extra heavy pipe and fittings and with extra heavy valves controlling each opening from the main, also installation of new coils in the drying machine. For this equipment, they estimate $225.00 in addition to the $1,275.00, a total of $1,500.00 for the two jobs.\n\nIn regard to Boiler No. 43794, I have, in company with the Public Works Engineer, when he was here on his visit, examined this boiler and agree with the engineer that it should be replaced with a new one, and also that this replacement should be made within the next six months.\n\nIn regard to the other equipment recommended by the Heating Company engineer and covered by the estimate of $225.00, I have not had time to check up on this, but am of the opinion that it would be as well to give this consideration in the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nIn the meantime, or before requisition is made for this expenditure, I will obtain from the Public Works Engineer on his next visit to the school, his opinion on the necessity of this expenditure and advise you in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\nOctober 15, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th September with reference to the repairs required to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, and I wish to compliment you on the very careful way in which you have submitted your estimates for the repairs required.\n\nFor the present you are authorised to have the repairs made to the roof of the main building and chapel, which it is noted will cost $286.29.\n\nThe balance of the repairs will be left over until the Architect of the Department has had an opportunity to inspect the School. This inspection will be made sometime this fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of February 13th last, file 154-6-5, in regard to repairs to Kamloops Indian Residential School, I am enclosing herewith an itemized list of repairs required, which I have prepared from an estimate submitted by James A. Gill of Johnston & Co.\n\nYou will please note that I have, for reference, listed these repairs under separate headings and numbered them accordingly.\n\nIn regards to expenditures in this respect, I beg to make the following recommendations:\n\nNo.1. Main Building and Chapel: All the repairs under this heading should be carried out as soon as possible, and completed before winter sets in, at a total cost of $286.29. These repairs are very necessary on account of the leaky roof, from which there is bound to be further damage to the interior, as soon as any amount of wet weather sets in.\n\nNo.2. Dairy and Laundry: Item: Sterilizing room floor with cement slab, etc. ...........................................$52.40. The present floor in the sterilizing room of the dairy is of concrete, but was laid much too level, and does not allow the water or other liquids to drain away freely, and due to this it is proposed to lay a concrete slab over the present floor, with a good slope towards the sink hole, so that the floor can be easily scrubbed, and kept clean and free of moisture and filth.\n\nItem: Drain from laundry and sterilizing room etc. ....$90.00. The purpose of this drain is to carry the liquids from the sterilizing room, which at present has no hole other than the hole through the concrete in the earth below, which of course, does not allow the liquids to get away, and is always running over and flooding the floor. This same drain would also be connected up so as to drain the floor of the laundry which at present is covered with from one to two inches of water on wash days. At present the water is delivered from the laundry to a drain system from the kitchen by an automatic pump, and with this system it is impossible to keep the floor dry, but with this proposed drainage by gravity, the difficulty now encountered should be overcome.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nThe Secretary.\n\nSeptember 29th, 1934.\n\nItem: Laundry floor to have drain or gutters to outlet, with grating over........................................... 48.00\n\nIf the drain from the sterilizing room of the dairy and laundry is installed, it will be necessary to cut gutters into the present concrete floor of the laundry so as to drain all liquids to the outlet. The cost in respect to these three items totals $190.40, and I would recommend that the expenditure be made.\n\nI should say that while in your letter of Febry. 13th last, I was not instructed to submit an estimate on drains, I am fully confident that Mr. James A. Gill is fully competent in regard to the carrying out of this work, also that satisfactory works will be installed and that it will not be necessary to refer these works to the Dominion Water Power Engineers for their opinion.\n\nThe painting of the lockers could wait for the present, or until funds are more readily obtained.\n\nWest Wing, Boys' Side: This wing of the school is certainly in need of a general overhaul and re-decorating, but for the present the most necessary are:\n\nPatching of plaster............35.00\nRepairs soap-trap washroom,\nConcrete step shower bath and repair 9 doors lavatory.......$17.00 $52.00\n\nBesides this, the lavatories, washroom and bathrooms should receive some attention with paint and lacquering........73.00 $73.00 $125.00\n\nThe balance of the repairs estimated should be carried out within the next fiscal year.\n\n4. Main Building: All repairs to the linoleum, as estimated, should be carried out. If not, in its present loose condition, and with water getting under the loose edges and worn out spots, in a year or so, new linoleum will be required for both these floors, but with these proposed repairs, it should be serviceable for several years. The cost is $61.00.\n\nThe re-decorating of the dining room could wait for another year.\n\n5. Boiler Room: As in the case of the sterilizing room, no consideration was given at the time of construction of this room to connect installation of works for the proper drainage of this room, and in consequence, whenever the boilers are drained, the floor is a mess for days after.\n\nT.S. Arnell, engineer of the Department of Public Works, after inspection of the boilers at the school, in his report of August 31st, 1933, states: \"Attention should be given to the drains under the boiler room floor; as from appearances, when they were laid they were only carried to the wall of the building and allowed to seep through the soil, which has now become clogged. If they were carried to the nearest surface drain about 100 feet good drainage would be obtained. This should not cost over $150.00, and then the boiler room floor could be kept dry, as at present water will stay for days, which is very injurious to the plant.\"\nIn regard to Mr. Arnell's report, I am sure that he is wrong in that the surface drain could be used to carry away the liquids in this respect, as the floor of the boiler room is much too low for this, and the only practical drain that can be installed at a moderate cost is the drain pipe to a sump pit as estimated on by Mr. Gill, at a cost of $69.10.\n\nEast Wing (Girls): This wing is in a much better state of repair than the west wing or boys' wing, and at this time, I would only recommend that minor repairs be carried out, such as repairs to radiators and the lavatory doors, at a cost of $25.00. The balance of the repairs to be given consideration at some future date.\n\n7. Barn: These repairs could wait until consideration is given to this school for additional stable room for their dairy stock. A report in this respect will follow for consideration in the next fiscal year.\n\nSUMMARY OF REPAIRS: JAMES A.

Barn: Ventilators; 6 require replacing .................... $12.00\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo, file 154-0-5, regarding an estimate for the next fiscal year on a new boiler for the laundry for Kamloops Indian Residential School, I beg to advise that I have had the Kamloops Plumbing and Heating Co., examine the present equipment in this respect at the School, and they have prepared an estimate as follows:\n\nTo supplying and installing new 20 H.P. Vertical Tubular Boiler, 125# Working pressure; diameter 38\", height overall 9' 3\", complete with all fittings and fixtures to comply with B.C. Inspection, 1\" Turborty Injector (bypassed), self grinding globe valves and check valves; also removing and rebuilding brick wall, complete with transportation, cartage, and all materials and labour for........$1,275.00\n\nBesides the replacement of the boiler the Kamloops Plumbing & Heating Co., engineer recommends that owing to the higher pressure of a new boiler that a new main should be installed to be slightly larger and with extra heavy pipe and fittings and with extra heavy valves controlling each opening from the main also installation of new coils in the drainage machine. For this equipment, they estimate $225.00 in addition to the $1,275.00, a total of $1,500.00 for the two jobs.\n\nIn regard to Boiler No. 43794, I have, in company with the Public Works Engineer, when he was here on his visit, examined this boiler and agree with the engineer that it should be replaced with a new one, and also that this replacement should be made within the next six months.\n\nIn regard to the other equipment recommended by the Heating Company engineer and covered by the estimate of $225.00, I have not had time to check up on this, but am of the opinion that it would be as well to give this consideration in the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nIn the meantime, or before requisition is made for this expenditure, I will obtain from the Public Works Engineer on his next visit to the school, his opinion on the necessity of this expenditure and advise you in the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\nOttawa, October 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of supplying and installing a new boiler for the laundry at the Kamloops Indian Residential School.

I wish to say that I have discussed the matter several times with the school staff. I might also say for your information that Mr. Bann, who was the dairy and farm foreman at the time we came here, at the end of March, due to some disagreement with the staff and principal, resigned from his position. That, at the time somewhat matters at the school, and since, cause for the delay in my reply. I regretted very much to see Mr. Bann leave the position, as he was much interested in his work, and the care of the herd of milk cows under his charge.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal, in which he outlines certain suggestions for your consideration, which to me all appear to be reasonable, and on them, I will comment as follows:\n\nWALLS: The solution to give them more sunlight would be to carry out the construction of the full number of windows on the front and east side in accordance with the tracing submitted by Mr. Bann. I have marked these in with red on the blue print, returned under separate cover. And on the west side a window between every second studding, as per your plans. In regards to ventilation, I am responding with the blue print, a grading which I think carries out a very good idea in this respect. The windows to open in with shields on top.\n\nDOORS: Due to the high winds here, swinging doors do not stand up, and have always proven unsatisfactory, and sliding doors of the right type would be preferable.\n\nSTALLS: This question of shorter stalls comes from the new dairy man at the school, and possibly he is right, but I do not see where just a couple of inches would make much difference, and the length of 4' 10\", shown in your plan should suit the purpose.\n\nPASSAGEWAY: Passage way to the old barn should be walled in with roof over.\n\nIf you will compare your plan of the proposed new barn with the plan of the old barn, you will get the principal idea of placing the passage way in alignment.\n\nCont. Page 2.\nDAIRY: Owing to local dairy regulations it will be necessary to place this building fifty feet distant from the barn. This building would have to be erected on the east side, and there should be a walled-in covered passage way connecting it with the proposed barn. Size of dairy, 12' x 14'.\n\nBoth the principal and myself are of the opinion that while the calf pen could do with more sunlight, its location, as you have it in the north end of your plan, would be more convenient all round, than to have it in front or south end.\n\nIn regards to the ladder to the loft. I think that if it can be worked into the plan, a stairway would be more convenient, and possibly prevent accidents of children falling from the ladder.\n\nI do not know of anything else at this time that I can comment on. However, should you require any further information in this respect, I will be pleased to do my best in obtaining it for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nWJ/BC\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect for the Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. W.J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was delighted to receive the plans for the new cow barn for our school. Our herd which now numbers near fifty head of Jerseys will need this barn very badly this coming fall. In fact, as you undoubtedly know, we had to shelter our young stock in a makeshift arrangement of stalls in the implement shed last winter. Quite a number of these will freshen during the next six months and we will have to have some place to put them.\n\nOur farm help have made the following suggestions which I wish you would submit to Mr. Orr for his consideration.\n\n**WINDOWS**\nPrefer larger or additional windows on both sides and front of building to afford more sunlight.\n\n**DOORS**\nPrefer sliding on account of the high winds here.\n\n**STALLS**\nOur herd is all Jersey cows which require a stall 4'6\" or 4'8\" and we therefore ask that the stalls be 4'8\" in length on the west side and 4'6\" on the east side. The stalls in our present barn are 5'2\" on one side and 4'6\" on the other. The latter would take care of any cows that are particularly big.\n\n**COVERED PASSAGEWAY**\nAs no provision seem to have been made for grain feed and as there is no way of getting our grain supply into the loft of the new barn it would seem necessary to have a covered passageway between the two barns. This passageway...\ncould be built so as to connect the cross walks of both barns. Assuming that the front of the new barn will be built in alignment with the old one we wish to bring to your attention that the cross walk in the old barn is 35' (inside measurement) back from the front entrance. There are eleven stanchions between the front and the cross walk. They are the standard 3'6\" in width. We therefore suggest that you ask Mr. Orr to consider placing the cross walk in the new barn in alignment with the one in the present one. This will give a straight run through from one barn to the other. As there is a driveway into the loft of the old barn all grain feed could be mixed there and the necessary amount could be run through in the covered passageway that we suggest.\n\nThe plans have been given very careful consideration and while we would like the abovementioned changes carried out our need for a new barn is so great that we would not like these changes to hold up the construction.\n\nOwing to the fact that we have no dairy at the present time and as it is absolutely necessary to have one for a school of this size, we suggest that a dairy be built 12' x 14' about fifty feet east of the new barn. This could be built in line with the cross walks and connected with a covered passageway.\n\nI wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank you for your efforts in connection with this matter and trust that it will not be long before we receive word that the Department is going ahead with the barn.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nRev. Thos. M. Kennedy, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nTMK/PWM.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, in duplicate, the report of Inspector Pagnell on his inspection of the Kamloops Agency, B.C.\n\nSCHOOL\n\nAs matters affecting schools are administered at Ottawa there does not seem to be any need for me to add anything to the Inspector's report.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n7. SCHOOLS: KAMLOOPS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL: In company with the Indian Agent I inspected the above residential school, and made a longer and more thorough inspection than I have done of this school for a considerable time. I gave no notice of my visit to the school. There were 289 children in the school at the date of my visit, the 5th of March. I found the building thoroughly clean and tidy, and all the dormitories and lavatories, etc., in perfect order.\n\nThe defects in the building itself, such as the falling out of the pointing and mortar in the brick work on the boys wing outside, and also structural troubles, the Agent informs me were shown to Mr. Orr during his visit. I understand too, from the Agent that the laundry is to be improved and altered. I, however, have to point out that since Mr. Orr visited, the floor in the kitchen has been sinking, directly under the stoves, and I should think that this is due to the heavy weights in the way of big boilers, etc., that have to be used to cook the meals on the stoves. Cooking for such a large number, roughly 325 or perhaps more, means large quantities of heavy food. Undoubtedly this floor will have to be strengthened and levelled. There is a possibility in my mind that some leakage from the drains, that I understand pass under this floor, may have weakened the ground under the foundation. An extra unit in the kitchen range had to be installed and already reported, but the cooks inform me that they are having difficulty in getting a good draft in the ranges. This may be due to the fact that the kitchen chimney has not sufficient diameter to carry the extra draft required. However, Indian Agent Ferguson is having the matter looked into. I am of the opinion, too, that something will have to be done shortly to take care of the overflow from the school cesspit. I may be wrong, but it seems to me to be tempting providence to have this overflow come out in the open during the summer time when the flies and mosquitoes are around. I have an idea that the Dominion Water Board have this in hand, but what exactly is proposed I do not know. I found the fire apparatus and fire escapes all in good order and in their correct positions, and the agent informs me that he conducted the test alarm not long ago, which was quite in order.\n\nDuring the date of my visit the children were having the following meals: mid-day, potatoes, meat and dumplings; supper, meat broth, potatoes and bread; breakfast, honey and bread with plenty of milk for all. I think the meals are quite satisfactory at the school and the children are all looking healthy and well fed. I understand, too, that there has been very little sickness.\n\nI found all the class rooms clean and tidy and in good order. I visited all the grades and heard and examined the children in their work.\n\nPrimary 1B, boys, under J. Schuber. The discipline in this class was good. Their writing was good and their answers to questions intelligent. This class shows a big improvement.\n\nCont.\nMarch 8th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary.\n\nGrades 2A and B, boys, under J. Schuber. During my visit to this class room the boys were doing exercises in connection with the monitory system. They seemed quite good and quick at it. The discipline of the class was good, but when reading they did not speak up quite so well as they might. However, Mr. Schuber seems to be a very good teacher.\n\nGrades 4, 5, 6, boys, under D. Murphy. When I went into the class room, the boys were doing exercises picking out nouns, adverbs and adjectives from the narrative. The reading of this class was particularly good, very plain to understand and all the boys were able to answer intelligently about what they were reading. There is particularly a great improvement in this class.\n\nGrades 3, boys, under D. Murphy. The way the boys of this grade did their mathematical exercises before me was a credit to the teacher. They also read well and intelligently. A great improvement is very noticeable in the classes for boys in this school. They used to be quite a bit behind the girls grade for grade and the improvement is most noticeable, and credit is due to both the men teachers.\n\nI have to report on the boys side of the school too, that Mr. Holmes, whom I reported on very well in my last report, has been transferred to the Kamloops School. He is giving the boys physical training, and instructing them in football and games. About 20 of the boys gave me a demonstration of gymnastics with the vaulting horse, under his charge and it was exceedingly well done. This training in games under proper discipline has undoubtedly helped a lot to pull the boys side of the school together and credit is due to Mr. Holmes in the matter, besides the good sense of the principal in obtaining such a man. The general tenor all around on the boys side has been greatly raised. I also examined the manual training classes in wood work and boot mending.\n\nGrades 1B and 1C, girls under Sister Mary Elaine. These children sing very well and pronounce their words well in reading. The discipline in this class is excellent.\n\nGrades LA and 2, girls under Sister Mary Austin. Grade 2 was particularly good at reading and both grades seemed well ahead for their ages; in fact grade 2 might almost be called grade 3. They were very fair at their mathematical exercises which they demonstrated to me, though somewhat nervous.\n\nGrades 5, 6, 7, girls, under Sister Mary Austin. These children gave me a demonstration of physical drill with song, which was very well done. The majority were very good at their reading and intelligent about what they were reading. They spoke up very plainly. The mathematical work as a whole was good as was their writing.\n\nYou will notice there are a few girls in Grade 7 and I hope to see the same later on on the boys side.\n\nThe school choir also gave me a demonstration of singing. They are taking part for the first time this year in the Musical Festival in Kamloops and stand a very\n\nCont.\nMarch 8th, 1935.\n\ngood chance of coming out well in the competition. I think that the idea of their taking part was well thought of on the principal's part. It will give the public some idea of what is being done at the schools, and help bring the Indians out of themselves. Whilst not bad before it is very noticeable that the whole spirit of the school has been raised. This school spirit has been fostered by the principal, Rev. T. Kennedy, and the children now have school colours, and all seem very contented and happy. I can only say that great credit is due to the principal of this noticeable improvement in the school. I could find no fault at all in the school, despite the fact that my visit was a surprise one.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG. S.

C.\nOttawa, March 5, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 10th December with regard to the proposed new barn for the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I have prepared a rough sketch showing plan of a building with the accommodation which I think would meet the requirements.\n\nSince making this plan, however, it has occurred to me that it might be better to reverse the location of the calf pen so that it would come on the south end of the building instead of the north end.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nMarch 6, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. O R R,\n\nThe following are the items included in our Estimates for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year - 1935-36 - for the Kamloops Indian Residential School:\n\nPaint and materials, decorating interior, main building - $500.\nMinor repairs, outside brickwork, and pointing stone work - 250.\nMinor repairs, interior, main building - 150.\nNew drain from boiler room - 150.\nProvide extractor, washer, and drying tumbler - 2,500.\nAlterations to laundry room - 200.\nInstalling single type flush toilets for girls - 900.\nTo erect a new dairy barn - 4,000.\n\n$8,650.\nKamloops, B.C.\nFebruary 27th, 1935.\n\nG-S-2\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regards to my letter of Dec. 10th. last in connection with the proposed improvements for the Kamloops Residential School.\n\nIn this respect I would say that the school are inquiring whether I have had any word as to the possibility of any work being carried out before the end of the fiscal year.\n\nIn regards to the proposed cowbarn. If funds are available, work could be started on this at any time. The frost is out of the ground and the teams at the school are idle now, while in another six weeks they will be busy with spring farm work.\n\nI would be obliged if you would please advise me in this connection and if nothing can be done before March 31st., will it be probable that funds will be available early in the next fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J. Ferguson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nWJF/BC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nK-S-10\n\nOttawa, March 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th ultimo, regarding the request of the Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, that the Department purchase a new motor truck, to replace the one purchased for the use of the school in 1929.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is not prepared to consider the supplying of a new truck. However, should the Principal make the purchase, himself, from school funds, the Department will agree to the trade in of the old truck, for which it is noted that an allowance of $250 will be made.\n\nRegarding the question of registration of the new truck, I have to say that, as the truck will not be the property of the Department and as the license will be carried in the name of the school, it is considered that the Principal will have to pay the Provincial Authorities the regular license fees. The Department will be unable to grant a certificate that the new truck is government-owned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\nK-S-10.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School has approached me with the matter of a new truck for the school. Their present one, a Chevrolet Model 1929 has become unfit for further economical service.\n\nIt appears that this truck purchased in 1929 was supplied to the school by the Department, and in view of this the Principal feels that the Department should assume the responsibility of making the required replacement.\n\nThere is no doubt that the school needs a new truck, for to put it in shape for the coming season would cost some $300.00, but in view of the grant received by the school, I do not think they should expect this additional assistance. However, as it is possible that the request might be given consideration, I am enclosing herewith a tender prepared by the Kamloops Motors covering a new truck.\n\nShould the Department not give this matter consideration, and the school make the purchase themselves there is the question of the trade-in allowance of $250.00 for the old truck and I should have authority to grant this permission to trade in this old truck.\n\nThere is also the question of registration with the Provincial authorities. At present the truck is registered in the name of the Department at the minimum fee of $2.00 per year for licence. If the school made the purchase themselves the registration would have to be carried in their name and if so, could the truck still be considered as being in Dom. Government service and be licenced at the minimum rate. You might please advise me on this point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.J.

Besides this, there is also included three maternity pens and a bull pen, and I am of the opinion that should there be any question of insufficient funds to complete the structure in accordance with the plans, the number of stalls may be somewhat reduced say to 22 or 24, and the pens cut to three. This would still give sufficient room to stable enough cows to supply all the milk required by the present population of the school as 50 cows of the superior type that they have should produce between 175 to 225 gallons of milk a day, which would allow for the 300 population, over two quarts per capita daily.\n\nMr. Ban has informed me that it will cost far more, owing to the extra excavation work and the making of a fill to a height of 7' 5\" if the building is erected with the side facing the south and now proposes that it be laid our paralleling the present barn as shown in the block plan of the sketch. He also claims that everything will be handier for the delivery of feed and the carrying away of manure and liquids. I think he is right in this as it does appear more convenient after looking over the plan although there will be some loss of sunlight. This would only affect the building during the winter months, when as a rule it is generally cloudy here; during the most of the spring and fall months and all summer, a good share of sunlight would reach the interior.\n\nThe plan does not show any building for the dairy, which in my opinion I consider most important in view of the unsanitary cubby hole they are using at present. The dairy, which should be of about 16'x20' floor dimension should be built on the east side of the new barn.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDrains: The drains for both buildings should be to the rear, that is, the north end, instead of as at present, with this drainage out in the front yard, which would place it near the new dairy under the proposed plan. In the rear there is more fall, and it could also be run into the manure pile and increase its value as fertilizer. I have had a talk with Mr. Bann over this, and in making the repairs to the drain in the old barn as talked over with you when you were out here, he has decided to change the grade so as the flow will be to the rear instead of to the front. The cost will not exceed the $25.00 allowed.\n\nIn regards to the construction work, the school is prepared to do all the excavating and the boys at the school can assist with the concrete, and construction work up to the first eight feet. The Reverend Principal does not care to have them work above the ground any higher than this during the process of framing the building owing to the possibility of accidents, but they could assist with the laying of the roof.\n\nAfter you have looked over the plan and if there should be any points on which I can give further information I would be pleased to hear from you.\n\nMr. Bann has expressed the wish that after you are through with the plan he would be obliged if you would return it to him.\n\nTrusting that the Department will soon have funds available with which to assist this school with this much needed improvements, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J. Ferguson)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 13, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, enclosing voucher in favour of Johnston & Co., Kamloops, for $256.28, I beg to say that it has been found necessary to return this voucher for further information.\n\nYou should have Johnston & Co. prepare a detailed account showing the manner in which the amount of $256.28 is arrived at. This detailed account should be attached to the voucher and returned for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J. Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nNovember 30th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 462-34 and 463-34, amounting to $286.28 and $38.63 respectively, in favour of Messrs. Johnston & Co., Kamloops, B.C., for repairs and extras in connection with main building at Kamloops Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental letter No. 154-0-5, dated October 15th, 1934, and Mr. Orr's verbal instructions of November 16th, 1934, for item of $16.00 for painting cornice.\n\nIn regards to the items in Voucher No. 463-34, besides that of $16.00 for painting the cornice, I beg to report as follows: This work was carried out without any instructions from me. The work, however, was of an emergent nature. It appears that before painting the cornice around the kitchen and sterilizing rooms, the sewers were cleaned out and the drain pipe from the roof to the sump pit, which had worked apart, was connected up. Following this there was a heavy rain and the sump pit which apparently had been clogged previously, would not run the water away, causing it to flood over the flat roof of this part of the building. The roof was found defective and the water flooded into the rooms below. During the afternoon of the 20th, the School authority called me over to look over the situation. The repairs were under way at the time and were about completed with the exception of the cribbing up the sump hole with rock. I then instructed that the hole be covered up until authority could be obtained from the Department to complete the repairs.\n\nWhile the School should have got in touch with me before starting the repairs, without doubt to avoid further damage the work done was very necessary and I would recommend payment.\n\nThere is one point, however, about the account for this extra work that I do not like, and that is that Johnston & Co., are charging all that they can for the job, and I feel that in connection with any future work, a change of contractors will be in order.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(W.J.

The laundry equipment is very necessary, and also the barn.\n\nIt is Mr. Ferguson's intention to write you full particulars regarding these and to request the Department to proceed at once with the building of the barn and the purchasing of the laundry equipment.\n\nIt has been decided that the repairing of the girls' toilets, for which $900.00 is available, should be deferred until the other improvements are made. This will mean that if the cost of the laundry equipment, etc., amounts to more than what is provided in this year's appropriation, the repairs to the toilets will be allowed to stand until next year.\n\nWhen you hear from Mr. Ferguson I would strongly recommend that you make the necessary arrangements to proceed with the work at this School at the earliest possible date.\nMr. Ferguson will also write you with reference to the septic tank. It is absolutely necessary that this be opened and cleaned. The cost will probably amount to nearly $400.00, but in its present condition it is a menace to the health of the pupils.\n\nThe only satisfactory solution at this School is to build another septic tank next year. The one at present in use is certainly too small for the number of children at this School.\n\nWith reference to the laundry machinery, I believe that Mr. Orr visited this School last year he took a list of what is necessary, so you have complete information on file. The only question is to get things moving as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTS SUPERVISION COMMITTEE\n\nOttawa, May 16th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication 154-0-5 under date of the 15th instant, and note a Pneumatic Storage Tank available for disposal at Kamloops, B.C. and same will have our attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSALVAGE OFFICER.\n\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nLHB/FC\nMay 15, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th with reference to the disposal of the pneumatic tank stored at the Kamloops School, I beg to say that government regulations are such that this department cannot sell equipment of any kind, and it will therefore be necessary, if this tank is to be sold, to transfer it to the government Salvage Officer, and he will arrange for the sale.\n\nI am today writing to Col.

A copy of the tender of Fernie Bros. of Kamloops is also attached.\n\nIn view of Mr. Webb's statement regarding this matter it seems desirable that this tender should be accepted and I shall be glad to have your instructions as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nAttached hereto is a letter from Fernie Brothers of Kamloops tendering for the purchase of a pneumatic tank stored at Kamloops Industrial School.\n\nThis tank was part of the domestic supply system constructed in 1920 to serve the old school. The Pneumatic system was replaced in 1928 by a gravity system. Since that time the tank has not been in use. A few years ago it was cleaned and painted. The replacement value is approximately $375.\n\nIn view of the fact that no use has been found for this old plant in the past seven years and to the possibility of deterioration I would suggest that it be offered for sale.\n\nThe tender of $100. by Fernie Brothers although it does not represent the value of the tank, is probably reasonable in view of the small market for such equipment, and is unlikely to be exceeded.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will bring this matter to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SGD) C.E.

Fernie, Prop.\nKamloops, B.C.,\nJune 15th, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nIn regard to the proposed improvements for this year at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, would advise that Mr. Phelan of the Education Branch, was here this week, and together with the Reverend Principal, Father Kennedy we looked over and discussed the work to be done.\n\nMr. Phelan informed me that in the appropriation for this year funds had been provided for as follows:\n\nLaundry Machinery........$2,500.00\nDairy Barn................4,000.00\nPaint, brick & stone.....1,250.00\nGirls' toilet.............900.00 $8,650.00\n\nIf authorization for these expenditures can now be obtained, I would suggest that the laundry machinery be considered of first importance, and the work in this connection be started immediately the children leave the school for their Summer Vacation, so that it may be completed before their return.\n\nI would place the dairy barn in order of next importance, and work on this could be started at any time.\n\nIn regards to the laundry machinery, it appears to me that possibly the matter of a new boiler to replace the old one, condemned last year by the engineer of the Department of Public Works, Victoria, was overlooked and not included in the estimates. In this respect I would refer you to my letter of October 11, 1934. If this be the case, and as it is very necessary that this replacement be made, it would be as well to delay authorization of the other two expenditures, namely Paint, Brick and Stone, $1,250.00, and Girls' Toilet,$900.00 until we are assured that the repairs to the laundry including the boiler will be completed. The estimate I submitted on this boiler amounted to $1500.00, but I am sure that amount can be somewhat reduced if both jobs are under way at the same time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.J.F.S.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nR.

W.P., complete with necessary mountings; hood and stack. Price F.O.B. School at Kamloops, including Sales Tax, $788.00.\"\n\nThis is a much better price than the one of Kamloops Plumbing & Heating, who quoted $1275.00 installed, as per my letter of October 11th last. Although this quotation covered the removing and rebuilding of the brick, which would not call for all the difference in the two prices.\n\nThis month, when Mr. Arnell, Dominion Public Works Boiler Inspector was here, we discussed the matter of this boiler for laundry, and he suggested that when the new boiler is installed at the school, the old one could be overhauled, the old tubes replaced, and shipped to LeJacques School at Vanderhoof, for use in the laundry there.\n\nToday the Reverend Principal, Father Kennedy, called me up about the repairs to the laundry, and informed me that he is very anxious that this work be carried out before the School opens on August 26th.\n\nIn view of this, I would be obliged if the Department would please advise me of their intention in regard to this work.\n\nI might add that I wrote your Mr. Orr, Architect, in this respect, on June 15th last, but have not yet had a reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nW.J.F/S.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nKAMLOOPS BC 29\nSECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n662 OTTAWA ONT\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS ADVISE CANNOT SANCTION TEMPORARY USE OF LAUNDRY BOILER KAMLOOPS SCHOOL CONSIDERED UNSAFE FOR FURTHER OPERATION STOP IN VIEW OF THIS NEW BOILER NECESSARY IMMEDIATELY WOULD RECOMMEND PURCHASE IN ACCORDANCE MY LETTER FIRST INSTANT WITH ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR INSTALLATION\n\nW J FERGUSON.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6449, file 882-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 9, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRev.

I have had this done about half way up the beds. An end near the tank and an end at the farthest end of the bed was dug up and found to be completely blocked with solid matter from the tank, so that no liquid could pass through the tile at these points. This leads me to believe that the same condition exists over the entire beds. At present, most, if not all of the liquid is flowing in the main sewerage pipe past the beds, out on to the open ground.\n\nJust what would be best to do to remedy the situation is a matter that should be dealt with by the Dominion Water Power Branch, and I would ask you to please refer the matter to them for a report. Some temporary work might be done this fall to make shift with until next year, when a sum sufficient to put this system up to full capacity and proper working order in relation to the population of the school, should be included in the estimates for next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(W.J.

(Kamloops Residential) The old boiler has been condemned. The principal reports that this boiler is not being used, and the school washing is being done without a supply of hot water. This is not a very desirable state of affairs when Scarlet Fever is present in the institution. I trust that this deficiency will have been rectified ere my letter reaches you.\n\nThe defective sewage disposal at the school looms up as a greater menace at a time like the present. As I have already informed you, the tank is not sufficiently large to allow full digestion before the sewage discharges into the disposal plant. The disposal bed, moreover, is poorly laid out. I wish that repairs could be made as soon as possible. It has been known for a number of years that the sewage disposal is both inadequate and unsafe.\n\nP. S. Tennant.\nMedical Superintendent.\nSept. 25, 1935.\n\nMr. W. J. Ferguson\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Ferguson:\n\nI am returning the plan of the School Laundry which you gave me and also a plan drawn by our Technical Instructor, Mr. Frank Bosco, showing dimensions and location of the machines we now have in the laundry, as requested.\n\nI am most anxious that the two washing machines which are now placed along the West wall enclosing the boiler and the Coal Store should be moved to the East wall where is the drain. All the machines which have to be drained should be placed along this latter wall so as to avoid having the children working in running water as is the case at the present time as the water has to run across the floor to enter the drain. The washing machines and the extractors, therefore, should be placed along the East wall. Either the present extractor or the new one might be placed near the outside entrance in the North East corner. There is a six foot space in that corner.\n\nI do not feel that it is so important as to where the other machines are placed as long as they are in convenient positions for the work and for supervision.\n\nThanking you for the interest you have taken in this matter, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nThos.

Depot to the School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Wire of September 10th, 1935.\n\nYou will note that the total of these vouchers exceeds the amount of $788.00 authorized by the Department by $25.00. $25.00 of this was due to the extra height of the new boiler over that of the old one. When plans of the new boiler were received from the Vancouver Engineering Works Ltd., after the order was placed with them, it was found that the hood and stack quoted on would not do, and a special uptake with a side outlet to chimney, with damper, had to be ordered at this extra cost. The top of the uptake is covered with a cap of steel bolted down, which can be removed and flues cleaned from a trap door in the floor from the room above. This trap door has not as yet been cut into the floor, but allowance can be made for it when the rest of the machinery is being installed in the laundry.\n\nThe other over-expenditure of $10.00, covered transportation of the boiler from the C.P.R. Station to the School. The Vancouver Engineering Works quoted the price f.o.b. Mission School at Kamloops. In this respect I took the matter up with them, and you will find attached hereto, copy of their explanation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(W.J.

Ferguson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKamloops, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 15th has been referred to the writer for reply. In respect to the delivery of the boiler to the Mission School at Kamloops, we regret that the wording in our tender was in error. The writer unfortunately had in mind at the time we made out the tender that the boiler was going to the Mission School at Kamloops, and with that thought in mind worded the tender accordingly. Our estimate sheet has no provision thereon for delivering the boiler to the School, this in view of the fact that we do not know where the school is in relation to the railway, nor have any way of determining just what the charges would be, and trust therefore that you will take these facts into consideration in deciding the question of such amount despite the fact that our letter did read F.O.B. Mission School.\n\nWith further reference to this boiler, another unfortunate circumstance occurred in that the freight in our estimate amounted to $16.17, whereas we actually paid $48.43, thereby incurring a definite loss of $32.26, thus making the whole transaction anything but profitable.\n\nWhilst we are not complaining, we merely submit the above facts and leave the matter with you feeling that you would wish to treat the whole thing with every fairness.\n\nAwaiting with pleasure your further comments, and thanking you in anticipate, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nVANCOUVER ENGINEERING WORKS, LTD.\n\n(Sgd) E.

I have noted that there are a sufficient number of children eligible for admission to fill the school to its present accommodation.\n\nWith reference to the request contained in the communication from Reverend Father Kennedy, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would say that the laundry machinery has been supplied and instructions have recently been issued to make the alterations required to the laundry and install the machinery. Certain funds will be available in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year to carry out repairs, painting, etc., and to repair the storage disposal system. I regret that it was not possible to proceed with the erection of the new supply of supplementary reading material has recently been sent the Principal, and he will be advised with reference to retaining in the classroom a number of the pupils who are over 16 years of age.\n\nRegarding the supplying of storage batteries for the lighting system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would say that this matter is now before the Honourable the Minister to approve the expenditure required, and we are awaiting his directions in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAROLD W.
