Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nOn checking the March quarter return of the Kingsclear Indian Day School, it is noted that only four pupils were registered during that quarter. The same condition applied to the December quarter, but we were under the impression at that time that possibly owing to sickness and bad weather the attendance had been reduced. However, as there are still only four children registered at the school, it would appear that these are the only pupils available. In view of the great shortage of teachers at the present time, the Department does not feel that we are justified in operating a school for four pupils. However, it is not our intention to close the school immediately, but, unless you can give definite assurance that there will be a much larger attendance for the coming academic year, the Department will have no alternative than to close the school at the end of June. Please let me know why the attendance at this school has become so low and also what are the prospects of an increased attendance.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of April 22, 1944 regarding the small number of pupils at the Kingsclear Indian Day School.\n\nSince Ernest Polchies was sent to the School for the Blind at Halifax, there has been only four pupils.\n\nThe number of children in this reserve has been lessened some by Indian families moving away when the father obtained a good job at some kind of war work. This condition will last as long as the war lasts.\n\nThere is however a new side to this problem now. Henry Solomon, an Indian from Kingsclear reserve, who has been employed in Maine for some time, disappeared Christmas eve last year. Last week his body was found in the river near Presqueisle, Maine.\n\nThis man left five children and two of these have been given a home by relatives in Kingsclear Indian Reserve. Henry Barney Solomon, Age 12 taken by Benjamin Tomah. Reginald Solomon, Age 13, taken by Gabriel Solomon.\n\nI did not know that these boys were coming to Kingsclear to live until after they arrived, but the relations had talked of taking the children when they heard of Mr Solomon's disappearance, if he did not show up. His wife, who turned out to be a bad woman, left the family some time before his disappearance. The Indians say she is now serving a term in a house of correction at Skowhegan, Maine.\n\nThis increases the number of children at school by two, or fifty per cent. Mrs Frank Sappier another woman of the Kingsclear reserve has been talking of adopting a child. If she does and it is of school age this will increase the number to seven pupils.\nWhen the Indians were aware of the fact that the school might be closed on account of the small number of pupils, they began to ask for children to adopt. I did not know if this would meet with your approval or not, and so I did not say much about it.\n\nOf course the ones who adopted the Solomon children had said when he was reported missing that if Mr Solomon did not return to the family they were going to adopt some of the children, therefore their action had nothing to do with the school problem.\n\nThe Indians of the Kingsclear reserve do not look kindly on the idea of closing their school and feel that they are being discriminated against as they say the war conditions have caused their men to go away and the children as well.\n\nThere are, as stated above, two more pupils to go to school now and if the school would be kept open by one more pupil being adopted by a family and kept at school I feel that we would have no trouble in placing one in a good home with Mr and Mrs Sappler, who have no children of their own.\n\nYour further comments please.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 3, 1944.\n\nMr. E.J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th ultimo, with reference to the attendance at the Kingsclear Indian Day School. It has been decided to allow this school to remain in operation, but it is hoped that the number attending the school will increase as a result of the action that is being taken by certain Indians.\n\nR.A.

SOUTHWESTERN AGENCY\n\nFour schools, one on each reserve, are being conducted for the education of the children. Two of these schools, the Woodstock and the Saint Mary's are looked after by two teachers, each, Sisters of Charity, and in addition to the regular work sewing, knitting, repairing of old clothing, cooking and weaving are being taught. The Kingsclear and Oromocto Schools each have but one teacher consequently very little time can be spent on Domestic Science work.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nEach reserve in this agency has an Indian school. Two of these schools, Woodstock and Saint Mary's are taught by Sisters of Charity. Two Sisters in each school. The other schools, Kingsclear and Oromocto, have one teacher each.\n\nThe Woodstock school and the Saint Mary's school are each too small to accommodate the number of pupils and these should be replaced by new ones.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 12, 1945.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N. B.\n\nI have reviewed recently the returns from\nthe Indian day schools in New Brunswick. I find that\nthere were no children in attendance at the Kingsclear\nSchool during the month of September. Of course, I\nrealize that this was due to the fact that the families\nwere absent in Maine.\n\nIn the June quarter there were only six\npupils enrolled and I understood from the report recently\nsubmitted by one of our officials, when he visited the\nschool in October, that there were only four children\npresent.\n\nAm I to understand that this is the total\nnumber of children of school age available on this\nreserve, or is there any prospect of additional children\nattending the school? Please let me have a complete\nreport regarding the situation at Kingsclear.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, December 12, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\u2014\n\n-Director-\n\nThe following is a report on my visit to the New Brunswick West Agency November 6-9 inclusive.\n\nKINGSCLAR RESERVE\n\nSCHOOL\n\nThe school is a one room building recently repaired and painted inside and out. It is now in a very attractive condition. There are only four children of school age living on the reserve, and they attend school regularly.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nFredericton, N.B.\nJanuary 16, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour letter of December 12, 1945, inquiring about the number of pupils at the Kingsclear Indian Day School, has been received and would have been answered before, had not the Indians informed me that two families, formerly of this reserve were to return during the Christmas season.\n\nAt the present time, the total number of children of school age is only four.\n\nGregory Francis, an Indian of this reserve is in the Canadian Armed Forces, overseas, but is expected home at any time. His wife is a girl from the Woodstock Indian Reserve and during his absence, she moved to Woodstock with her people. On their return, which may be at any time (as soon as the husband returns) there will be one more pupil to attend school and next year they will have a second one of school age.\n\nDavid Solomon, another Indian of this reserve has been working in a war plant in Connecticut, U.S.A., he was to have returned at Christmas, but has not, as yet. He has two small children to attend school.\n\nFrank Sappier, has an adopted child, which will be of school age in another year.\n\nIf the building program on the Kingsclear\n\n(over)\nReserve, which was talked of recently, materializes, then, the school will be too small to accommodate the pupils.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 23, 1946.\n\nMr. E.J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the Kingsclear Indian Day School.\n\nI suggest that you review the situation early in June and forward a report to the Department in order that we may decide what action should be taken for the academic year 1946-47.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum for File:\n\nThe April report of Indian Agent Whelan, regarding the Kingsclear School, states that there were only 5 children on the roll with an average attendance of 3.5\nOttawa, May 18, 1946.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of January 16 and my reply of January 23, with reference to the Kingsclear Indian Day School.\n\nI notice from your April report that there are only 5 children on the roll and an average attendance of 3.5.\n\nAs requested in my letter of January 23, I expect that you will review the situation at Kingsclear early in June and forward a report. With the very small enrolment, the continued operation of this school is difficult to justify.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFredericton, N. B.\nJune 17, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to refer to your letters of January 23 and May 18, 1946, regarding the attendance at the Kingsclear Indian Day School.\n\nThere are at the present time six children in attendance at this school.\n\nThere are three others, who have passed their fifth birthday and although they are too young to start at the beginning of the school year, they will be in attendance during the second term.\n\nThe matter of closing the school came up about a year ago and at that time the Indians of the Kingsclear Reserve, felt they were being deprived of a great deal, which other reserves had.\n\nI would recommend, if at all possible, that this school be kept open, as I expect an increase in the number of pupils yearly.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 21, 1946.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 17th instant, the Department has decided to allow the Kingsclear Indian Day School to remain open for the academic year 1946-47. I presume the present teacher is willing to remain.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nN.B. West.\n\nREPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING JUNE 30th, 1946.\n\nI beg to submit report of Indian Agency N.B. West for the quarter ending June 30, 1946.\n\nOne Indian Day School is in operation on each Reserve and two Sisters are employed at the Woodstock and St. Mary's Schools. The Oronocto and Kingsclear Schools are each looked after by one teacher.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nN.B.

The Oromocto and Kingsclear schools are each looked after by one teacher.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nN.B. WEST\n\nREPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1946.\n\nI beg to submit report of Indian Agency, N.B. West, for the quarter ending September 30, 1946.\n\nThe schools got away to a poor start, on account of the number of children leaving the reserves and going to Maine with their parents to pick potatoes. Two schools, one each at Kingsclear and Oromocto were closed part of the month on account of the absence of pupils. A number of children left the Woodstock and St. Mary's Reserves, but there were enough left to keep the schools open.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 16, 1946.\n\nMr. E. J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nTeachers' Salaries\n\nMr. Morris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies for Quebec and the Maritimes, has requested that we review the salaries of the teachers in your agency.\n\nOur records show the following salaries are at present being paid:\n\nWoodstock Day School:\n- Sister Dolorosa - $100.00 per teaching month $112\n- Marion Teresa - 94.00 \" \" \" $94\n\nDevon Day School:\n- Sister Jean Marie - 80.00 per teaching month $112\n- Marietta - 75.00 \" \" \" $94\n\nGromocto Day School:\n- Miss Eileen Delaney - 100.00 per teaching month $118\n\nKingsclear Day School:\n- Mrs. Irene Hurley - 94.00 per teaching month\n\nOur teachers' salaries are based upon their experience and qualifications. Therefore, in order to assess these factors,\n\n...........\nwe enclose five copies of our teacher's application form. The bottom part only of this form need be completed by your teachers as the upper part is used only by new teachers first entering the service.\n\nIt is not felt that we can raise the salary of the teacher at Kingsloch, due to the small number of children in attendance.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Teachers Salaries.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of December 16, regarding application for employment of Indian Day School Teachers, to be filled in, regarding the teachers of the Woodstock, St. Mary's and Oromocto Indian Schools.\n\nThese forms were forwarded to the teachers to be filled in, but several had to be returned for completion and one apparently was mislaid, as it just reached our office yesterday.\n\nThe Sisters of the St. Mary's Indian School are receiving much less for their services per month, than the other teachers, and as they are doing splendid work, I would recommend that their salaries be made equal to the others, even after a raise is given.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 5th, 1947.\n\nEdward J. Whalen, Indian Agent, Fredericton, N.B.\n\nNew Teachers' Salaries\n\nReference your G-7-12 of Jan. 21st.\n\nEffective 1st February, 1947, the following increased salaries will be paid.\n\nWoodstock Day School\nSister Dolorosa - $112. per teaching month\n\nDevon Day School\nSister Jean Marie - $112. per teaching month\nSister Marietta - $94. per teaching month\n\nOromocto Day School\nMiss Eileen Delaney - $118. per teaching month\n\nThe larger amount paid to Miss Delaney is due to the fact she is eligible for the payment of income tax.\n\nApparently Sister Marion Teresa does not hold a provincial teaching licence or certificate.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 28th, 1947.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nWe are in receipt of a report from School Inspector Titus with reference to his inspection of Kingsclear School on February 17th. He states that there are seven children enrolled but only two of them were present on the day of the inspection. He further advises that there are five pupils in Grade I and of these, four are only five years of age.\n\nThe Inspector feels that these children are too young to attend school and he expressed the opinion that the teacher is very handicapped by the fact that they do not understand English.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter of June 17th, 1946, the Department was hopeful that the attendance would increase. However, it appears to be decreasing. Certainly, neither the enrolment or the attendance is such as to justify the continued operation of this school.\n\nAs you were informed in official letter of June 21st, 1946, we are prepared to allow the school to remain open for the current academic year but as things stand at the present time, there appears to be very little hope of reopening it next year. Is there any white school in the immediate neighbourhood of the Kingsclear Reserve that the Indian children of school age could attend?\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nFile 56-2-1\n\nWith reference to Indian Agent Whalen's letter of March 4th, it should be noted when his further reply is received that Mr. Norris, Acting Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Maritimes states that it is the intention to move other Indians to Kingsclear Reserve this Fall and in that case it might be necessary to continue operation of the Kingsclear Indian Day School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFredericton, N. B.\nApril 19, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nKingsclear Indian School.\n\nWith the proposed enlargement of the Kingsclear Indian Reserve, and the desire to have all the Indians of the Oromocto Reserve moved there during the coming season, it will be necessary to make plans for the school during the fall term, as it is expected that between 30 and 40 pupils will be there to attend school during 1947 and 1948.\n\nAs the Sisters have had such marked success in the Indian schools of the maritime provinces, and especially in the Domestic Science and welfare work, I would recommend, that, if at all possible, Sisters be employed to take charge of this school during the coming year.\n\nThey could be housed for the present time, in the house on the C. C. Murray property, recently purchased.\n\nI have not approached the Mother Superior in St. John, regarding the Sisters to take over this work, as I wished to hear from you regarding same before approaching her. But, I feel, as there is a resident Priest and a Church at Kingsclear, we would be able to get the Sisters.\n\nMrs. Hurley, at present teaching the Kingsclear School, has informed me, it is her intention to resign at the end of the present term, and Miss Delaney, who is now employed as teacher, at the Oromocto Indian School could, in all probability, be placed elsewhere to good advantage.\n\nMay I hear from you regarding the employment of two Sisters at the Kingsclear Indian School.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nWill there be over 30\nOttawa, April 28th, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your application form for employment as a teacher in an Indian day school. We have vacancies for Roman Catholic teachers in the Province of British Columbia. In fact, we have one school to which you could report as a teacher on July 1st, 1947. Our beginning salary for teachers with first class certificates and no teaching experience is $126.00 a teaching month.\n\nAt the Okanagan Indian day school to which I referred in the opening paragraph of my letter, you will find good living quarters and furniture. The school has been closed for the past year and we are anxious to get a Catholic teacher as soon as possible. The school is situated seventeen miles from Vernon, B.C., and it will be necessary for you to do your own housekeeping.\n\nThere will be other vacancies occurring in the summer in Ontario and there may possibly be a vacancy in Nova Scotia.\n\nCould you please inform me of what part of Canada you particularly want to be employed in.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nKingsclear Indian Day School\n\nReference your Letter of April 19th.\n\nWe wish to advise that we do not employ two teachers at a school unless there is an average annual attendance of at least 30 to 35 during the academic year. You will agree that we could scarcely employ an additional teacher on the \"expectation\" indicated in your letter.\n\nWe understand from Mr. Morris that he has other plans for the house on the Murray property.\n\nWe have received an application for employment in Indian Schools from Mr. A.E. Hawley who holds a first class teaching license, physical education diploma and a Bachelor of Arts degree. Mr. Hawley is at present attending Saint Francis Xavier University at Antigonish.\n\nOn our new salary scale we can offer him a starting salary of $126. a teaching month.\n\nFrom the above it should not be inferred that we do not wish to employ Sisters as teachers at this school. However, we are not prepared to employ two teachers at the present time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nJuly 26, 1948.\n\nMr. E.J. Blakey, Supt.

I have asked Mr. Whalen to contact you with regard to the possibility of exchanging these two teachers.\n\nI would advise that this transfer is but a suggestion and that we will expect to hear from both of you with regard to its feasibility.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Barker has sent in an accepted cheque on the Bank of Nova Scotia for the required amount. Mr. Jeffrey's tender is the lower by $352.00 and if his cheque is marked good I would recommend the acceptance of his offer.\n\nA building on the same plan was put up last year at St. Mary's last year at a cost of $3287.00, but Kingsclear is not so advantageously situated for getting in material.\n\nIf the Department considers Mr. Jeffrey's tender I would suggest that he be wired to have his cheque accepted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has some obligations to meet on Tuesday next for which he will require the money, and I would be obliged if you would interest yourself in seeing that a cheque is sent to him before that date for whatever amount he is entitled to on these estimates.\n\nAlthough he expects to have the building\ncompleted in the course of two or three weeks he informs me that he has received only $900. up to date.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

RYAN, on his inspection of the KINGSCLEAR INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, on May 29, 1933.\n\nOriginal on 56-2-6.\n\nThe interior of this school should, if possible, be painted. However, if funds are too low, the next best thing would be to have a proper person to wash walls and ceiling and woodwork with a proper chemical wash, that will remove the blackened condition of the interior.\n\nThe floor must be washed, well dried and covered with hot oil, the out-houses white-washed, cleaned and repaired and a little minor repairs about school steps and fence, etc.\nOttawa, June 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, has forwarded the reports on his inspection of the schools in your Agency.\n\nRegarding the Kingsclear Day School, he recommends that the interior woodwork be washed, and the floor scrubbed, and, when dry, given a coat of hot oil. You should arrange, during the summer holidays, to have the interior woodwork well washed and the floor scrubbed by a person competent to do the work.\n\nHe also recommends that the out houses at all the schools be thoroughly cleaned and placed in a satisfactory condition, and any minor repairs required carried out. The out houses at all the schools should be cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible.\n\nAccounts, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. J.

Last year I had a man try and wash the walls at the Kingsclear Indian School. He had all the materials necessary to remove dirt, but the dust and smoke would not wash off. I would recommend the walls and ceiling of this school be painted, one or two coats. The cost would be very light, not more than fifty dollars, perhaps less, and would mean a great improvement to this school.\n\nThe school at Kingsclear is the only one in my Agency that the interior looks shabby. I would like very much to have this work done, so the interior of all all the schools would be clean and tidy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, July 10, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, regarding the condition of the walls, ceiling and woodwork in the interior of the Kingsclear Indian Day School and recommending that they be painted, at a cost of approximately $50.00.\n\nIn reply I regret that the Department will have no funds this year to carry out any painting or redecorating at Indian schools. Therefore, it will not be possible to authorize the expenditure required in connection with the painting recommended by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. J.

No. 6. On September 18th, cheque No. 15669 for $13.50 was mailed to Mr. Sacobie at Fredericton, N.B.

Your voucher stated that the account in favour of Gabe Sacobie was for cleaning the Kingsclear School, and it is thought that there may be some confusion caused by sending the cheque to Oromocto instead of to R.R. #6. If the man Gabe Sacobie, to whom this cheque is due for services cleaning the Kingsclear School, is dead, kindly inform the Department if he left a will. If so, has it been probated? If he left no will, have letters of administration been taken out? Did deceased leave wife and family?\n\nThe above mentioned cheque is being held pending your reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C.

You should state if you consider the work could be done satisfactorily by Indian labour. Please forward this information at an early date in order that, if it is decided to have the painting carried out, it can be done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nThe Inspector also recommends that the outhouses be cleaned out, whitewashed and placed in a sanitary condition. You may have this work done, keeping all expense as low as possible. You should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF.

Brown. This man is a first class painter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nJune 29th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department there will have to be some work done at the Kingsclear Indian School. When the snow melts in the spring, or it rains, the water runs into the cellar and lies there, and this causes a musty odor in the school. There is a window on the north side of the school in the cellar wall, which could be closed by filling in with stone and cement. This would stop most of the water getting in. What really should be done, is a drain on the upper side of the school, to continue about ten rods; dig this drain a foot or two below the cellar floor, and fill with rock. This would carry the water away.\n\nI would recommend the window be closed as referred to above. If the Department approves of this work being done, I will get an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letters of the 29th ultimo and the 11th instant, regarding the cleaning and painting and also the condition of the drainage at the Kingsclear Indian Day School. It is noted you enclose an estimate of the cost of the cleaning and painting.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure, not exceeding the sum of $55.00, in the washing of all walls and ceilings of main room, hall, entry and anti-room and applying two coats of paint. You should see that this work is satisfactorily completed during the present holidays. After the work has been finished to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in triplicate, stating in full detail the work performed. You should state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid.\n\nThe Department will have no funds to install a drain from the cellar of the school. However, you may arrange to have the window on the north side filled in with stone and cement. The cost, of course, should be kept as low as possible, and, when completed, you should forward an account, in triplicate, stating the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid for the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In the opinion of Mr. Betts, who\nis a competent plumber not worth repairing. It will cost\napproximately $10.00 to take the furnace down, and to\nweld the holes which are visible, without taking it apart,\nthe cost $14.00, there will be another charge of $10.00\nto reassemble it.\n\nIf the Department has not received any complaints\nregarding this furnace it could not have been inspected\nrecently.\n\nAfter a careful investigation, I beg to suggest\nto the Department it would, in my opinion, wasting money\nto spend much on repairs.\n\nI therefore recommend the installation of a\nnew furnace, castings only, at an approximate cost of\n$130.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA/ Indian Agent\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should therefore arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list. Please obtain a furnace of a type that would be suitable for the heating of this school and arrange for the satisfactory installation of same. This matter should receive your prompt attention, in order that the work can be completed before the extremely cold weather sets in.

In previous years we allowed $6 a quart for milk at this school and, in view of the regulations made by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board we cannot exceed this price this year. I understand that bonus is paid for milk in some sections and possibly Mr. King can collect the other $6 from any bank which, I understand, handles these bonus payments.

The schools at the Kingsclear Reserve and the Oromocto Reserve are large enough for the present needs. The former needs painting, but this is to be done during the summer holidays.\n\nTwo of the schools, the Woodstock and the Saint Mary's are looked after by the Sisters of Charity, two in each school.

B.\nNovember 26, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\nRe: Painting & Repairing of the Kingsclear Indian School and Outbuildings.\n\nIn my letter of July 4, 1945, I stated that I considered the cost of painting and repairing the Kingsclear Indian School and Outbuildings, including a well house would be $208.50. I now find that the cost of labor is about four times what I had figured on. More material too, was required which brought the cost still higher.\n\nThe extra labor and material was due to the condition of the school, which was much worse than could be seen until work was started on it. The metal ceiling, when cleared of the scale paint was rusty and had to be scraped and washed before being painted. Many holes had to be repaired in the walls and some of the window sashes were rotten and had to be replaced, others repaired. The building on the top of the roof was also in bad shape and had to be repaired. The flag pole too, had been placed on the top of the porch entrance and started the porch from the top main building. The pole itself, was also rotten and had to be taken down. In all, many unforeseen repairs were required. The outside walls of the building had to be scraped with a wire brush before being painted. Wages too, were higher than I had planned, help was scarce and there was no alternative.\n\n(over)\nonly to take who I could get and to pay the same per hour as these people could get elsewhere.\n\nMr. William Polchies, an old reliable Indian, looked after the work, but, got very little help from the rest of the Indians, as they said they could make more money in Maine picking potatoes. I told this man to hire a white man to help him. Al Myshral was hired. (This man supplied many of the materials required for repairs to the school without charging for them).\n\nIt is regretted that my estimate was so much below the actual cost of the work. I visited this school often, as may be seen by my Daily Diary and tried to get the work hurried along, but as stated above, very much unforeseen work kept showing up and it was impossible to rush any.\n\nOn October 12, I told Mr. Polchies, that as the work had cost so much, we would have to close it out in two days more.\n\nWhen J. E. Morris (Welfare Division), visited this school, I showed him the work and explained this. He authorized the completion of the work, which has been done.\n\nA further advance of $271.22 will be required to finish the work as shown on the attached sheet, and I would ask that this be forwarded at an early date.\n\nEdward J.

I thought this was due to the worn out pipes, and I replaced these by good ones, although not new ones, which were obtained from the Internment Camp, Ripples, N. B. This, however, did not help matters much, and the stove continues to smoke.\n\nThe Indians claim this furnace has been in use at the Kingsclear Indian Reserve for about twenty-two years; therefore, I would ask to have authority to have it dismantled and repaired by a tinsmith, if repairs can be made without too much cost.\n\nNo estimate of the cost can be obtained, until the outside of the furnace is removed.\n\nEdward J. Whalen,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 3, 1947.\n\nMr. Edward J. Whalen, Indian Agent,\nFredericton, New Brunswick.\n\nFurnace - Kingsclear Indian Day School\n\nThe Department authorizes the dismantling and repair of the smokeless furnace at the above school. It is understood that this furnace is 22 years old and has been smoking during the past winter.\n\nIt is suggested that these repairs be carried out during the Easter holidays. If you find the furnace in bad condition it may be advisable to replace it entirely, but we will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F.

Consequently, the amount paid to this man included, as well as his own labour, $12.00 which he advanced to Donald Solomon and $2.00 which he paid for truckage.\n\nEdward J.

Some are in fact able of their children are bright and intelligent. In the past, I have done my best to get them to attend the Oromocto school, but owing to their previous habits, they will not keep up with white children. As the Department is deeply interested in the education of the rising generation, I feel that the time has arrived that a school building should be erected on this Reserve, and a teacher appointed for their special instruction.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames Macmillan\n\nIndian Affairs.

Their parents he states will not send them to the white school and if the Department decides to accede to this request, fully $700.00 would be required for the erection of a suitable building, with $100.00 extra for equipment, and $300.00 a year for the salary of a teacher. After all this expenditure had been gone to, it is doubtful whether they would take advantage of the school when established. I think it would be better to have the Agent use his influence with the Indians to have the children attend the white school even if the Department had to hold out inducements in the way of furnishing the necessary clothing for such children as could be persuaded to go there.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I hasten to inform you that in connection with the General School Act of this last, and other years past, I consulted with the parents of the children as to the benefits to be derived to both them and their children if they would but send them to the school regularly, so it was felt for a time to give them a knowledge of reading and writing, &c., by which they would make fair progress, and would thus keep on those of the most intelligent children to school for a month or so, when owing to the disobedience of their parents they would stop going altogether. By experience of the Indians' children, in most cases, owing to their peculiar race or character, they must be kept in very few cases. The educated by themselves, this is evident on any inspection of the schools of this agency. I therefore for the reasons stated made the application for clothing as stated in your letter of the 16th Dec. 1904.\n\nI am Sir,\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Barnett, one of the trustees informed me that the school house was too small to take in any more children\u2014 that they had already refused applications from a side\u2014 that even supposing that the ratepayers would agree to this proposition they would certainly have to employ another teacher, as the present teacher had already too much to do.\n\nI asked him to consult with the other trustee whom I did not see, and also to try and get the ratepayers to agree to taking the Indian children into their school at least for a year, and see how it worked out.

In the meantime, however, if a suitable building could be rented at a moderate rate in which a school could be temporarily conducted, the Department would be willing to pay the salary of a teacher and, if the Indians show their appreciation, steps might be taken to provide a permanent building.\n\nYou will be good enough to make the necessary enquiries and report again to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

The duties have been and will be, for an able, yet more trying than in a place where the children have been placed in the discipline of school life for years. I am sure the Inspector, Rev. Ryan and Commissioner Mr. White will assure you that I have endeavored to perform faithfully all duties in connection with this school, with quite gratifying results.\n\nI desire also to call to your attention a little grievance in connection with my salary for the past year.\n\nThe salary was to have been three hundred dollars. I received two hundred and fifty, $25 for first quarter, and $75 for each succeeding quarter. During the school year I lost eight teaching days through owing to rooms being shut on the school building. For these days I did not expect pay.\n\nYou will readily understand it being no fault of mine that I was appointed teacher of this school first of August instead of first of July. And that the opening of the school was delayed for eight days.\n\nI feel that as the duties in this school, and the conditions under which I had to teach were very\nhard. I should have received my full salary. Trust me efforts to explain this matter will produce a favorable response.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n(Mrs.) Blanche J. McLeffrey,\n(Teacher)\nOttawa, 23rd August, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant; and in reply I beg to say that a cheque for $50.00 being balance of salary owing to you for the school year ended 30th June last, is being sent under separate cover. In view of the favorable report received on your work, it has been decided to grant you an increase for the current year of $50.00, making your salary $350.00 per annum. In return for this increase the Department would like you to take up some branch of domestic science in the school room. A number of our teachers give instruction in plain sewing to the girls and in nearly every instance, this has proved both of interest and benefit to the children. The Department supplies the necessary material. Be good enough to state whether any of the girls attending the Oromocto Indian school are old enough to be taught sewing and if so, whether you will be willing to undertake the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Smith\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI thought it might be just as well & let you know that Mr. and Mrs. Van Saarloos are still old timers, that is, taking their two children away from school, and when they pleased to do so, they will send them back. This taking the children from school every little while (for a week or so) not only retards their progress, but spoils the average. It is simply useless to try to reason with this woman as I have tried, and failed. So I'll have to leave it to you Mr. Smith.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nBlanche J. St. Cyprey\nSir,\n\nWe have an Indian woman on the Oromocto Reserve that is giving the teacher a lot of trouble, taking her children out of the school just when she likes and sends them just when she likes. She demands her children any time during school hours and if the teacher refuses to let them go she makes a row with the teacher on the spot. This is the woman I reported to the department for taking the axe and striking the school house door and threatened to strike the teacher with it if she did not let her child out of school when she wanted it.\n\nNow if she is allowed to do this it will have a bad effect on the school for the rest of the Indians think if she can get her children whenever she likes, or send them just when she likes they have the same privilege. Kindly instruct me what to do at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nN.J. Smith\nIndian agent\nFredericton\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nP.S.

You will, therefore, be good enough to instruct the truant officer to inform Mr. and Mrs. Sacobie as to these provisions and, if they refuse or neglect to send their children to school, to arrest the children and take them to school and if the parents interfere with the truant officer or with the teacher in such a way as to bring themselves within the provisions of the criminal code for assault, breach of the peace or some other such offence, to have parents prosecuted.\n\nN.

It will be proper for either you or the truant officer to lay a complaint against either of the parents who is guilty of causing a disturbance at the school before a Justice of the Peace and have them prosecuted. The Department thinks it would be better that the charge should be made by yourself or the truant officer than by the teacher. It is hoped, however, that a warning from yourself and the truant officer will put an end to any further trouble in this connection, but, as discipline must be maintained, the Department is authorizing you to take prompt action, if necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Has the department any power to compel these families to stay on the Reserve, that their children may attend school. It seems unfair to keep a teacher and family and provide wood for a school and the families will leave the reserve. There are five families at Sagetown, who have lived there for years.

Teachers of my class and experience are securing as high as $600 for the coming year. Although I like my work in the Indian School very much, I find that with present living conditions in Oromocto since the disastrous fire of September last...\nbound has been high and almost impossible to get) I find that it would be to my advantage to teach elsewhere unless you can offer an adequate increase in my salary.\n\nWill you kindly write me as soon as possible and inform me as to the best you can do in this matter, please?\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdna Rowan\n\nFredericton, N.B. #1\nYork E., N.B.\n\nJuly 26/20.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMiss Edna Rowan, teacher of the Oromocto Indian Day School, has applied for an increase in salary.\n\nMiss Rowan was appointed teacher at this school on September 1st, 1920, at a salary of $400.00 a year and bonus at the rate of $150.00, a combined salary and bonus of $550.00. She has a second-class license for the province of New Brunswick and Mr. Inspector Ryan states that she is doing as good work as can be expected owing to the irregularity in the attendance. There is an enrolment of 14 pupils, with an average attendance of 9. The total number of children of school age on the reserve is stated by the Inspector to be 14.\n\nMiss Rowan states that the Department of Education and the districts have increased their grants for the coming year, making the salaries considerably higher than in former years, also that teachers of her class and experience are receiving as high as $800.00 for the coming year.\n\nI would recommend that Miss Rowan be granted an increase in salary of at least $50.00 from the first instant.

J. Griffith, Agt,\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you, the children of the Oromocto reserve are not attending school as they should. I visited this school Sept 16th, there were only two children present. The families move down near the St. John river during the hunting season, and do not try to give their children an chance to get an education. It seems very unfair, as well as discouraging to the teacher and myself. The Department have provided a good school, and everything necessary to educate these children, and their parents do not try to take advantage of these privileges. The Indians of this reserve are a lazy, indolent, good for nothing lot, and do not seem to care how they live.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, October 19, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant regarding the unsatisfactorily attendance at the Cromosco Indian Day School.\n\nWe note that the parents take very little interest in the education of their children. You should take this question of a better attendance up with the truant officer Gabe Sacobia. As he is also the Constable it is considered that if he took a strong stand with the parents, it would greatly improve the attendance. If the parents refuse, after due notice from the truant officer, to send their children of school age and who are in good health regularly to school, it might be advisable to take steps under Sec. 10 of the Indian Act to enforce attendance. It is thought that if one or two examples were made of parents who neglect or refuse to send their children to school, it would have satisfactory effect. You should consider this matter fully with the truant officer and if you think it advisable, you may take action as set forth in sub. sec. 2 and 3 of sec. 10 of the Act.\n\nPlease inform the Department of any action taken in the matter. You might state if you consider that Gabe Sacobia is making any effort as truant officer to encourage the parents to send their children to school, and if not, would you recommend that a change be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.

The teacher has a roll of kakhi cloth, which the Department sent, and I have given each child, who is large enough to wear them, a sweater. The military boots I distributed among them.

C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for the province of New Brunswick, in a report on his recent inspection of the Indian Day School on the Gromecto Reserve, No. 36 (Federal Electoral District of York-Sunbury), recommends a change in teacher for the coming academic year. He recommends that the present teacher, Miss Eileen Delaney, who possesses a second class teacher's certificate, be replaced by Miss Mary Eileen Scott, Lower Newcastle, N. B., who possesses a first class superior teacher's license for the province of New Brunswick. The Inspector reports that, in some way, Miss Delaney has lost her former interest in this reserve and the proper advancement of the school work has been falling off for the past three years. He states it is now the policy in the white school sections to employ teachers having first class certificates and that they could be obtained for the same salary.\n\nMiss Delaney has been employed at this school since September first, 1923, with salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month.\n\nI would suggest that Reverend Father Ryan's recommendation be approved and submit same for your consideration.

(RG 10, Volume 6065, file 281-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Parish Priest in this district, with care of the Indian Reservation, informs me I am much disturbed about the dismissal of Miss Ellen Delaney, from the Indian School of that Reservation.\n\nA manifest injustice has been done to Miss Delaney. In the first place she has been highly efficient and in my judgment, which is also the judgment of a former teacher, has given satisfaction in every way. In addition to this, she is a lady of refinement and culture, deeply religious, and merely an example to all.\n\nMiss Delaney and her sister are the sole support of aged parents. Her dismissal, coming at this time causes a hardship which might easily have been avoided and which should have been avoided by anyone with a proper sense of justice and honesty of purpose.\nIn addition to these reasons Miss Delaney has lost her identity in the schools of the province and the twelve or more years she has taught in the Indian School at Brompton cannot warrant the teacher superannuation in this province.\n\nIt is said that 1st class teachers are required for Indian Schools today because Miss Delaney missed hers only by accident. Neither can I understand why this should have any bearing, as at Deans, Kingaclear, and at other points 2nd class teachers are employed. If this requirement be a new ruling, why in the name of justice make its effects retroactive?\n\nIf Father Ryan has engineered this change, I cannot understand what has come over him. He certainly must be losing a balance of mind. A year or two ago a most disgraceful exhibition of bullying occurred in the Dixon School. The same thing at school must be repeated at Brompton.\n\nThe different Pastors at Deans, Kingaclear, Madstock etc., care for their government charges at considerable trouble and also personal expense. We feel that we ought at least be extended the courtesy of a consultation in any contemplated changes of teachers. Neither can we understand why a teacher of the parish, in which the reservation is situated, might not be employed, rather than having one brought\nfrom the District in which the Reverend Inspector resides.\n\nHoping that my plea for justice in this case may be given satisfactory consideration.\n\nI remain\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nC. T. Boyd, P.P.\n\nPetersville\n\nQueens Co.\n\n7.5\nOttawa, July 21, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding Miss Eileen Delaney, who has been teaching at the Cromocto Indian Day School.\n\nReverend F.

It therefore gives me pleasure to state that I have known this young woman for some years and that her character and conduct are of the very highest.\n\nRecently I have seen a copy of a letter sent the Department by the Rev. C. Boyd of Petersville, N.B., in which he states that the former teacher at Oromocto, Miss Delaney, has been replaced by the Inspector of Indian Schools, Rev. F.C. Ryan, in favor of an inexperienced teacher and a parishioner of Fr. Ryans. In the interests of truth allow me to state that Miss Scott is not inexperienced but has successfully filled the position of teacher at Bartibog Bridge, N.B., during two years and further that far from being a parishioner of Fr. Ryans, she lives in my parish. Furthermore, to my certain knowledge, she never at any time made Fr. Ryan's acquaintance, nor had any correspondence with him previous to her appointment as teacher at Oromocto. Moreover, she was recommended to the Inspector neither by myself nor anyone else, but obtained his approval by her own record and merits.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. W.J.

Mr. Green and his men doing their engaged in cleaning the cellar ceiling in position and doing the work as specified. I would call the Dept.'s attention however to the fact that the plans suffered a slight alteration as to the carrying timber in cellar in as much as the contractor could not possibly carry out the plans for stairway. Furthermore he does not believe that according to plans the carrying timbers would be across stairs leaving only 3 ft. of head room rendering it difficult for any body to go up and down cellar stairs. Therefore I am sure carrying timber where it interfered with going up and down stairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

File 56-3-5. This letter refers to the drainage from the grounds at the back of the Oromocto Indian School, to stop the water from soaking into the cellar. There is a drain there now, with a three inch pipe in it, but this is useless. I would recommend a drain be dug from the west side of the school, and continued easterly to the highway road, a distance of twenty-two rods. There is a gradual slope from the school to the road. The drain should be dug about one foot below the bottom of the cellar, then filled with rough rock. This was done at Woodstock School, and has greatly improved the condition. The approximate cost would be seventy-five dollars.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, June 19, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the drainage from the cellar of the Oromocto Indian Day School, and stating what you would recommend be done in the matter.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that you may have a drain dug from the west side of the school and continued easterly to the highway. This drain should be dug about one foot below the floor level of the cellar and filled in with broken rock. This is the same arrangement as was made for drainage at the Woodstock School, which, we understand, is successful. You should arrange to have this work carried out during the coming summer holidays, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed. The cost should be kept as low as possible, and should not exceed your estimate of approximately $75. When this work is completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelative to the interior painting of the school building, I have to request that you will forward an estimate of the cost of having this work carried out, stating definitely what painting you would recommend be performed. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing having the work done. Please give this matter your early attention, as, if it is decided to have the painting carried out, it should be done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the Oromocto Indian Day School, recommends that the interior of the school building be thoroughly cleaned and painted. You have already referred to this matter and have been requested to furnish an estimate of the cost at the earliest possible date. The floor should also be thoroughly scrubbed and oiled.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the attendance. He states that the children of some of the families who receive relief do not attend regularly. You should notify the parents or guardians in each case that consideration will have to be given to the cutting down of relief supplies if their children do not attend regularly after the school re-opens. It is thought that if you took a strong stand with the delinquent parents that there would be a larger and more regular attendance.

When I gave this estimate, I thought that there were plenty of rocks on or near the reserve, but there were none. What rocks I used had to be hauled two and one half miles. This meant an extra expenditure. It has cost twenty-five dollars for the rock delivered. These I used around the school, from there to the highway I am using 4 inch tile pipe, which will be just as serviceable as the rock. I would recommend an extra expenditure of twenty-five dollars, a total of one hundred dollars, as it will require that amount to pay for work and material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, September 13, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to digging a drain and filling it with rock at the Oromocto Indian Day School.

This list should be handed to you at the end of each month, and you should prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the amount due and forward same to the Department, with the list attached showing the quantity of milk delivered at each school. A separate account should be forwarded covering the cost of the milk supplied each school.\n\nThe teacher should see that the milk is received in clean containers and that it is kept in a sanitary condition, also that the full quantity received is used by the pupils each day, without waste.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. H. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\nTO B.J. Griffiths Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\n\nSIR:\n\nI recommend that the school children of Oromocto Reserve be supplied with milk for lunches through the winter months, as in previous winters, also bread and butter. It would require 5 loaves of bread and one pound of butter weekly for this school. One small nail brush is also required.\n\nMy reason for making this recommendation is that the families on this reserve seem poor and improvident. If the children were given a good morning lunch they would be in better condition to resist colds and other diseases through the winter months. The nail brush is needed to help the children to keep their hands clean.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH NURSE\n| Date   | Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|--------|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| May 13 | 2 soap                       |          |            |       |\n|        | 2 oxgall                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 1 Bodlam                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 25                           |          |            |       |\n|        | 2 soap                       |          |            |       |\n|        | 2 oxgall                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 1 gal gas                     |          |            |       |\n|        | 2 oxgall                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 4 soap                       |          |            |       |\n| July 9 | 2 gal                        |          |            |       |\n|        | 15x16 DT                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 70                           |          |            |       |\n|        | 18 glass                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 29x30 DT                      |          |            |       |\n|        | 125                          |          |            |       |\n|        | 2 sandpaper                   |          |            |       |\n|        | 5                            |          |            |       |\n|        | 1 w. wash Brush              |          |            |       |\n|        | 50                            |          |            |       |\n|        |                               |          |            | 65.50 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, in a report on his inspection on the 4th instant of the Cromocto Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the roof of the school building. He recommends that the shingles be replaced where they have fallen out, and that the roof be repaired. He states that the steel ceiling should be painted with a coat of proper paint to overcome its present condition before receiving a final coat, and that a competent painter should do the work.\n\nI would request that you furnish an estimate of the cost of the above repairs, stating how you would recommend that the labour be carried out.\n\nYou should arrange during the summer to have the toilets cleaned out and placed in a good, sanitary condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nJune 28th, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the outhouse building of the Cromcote Indian School needs repairing. The sills have rotted, and the building has settled. The doors will not open; the roof needs repairing; also the saddle board is off. There is a new box needed, as the one in use is now so rotted that it cannot be moved to be cleaned. Also, there are two lights out of the cellar windows. One of the buttments by the steps going into the school needs repairing, as the bricks have chipped, and some have fallen out.\n\nIt is impossible to give the exact cost of material and work, but I do not think it can be done for less than $30.00. The outhouse will have to be blocked up to get underneath to do the work. I would recommend that this work be done during the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 18, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the outbuilding at the Oromocto Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of an expenditure, not to exceed the sum of $30.00, in having the out-house thoroughly repaired and placed in good condition. You should arrange for the purchase of any materials required and for the labour. You may also have two lights installed in the cellar windows and the buttments by the steps of the school repaired. You should see that all work is satisfactorily completed and at as low a cost as possible.\n\nPlease forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the material and labour. Regarding the labour, you should state definitely the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. This work should be completed before the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.

Also seven panes of glass in the basement need replacing.\n\nI beg to recommend a skilled painter be employed with an Indian as helper to do this work. I can hire such a man for $2.50 per day. It will take approximately five days.\n\nAug. 8/38\n\n379 Saunders Street,\nFredericton, N.B.\nto do this work properly.\n\nI herewith submit cost of paint, wire brush etc. for your approval.\n\n2 gals. paint @ 3.75 per gal. ...... $ 7.50\nwire brush .50\nglass, putty and sponge 4.42\nlumber for fence & plans 2.80\nLabor 1 @ 3.50 per dy. 3.50\n// in relief for Indian 5.00\n\n$25.72\n\nI trust the Department will grant this amount. There is much work to be done in the schools of this district and only a very short time left before the children will again be learning their studies and work will be impossible.\n\nI find on the files in my possession authority for work to be done on Indian Day schools at Tinguelear, St. Mary's and Woodstock.

Lee MacCutcheon, I inspected the Heating System at the Oromocto Reserve School, and find the fire pot is cracked in three places. The steel necks which connect the radiator to the front casting have rusted through in several places, these, have holes in them as big as a twenty-five cent piece. I consider this very dangerous if left in this condition, as it is possible for fire to pass through the tubes directly into the hot air leads. This could be temporarily repaired, with sheet iron and cement, making it safe for the balance of the heating season.\n\nGenerally speaking, I would not recommend trying to operate this furnace another season. Taking into consideration the general condition of the furnace, I also noted that the furnace has 5 hot air leads coming off, which has equivalent of 250 Sq. in. with 2-8\" return leads equivalent to 100 Sq. in. This furnace should have at least another 150 Sq. in. of cold air to balance up the hot air capacity.\n\nThe cost of making the temporary repairs, of cementing the fire pot and the steel necks would be, thirteen ($13.00) Dollars.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.J.G./B.M.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B.,\nMarch 6th, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe first of the month I instructed the Janitor of the Oromocto School to scrub the floor and oil it. I took particular pains to show him how to heat the oil and how to apply it, but to my disgust when I returned to see the work, he had put the oil on cold with a broom. The children were slipping all over the floor and the grit and sand and dust was all mixed up with the oil and tramped into the floor.\n\nIt was the worst mess I ever saw. Let me assure you, Sir, that the janitor got a severe reprimand, and if he does not do better I am going to get rid of him at the end of this month.\n\nFriday night after school, I took a man and we went to Oromocto. I had the Indians scrub the floor and rescrub it. Then we treated it with Turpentine. I went down again Saturday morning and the floor was sand watered and scraped and treated with hot oil. It will take me some time before this floor will be as I want it. I purchased a gallon of turpentine, a gallon of Hippo oil and will send an account for the man's labour for $8.00.\n\nTrusting the Department approves of my action,\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nR.

Some little repairs about school and out houses are required. The interior of out houses should be whitewashed, cleaned etc.\nOttawa,\nJune 22, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $200.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the day schools in your Agency. Yesterday I wrote to you regarding the Kingsclear School. Today I am in receipt of Father Ryan's report of the 4th instant regarding the Oromocto School in which he recommends the painting of both the interior and exterior of the school. It is doubtful if we will have funds to do this work but you might let me know the cost of painting both the interior and exterior. A separate estimate should be forwarded as we might be able to do only one. The Inspector also states that some small repairs are required and that the toilets should be whitewashed. These will not involve any heavy expenditure and you may arrange for the necessary work before the schools re-open after the summer holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. R.

This would be a job for a painter with an Indian helper. The ceilings will have to be steel brushed and of course, it will involve an expenditure of more than 50 dollars.\n\nI would ask permission to have a painter (one recommended to me by the correct persons) give me an estimate of this, so that I may submit same to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nR.

I note that Father Ryan recommends that the Oromocto School be painted both on the interior and exterior. This is quite out of the question with the amount of money we have. The school is in need of paint on the outside. The interior, with the exception of the ceiling is in very good condition, and even the outside of this school does not need painting as badly as the school at Kingsclear; however, I would ask for authority to expend $50 dollars at the Oromocto School for cleaning walls, floors, desks, outhouses, etc., Indians to do the work.\n\nAttached please find an estimate supplied by Austin Smith, white man of Oromocto, recommended to me by the correct persons. I would ask authority to employ Mr. Smith to remove the old paint from the ceiling and repaint it. Material and labour to cost $50.45. The estimated cost of work to be done in the four schools $120.45. This will leave a small surplus for making small repairs during the coming year and I feel under the circumstances, that with the painting of the\nthe ceiling at Cromocto and cleaning of the other schools, we can get along very nicely this year.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nR.

I proceeded to bring the matter to your attention and I take this opportunity of doing so. I am, however, of the opinion that a school house is not very much needed by this band. There is an English school within two miles from the reserve and if the Indians were very desirous of educating their children there would be no difficulty in sending them to this school.\n\nThe Indian School at Bel Ground where there is a much larger Indian population is not a success owing to the indifference of the Indians. During the last quarter there were only eight pupils enrolled and an average attendance of five. It is questionable whether the work done at this school justifies the expenditure for teachers' salaries. On the other hand, the work being done in the schools at Point Church and\nBig Cone where the Indians affect to take more interest in the matter of education.\n\nSome opinion that a school at Red Bank would not be a success. In any case of the Indians there are directors of education whose children I can see no reason why they should not take advantage of the white schools in the vicinity.\n\nYours obdly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thomas, Chief of the Red Bank Indians, who called at the Department today, states that his children are not allowed to attend the white school at South Esk any longer as the Trustees decline to receive them unless paid for. In this connection I beg to refer you to previous correspondence on the subject of obtaining educational facilities for the children of this reserve, and particularly to official letters of the 23rd and 26th April 1899 in which you informed that the Department would be willing to pay for the tuition of Indian children attending a white school on receipt of the usual return and requisition and you were then asked to try and induce the Indians to send their children to either of the white schools in the neighborhood of their reserve.\n\nThe Department would like to know what action you take, if any, in regard to this matter. If the Trustees of the white schools have any claim against the Department for the tuition of Indian pupils, duly certified accounts should be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nThe Department wishes you to notify the Trustees of\n\nW.D. Carter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nof white schools in the neighborhood of Indian Reserves without schools of their own, of its willingness to pay for the tuition of Indian children at the rate of fifty cents a month on the above terms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\nNew Brunswick,\nNortheastern Division,\nRichibucto, 15th Feb'y. 1905.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter of the 10th instant, I have to report that I have on more than one occasion called on the Indians of Red Bank having children of school age and requested them to send their children to school. There are two white schools in the vicinity at either of which they could have attended. Tenas did send one of his children for some time and informed me that he paid for their tuition himself. I informed him and the others that the Department would pay these bills if they were sent me and asked him to send them but he stated he would not ask for payment, that he was able to pay himself. At that time he was very much dissatisfied because the people would not build an Indian school at Red Bank. The next time I visited the reserve I again brought up the subject with him and he then said he would send me the bills for tuition, but he never did so. At that time the both white schools in the vicinity were quite willing to receive Indian pupils and I have never heard that they have since refused to do so. I very much doubt his statement that any pupil has ever been refused but will at once make inquiries. Tenas is still agitating to have an Indian school at Red Bank and I think the object\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6066, file 282-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nhe has in view is to try to induce the dept to build one. I may say that I have made a special effort to have these and other Indians not having a school on the reserve send their children to white schools but have met with success only at Indian Island and Auctoucho.

I would also suggest that even if the Department find themselves unable to build a school this year it might be advisable to purchase the land now as it could probably be purchased more cheaply now than later.\n\nThe recent heavy freshets on the Mirimichi have done considerable damage to the roads and bridges in the vicinity of Red Bank reserve and the Red Bank band through their Chief, have asked me to apply to the Department for a grant of $200 to assist them in making a road and building two bridges. do not feel that can make any recommendations on the matter until I have visited the reserve, which will be shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa, August 23, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, in which you state that the Chief of the Red Bank Band informs you that Henry Cloud, from whom the Department rented the building now used as a school house will require the building this fall and if he does there is no other building in the vicinity that can be used as a school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as the Department has gone to the expense of fitting up this building, it claims that it should be allowed to use it until such time as another can be erected, especially as it is paying a liberal rent for it.\n\nThe Department would like to know where a suitable site can be purchased for a new building and at what cost.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the appointment of Miss Martha Isaacs to the position as teacher of the Red Bank Indian Day School, and recommend that she be given a trial.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may appoint Miss Isaacs as teacher of this school, provided you are satisfied that her services would be satisfactory. You should inform her that her remaining in the position depends on the success with which she meets in the work. The Department will allow her a salary at the rate of $400.00 a year, the same as was paid the former teacher. You will be good enough to inform the Department as to whether Miss Isaacs accepts this position and, if so, the date on which she begins duties. You should give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the school may be re-opened on or about the 2nd of September, next.\n\nYou should also inform Mr. Superintendent Sheridan regarding the appointment of Miss Isaacs.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Tobique School I beg to say that the Department will await the receipt of the application from Miss Evelyn Holland, whom you state is applying for the position.

Schools.\n\nRev. sir dear father,\n\nI again beg of you to assist me. I do not like to bother you, Father, but in a case like this, I have no confidence in anyone but you.\n\nI am having trouble continuously with the chief, he wants the Dept. to give me a sudden dismissal. He came to my school today and gave me a warning to go, that he was going to have me dismissed immediately. You should now advise the Dept. not to take heed of his complaints, for no doubt he already sent another report to the Dept. against me.\n\nHe even accused me of about the coal shortage, what I did with the coal, and also said that he has more authority over Red Bank school than you have. I sincerely hope, dear father, you will help me out, in this case.\n\nI remain\n\nyour respectfully,\nMartha Isaac\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 29, 1920.\n\nSir,-\n\nA report has been received from Miss Isaacs, teacher of the Red Bank Indian Day School, in which she states that the school was closed since February 26th on account of a shortage of fuel.\n\nIt is considered that an ample supply of coal was furnished for the use of this school and, unless there is great waste or the coal is being stolen, the Department cannot understand why so much coal is consumed at this school.\n\nYou will be good enough to purchase a supply sufficient for the needs of the school till the warm weather arrives. You should obtain prices from a number of dealers and purchase the coal from the one quoting the lowest price. In making the purchase you should be guided in all respects by the requirements of the War Purchasing Commission. You will be good enough to give this matter your prompt attention and have the coal supplied to the school at once.\n\nMiss Isaacs states that the janitor, Chief John Tenass, has resigned and appointed another man, Harry Condo, who does not perform his work in a satisfactory manner. You will also be good enough to look into this question of the janitor and advise the Department.\n\nThe teacher states that the place where the coal is kept was open all winter. Some arrangement should be made to keep the coal under lock and key and the janitor should be responsible to see that there is no waste and that none of the coal is stolen.\n\nJohn Sheridan, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nThe teacher also reports having trouble continually with the Chief, who has threatened her with dismissal. You will be good enough to advise the Chief that he has no authority whatever to dismiss the teacher and that he should do his duty and endeavour to have the Indian children attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 29, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter which you forwarded from Miss Martha Isaacs, teacher of the Red Bank Indian Day School, dated the 20th instant, regarding the trouble she is having with the Chief, who, she states, wishes to have her dismissed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may inform Miss Isaacs that the Chief has no authority to dismiss her. She should, however, endeavour to use tact in dealing with the Indians, and it is hoped that no further trouble will arise in her dealings with the Chief and other members of the band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Both yourself and your wife should cease causing any further disturbance or interfering with the work of the teacher, and you should endeavour to help the teacher in every way possible and encourage the Indian parents to send their children regularly to school.

However, as the Indians express a desire to retain Miss Isaacs' services the Department will consent to her remaining for a further period. Should further trouble, however, occur after this school re-opens in September, next, a new teacher will have to be secured. Miss Isaacs may, therefore, remain in charge at Red Bank and Miss Taylor is to remain at Eel Ground. You will be good enough to inform these teachers accordingly. Miss Isaacs should understand that, if there are any further complaints, it will be necessary to make a change at the Red Bank School.\n\nYour remarks re.

They state that the Chief is the only one who wishes a change.\n\nIt was considered that, in view of the trouble that had occurred during the past year between Miss Isaacs and the Chief, it would be better to arrange for a transfer. However, as the Indians express a wish to retain her services, the Department will agree to her remaining for a further period on the understanding, however, that should any further trouble occur a change of teachers will have to be made. Inspector Ryan is being informed accordingly.\n\nOn May 10th, last, you were requested to state whether you considered that it would be advisable to appoint a new truant officer and caretaker for this school in place of the Chief. If this were done it might avoid trouble that was occasioned in the past. The Department will be pleased to have your views regarding the appointment of another truant officer.

Smith and Julia Jerome Smith.\n\nP. Duffey\n\nThe above is as found in the Church records at St. Thomas Church, Red Bank, N.B. Given by me the undersigned at the said Parish of St. Thomas, N.B., Canada on this the 26th April 1928.\n\nJ. E. Ryan\n\nThis is the B.F. certificate signed by Raymond Young.\nMrs. P. Young's visit to the school was on her son's account. She came in and I understood wanted to fight. This was on the 18th. She kept the school in trouble for some months. The Police Officer was about getting ready to take the young lad to Newcastle. I only learned this also today from the teacher.\nDear Sirs:\n\nOn several occasions, our Red Bank, Ind. day school has been visited in past years by two of our Ind. women (I am pleased to say their standing on the Reserve is not very good,) who, ever some trifling affair re. their children, have during school hours, used very vile language against the teacher & & before the pupils -- Just this week such has been repeated again, I have resolved to put an end to such at once, before taking the step I thought to consult with the Dept. and have the Dept. write a letter to each of the offenders - both are receiving Gov. aid.\n\nThe guilty parties are Mrs Mary Sylvester Ward, and Mrs Philip Young, (Red Bank, Ind. Reserve). This case will get them another case that developed this week - that of Raymond Young, the 13 year old son of this famous Mrs. P. Young,\n\nthe teacher, Mrs. Keene, lost her watch. It was reported that the said Raymond Young found same, I brought him & his father to my office, after some trouble the young lad said he found the watch and hid same under an old tree, later he said he sold the watch to a constable but I do not know. The officer took the boy before the police magistrate, the Matonet boy was summoned - then at court - the said Raymond Young told the court he only said that he sold this boy the watch thinking he would get clear, however he informed the court, that he found the watch and hid it under a tree, so the court sent him back with Copp - the police officer, but no watch was found, I called up the Police magistrate re. the case, he said he could do nothing, as the young lad lied in every way, so that nothing could be done.\n\nOn account of the scandal before all the school children, I had the teacher give the Ind. children a good lecture, and order this child to leave the school room until something could be done to clear up the matter.\n\nWe fear he sold the watch and we are offering a reward for its recovery and publishing it all over the country. He told me he sold it for $50 cash.\n\nHe is a bright child, and the first Ind. child that I have ever met that will look you in the face and lie as fast as he can talk. We are certainly up against a \"SOMETHING\" - Mrs Keene is about discouraged.\n\nAny suggestions on the subject of the above would be gratefully received. This Young family draws AID MONEY, and for this very boy, again I fear to let him at school with the other children, -- I really do not know what to do with the case.\n\nJ. C. Ryan\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6066, file 282-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, April 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Rev. Father Ryan, in which he states that on several occasions two Indian women of the Reserve visited the Red Bank School and caused a disturbance. He states the names of these women are Mrs. Mary Sylvester Ward and Mrs. Philip Young. Mrs. Ward's last offence in disturbing the school was on the 19th instant. Father Ryan states that the teacher ordered Mrs. Ward to leave the school, but she said that she would stay as long as she wanted, and she kept the school in an uproar for ten minutes. He states that both these families are receiving relief, and asks that some action be taken to prevent further disturbance on the part of these women, and that the relief granted them be cancelled, pending their future good conduct.\n\nI have to request that on the occasion of your next visit to this Reserve you will enquire into the case of the disturbance at the school, and notify these women that, if there is any further complaint, steps will be taken to have them prosecuted by a magistrate. It is thought that you will be visiting Red Bank in the near future in connection with various matters affecting this Reserve, and you should then deal fully with the complaints above referred to. These two women should be made to understand that they are not to interfere with the teacher, or with the work of the classes in the school.\n\nRev. Father Ryan further states that the teacher lost her watch, and it was reported that one of the Indian pupils, Raymond Young, a son of one of the women mentioned above, found same. Father Ryan had the constable take this boy before the police magistrate, but the case was dismissed for want of the necessary evidence as to the boy's guilt. You might make enquiry into this matter also.\n\nIt would be advisable to consult Father Ryan and the teacher regarding all the above complaints. After your visit, you should report fully to the Department any action taken. We are informing Father Ryan that the matters complained of have been placed in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.

This repair was done in 1926, and I remember of asking Mr. Tozer to do it but I cannot find where I informed the Department about it. It was done after an Indian had broken out of the lockup, and had to be done immediately.\n\nThe other charge: for driving Indians to Newcastle to give evidence.

They state, that there are 14 children that are now ready to go to school and are unable to do so on account of their being no school upon the said reserve and no white school in the immediate proximity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 6, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo stating that the Indians of the Red Bank Band are anxious to have a school established on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you are satisfied that there will be enough children to school age to justify the Department in re-opening the school there, it would be inclined to do so, provided there is a building suitable for the purpose. If the old building is still available I should like to have an estimate of the probable cost of putting it in repair to open the school after the summer holidays and you should also state whether it would be possible to engage the services of a suitable teacher to take charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Rei Bank Indian school, and in reply I may say, that I am making enquiries as to the possibility of getting a suitable house for a school house. I do not think that the old building is in existence, as my attention has never been called to it at any time I visited the reserve.\n\nI do not consider that there will be any difficulty in obtaining the services of a suitable teacher to take charge of this school, and have now already a person in view.\n\nAs soon as I can get definite information in regard to the building, I shall communicate with you again upon the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your communication of the above number regarding the opening of a school on the Rei Bank Indian Reserve, the Chief writes me, in answer to my enquiry, that there are no available building that can be repaired for this purpose, and he is desirous that a new school house be erected.\n\nI think however, that I may be able to secure a suitable building and intend visiting the reserve in the course of a few days and will then report more fully upon the matter. I may also say, that the Rev.

It will require about $25.00 to repair the same in addition to small outbuildings which will have to be erected. These repairs must be done at the expense of the Department.\n\nI would suggest in the event of the trial school being opened, that the seats and desks now used at the trial school at Eel River Reserve be transferred to this school at Rei Bank, and that new metal desks and seats metal bottom and hardwood tops, be procured for the new school at Eel River. I may also say, that I do not think there will be any difficulty in securing a suitable teacher to take the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 27th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant with further reference to the re-establishment of a school at Red Bank and stating that you can secure a small house for the accommodation of the school at a rental of $6.00 - a month, but that it will require about $25.00 worth of repairs in addition to some small outbuildings which ought to be erected. In reply I beg to say that provided you are satisfied that you will be able to secure a suitable teacher to take charge of this school, the repairs may be made and the Department will pay the rent specified and you may have the seats and desks now in use in the school at Bel River Reserve transferred to Red Bank.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

In the event of the Department deciding to erect a small building, you might state whether you know of any competent person who would undertake to put up a small building by day labor and whether building material is readily available, the Department to supply the material from the funds of the Band. It would hardly appear advisable to prepare an elaborate plan and specification and call for tenders for a building to accommodate an average of ten pupils.

You should say how they arrange payments between themselves and you should also state why Allan Tozer endorsed a cheque drawn in favour of Elvin Tozer, using the name of the payee, and also writing his own name as endorser, thereby showing that he received payment of the amount thereof. Apparently it was a matter immaterial which name was on the cheque referred to, as while it was drawn in favour of Elvin Tozer, it was cashed by Allan Tozer. I have also to point out that the signature of the latter as it appears on cheques is entirely different from his signature on time sheets for labour, which sheets supposedly were signed in his own writing, as foreman of the work done.

The teacher wanted a book cupboard, the size and cost of same I am enclosing. We could not get a book cupboard from any of the furniture dealers for less than $25.00.

It is considered that a building of much cheaper construction would be suitable for the purpose, it not being necessary to use the quality and size of the material mentioned in the quotation of Mr. Allan Tozer. You should endeavour to obtain a price for a much cheaper type of building and one which would meet the demands for which it is required. The Department could not undertake any such expenditure in the erection of a coal and wood shed as that furnished by the estimate which you submitted.\n\nWith reference to the cupboard I beg to say that you may arrange with Allan Tozer to build this cupboard for the storing of books, school material, etc. It should be six feet high, three feet wide and fourteen inches in depth, with six shelves, and to be of the same kind of wood as used in the interior of the school. The cupboard should also be completed with door, hinges and lock and the work should be done for the amount not to exceed the estimate submitted by Mr. Tozer, namely, $13.00. If he will undertake the work for this amount you may authorize him to do so and, when completed, you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, for the amount due.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Although building from ground is all done in matched lumber, yet in places this is broken and the ground has been either washed away or blown away so that cold winds and frost enter under buildings.\n\nThere are no double windows for this school.

They said that Stanley Doran, the blacksmith, had stated that, on the authority of the Chief, he had removed five bags of coal, which he had not returned. The Chief had no authority to grant permission to anyone to take away coal and you will be good enough to inform him accordingly. You should inform Doran that it is expected that he will return the quantity of coal taken by him at once. The Indians and others should understand that this coal is supplied for the use of the school only and must not be used for other purposes.\n\nIn November, last, you submitted an estimate of the cost of erecting a combined coal and wood shed for this school, but, as the price was considered excessive, you were requested to endeavour to obtain a price for another cheaper type of building. The Indians request that the labour in erecting a combined shed which would serve the purpose be performed by the Indians. It is now too late in the season to do anything this winter, but the erection of this shed should not be lost sight of and you should draw it to the attention of the Department in the spring. It is considered that, if the lumber were supplied, the Indians could perform the labour themselves and the total cost should not exceed $75.00, as the Department has had similar work done at the school for that amount. It will be necessary in the construction of the shed to provide separate bins for the coal and wood. The bin for the coal should be floored. You should try and have the necessary arrangements made to have this work undertaken in the spring and should be prepared to furnish an estimate of the material required and the cost of the labour when you bring the matter to the attention of the Department next spring.\n\nThere is no well in connection with the school and I shall be pleased if you will submit an estimate of the cost of having a suitable well dug or drilled, including the cost of the pump and other material required.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from you in due course regarding the above matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You will be good enough to arrange for the purchase and delivery of a stove of the type suitable for the use of the school. If possible, prices should be obtained from number of dealers, and the purchase made from the one quoting the lowest price. If any new stove pipes are required, you should also arrange for the purchase of same.

Father Ryan, in a report on his inspection of the Red Bank Indian Day School, recommends that the interior of the school building be well washed with soap and water and, when dry, given a good coat of hard varnish. He also requests that the interior of the teacher's house be painted. This building has not been in use for about two years, and, as a new teacher is being engaged who will occupy the house, Father Ryan recommends that the building be placed in good condition. He further requests that the woodshed be painted, and that several of the desks be cut down to provide suitable seating accommodation for the smaller children.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will make the necessary arrangements to have the interior of the school building thoroughly cleaned and given one coat of varnish. You may also arrange to have the interior of the teacher's house painted. Only the work considered necessary by you in this house should be carried out. A brighter colour of paint than that at present on the interior of the building should be used. You should also arrange to have any painting required to the woodshed carried out, and the desks cut down to meet the requirements. It would be well for you to consult Father Ryan regarding the above painting, and it may be possible that he can arrange for the labour required. You, however, should arrange for the purchase of the materials. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and proper vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost of the paint, varnish, etc., supplied and for the labour employed. This work should, if possible, be completed during the present summer holidays, and it should, therefore, receive your early attention.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered 20 yards of gingham of a good quality to be used by the teacher in having the older girls make up aprons and dresses. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering this expenditure.\n\nThe necessary quantity of khaki which you have received should be supplied this school.\n\nInspector Ryan states that he has a good teacher in view for this school for next year.

I am sorry to say that I have not any authority for this expense; When I visited the reserve on August 25th, just before the school opened I found that the toilets needed to be cleaned, and also that there was no kindling wood, which was needed as soon as school opened; and I arranged with Ward to do this work, and furnish the wood; I intended to write and explain about it to you as soon as I returned home, but somehow it escaped my memory and I never thought about it again until I received his bill.

The exterior walls require painting with two coats of good paint.\n\nThere is a small residence provided for the teacher. This building also requires to be painted with two coats of paint on the outside. We have very fine buildings on this reserve and when painted they will be a credit to the Department.\n\nThe interior of the school building is sheeted with pine sheeting and has hard wood floor. The desks were in good condition and the classroom presented a very attractive appearance.\n\nOur Agent could arrange next spring for the labour in painting the buildings and also for the purchase of the paint, oil, etc., required. I am unable to give an estimate of what this work would cost, but strongly recommend that it be carried out next summer. While at the school I was accompanied by Mr. Agent Hudson and Rev. Father Ryan. I authorized the Agent to have a small table installed in the classroom for the cutting of garments and also to buy a small quantity of sewing material and slates. He will forward account for this expenditure in the usual manner.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The roof on the east side of the school building requires reshingling, using creosote stain shingles. The shingles on the west side of the roof should be resailed where required, and the old shingles creosoted over. The exterior walls of the building, windows and doors require to be painted with two coats of good paint. The teacher's residence also requires painting on the outside with two coats of paint.\n\nPlease state whether you can arrange to have the above work carried out during the coming summer holidays, all work to be done by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman, you to purchase the shingles, paints, oils, etc., required, after obtaining competitive prices, and keep proper time sheets of the labour employed. I have to request that you will, as you consider convenient, give the information asked for regarding the carrying out of this work, stating approximately the amount of work you would recommend be done. When your reply is received, consideration will be given to authorizing you to purchase the materials and have the work completed.\n\nThe Department understands that the building used as a jail and which is located on the school grounds requires repainting with two coats of paint on the outside. You might furnish a separate estimate of the cost of having this work done. There are no funds specially provided but, when your estimate as to the cost is received, consideration will be given to having the work performed at the same time as the other work is being carried out at the school and teacher's residence.\n\nIt would, no doubt, be advisable for you to consult Rev.

The whole interior of this school is finished in Douglas fir. It was varnished some eight years ago. It is only a small school and would not take much. The ten desks could also be varnished, and the floor oiled, after being well washed.\n\n\"The closets should be cleaned, repaired and whitewashed - some repairs on the school step, etc.\"\n\nPlease let me have an estimate of the cost of the work recommended by Father Ryan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

The teachers residence which is a small separate building should have a coat of paint also. The expense for this work, material and labour will be about $250.00.\n\nWith regard to the Indian Island day school, I would sooner wait until Mr. Phalen views the situation, as the building there is very small and probably the Department would build a new one. The building there is rented from an Indian.\n\nI would recommend that whatever work is to be done on those school buildings, should be commenced as soon as possible after the schools close for summer vacation.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th ultimo, I regret that no funds were provided in the present year's appropriation for painting the exterior of the Red Bank Indian Day School.\n\nWhen reporting on his recent visit at this school, Inspector Ryan stated that the interior should be varnished in order to preserve the wood. Please let me know what it would cost to do this work, as it is possible we might be able to provide funds for the purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the heating of the Red Bank Indian Day school, it has been done with a coal heater in previous years. The heater now has to be renewed before the weather gets cold, and I was thinking that it will be less expensive if a wood burning stove was installed instead of coal. This school is located in a district where there is abundance of good wood available and I don't see why a considerable expense could not be saved by using wood instead of coal. In the first place a wood-burning stove will only cost about half as much as a coal stove, and I know the wood will cost less.\n\nIf you have already arranged for the purchase of the coal it will be inconvenient to change your plans, but if not, I would recommend that wood would be used in future instead of coal for this school. Please let me know what you consider would best in this case.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This heater is so constructed as to cause a circulation of the air and heat through the entire room at an even temperature, and so does not make it uncomfortable for those who sit near it in school.

I wish to say that the two firms mentioned did not quote exactly the same prices but the difference is negligible. In both instances quotations are subject to change to prevailing prices on date of delivery and are not F.O.B. school. Delivery of these materials would be made to the school by agency truck. Indian labour will be employed but I know of no Indian on the reserve, capable of taking charge of this work.\n\nThe sum of $297.50 is a careful estimate of the cost of labour to complete this work but I can not guarantee that this amount will not be exceeded.\n\nIn our letters of April 23rd and April 26th instant, further authority was requested for repairs to school buildings at Burnt Church and Big Cove Reserves. If all of this work can not be authorized this year, I respectfully suggest that the Burnt Church buildings be given priority.\n\nE.J. Blakey,\nSupt.,\nN.B.

Therefore, the amount in the sum of $525.00 included in our estimates 1949-50 for this work will not be needed. However, as these school buildings are without foundation, it is felt that this work should be undertaken next year in order to prevent deterioration and that $1,500.00 should be included in our estimates 1949-50 for this purpose.\n\n(E.

J. Ryan\n\nSupt. Indian Schools\nExtract from teacher's report on the St. Mary's Indian day school for the year ending March 31, 1910.\n\nAny irregular attendance here is seldom caused by dislike for school. The children when here attend school well. Our Reserve is situated near the City and in a very public place and there are many things that attract the children's attention and lead them off and they forget about school for the time. I would suggest having suitable play grounds fenced in, where the children could have their own amusements. Also having prizes offered every year, something worth working for.\nReport for May 1877.\n\nPupils enrolled - 26\nBoys - 11\nGirls - 15\n\nAverage Attendance - 18\nTeaching Days - 22\nPupils in Grade I - 7\nII - 8\nIII - 5\nIV - 4\nV - 2\n\nThe pupils are all making good progress. They all come to school clean and tidy. Instruction is given every day in Hygiene and Physical Culture.\n\nMarie Rush\nTeacher\nOttawa, March 10th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nReferring to your report on the St. Mary's Indian school for the current year I beg to say that your remarks in regard to the irregular attendance have been noted.\n\nThe question of providing play grounds for this school was taken up with Rev. J. J. Ryan, Superintendent of Indian Schools, and the Department regrets that, at present, no suitable arrangements can be made.\n\nYour suggestion that prizes be offered every year is noted. The Department would be glad to know the nature of the prizes you think ought to be given, the time of year that they should be distributed and the probable cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Maria J. Rush,\nTeacher,\nSt. Mary's N.B.\nTo The Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 15th regarding the giving of prizes at the school. I think the best time to give them would be at the close of the school term in June and also at Christmas. The cost would depend on how many pupils were deserving of prizes. Very good ones could be given twice a year for about twenty dollars ($20) as the Indian children here are very fond of sports. I would suggest the giving of such prizes as sports, footballs etc., or dolls for the little ones. It would be better...\nTo give something they could take pleasure from rather than give clothes.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1910.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant in reference to the purchase of prizes for the children attending the St. Mary's Indian school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Father Ryan will be instructed to purchase for you a football and two base balls, one of them suitable for the girls, and at the end of the school term, June 30th, next, prizes to the extent of $10.00 may be awarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Maria J. Rush,\nTeacher,\nSt. Mary's, N.B.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1910.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to purchase for the teacher of the St. Mary's Indian school a football and two base balls, one of the latter suitable for the use of the girls.

The Department would have preferred to have this resignation direct and it should have been the subject of correspondence, while all inspection reports are read and acted upon as promptly as possible, in the mass of correspondence reaching the Department there is bound to be delay which is not so apt to occur with ordinary correspondence.\n\nIn regard to the applications the Department is of opinion that it would be well to appoint Mrs. Lily A. M. Canney and an initial salary of $350.00 per annum will be allowed.\n\nApplication was received sometime for the position of teacher of this school from Miss Mary T. Hughes of Fredericton and perhaps either she or Miss Hanebry would be available for the Woodstock School.

Hughes of the town of Devon, in the County of York in the Province of New Brunswick, Teacher:\n\nHumbug, therefore,\n\n1. That your petitioner has been the Teacher in charge of the Indian School at St. Mary's, in the Southwestern Agency since the September Quarter 1911.\n\n2. That your petitioner as said Teacher is being paid the salary of $450, plus a bonus of $150.\n\n3. That the sum is inadequate to meet the ever-growing expenses and increases in the necessities of life, which have advanced within the last few years more than 100 per cent.\n\n4. That the salaries paid to the Public School teachers in this vicinity, doing work\nsimilar to that of your petitioners, are now $900 per year, and said teachers have petitioned for, and expect to have granted an increase of $200, thereby making for them an annual salary of $1100.\n\nYour petitioner therefore, begs that an increase in salary be granted to her, beginning with Jan. 1st, 1920, so as to make her an annual salary of $1000.\n\nAnd, as in duty bound, will ever pray.\n\nDated this 24th day of March 1920.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn the petition hereunder Miss Mary T. Hughes, teacher of the St. Mary's School, N.B., requests an increase in her salary.\n\nMiss Hughes was appointed teacher of this school on August 28th, 1911, at a salary of $350.00, which was increased to $400.00 on January 1st, 1914, and further increased to $450.00 on July 1st, 1917. This is the salary she is now receiving, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum. Miss Hughes states that the salaries paid to the public school teachers in the vicinity doing similar work to herself are now $900.00 per annum and that they have petitioned for and expect to receive an increase of $200.00. Miss Hughes requests that her annual salary be increased to $1000.00.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 24 pupils at this school, with an average attendance of 19.\n\nMiss Hughes holds a Second Class Professional License and a special certificate for the teaching of physical culture.\n\nThe Inspector states that she has done especially good work since assuming charge of this school and that he does not think that her work could be improved on. She teaches the girls sewing and knitting and lessons are also given in hygiene. She also visits and advises the women on the reserve. The Inspector also states that the school is well managed and that, if we could get the same results in all our schools in New Brunswick, it would be most encouraging.\n\nI would\nI would recommend that Miss Hughes be granted an increase of $100.00 from the first of January, last, as there is no doubt that the present salary paid her is inadequate. She maintains the best average attendance of any of the schools in New Brunswick, and the reports on her work have always been satisfactory. If the above increase is allowed this will give her a salary at the rate of $550.00, which, with the bonus of $150.00, will make a total of $700.00.\n\nI beg to submit the above for your consideration.\nOttawa, March 31, 1920\n\nSir,\n\nThis Department has received applications for increases in salaries from several of its teachers in the Indian day schools in the Province of New Brunswick, and I would esteem it a favour if you would kindly furnish me, at your early convenience, with the following information.\n\n(1) - The average salary from all sources paid to female teachers in the rural day schools in the Counties of Carleton, York and Sunbury holding certificates of the First, Second and Third Class, respectively.\n\n(2) - The minimum and maximum salaries paid female teachers having the above grades of licenses in these three counties.\n\n(3) - Also the same information regarding male teachers in these three counties holding licenses of the First, Second and Third Class.\n\nI shall also be pleased if you will send me a copy of the last annual report of your Department.\n\nThanking you for the trouble taken in forwarding this information.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nChief Superintendent Education,\nProvince of New Brunswick,\nEducation Office,\nFredericton, N.

Carter, Esq.,\nChief Superintendent of Education,\nFredericton, N.B.\nOttawa, April 8, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the petition which you forwarded asking for an increase in your salary as teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the highest salary paid to any of the teachers in the Indian day schools in the province of New Brunswick is $500.00 per annum. They have also been receiving the bonus at the rate of $150.00.\n\nThe Annual Report of the Chief Superintendent of Education for the Province of New Brunswick for the year ending June 30th, last, shows that the average salary paid female teachers having Second Class Certificates in the county of York was $403.00 per annum. The Chief Superintendent of Education informs this Department that an increase has been made in the salaries of teachers generally in New Brunswick since that date.\n\nThe Department will allow you an increase in your present salary of $450.00 of $50.00 from the first of April, last. This will make your salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum from that date. You will also be entitled to the bonus allowed, should it be continued during the present year. It is considered that the salary you receive will compare favourably with the salaries paid to teachers having your qualifications in the schools in New Brunswick.\n\nMr. Agent Griffiths is being informed of the above increase in your salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMiss Mary T.

This increase is to date from the first of April, last.\n\nThe last Annual Report of the Superintendent of Education for the Province of New Brunswick states that the average salary paid to teachers having the qualifications which Miss Hughes possesses in the County of York was $403.00 per annum. While an increase has been granted in the salaries since that date, it considered that the salary now allowed Miss Hughes will compare favourably with the salaries paid to teachers of the same class in the common schools of the province.\n\nI may say that Miss Hughes will also be entitled to the bonus, should it be continued during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Payment at the increased rate was made you from the first of April, 1920, and the amount of the increase due was included in the cheque sent you in payment of your salary for the June quarter, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst.

In view of her ten years' services in this school, I am taking up the matter of a possible increase for the next fiscal year.\n\nThe methods in use in the primer class in connection with language were only fair, and I took the class and gave Miss Hughes some pointers in connection with initial steps in English. The reading of a Grade 5 group was excellent. In Mental Arithmetic the Senior classes showed excellent training.\n\nRussell T.

I do feel that in considering the above there will be no hesitation in granting her an increase of salary. Little could be added in suggesting further.\n\nMiss Hughes is very faithful to duty, she is giving the girls a good training in domestic work. Their sewing is wonderful.\n\nI must say that this school is well managed and under good control.\n\nF. C.

This will raise her salary from that date, at the rate of $600 per annum, and she will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nThis increase is granted in view of the excellent work being performed by Miss Hughes.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform her of the increase in salary that has been granted her.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D.

Hughes, teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School, receive a salary of five dollars per month, for teaching domestic science. This would be fifty dollars per year, beginning January 1st.

Hughes, teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that, while the Department notes the splendid work Miss Hughes is performing, it is regretted that, as our appropriation for the present fiscal year is entirely assigned, there are no funds available to provide for an increase. It is expected that Miss Hughes will continue giving instruction to the pupils in domestic science with the same success as she has in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The school room was clean and comfortable and the children, on the whole, looked fairly well clad and tidy. There did not seem to be as much impetigo contagiosa as usual, all the cases I found being amongst the pre-school children.\"\nI wish Miss Hughes would resign to make way for a younger teacher. I do feel we could get one of the Rev. Sisters to cross over from the Fredericton Convent and teach in this school, or some good, smart, young teacher. A Rev. Sister would be better. I think the Department has been more than generous to have retained Miss Hughes' services so long. I would be pleased to see her have the school if better work could be done. However, I have waited years for this, but all in vain.\n\nI think the Department should give her a pension and then we could get an up-to-date teacher with modern ideas of teaching.

It is considered that the carrying out of these services would not unduly interfere with her regular classroom duties. The above work is in the interests of the health of the pupils, and the Department expects that she will comply with its requirements in carrying out the above services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB. J. Griffiths, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N.B.\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn making my FALL tour of the Inspectors of our Ind. schools along the St. John river this week, I found that Miss Hughes, teacher in the North Deven Ind. school had thrown out our Cerena Readers and introduced the Canadian readers, also introduced the Ontario grammar, stating it was the desire of the Dept. to do so, and that I gave her orders to change the readers.\n\nNothing could be more false as far as the readers are concerned, I never, nor would I think of giving such an order, -It may be the same re the Ont. Grammar, perhaps your Dept. did not order such a change. Again she informed me that the Dept. intended to make further changes & in the curriculum of the N.B. Ind. schools.\n\nI might here add that our N.B. Ind. schools are enjoying a prosperity that is not surpassed in any other Prov. in Canada, but if our CURRICULUM which is the same as the White schools of N.B. is allowed to be laceraed and undermined, to suit the whim and fancy of every teacher, -as was the case when I took over these said Ind. schools,-then nothing but \"CHAOTIC CONDITIONS\" must reign and our present prosperity annulled.\n\nKindly inform Miss Hughes to fellow my directions like all our teachers are doing and have our Cerena Readers replaced in her school, also the N.E. Grammar.\n\nI must say as a teacher she has long outlived her usefulness as a progressive teacher in this school, and should be induced to give way to a younger teacher.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspector of Ind. schools for N.B.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These were not ordered and the teacher was informed that the Department desired the Canadian Catholic Corona Readers used in the St. Mary's Indian Day School. A supply of these was recently sent to her. Possibly, they had not reached the school at the time you visited it. However, a letter is being directed to her in connection with the matter.\n\nThe Department has recently been engaged in the preparation of a list of new texts which, it is considered, will be more suitable for Indian schools than those previously used. I am enclosing, for your information, one of the tentative lists of these books. During the current academic year, they are being used in many of our schools with a view to determining their usefulness. It is our intention to again review the whole list of books next summer in preparation for the academic year 1933-34. It is understood, of course, that, in the highest grade where pupils are intending to try provincial examinations, the teacher will request the books used in the province in order that the children may not be handicapped.\n\nI trust that you will give the attached list your careful consideration and, if there are any of the books mentioned in it which you would like to see, please let me know and copies will be forwarded to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, Northumberland Co.,\nN. B.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, October 14th, 1932.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is informed by Rev. F.C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, that you wish to use the Canadian Readers in the St. Mary's Indian Day School. While a requisition has been received from you for these books, they were not supplied. You were later informed that the Canadian Catholic Corema Readers should be used and an order has been placed for those requested on your requisition of September 12th. Possibly, these had not reached you when Father Ryan visited your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Mary T.

The Department has noted your remarks regarding the services of Miss Mary T. Hughes, the teacher.\n\nWhile Miss Hughes has given long service, it is considered that it would be in the interests of the work if a change were made for the school year beginning September 1, 1933. The Department will await the report on your inspection of this school next spring, and, at that time, I shall be pleased to have your opinion as to whether her services should be dispensed with at the end of the current school year, viz., June 30th, next. In view of her lengthy period in Indian school work, the Department would not like to take any immediate action in dispensing with her services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

[signature]\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour communication of the 14th inst. in regard to the use of Readers in the Indian School, has been received and its contents carefully noted.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that I think that the Canadian Catholic Corona Readers are better suited to the needs of the children of our school than are the English Readers and that I much prefer their use in our school.\n\nI sent a Requisition for the Canadian Catholic Corona Reader on Sept. 12th, and repeated the order in October and have not yet received a reply. I trust\nthat you will send the book as soon as possible.\n\nI wish to state that during all the years that I have taught this school, I have always been, and still am, willing and most anxious to comply with the wishes of the Department in performing my duties in connection with this school.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV. F. G. RYAN,\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS FOR NEW BRUNSWICK,\nDATED MAY 30, 1933, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE\nST. MARY'S INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI really do not consider that this school\nhas produced the required advanced work for some\nyears. I would certainly suggest a younger teacher,\nwho will engender new life in this school.\n\nI certainly would suggest that the Department\noffer Miss Highes a minor Indian school, say the Oromocto\nor Kingsclear School, and then exchange teachers for a\nyear or two, until we could get a good first class teacher\nin this school who would teach same for the present salary\nand give us satisfaction. If she will not accept the\nchange, then we will fill the school by a good first\nclass teacher, which can now easily be procured for the\nsame money.\n\nWould the Department look up the number of years that\nshe has held this school? It must be some 25 years. I\nwould ask the Department to take this case at once in\nhand and care for it. I will forward to the Department\nher birth certificate as soon as I have received same.\nWe must put new life in this school and get more advanced\nwork. We have gone too long in this way.\nOttawa, June 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your report on your inspection, on May 30th, last, of the St. Mary's Indian Day School. Regarding the services of Miss Mary T. Hughes, the teacher, I have to say it is considered, in view of your report, that her services should be dispensed with at the end of the present school year. Miss Hughes was appointed teacher of this school from September first, 1911. It is noted you suggest that a younger teacher be secured - one who would engender new life in this school.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to transfer Miss Hughes to either the Oromocto or the Kingsclear School and considers that it would be in the interests of the work to retire her from further teaching services in our schools. If you concur in the change of teacher for the coming academic year, I would request that you inform Miss Hughes that her services will not be required after the end of the present month.\n\nIn view of her service, the Department can allow Miss Hughes a gratuity upon retiring, equal to two months' salary. This is the full amount we can provide, under the regulations.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your prompt attention; and, if you decide that Miss Hughes' services should be dispensed with, please give her immediate notice.\n\nIn the event of Miss Hughes' retiring, it will be necessary to obtain a qualified teacher to succeed her. The salary allowed would be at the same rate as paid Miss Hughes. I shall be pleased to hear from you at an early date as to whether you have dispensed with her services \u2014, in which event a cheque could be sent her for the two months' retiring allowance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Therefore would not require your services after June the 30th, of the present year, 1933.\n\nWe are grateful for your 22 years of service, for which the Ind.

Twenty-two years ago I gave up a school in the Town of Grand Falls to enter the employ of the Department, and teach this school which I have since continued to do. I think I can safely say that I have performed my duties faithfully during all that time. It has been a difficult problem; probably more difficult from the school being in the Town of Devon and in close vicinity to the City of Fredericton than is the case of the Indian schools situated farther away from the town, yet I think the record made by the children from my school will compare favorably with that of any other Indian school in the province. I believe that the children from this school, in passing the High School Entrance, the Normal School Entrance, obtaining a Certificate in the Fredericton Business College, and in winning a Medal for excellence Essay writing etc., have accomplished more than the children from any other Indian...\nschool in this province have succeeded in doing. The records of your department must show many of these facts.\n\nWhile I am perfectly able to continue my work in the school as in the past, it will be very difficult for me, after having been out of the provincial schools for so long a time to now obtain a position at all or in any event as satisfactory a school as that which I gave up to accept the school in the Indian Department. In addition to that, if I had remained teaching in the provincial schools, I would be in line for a pension when my work of teaching was finished, which benefit is now lost to me.\n\nIf then this notice has been sent with the authority of the Department, I request that you reconsider the matter and have it withdrawn, and that the great injustice may not be done by depriving me of my work in the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMary T. Hughes.\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of the 19th instant, in connection with dispensing with the services of Miss Mary T. Hughes, teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a letter from Miss Hughes, strongly protesting against her dismissal and pointing out that she has performed very faithful services for some 22 years.\n\nMiss Hughes' letter has received very careful consideration; and, as you will agree, it will likely be impossible for her to secure another school this year. Under these circumstances, the Department is inclined to allow her to remain for one more year and would appreciate receiving your concurrence. In the event of your agreeing, the Department will write Miss Hughes, advising her that she will have to relinquish her duties at the St. Mary's Day School on June 30, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

According to this letter she has been dismissed. Perhaps it is not my affair, but Miss Hughes is one of the best teachers in my agency, or at least I think so, and I think any of the Department officials who have visited this school will agree with me. Her domestic work is a credit to any teacher, and many of her pupils who have completed their education, or the number of years they are supposed to go to school, have compared very favorably with any other Indian or white students.\n\nPerhaps I should not interfere in this matter, but I cannot understand why a teacher like Miss Hughes, who has given such satisfaction, should be dismissed.

I clearly made this known to Miss Hughes at each visit, as my reports at Ottawa will verify in the past years. Therefore, it should be the will of Miss Hughes, myself and the Dept. of Ind. education, in justice to the Ind. pupils of the said school, to give them the services of a 1st class superior teacher when the salary of such a teacher would not be greater.\n\nOn the other hand the dominant attitude that Miss Hughes has assumed towards me in the past makes it imperative that either one of us should resign.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJ.

MCGILL,\ndated June 16, 1933, to the HONOURABLE THE\nSUPERINTENDENT GENERAL, on his tour of\ninspection in the Maritime Provinces.\n\nOriginal on 536764.\n\nFrom Paragraph 4 of Report:\n\nMy first visit was to the Fredericton Agency, where I saw two reserves including the day school of each. These latter did not impress me favourably. Discipline and order seemed deficient and the attitude and appearance of the pupils indicated indolence and lack of interest.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nFredericton, N.B.,\nJuly 14th, 1933.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nMy attention has just been directed to the fact that Miss Hughes, who has given very faithful and efficient service for twenty-two years, as teacher of the St. Marys, now North Devon, Indian Day School, has received notice, dated June 21, 1933, from the Reverend Father F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, at Red Bank, Northumberland County, to the effect that it has been considered advisable to engage a first-class teacher for the term beginning September next, and therefore her services would not be required after the 30th of June, 1933. It is intimated to Miss Hughes that the Indian Department will allow her upon retiring a gratuity equal to two months salary.\n\nNow ostensibly the reason given for Miss Hughes' retirement is that the services of a first-class teacher are required. My information is that such is not the case and that Miss Hughes has done excellent work. As a matter of fact, I am advised that in days gone by her pupils have led all the other Indian pupils in the Province in essay contests, domestic science and manual science work, and other spheres of educational activity.\n\nI think it rather rough, that after twenty-two years of faithful service she should be\ndismissed peremptorily on a week's notice. If the school were being closed up, if there were any complaint against the efficiency of her service, or if any other good reason were assigned as to why she should be dismissed, one could understand the action of the Inspector, but such being not the case, I do protest against her dismissal, and would request you very earnestly to have the order countermanded, and Miss Hughes retained in the employ of the Department, especially because she has given universal satisfaction over there.\n\nIn his letter to her, the Reverend Father states that they are grateful for her 22 years of service and it is an absolute fact that there is no complaint against her.\n\nIt is a pretty serious matter to turn a woman of her age out of her employment at the present time. As a matter of fact it is rather a cruel thing.\n\nI have no doubt that if it had been intimated to Miss Hughes that she should have what is known as a first-class license she could easily qualify, and would be prepared to do so. I have therefore to very earnestly request that the order given by the Inspector be countermanded and that Miss Hughes be retained in her position. If it is necessary for her to qualify as a first-class teacher she will do so. The difference between a first and second class license in New Brunswick is not so marked as to make it impossible for her to qualify.\n\nI assure you that there is absolutely no politics behind this request. Miss Hughes has probably never voted for me and probably never will, and there is certainly one occasion on which I am quite sure she did not vote for me, so I am not writing for any personal motive, but really out of a sense of justice to her, and I appeal to you to review the circumstances in the same sense.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hughes from the position as teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School at North Devon, N. B.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I have to say that the Reverend F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick during the past two or three years has recommended that a change of teacher be made. I quote from the report on his inspection of this school, dated May 30th, last:\n\n\"I really do not consider that this school has produced the required advanced work for some years. I would certainly suggest a younger teacher, who would engender new life in this school. We must put new life in this school and get more advanced work. We have gone too long in this way.\"\n\nOn receipt of this report, the Department wrote Father Ryan, requesting him to give further consideration to the question of dispensing with Miss Hughes' services.

Under these circumstances, the Department instructed Father Ryan to notify Miss Hughes that her services would not be required after June 30th, last.\n\nI may add that, in view of her 22 years' service, arrangements are being made to allow her a gratuity equal to two months' salary.\n\nIn making this change, the Department is actuated by a desire to improve the efficiency of the work at this point, keeping in mind the fact that a considerable expenditure of public money is involved. It is intended to secure a teacher having first class qualifications.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nJuly 21, 1933.\n\nA. S.

I understand that he wishes to\ninstall a member of a religious order in place of Miss\nHughes. I may be mistaken in that, but if such is the\nintention, I protest.\n\nMiss Hughes is a good Roman Catholic\nand is a good teacher, and her dismissal after 22 years\nof faithful service is exceedingly harsh. If more ad-\nvanced work is required of Miss Hughes, I am satisfied\nthat she could attain the standard of a First Class\nteacher, or I am so assured.\n\nYou state that in making the change,\nthe Department is actuated by a desire to improve the\nefficiency of the work at this point. May I enquire\nif there has been any complaints about the efficiency\nof Miss Hughes?\n\nMy understanding is that she is a very\nefficient teacher and can ...... easily attain a First\nA. S.

(RG 10, Volume 6066, file 283-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Williams.\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter from Mr. R.B. Hanson, M.P.,\u2014\n\n\"Re Miss Mary T. Hughes, Teacher of St. Mary's Indian Day School in North Devon.\n\nA few days ago, Miss Hughes received a letter from the Inspector of Indian Schools, Reverend F.C. Ryan, stating that her services were to be dispensed with. She has been there for 22 years and has given very faithful service. The reason alleged was that they wanted a First Class teacher, that is, a teacher holding a First Class License, while her license is only Second Class.\"\n\nWill you kindly furnish the Minister with a complete report, submitting copy of Mr. Hanson's letter to Dr. McGill of July 14th, and Mr. Williams' reply of the 18th.\n\nFor Private Secretary.\nJuly 27, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 26th instant, with reference to a communication received from Mr. R. B. Hanson, M. P., regarding the dismissal of Miss Mary T. Hughes, teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School, North Devon, N. B., I attach hereto, as requested, copies of Mr. Hanson's letter to Dr. McGill of the 14th instant, Mr. Williams' reply of the 15th instant and a further letter from Mr. Hanson of the 21st instant, to which no reply has yet been made.\n\nDuring the past two or three years, Reverend F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick, following his semi-annual visits of inspection to this school, has reported adversely regarding Miss Hughes' services. A report, dated May 16, 1933, states as follows:\n\n\"I wish Miss Hughes would resign to make way for a younger teacher. I think the Department has been more than generous to have retained Miss Hughes' services so long. I would be pleased to see her have the school if better work could be done. However, I have waited years for this, but all in vain. We should get an up-to-date teacher with modern ideas of teaching. Her day has long passed away.\"\n\nFather Ryan was informed that, in view of lengthy service, the Department would continue Miss Hughes' employment during the school year ending June 30th, last - her further retention to depend upon the reports of his inspection during the past school year. He visited and inspected this school on May 30, 1933, and reported as follows:\n\n\"I really do not consider that this school has produced the required advanced work for some years. I would certainly suggest a younger teacher, who will engender new life in this school. We must put new life in this school and get more advanced work. We can fill this school by a good first class teacher, which can easily be procured for the same money.\"\n\nAs stated in Mr. Williams' reply to Mr. Hanson, of the 13th instant, the Department wrote Father Ryan, requesting him to give further consideration to the question of dispensing with Miss Hughes' services.\n\n- His reply\nHis reply, dated the 11th instant, copy of which is attached hereto, was that Miss Hughes is not able to give this school more attention than she can. Only a certain standard can be reached and beyond that it is impossible for her to make progress. He considered that, in the best interests of the work, a change of teacher should be made. He was therefore instructed to notify Miss Hughes that her services would not be required after June 30th, last.\n\nMiss Mary L. Murdoch, R. N., Public Health Nurse, in a report dated September 14, 1932, states that Miss Hughes is not prepared to undertake tooth brush drill or administer Cod Liver oil to the pupils, nor does she approve of the use of milk in the school.\n\nFor the past two years, Corona Readers have been used in all Roman Catholic Indian schools throughout Canada. Father Ryan reported that Miss Hughes had thrown out these readers and introduced the Canadian Readers.\n\nFurther, I would draw your attention to paragraph 4 of the report of Dr. W. H. McGill, dated June 16, 1933, to the Honourable the Superintendent General, on his tour of inspection of the Maritime Provinces. One of the schools referred to in Dr. McGill's report is the St. Mary's Indian Day School.\n\nMiss Hughes possesses a second class certificate. Her services are not being dispensed with on the ground that it is intended to install a member of a religious order in her place but was based entirely on the reports of Father Ryan. It is intended, however, if a new teacher is engaged, to obtain the services of one holding a first class certificate.\n\nThere are 34 children on the roll at this school, with an average attendance of 24. The Inspector states that, while Miss Hughes does fair work with the lower grades, she fails with the advanced classes. He further states as follows:\n\n\"I feel, since Miss Hughes has had this school for nearly 25 years, she could not complain of the Department's out of interest for the Indian, would bring in a new teacher and new life to both the Indian home and school. I do feel she has gone beyond that age in which real active work could be expected for our higher grades.\"\n\nActing on Father Ryan's adverse report, the Department considered it necessary, in the interests of the work, to make a change in teacher for the coming school year. Father Ryan has been requested to nominate the services of a teacher having first class qualifications. He has not yet done so and no successor to Miss Hughes has yet been appointed.\n\nNo doubt, certain friction has developed between Father Ryan and Miss Hughes. It has been the policy of the Department to rely on reports of inspectors and to base any action taken regarding a change in teacher on such reports.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nTo the\nDepartment of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Ont,\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI understand that the teacher of the\nIndian school of the Devon reserve, Miss Hughes\nis not teaching next term and that it will be\nnecessary to appoint another teacher, and that\nMiss Constance Murphy is an applicant for that\nposition.\n\nMiss Murphy is a teacher with seven\nyears experience with the mixed grades and is\npossessed of very pleasing appearance and char-\nacter above reproach in any way, and should be\na very likely person for the position. She also\nbelongs to the parish which is in charge of the\nRev. W.M. Donahoe who will have supervision of\nthis band of Indians and incidentally also the\nschool, and I understand that Miss Murphy is his\nchoice, and I would very strongly favour his selec-\ntion for the position made vacant by the resignation\nof Miss Hughes.\n\nMayor.\nApril 28, 1935.\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nI have visited several schools conducted by Miss Constance Murphy and wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the excellent work done by her in the schools of the province.\n\nMiss Murphy is a capable and efficient teacher with considerable experience and is interested in her work. Discipline was well maintained and satisfactory progress was made in the prescribed course of studies.\n\nIt is with pleasure indeed that I recommend Miss Murphy to any who may require the services of a capable and efficient teacher.\n\nHugh C.

Constance Murphy.\nThe Department of Indian Education\nOttawa Canada.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIt has very recently come to my attention that the Indian School of the Devon Reserve has been vacated by the dismissal of Miss Mary T. Hughes from the position of Teacher. I have had no complaint to find with Miss Hughes whose work so far as I know has been satisfactory.\n\nSince this vacancy is now to be filled I wish to recommend for the position Miss Constance Murphy, a First Class Superior Teacher with seven years experience in teaching the public schools in New Brunswick. I feel that as I have the Spiritual care of the Indian children of this reservation that I should also have very special weight in recommending the appointment of their teacher. I claim this as a just right, I therefore request the appointment of Miss Murphy, Marysville, as Teacher of the Indian School on the reservation under my Spiritual direction. Miss Murphy is a young woman of excellent character, etc.\nbest of health and considered among the best of teachers in New Brunswick. The fact that the Government has granted her a First Class Teachers License is the highest guarantee as to her ability. Other applications may be accompanied by prominent recommendations but I feel that of the Parish Priest of the Indians of this Reservation should be the strongest influence possible. Trusting this will have your hearty consideration.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nD.M. Donahoe\n\nJuly 31, 1933\n\nNorth Devon, NB.\nOttawa, August 3, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMiss F. Constance Murphy, Marysville N. B., has forwarded an application for the position as teacher of the St. Mary's Indian Day School, Devon, N. B., and enclosed a communication from you to this Department, regarding her character and services.\n\nFor your information, I have to say that the matter of an appointment at this school is being referred to the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, who is at present absent in the West; but, upon his return, he will deal with the matter. I may add that Miss Hughes was dismissed upon the report of Rev. F. C. Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools for New Brunswick. Father Ryan nominates the services of all teachers for the New Brunswick schools, and Miss Murphy is being requested to forward an application to him. I am directed to say that, when the appointment is being made, the application of Miss Murphy will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. W. M. Donahoe,\nNorth Devon,\nN.

B., stating the qualifications and experience which you possess and enclosing testimonials regarding your character and experience.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the nomination of a teacher for this school has been placed in the hands of Rev. F. C. Ryan, Red Bank, N. B., Inspector of Indian Schools, and I would suggest that you forward your application to him. I may add that, when the appointment is being made, your application will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss F. Constance Murphy,\nMarysville,\nN. B.\nNORTH DEVON, N. B.\nJuly 26th, 1933.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSIR,\n\nOn July 4th I wrote your Department that I had received from\nthe Reverend F. C. Ryan a notice of dismissal as teacher in the Devon Indian\nSchool, and I asked if this was authorized by the Department but I have not\nyet had a reply.\n\nI was unable to understand this notice after 22 years of service,\nas my school had always been in good condition, and no complaint had ever\nbeen made against me so far as I know. No person had ever suggested to me\nthat anything had been wrong with my work and on one occasion the Department\nhad even presented me with a medal for the excellence of the work done in my\nschool. I hope, therefore, that you will see not only how unexpected, but\nalso how unfair and unjust the dismissal proposed by the Reverend F. C. Ryan\nwould be. I trust that I shall receive word at once that the notice of the\nInspector is cancelled.\n\nI have just heard that the Inspector has made unfavorable reports\nagainst me as a teacher during the last two years. If so, he never made\nany representations to me to the effect that my work was not satisfactory,\nor that my methods should be changed. When I was teaching in schools which\nwere inspected by trained inspectors I was complimented for the excellence\nof my work.\nAs I said my school has always been in good condition. I would welcome having my school inspected by any person who knows how to inspect a school; and if I am being dismissed because of the report of Inspector Ryan I would earnestly request that someone who really knows how to inspect a school be sent to do so.\n\nAs a matter of fact during two terms during the last two years four of the classes were not examined by the Inspector at all. In the inspections in the Spring of 1931 and 1932 Reverend W. Osborne came to the school with the Inspector and took Grades 1 to IV out of the class room into a small room adjoining and purported to make an examination of them while Father Ryan examined the remaining pupils in the school room. That is all the examination that these grades received. So the inspector would know nothing about their condition except what he was told; and I know nothing about the kind of inspection which they received, because whatever was done was done behind my back.\n\nFor sometime I have felt that for some indirect purpose the present Inspector has been trying to get me in an unfavorable position with the Department and I did everything possible to avoid this. I explained this particularly to your representative Mr. Orr when he was here and he assured me that I need not worry about that; but nevertheless I made sure that the Inspector should not have any reasonable cause of complaint against me.\n\nKindly let me point out a few of the things that have happened during the last few years in connection with this school.\nPrevious to 1930 the Reverend Father Ryan had expressed himself as greatly pleased with my work because one of my pupils had succeeded in winning a medal for the best essay written in the Indian Schools, and another pupil had succeeded in successfully passing the Normal School Entrance examinations. After this pupil had passed this examination the Normal School authorities refused to accept her as a student; so she went to the Fredericton Business College and obtained a certificate there.\n\nIn 1929 the Inspector urged that pupils be prepared for the High School entrance examination. This was really a very difficult matter, as the course of study in the Indian Schools is not fitted to meet the requirements of entrance to high school, and I had to teach the work of the Provincial Schools in addition to the work required by the course in the Indian Schools. I had one pupil who was prepared in this way. I worked very hard with this pupil. I spent a great many hours with her in addition to the regular school hours in giving her instruction, with the result that I succeeded in getting her to the point where she did successfully pass the examination and she received her certificate.\n\nThe Inspector had told me that if I succeeded in having this pupil pass this examination successfully it would make a great name for me with the Department. When she did succeed I wrote the Inspector informing him of the fact, expecting he would be greatly pleased with the result; but he never even acknowledged receipt of the letter. Instead, he did this: He wrote the pupil herself that the Department wanted her to go back to my school and qualify to write the entrance examination for the Normal School. In this letter he wrote the following amazing statements:\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6066, file 283-1, part 1)\n\"Please remember the standing of your teacher is at stake, as well as any further increase in salary, together with the holding of her school, should she be unable to give you the required training,\u2014so you and your parents can rest assured that the teacher is well qualified to do so, and the very moment she is not she does not hold her school.\"\n\nIt is hard to understand what prompted such a letter. Certainly nothing would be more likely to undermine discipline in an Indian School than such a letter about a teacher.\n\nNevertheless, I was prepared to undertake the work again, but the pupil refused to co-operate. Perhaps one could not expect anything else. Her sister had prepared for and successfully passed a similar examination, which lead to nothing, because the Normal School would not accept her. However I undertook to teach her Geometry and the other necessary subjects not on the ordinary course and did get her over part of the work successfully as the Inspector found when he visited the school\u2014but she would not go on with the work.\n\nAgain in 1932 when the Inspector was in the school I showed him some very excellent domestic science work that the pupils had done. Among this was a sweater which a boy of 12 was knitting. The Inspector looked down at the larger boys and stated in a very loud tone:\n\n\"It is the wish of the Department that all the large boys make sweaters and if they do not the teacher should resign.\"\n\nAgain it is hard to know what called for such a remark. No doubt he knew that the large boys would not knit sweaters. When I told one of your representatives what the Inspector had done in the presence of the pupils he\nstated that in his opinion it was much better for the boys to study the academic work than spend their time in school knitting sweaters.\n\nThen in the fall of 1932 when certain books for use in the school were forwarded to me by the Department the Inspector ordered me not to use them, but to pack them up and send them back. I refused to do that and said I would have to follow the orders of the Superintendent. The Inspector then called out in a loud voice in the presence of the pupils:\n\n\"I am the Superintendent. It is my school and if you use any books except those authorized by me, you will be put out.\"\n\nApparently from the letter of the Department to me of October 14th last he must have written the Department after this, that I wished to use the Canadian Readers instead of the books which had been sent me. If so, the statement was simply untrue, for I very much preferred those which the Department had sent me and which he ordered me to pack up and send back. I was thus left in a very difficult position and on October 24th, 1932 I had again to write to inquire from the Department whose orders I was to follow\u2014because I then saw that the action of the Inspector was getting me in a place where I might be subject to censure by the Department.\n\nI trust therefore that you will see that justice is done me as a teacher of long standing and that you will not allow me to be thrust aside in this manner.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hughes, teacher of St. Mary's Indian Day School, North Devon, N.B., I may say that in accordance with your instructions, the services of Miss Hughes are being retained for the ensuing school year.\n\nIn this connection I would respectfully point out that Miss Hughes' services are being retained in the face of repeated and emphatic adverse reports on the part of the School Inspector, Rev. F.C. Ryan. This is a situation that can scarcely result otherwise than in a prejudicial effect upon the administration of our educational branch in this agency. I may say that this case is one with which I am personally familiar. I visited this school and met Miss Hughes during my recent visit to New Brunswick, and from even a cursory inspection I gathered a very unfavourable impression of the school and the teacher. This was before I had occasion to read any of Father Ryan's reports.\n\nI fear the effect of Miss Hughes being able to retain her position in the face of the School Inspector's disapproval will not be conducive to discipline, and any improvement in her work can scarcely be expected under the circumstances. Also, the disregard on the part of the Department of our Inspector's advice is likely to have the effect of discouraging this officer from making frank and constructive recommendations in the future. He is not unlikely to be inclined to the opinion that he has not the confidence of the Department, which is not the case.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nFredericton, N.B.\nAug. 22, 1933\n\nRev.
