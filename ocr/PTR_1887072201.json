There has now been a sufficiency of moisture, the crop is everywhere heavy and all that is required is a spell of dry weather to ripen it. In isolated cases the crop is indeed rather heavy and shows a tendency to lodge\u2014but no actual damage from this cause can yet be reported and a continued absence of bright sunny weather will prevent any appreciable loss on this head.\n\nWe believe there are now few skeptics as to the necessity of early seeding and though that opinion ought to be confirmed by experience. Many farmers in the fear of another dry season put down comparatively small crops at first and some of them, after seeing every evidence of a most splendid, many of whom have already sown fields late in the season. Growth this spring having been so heavy in consequence of the prevalence of the rain, maturity is naturally slower of being reached and those who later sow fields are by no means so far advanced as they could wish to see them so near the end of July. The great bulk of the grain crop, however, is well advanced and harvest will shortly close on the heels of the hay time. Haying has been commenced in places and will be general next week.\n\nThere is a good show of rye hay, more than two or three years past and deserves the best attention for depending on swamp grass, which is less plentiful. All root crops are in splendid condition, and indicate an extra heavy yield. No potatoes where they have been sown, are excellent in quality, plentiful in quantity and free from the sort of scab that was not uncommon last year.\n\nThe area under crop in this district this season is only moderate in extent, but during the last few years have delivered more from ploughing as large an acreage as they might otherwise have done. In the interval between seeding and hay-time a good breadth has been put under process of summer fallow and new land has been broken in many cases, pointing to a larger extent for next season.\n\nLivestock of all kinds is in flourishing estate and altogether the farmers\u2019 prospects are greatly more favorable than they have been of late years. The recent action of the Government in regard to the seed grain has given universal satisfaction, which the prospective early payment of the rebellion loss claims in no way detracts from.\n\nEDITORIAL NOTES\nWe have received another letter on the seed grain question from Mr. MacTaggart, but as both parties have had an equal opportunity of stating their views fully, and the question is regarded with considerable interest, we are afraid our readers are becoming tired of the discussion, we have considered it better in the interests of all concerned that the matter so far as our columns are concerned\u2014should now be closed.\n\nNo one will be disposed to question the main theme of Mr. Wiman\u2019s essay on \u201cUnrestricted reciprocity\u201d published in the Mail and Globe, and delivered at Dalfern Lake on Friday. Canada is unquestionably a country very rich in natural resources, and the American demands are, we think, just. But Mr. Wiman will have to talk much more to the purpose than in these picnic discourses before he will convince the Canadian people that America does not expect to get very much of the bargain he and his friends are now pressing on the attention of the Canadian farmer. The offer is most tempting, and it is possible that the principles involved are wholly without foundation; but, we repeat, the benefit attaching to Unrestricted Reciprocity may be purchased at too dear a rate. Indeed, the offer offered by these gentlemanly petitioners is a rare one, and, talked into purchase Commercial Union at such a price, the Confederation would do better to stand firm, if, as Mr. Wiman says, poverty, for another twenty years, the Canadian, with all its vast possibilities, is now ours at all events, a possession that any young nation may be proud of; and we will bid for it with a courage based on the old trading friar, what might our children say of us twenty years hence, when, their birthright sold, and the budding promise of Canadian nationality untimely snuffed out? We trust that the Canadian work only for himself. It cannot be too often pointed out that the difference that has appeared in the last ten years between the settler and the Englishman living here could be easily wiped out, and at the end of it all he gets his farm of his own, and the opportunity of leaving his heritage for his children. That is the difference. The English farmer toils for the landlord, the Canadian for himself. The Canadian work only for himself. It cannot be too often pointed out that the difference that has appeared in the last ten years between the settler and the Englishman living here could be easily wiped out, and at the end of it all he gets his farm of his own, and the opportunity of leaving his heritage for his children. That is the difference. The English farmer toils for the landlord, the Canadian for himself.\n\nMATRIMONIAL\nA pleasant event occurred at \u201cBeltrice,\u201d the residence of Mrs. Robert Campbell, at noon today, the occasion being the marriage of Miss Margaret MacTaggart, a niece of Capt. Craig of this place, to Mr. Hoson H. Murray of Beltrice.\n\nAt \u201cBeltrice\u201d also, the marriage of Mr. A. McKay in the presence of a number of friends, Miss Meyer, Buffalo, N.Y., and Mr. Murray, Buffalo, N.Y., proprietors of Buffalo as grocermen. Mr. Murray and his lovely bride for the east coast, and we hope they will be happy together.\n\nThe bride was made the recipient of a number of valuable presents, among them a set of silver tea things, presented to her by a friend who was present at the ceremony.\n\nIt is considered more than probable that Mr. Murray will cross the Atlantic this autumn.\n\nA SOUTH OPINION\nWe have already quoted from some of the excellent letters written by the correspondent of the Chicago Herald in regard to the proposed railway to connect with the Pacific Railroad, and we are glad to see that he makes the following interesting reference to the North-West.\n\n\u201cOf the soil of the vast northern plains of the Canadian Northwest for milling purposes is clearly shown by the fact that the wheat grown there is as fine with the flour from Minnesota. The greater whiteness of the former is most marked, and the flavor and flavoring properties are such that superiority is not the result of rejecting any part of the grain, but simply due to the fact that the Manitoba flour takes rank as the finest in the world, and its supremacy is not attributable to the climate, but to the milling process, but solely to the superior quality of the grain. It is no mere figure of speech to say that Manitoba flour ultimately will, and will, will be the world\u2019s greatest. The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, and the proof of the flour is in the making of the best flour. In this capacity the wheat grown here, owing to the most influential climate, is unsurpassed, only eight or ten years old. The true comparison can only be made by those who have seen wheat grown in every country in the same time. How much farther on is a famous English proverb, but it points out that, to start without capital, which is not\u2014after ten years work! He has made a living, and has saved a little money, and is penniless richer than he started; he has only Bread. Here, under the same climate, the same soil, the same living than he could earn at home, and at the end of it all he gets his farm of his own, and the opportunity of leaving his heritage for his children. That is the difference. The English farmer toils for the landlord, the Canadian for himself. The Canadian work only for himself.

All members present and Mayor Macnaught in the chair.\n\nThe principal business was the consideration of the laws.\n\nThe by-law to subdivide the town into wards or polling subdivisions, and the by-law to provide for the organization of police and suppression of crime, were each considered in committee of the whole, and the former was read a third time and ordered to be signed and numbered.\n\nThe Committee then adjourned.\n\nFor preserving and cleaning the teeth and healing the gums, try our Myrrh Tooth Paste at Clark's Drug Store.\n\nMr. G. Adams shows us what he has grown on his own farm, which measured fully 4 feet 6 inches high, and was very strong and healthy. This is not the longest or strongest to be found in the place, but other friends most likely will not dare to put the H. B. cup to its trial before going to Halton.\n\nIt appears that the dismission of the Federal Government from building a River Road from Fort Garry to a location in Winnipeg. The sensation was more reactionary-of course, it was thought that the road would not have been expected for some time. The excitement was temporary and soon cooled down, a deep feeling of satisfaction being felt whether finally allowed or disallowed the road would be built in due time. The discussion between the Provincial Government on this question for the past several weeks and the strong assumption made at the turn of the year recently, all tending to strengthen the impression and create a still further reliance upon the promises made by the government, has now quieted. It was hinted that the Federal government could prevent the promises by taking legal action. A prominent legal authority states that this action is out of the question, insisting that the provincial government has no law, or rather the constitutional right, on their side. How little the dissent manifested at that time was realized when the construction of the road is evidenced in the statement made by a member of the Provincial Board of Education. In the words of the matter the gentlemen in question said: \"The dissipation of the enthusiasm which had been aroused has been signalized by the act was in force when the contract was signed. It will be seen that the work is being pushed because the contractors are bound under their contract to finish the work in a certain time. It is therefore no surprise it was expected, but no official notification has yet been received. The contractors have made arrangements in order to provide the necessary funds to meet the requirements of the work as it progresses and the sale of the land will be made as soon as a better opportunity is offered.\"\n\nIt will also be seen that the Government has not interfered with the progress of the work, while for the benefit of remote settlers it may be mentioned to note that the road will be completed.\n\nMr. M.J. Haney stated last evening that he was not aware that the action of the Provincial Board of Education would cause any particular effect. \"A large number of men will be put to work under my supervision,\" Mr. Haney said, \"starting the right way and I am expecting they will complete their jobs by Saturday night. The surveying work is also progressing well.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the Workmen's Conservative Association at Winnipeg, Mr. J. E. Smith, of the association, stated that the association would consider any particular effects. \"A large number of men will be put to work under my supervision,\" Mr. Haney said, \"starting the right way and I am expecting they will complete their jobs by Saturday night.
