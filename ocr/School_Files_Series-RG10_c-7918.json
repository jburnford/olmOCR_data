It appears that there are five separate stoves used in keeping the classrooms and teacher's residence heated and that it might be even an economy to effect a change. I should be grateful if you could get a price on a hot air furnace, installed with the necessary piping to the rooms in use.\n\nYou might also let me know something of the cost of getting coal delivered to this school, as it is reported that the wood supplied is not wholly suitable for heating. If a furnace were installed and coal supplied, it would solve the heating problem at this school for some years, and the Department is desirous of getting an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

A great many repairs are needed. A new roof should be put on at once. It is badly in need of paint. Unless repairs are made very soon the woodshed will fall down. The classrooms have not been painted in years. The teachers' quarters are very unsatisfactory.\n\nI might suggest that the Department send an architect to look over this school building. The building has been allowed to get in a very bad state of repair. It is a question if it is advisable to spend much money on such an old building.\n\nNote handwritten:\nMake only about necessary repairs.\nOttawa, June 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Separate School Inspector reports that certain repairs are badly needed at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. He states that the roof is in poor condition, that the woodshed requires repairs and that painting is needed.\n\nI may say that the Department hopes to arrange for a new building for this day school as soon as funds can be provided for the purpose, and only those repairs that are absolutely necessary should be considered for the next year or so. I should be pleased if you would let me have a report as to what is really necessary this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nK. V. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. J.

Fr. Artus, Missionary at Wikwemikong, in regard to the school there. He has been informed by the Agent, Mr Lewis, that the very necessary repairs on the old school would not be made because a new school was soon to be built. This is, of course, good news to him.\n\nNow for some good news for the Department. The Ladies from Spanish are prepared to hand over free of cost the foundations intended at the time for a boarding-school for girls, but now of no use to them since the plan of the boarding-school has been abandoned. These foundations were well built of cement and are in a good state of preservation. The location is the best that can be found, on high ground, with good exposure, central, near the church. There is sufficient playground attached to the building, but if what is there is thought insufficient, Fr Artus is quite ready to add on some of the church property.\n\nThe Ladies would like that in the plans being prepared a room be reserved for an oratory, or chapel, in the teachers' quarters.\n\nWith kind regards, I am, Yours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 5, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, relative to the erection of a new school building at Wikomikong. The need of a new building for classroom purposes at this point has been considered by the Department. There are no funds available this year to provide the cost of its erection, but the Department is noting, for inclusion in its estimates for the coming session of Parliament, an item for this purpose.\n\nI wish to thank, through you, the Ladies of the Spanish School for their offer to hand over, free of cost, the foundations intended for the erection of a boarding school for girls, together with the site on which to erect the new day school building. When the plans are being prepared, favourable consideration will be given to the request to provide a chapel in the teachers' quarters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D.

No unnecessary expense should be incurred for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Agent,\nIndian Agent,\nPantowaming,\nOnt.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that during the winter months there are between fifteen and twenty pupils who remain at the school during noon hour and eat a cold lunch at Wikwemikong school.\n\nThe teachers purpose serving these pupils with a hot lunch providing that the Department will allow them $10.00 monthly to purchase supplies.\n\nAs a number of the pupils attending this school have a distance of three miles to walk morning and evening I believe that it would be well to allow the teachers $5 or $10 monthly during the winter in order that these pupils attending from a distance may have better nourishment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 28th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, requesting that a grant be allowed for the purpose of purchasing supplies for a midday lunch for a number of pupils of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $10 per month during the coming winter months in the purchase of the supplies required for this purpose. This lunch could be served to the pupils who remain at the school during the noon hour. It is presumed that the teachers will arrange for the preparation and serving of the lunch. If any utensils are required for the purpose, you may arrange for the purchase of same. The food supplies for the lunch should be purchased by you from time to time, and care should be taken to see that there is no waste. After the serving of this lunch has been in operation for a short time I shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the results.\n\nYou should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the supplies, and the above authorized amount should not be exceeded each month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I do not think the expenses would amount to more than six or seven dollars.\n\nI have been among the people. They seem interested and will disposed but a dollar means a great deal to them at this time of the year. I did not ask them to pay.\n\nI trust this request may meet with your kind consideration.\n\nI am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Miss Sadie L.

These records shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wage Officers of the Government at any time it may be expedient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of workmen employed and wages paid during the execution of the said contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said workmen have been paid in arrear; (3) that all the above conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor, in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall also from time to time furnish the Minister such further written information as may be required by the Minister may deem necessary to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In the event of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed in the said work, and if a claim therefor is filed with the Minister in the manner and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may pay such claim out of the moneys at any time payable by His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payments to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payments for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the same rights in respect of moneys so owing them as the workmen employed in the execution of the said contract.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from sub-letting, it shall be understood that sub-letting, other than such as may be customary in the trades concerned, is prohibited unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; sub-contractors shall be bound in all cases to perform all the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of sub-contractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written permission of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\nRef.

Coal delivered in Wikwemikong will cost approximately $25.00 a ton, where wood will cost $5.00 a cord, 128 cubic feet. The whole basement should be excavated as the additional expense would be only a trifle and the extra space would answer to store a supply of firewood for winter use instead of erecting a woodshed.\n\nOn making an inspection of the old building in use as a school at present I find that there is a lot of valuable material in this structure. There would be sufficient material if taken down carefully and properly utilized to rebuild a new structure of the dimensions of the proposed new building. Of course a certain amount of new material would have to be procured such as exterior siding, windows, doors, lath, shingles, and a quantity of flooring, but I believe that all the rough material required could be taken from the old building and would entail a large expense.\n\nIf this work would commence about the middle of June next summer when the class rooms close for the holidays the building should be completed by the 1st of September.\n\nWikwemikong is quite remote and the cost of transportation of heavy material such as can be taken from the old building will be high.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nTENDER FORM\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n\nBuilding...Combined Day School & Teachers Residence\nLocation...Wikwemikong on Manitoulin Island.\n\nI (we) McLarty, Hartan & Weber Limited, hereby offer to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to furnish all the necessary tools, implements, materials and labour, and to execute and complete in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner, all the works required in completing the aforesaid building, according to drawings, specifications and form of contract exhibited to me/us, and prepared under instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, for the sum named as under.\n\nTender for the whole of the work as shown on drawings and described on the specifications (Amount of tender to be written)...Thirteen Thousand, Five Hundred and Ninety Nine Dollars and Thirty Seven Cents...\n\n($13,599.37)\n\nI (we) herewith agree to complete the work within a period of...months from the date of notification of acceptance of tender, and hold myself (ourselves) ready to enter into a contract for the due execution of the work.\n\n(a) I (we) herewith enclose an accepted cheque for $13,600.00 on a chartered bank, payable to the order of the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, equal to ten (10) per cent of the amount of the tender, as per terms of the advertisement and specifications for this work.\n\n(b) Attached hereto is a letter from the Manager of the Bank of...certifying that War Bonds of the Dominion of Canada or bonds of the Canadian National Railway Company to the value of...have been deposited in the Bank of...subject to the order of the Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWar Loan Bonds of the Dominion or bonds of the Canadian National Railway Company will be accepted as security, or Bonds and cheque, if required to make up an odd amount.\n\nEnvelopes containing this tender are to be endorsed \"TENDER FOR Combined Day School and Teachers Residence, Wikwemikong, on Manitoulin Island,\" and addressed to the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, Ont.\n\n\"Tenders must be in the hands of Deputy Superintendent General by 12 O'CLOCK NOON of DATE FIXED FOR THEIR RECEIPT.

First, about the doors swinging in. I understand it is unlawful to swing doors in schools, so a matter of fact I have had to change some although the plan showed them that way. It does not cost anything to swing them out if we do so before making the frames. But however, a letter from you will clear me on the matter.\n\nAlso about the beams supporting the upper floor. The plans show an 8x10 wooden beam, two of them over each class room. I am afraid they would not stand the weight unless there was a truss rod in them. Will you kindly advise us on these matters at once so we will have no delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJohn McLeod\n\nAdd communication to:\nGovernment House\n& Queen's Hotel\nWekwelemiing\nOntario\nOttawa, Oct. 24, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. McLeod,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th with reference to the combined day school and teachers' residence at Wikwemikong, I would ask you to kindly arrange to have the doors hinged so that they will swing out. It is thought that in order to save congestion that the doors leading to the cloak rooms could be omitted.\n\nWith reference to the beams supporting the upper floor I think you are right and would ask you to kindly arrange to either have these trussed with steel rods or provide a wood column supporting the centre of each beam.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

The department Architect is in western Canada on duty, at the present time, and I do not wish to make any change in connection with the furnace or the size of the basement without his concurrence. The furnace will not actually be supplied for a while anyway, as there will be time to look into this carefully after Mr. Orr returns to Ottawa. The lavatory is put in new buildings, and later, when the water supply is determined, arrangements may be made for its use. The intention is to have the children use outdoor closets for the time being and the teachers could have chemical equipment in the basement.\n\nThe kitchen, of course, cannot be enlarged, as that would interfere very seriously with the whole construction. It is a nice-sized room and there is no reason why it cannot be used as a dining room as well. The draining and levelling of the site for playground purposes can be attended to next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Sadie J.

The contractor, Mr. McLeod and Inspector Clark claim that it is in accordance with the measurement on the plan, but I differ from them. It is several feet from the floor to the beams, and in order to install the proper piping from the furnace to heat the different rooms the pipes have to circle under the beams which causes them to be very low and in the way if the basement is to be made use of for any purpose.\n\nAs we cannot agree as to the proper construction of the school building I would recommend that the Departmental Architect pay a visit to this district and settle this matter besides other little differences in connection with this building.\n\nIf possible, he should come at once while the road travelling is in good condition for later on it may be a hard trip to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nDecember 29th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a voucher in favour of Mr. C.

Jamieson & McLeod amounting to $75.00 for additional excavating under the new Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nOnly approximately half of the cellar under this building was to be excavated according to the specifications. In order to have ample room to store a supply of fuel for winter use and save the expense of erecting a wood shed it was necessary to have the whole cellar excavated. The contractors offered to carry out this extra work for the sum of $75.00. As they had already commenced the work and I did not have time to report this matter to the Department for approval, they should not delay the work as the winter was setting in, so I authorized them to excavate under the whole building in order to save further expense in future.\n\nI would most respectfully recommend that this amount be paid to Messrs. Jamieson and McLeod as it was necessary to have this work carried out before the foundation was erected and it will save the expense of erecting a wood shed which would cost much more than the contractors' charge for their extra work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nINFORMATION REQUESTED\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo John Reynolds' Estate, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nDATE\n\n1931\n\nJanuary 6\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. 19-6-4 dated November 25th, 1930.\n\nNo. 19-6-4 December 11th, 1930.\n\nManitowaning, Ont., December 11/30\n\nMinister of Indian Affairs\n\nManitowaning, Ontario\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nJOHN REYNOLDS' ESTATE\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\n\nDry Goods Groceries Flour and Feed Chinaware Indian Bark\n\nFor Wikwemikong School\n\nTo 6 months 187\n\n5 10\n\n2 63\n\nTotal 7 73\n\n$11.40\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 100\n\nSignature\n\nAgent\nOffice of the Manitowaning Indian Agency,\n\nJanuary 5th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos., amounting to $11.40 in favour of John Reynolds' Estate, Manitowaning, Ont., for supplies for Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 19-6-4 dated November 25th, 1930, December 11th, 1930.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.V.

Agent\nJune 23, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nOn the 29th ultimo, I visited the Wigwemikong Indian Day School, which is at present conducted in the old building near the church. As far as I could learn from a brief visit, Miss Sadie Burke and Miss Agnes Manitowabi - the latter an Indian girl - are doing very efficient work.\n\nI visited the new building which was erected during the fall and early winter, and I believe it very suitable for our purposes. There is considerable still to be done, however, before school can be conducted there, as follows:\n\n1. Well and water supply system.\n2. Sewage disposal system.\n3. Outdoor toilets for boys and girls.\n4. Benches for noonday lunch.\n5. Cupboards for children's dishes.\n6. Woodshed.\n7. Kitchen cupboards and tables.\n8. Dry storeroom in the cellar.\n9. Cupboards and bookcases in classrooms.\n10. Levelling the grounds and fencing.\n11. Chemical toilets for teachers.\n\nThe ladies of the Nardene Order, who are responsible for the teaching at this school, also requested that we provide a small kiln at one end of the building as occupied; the need for this will be better determined. I believe the Department should seriously consider purchasing a few more feet at the back of the building, to take in a rather low spot there. This could\nbe fenced so that cattle would not get into it, and we should consider draining it. I looked at the contour of the land behind and I believe that the draining would be comparatively inexpensive. New desks are not required, as the ones now in use can be sanded and varnished and moved over.\n\nTo properly prepare the building and grounds for school purposes will require a considerable outlay and I propose to place an item in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year. Of course, there are no funds at the present time for the purpose, and, anyway, for some reason or other, the teachers are not anxious to move to their new quarters. They asked that the final work be postponed until next year. Father Artus also requested that we postpone moving to the new building until 1932. In view of the fact that funds were not available to prepare the school for occupation, I informed them that we would consider their request.\n\nIn view of the whole situation, I wish to recommend that we prepare the school for occupation early in 1932 and that the classes and teachers move over as from September first of that year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nYou are authorized to arrange to have the windows of the old Wikwemikong Indian Bay School putted during the summer.

Before making definite arrangements to this effect, the Department desires to be assured that, in the event of the building and grounds being suitably prepared, the new school will meet with the approval of all parties concerned.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKantowaning, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 13th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nDuring the last winter past a hot lunch was served at midday to the pupils attending the Wikwemikong Day School. The Department furnished the groceries and the teachers did the cooking. This practice was beneficial to the children's health besides it did encourage a satisfactory attendance. The teachers have advised me that they are willing to carry out this work again, commencing with the current month, providing the Department will supply the necessary articles to provide the lunch. As this plan worked out in such a satisfactory manner during the winter past, I would recommend that a hot lunch be provided to the pupils again this school year commencing with the current month. The cost should not exceed $10.00 a month.\n\nThere are seven more Indian Day Schools in this agency where a number of the pupils have a long distance to walk in order to allow them to attend school and have to eat a cold lunch at midday. As the cold weather is not setting in I would recommend that hot cocoa be served with their lunch at midday in each school. The cost of a supply of cocoa, sugar and milk should not exceed $4.00 a month for each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nOctober 12th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. 19-65 of the 7th instant to the effect that if funds can be provided the Department expects to make arrangements early next spring to complete the new Indian day school at Wikwemikong provided that the new school will meet with the approval of all parties concerned. In reply I have the honour to report that the effect that I have discussed this matter with the teachers and Indians concerned. They agree on the opinion that there is not ample space on the first floor to accommodate two teachers, and a companion who acts as housekeeper, and they desire that the Department should arrange to have an addition to the north side of the new building in order to provide sufficient accommodation. Otherwise the new school has met with the approval of both teachers and Indians concerned, and they are desirous to having it completed at an early date.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that this new school is a fine structure located on one of the most suitable sites in Wikwemikong village for a school building as the location is dry, a playground can be suitably prepared with little expense, outside of cost for fencing, and the site is central to the different Indian families, and as the old school building in use at present is in a dilapidated condition, I would recommend that the new building be placed in condition for occupation as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIN INDIAN TRUST FUND\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo John Reynolds' Estate,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nDATE\n1932\n\nAMOUNT\n\nNovember 12, 1932.\n\nAuthorized by Dept. letter No. X-64, dated November 2nd, 1932.\n\nNovember 12, 1932.\n\nI box of soap, 1 case of washing soda and\n12 yards of towelling, furnished to Wikwemikong\nIndian Day School.\n\nManitowaning, Ont. \u2014 November 12/32\n\nIndian Agent\n\nManitowaning, Ontario\n\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nJOHN REYNOLDS' ESTATE\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS\nAND DEALERS IN\nINDIAN BARK AND GRASS GOODS\n\nSupplies for Wikwemikong School\n\n| Item                  | Quantity | Cost |\n|-----------------------|----------|------|\n| 1 case soap           |          | 4.00 |\n| 1 case washing soda   |          | 1.50 |\n| 12 yds towelling      |          | 2.64 |\n\nTotal: $7.14\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed\nand the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of\nthe same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM NO. 109\n\nAgent\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct; that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 199\n\nAgent\nOffice of the Manitouining Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 5th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. ...........................................\n\namounting to $7.84 ........................................... in favour\n\nof John Reynolds Estate, Manitouining, Ont.\n\nfor 1 box of soap, 1 case of washing soda and\n\n12 yards of towelling, furnished to Wikwemikong\n\nIndian Day School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 19-6-4 ............ dated November 2nd, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nManitowaning, December 6th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that the paper roof on the Wikwemikong old school building is in a state of bad repair.

The cost of having the necessary repairs carried out in order that the building will be in a habitable condition for the winter will amount to approximately $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 14th, 1932.\n\nSIR,\n\nWith reference to your 154-5-46 of the 6th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves of your incurring an expenditure of, approximately, $25.00, in order to make the old Wikwemikong Indian Day School habitable for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRe J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, December 25th, 1932\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a requisition by Miss Louise Gattie for material for use in the Wikwemikong Day School. On account of there being two classrooms in this building and a large attendance the requirement for material is large.\n\nThe brooms are almost worn out and as winter is here and so many pupils cleaning snow from their feet and clothing six brooms are required for the two classrooms and teacher's residence. The water pails in use at present are of tin and have become rusty and of no further use. A new Axe should be furnished as the old one which has been in use for a long time is worn out. The teacher has asked for a small hatchet to enable her to split the kindling wood fine, and a new hammer, also two extra axe and hammer handles to have on hand. I would recommend that the hatchet, new hammer, one axe handle and one hammer handle be supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-6-5.\n\n184-5-46.\n\nOttawa, January 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School, for supplies for the classroom and for other articles to be used at the school.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that an order will be forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following:\n\n- 4 brooms,\n- 3 galvanised water pails,\n- 1 axe with handle and one extra axe handle,\n- 1 banner complete with handle,\n- 1 extra handle,\n- 1 hatchet.\n\nPlease obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost.

It will take at least six dozen to replenish the number required.\n\nThe total cost of the meat gringer, tea kettle and coat hooks required will cost approximately $7.00.\n\nA small amount of sewing material has been asked for by Miss Cattie to manufacture exhibits for the school fair to be held next fall.

The Department is not prepared to supply a meat grinder.\n\nRegarding the supplying of coat hooks for the cloakroom, I have to say that as it is intended to utilise the new school building during the next school year, it is hardly necessary to incur the expenditure required in placing new hooks in the cloakroom. However, if you consider that hooks are absolutely necessary, you may arrange for the purchase and installation of a sufficient number to meet the requirements.\n\nRegarding the sewing material required to make articles for the school fair, you may purchase sufficient embroidery cotton for laundry bags, 2 lbs. Scotch fingering yarn and 2 cards mending wool. An itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost, should be obtained. This you should attach to a proper voucher form, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

The Department supplied the groceries and the teachers did the cooking. This hot lunch was beneficial to the health of the children in addition to having a tendency to encourage a more satisfactory attendance. The teachers are willing to carry out this work again commencing the first of the next month, providing the Department will supply the necessary articles to enable them to serve these lunches.\n\nAs there are a number of children in attendance at this school who are under-nourished and in need of a hot meal at mid-day I would recommend that a hot lunch be provided this school year commencing on the first of the next month. The cost of providing articles to serve this lunch should not exceed $15.00 a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the serving of a hot lunch at midday to the pupils of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as our funds for this purpose have been considerably reduced, the full amount the Department can allow for supplies for a hot lunch during the coming winter is $5.00 per month. It is considered that cocoa or tea should be served. However, you may take this matter up with the teachers and arrange for the purchase of the supplies, to an amount which must not exceed $5.00 per month. The serving of this lunch should be between November first and the end of April, 1934. Please obtain invoices itemized and in triplicate, covering the cost of the supplies. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. I regret that our funds will not permit a larger expenditure for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J.

Mr. Perrier when passing here told plainly that this house could not be used without making an addition. I enclose a sketch of the apartments for the kitchen, the pantry will be down the cellar, the cook will have to get her wood by careful down, as she has no place to put at least for one day the necessary fuel for the day. Where will be the dining room, they do not know. The kitchen is only 11' x 15'.\n\nThey do not object to go as the house is made now, but they say at least for the lodgings. As you see to go from clear to another, they have to pass through the kitchen. Would it not be possible to have an addition or in the other schools, Pews, Gaboni, Test Bay, Chishigaming and all over.\n\nI hear that you will come, why not now to see what should be done before they go to any expenses to fix something for next September. Mr. McGookin, told the Agent to fix it for that time, he said he could not afford for that they would, but there is no...\n\nYours sincerely, C. Belanger.\nWe said that\nin school he\nwould go.

The roof is in a leaky condition and if this building will be occupied for another year the necessary repairs will have to be carried out before the wet weather sets in. The approx. cost of the necessary repairs to the roof will be $50.00 as it covers a large surface, 5000 square feet, which will have to be resurfaced with roofing pitch.\n\nIt may be that the new school building erected recently could be put in shape for occupancy before next fall. At present there is not any toilet accommodation or any water in connection with this building. The yard is rough and unfenced, and the kitchen portion of the building will require some shelving and cupboards for dishes and cooking utensils. The equipment in the classrooms and teacher's residence in the old building could be removed for use in the new building as it is all in good condition and sufficient on hand to equip the new building. If the Department has sufficient funds available at its disposal to allow an expenditure in having a new school premise placed in such condition that it could be utilized for school purposes in the near future I would recommend favourably, but in the meantime I would recommend that the necessary repairs be carried out to the roof of the old school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nManitowaning, July 16th, 1934.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a requisition by Miss Louise Gattie for articles for use in the classroom at the Wikwemikong Day School.\n\nOn account of the large increase in the attendance of pupils at this school 12 new Desks and 1 Rear Seat should be supplied. Those in use at present are of individual type manufactured by the Globe Furniture Company Limited, Waterloo, Ont. At the close of the school for the holidays there was an enrolment of 95 pupils, and a number of new beginners will be enrolled when the school re-opens in September next.\n\nThe teachers are in need of all the articles asked for on this requisition, and I would recommend that they be supplied, if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Louise Cattie,\nSpanish, Ont.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| July | To paid labour performed in general cleaning of classrooms at Wikwemikong Day School at the end of June quarter 1934. |        |\n|      | paid the following amounts for polishing stoves                       |        |\n|      | Aratha Tenookhank                                                     | .20    |\n|      | Della Trudeau                                                         | .20    |\n|      | Mrs. Stephen Recollet                                                 | .50    |\n|      | paid the following amounts for washing windows                        |        |\n|      | Mrs. Stephen Recollet                                                 | .55    |\n|      | Philomine Rivers                                                      | .70    |\n|      | Aratha Tenookhank                                                     | .55    |\n|      | paid the following amounts for scrubbing floors                       |        |\n|      | Mrs. Stephen Recollet                                                 | .75    |\n|      | Philomine Rivers                                                      | 1.40   |\n|      | Aratha Tenookhank                                                     | 1.10   |\n|      | Ellen Shawan                                                          | .35    |\n|      | Mary Ashenakwat                                                       | .35    |\n|      | Della Trudeau                                                         | .70    |\n|      | Mrs. Joe Pinard                                                       | .50    |\n|      | Josephine Desmoulons                                                  | .50    |\n|      |                                                                      | $7.75  |\n\nVote: 176\nSchool Number: 448\nAllot: 280\nTotal: 2036\n\nTRIPOLICATE FOR FILE\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, and that the charges herein itemized are incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada to pay.\n\nForm 50\n\n[Signature]\nAgent\nManitowaning, July 20th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a voucher in favour of Miss Louise Gattie, of Spanish, Ont., teacher in the senior classroom of the Wikwemikong Day School, amounting to $7.75 for payments made to Indian women for labour performed in the general cleaning of the interior of the Wikwemikong Day School building.\n\nAt the end of the June quarter Miss Gattie had all the stoves and pipes in use cleaned and polished, the woodwork and floors in the classrooms and teacher's residence cleaned and scrubbed and placed in a sanitary condition after being in use during the year past.\n\nThe document is enclosed herewith which she forwarded as a receipt to show that the different amounts were paid by her for the labour performed in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr. Phelen,\n\nAs there is nothing done around the new building I suppose that the teaching will be again in the old building, as by the past years.\n\nI would call your attention on the small reparation that is absolutely necessary. The roof needs to be tarred; it is not broken, but the roofing paper is like sponge, and absorbs rain, and so leaks as soon as it rains. At least the tar should be put over the classes and the kitchen, that is on top of the building. Last year the teachers had to spend nights watching for that leakage. If this could be made before the opening of the classes, it would be a great burden away from the teacher's shoulders.\n\nI thank you very much for preventing the teachers to go in the unfinished building. They appreciate very much your kindness.\n\nI look forward to all, and once more thanks for your great kindness.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nC. B\u00e9langer, S.J.\nOttawa, August 10, 1934.\n\nDear Father Belanger:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.\n\nIt is the Department's intention to erect toilets for the pupils, dig a well, build shelves in the teachers' living quarters and supply them with an indoor sanitary closet. Then that is done, the Indian Agent is being instructed to move the school from its present quarters to the new building. I may say that I was at Spanish last Saturday. I consulted Miss St. James and the ladies who have been teaching at Wikwemikong, and they are agreeable to the change. I realise that the teachers' quarters in the new building are really not large enough, but the ladies are prepared to use the new school this year, and I think that I will be able to make arrangements for providing sufficient funds in next year's Appropriation to allow for the erection of an addition during the summer of 1935.\n\nThe building at present used for school purposes at Wikwemikong is quite unsuitable, and it is only a waste to spend more money on repairs.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Chas. Belanger, S.J.,\nWikwemikong,\nOnt.\nJuly 18th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReport on my inspection of the Manitowaning Agency on 11th - 13th ultimo.\n\nI was requested to make enquiry regarding the delay in opening the new Wikwemikong Indian Day School erected by the Department two years ago and still unused. There has been dissatisfaction on the part of the Church officials with the location of the school as being too far from the Chapel. The old school is just across the road from the Chapel while the new one is less than half a mile distant. This undoubtedly has been an influence in keeping the teachers' from taking up residence in the new building. There are other objections, however, which until remedied prevent the school being used by pupils or teachers, namely, lack of accommodation. Toilet facilities have been provided for 60 pupils, 2 teachers and housekeeper. There is no water available so far and no cupboards or shelves in the kitchen. The grounds should be levelled and the lot fenced. If the necessary funds are not available to make these additions, I would recommend that the classrooms be opened, the teachers to remain in residence in the old building in the meantime. The Indians are anxious to have the new school opened for the pupils and it ought to be; the old building is not only unsuitable but dangerous in the event of fire or windstorm. Definite steps should be taken to have the new classrooms opened at the beginning of the September term.\n\n(sgd) Thos McGoogin,\nInspector.\n\nA.S.

It is the Department's desire that a pump be placed beside the sink in the teacher's living quarters and pipe run to the well in order that the water can be pumped into the sink without going outside.\n\nIf you can do this work with Indian labour, you may proceed at once, but you should keep all costs as low as possible. If Indian labour is not available, you should at once advise the Department.\n\nYou will be advised, shortly, regarding the name of a competent carpenter who will, under your direction, erect two toilets, one for the boys and one for the girls. These should be located by you at a reasonable distance from the school. The carpenter should also be employed in erecting the shelves required by the teachers in the downstairs living room.\n\nIt is intended to supply an indoor sanitary closet. You will be further advised regarding this when the order is placed.\n\nAll work should proceed as quickly as possible, with a view to having the building ready at an early date. If it is found that the digging of the well, the erection of the toilets and making the shelves cannot be completed by September 4th, the school should re-open in the old building, and, as soon as the work mentioned above is completed, you may close the school for two or three days, in order to enable you to move the desks and other furniture from the building at present used to the new school. This matter will be left in your hands, and you should have the moving done at as reasonable a cost as possible, employing Indian labour.\n\nbefore ordering the desks requested in your letter of the 16th ultimo; the Department will await a further communication from you, after the school has been moved to the new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Indian labour has been employed to dig the well. In order to have a sufficient supply of water it was necessary to dig to a depth of twenty feet. The Indians are busy building up the wall with dry stone and I expect that the well will be in shape to install the pump by the end of the current week.\n\nMr. McMullen, of Manitowaning, has been employed to erect the two toilets, and is now busy at this work, but it will now be possible to have these buildings ready for use, and the necessary shelving installed in the teachers living room before the last of October next. However the school has been re-opened in the old building and will be conducted there until the new building is ready for use.\n\nBefore the sink in the teachers living room can be made use of it will be necessary to install a drain lined with tiles in order to carry the waste water away and prevent the sewage from also washing the floor. The pipe projects only a foot or so through the concrete cellar wall, about three feet below the surface and is of no use until a drain is installed. In order to secure proper drainage it would be necessary to have the drain 100 feet in length.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, November 12, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nSince writing you on the 10th instant regarding the new Wikwemikong Indian Day School, the Department understands that no kitchen cupboard or shelves have yet been built in the teachers' living quarters.\n\nAuthority for this work was contained in official letter of August 10th, last, and the Department cannot understand why there has been such delay.\n\nAs requested in official letter of the 10th instant, you should let me know, at once, how the work is progressing at this school and, if everything has not yet been done to make it comfortable, you should state when the necessary work will be completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning November 18th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental Letter No. 19-6-5 of the 10th instant, with further reference to the work authorized in Official Letters of August 10th and September 17th in connection with the new Wikwemikong Indian Day School, I have the honour to report that the work authorized by the Department has been completed and the school has been removed to the new building.\n\nA well has been dug and a pump has been placed beside the sink in the teacher's living quarters with a pipe from well so that the water can be pumped into the sink without going outside. Two new large toilets have been erected, one for the boys and one for the girls, and the sanitary toilet has been installed in the basement. Shelves have been placed in the store room in connection with the teacher's living quarters and the clock rooms have been completed and equipped with hooks for the accommodation of the pupils.\n\nAfter the pump in the kitchen was installed it was found that there was not any drainage system to carry the water away from the sink. In order to have proper drainage I had to send to Owen Sound for sewer pipe to carry the refuse water from the sink across the basement floor and under the wall to a cesspool. I was forced to install.\n\nAll the work authorized by the Department has been completed, and all the classroom equipment and furniture for the teacher's living quarters have been moved to the new building, and the classroom work is conducted in the new quarters during the current week.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe industrial school at Wikwemikong has been closed and moved to Spanish River. As there are a large number of children living in the village of Wikwemikong for whom a school should be provided, the Department intends to continue the day school there, which was formerly held in the industrial school building. The Department has been in communication with Mr. Agent McLeod who states that the Rev. Father Desautels, who is acting for the church, demands a rent of $20.00 a month for the use of the building, but that the church authorities indicate that an agreement should be made between them and the Department before the Department takes possession of the building. They are either willing to rent or sell. The building needs repairs and refurnishing, as they were allowed to remove the desks to Spanish River.\n\nAfter careful examination of the old records I do not see that the church has any title to the property under which they could claim rent. They have been using a certain portion of the land in the village for mission and school purposes, but as they have given up the school I consider that the building used for that purpose reverts to the band. Father Desautels claims that the school and dependents are built on land ceded by the Indians for the use of the Missionaries. I think that any concession made years ago to the missionaries was on condition that they should maintain a mission and school. As the school has been abandoned they lose any claim they ever had to the property.\n\nThe school is now closed awaiting settlement. The teacher is under salary and school material and supplies will have to be furnished before it can be opened. I think it well, as I am going to Spanish River and Sault Ste. Marie, to interview Father Desautels and find out on what he bases his claim for compensation for the use of the building. It would not be well for the Department to enter into an agreement recognizing their title to the property, as it has never been surrendered and they have simply been granted use for certain purposes. There is no doubt that the Department has a perfect right to take possession of the buildings, as it has contributed $6,000.00 as shown by the papers filed towards its acquisition and it is still in possession of the land. I consider that Father Desautels is endeavouring to obtain recognition of their claim to the land, which does not exist. The opening of the school in this building would not interfere with any valid claim the church might have for compensation, but until they can show that they have such claim there is no reason why they should be allowed to virtually close the school.\n\n(sgd.) Martin Benson.\nOttawa, October 7, 1913.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nI called on Mr. Agent McLeod that night and he arranged to drive me over to Wikwemikong on Sunday. We spent the day there and I am pleased to say that I arrived at a satisfactory arrangement with Father Desautels, the priest in charge, in regard to the occupancy of the old school building for the day school on the reserve. Miss Duhamel is there and ready to assume her duties as soon as this matter was settled. I may say that owing to the good offices of Father Dugas, who gave me a letter of introduction to Father Desautels, I had very little trouble in arriving at a satisfactory settlement. We are to have the use of as much of the building as we require for school purposes free of cost. As I was authorized to see that the building was made comfortable for the teacher, we took one of the large rooms and had it fitted up as a living room for Miss Duhamel and her helper. I instructed Mr. McLeod to order the number of desks required for this school from the E. H. Moyer Co., Toronto, and I saw them on my way down in reference to the shipment.\n\n(Sgd.) Martin Benson\nOttawa, November 24, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nIn connection with the building at Wikwemikong which the Department has used for day school purposes during the past twenty-one years, I have reviewed all the files and the only information that I can find regarding our right to this building is contained in the two memoranda of which copies are attached.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nWinneikong 19th Nov. 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI thank you very much for your last letter. The Sisters are in the new school, I must say that I think that Mr. Lewis did his best to have the change done, but the workers were not so anxious to finish the job for their own benefits. He has been very kind to the Sisters, he comes to see if they need anything that he can give them. Little by little he will provide for the absolutely necessary.\n\nNow there is one more problem? The old school belongs to the Department, what will become of it? If the Department never allows the Indians to use it as a club house, it will soon become an ill-famed house, where all the crimes will take place. Already they put in their tables and the same night that the Sisters left, they had organized a dance, but happily Mr. Agent firmly told the Sisters not to give the key without a written authorization from him. For the best of the reserve it should be torn down. The doors, windows, and lumber would certainly pay and over for the cost of the tearing. If it stays it will certainly be a school of corruption for the youth, as the parents have no authority on their children, girls of 13-14 roving around at midnight and over, and not few only. There\n\nThere are 48 windows, 15 doors, recreation is hard wood floor and classes etc.\n\nDo not take the trouble to answer this letter, though it may be good to let Mr. Agent know that I think that he did his best about\nabout the preparation of the house. The Indians were so slow working, that it probably the cause of the delay.\n\nThe Sisters do not speak of the addition, they take courageously their cross, as coming from God, hoping so to obtain His blessings on our reserve.\n\nThe Two Fox are at home (Girls). They were to be operated for tonsils, and I did not know, so they came before the operation was performed.\n\nThe reason for asking the Department to tear down the old school is that there are so many rooms in it. You may imagine what will happen if open to the public, at night and nobody to watch for the order. As it is dangerous and of no use, it seems natural that it should disappear.\n\nI hope that in the future I will leave you more peace, as you have not only Wikwemikong to care for.\n\nThanking you for your great kindness,\n\nI remain (in union of prayers for success of yours)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. B\u00e9langer, S.J.\n\nThe fair can be very well in the council house, there are two large stories. And the club is nothing there is only the name of it,\nOctober 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe question of what should be done with the building that has been used up to the present time for the Wikwemikong Day School has been brought to the Department's attention. The Department is inclined to feel that it is not necessary to keep this building standing as it will be a continual source of trouble. I have reviewed our files, and it is considered that this building really belongs to the Department, and, consequently, we have the right to demolish it.\n\nI would appreciate your discussing the matter with the Rev. Chas. Belanger, S.J., and advising the Department if you would recommend pulling down the building. If so, you should state if the work could be done at once and what expense would be involved. Would it be possible to salvage the doors, windows and any other material that might be useful for the erection of the proposed addition to the present Wikwemikong Day School? In this event, you might let me know where the material could be stored. Please give this matter your careful consideration and report to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nUntil it has been finally decided what disposition is to be made of this building, it should be securely locked and not used for any purpose whatever.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis\u2014Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, December 7th, 1934.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No. 19-6-5 of the 24th ultimo in connection with the question as to what should be done with the building that has been used up to the present time for the Wikwemikong Day School, I have the honour to report that it is my opinion that it should be left standing until at least next spring or so long as the Department would make use of the material for use in the erection of the proposed addition to the present Wikwemikong Day School. Since the old building has been vacated it has been securely locked and no use made of it whatever for any purpose, and this course of action will be continued until further instructions from the Department.\n\nIf this building were taken down under careful supervision it would be possible to salvage sufficient doors, windows, hardwood flooring of good quality, and other material that would be useful for the erection of the proposed new building, but if wrecked at present the material would tend to pile outside as there is no place for storage available at Wikwemikong for such a large amount of material, and if left outside it would become in a state of deterioration before it could be utilized for other purposes, and besides it would be possible that a large amount of the material would be carried away, so I would recommend that the Department take no action to demolish this building until next spring, at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 13th, 1954.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 184-6-50 of the 7th instant, with reference to the building which has been used up to the present for the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.

ORR,\n\nYikwemikong: Addition to new school building, to provide increased living accommodation for teachers - $1,000.\n\nThe teacher and pupils moved into the new school building on December first last. There are two teachers, and the accommodation provided for living quarters is inadequate. At the end of the building, a very narrow pass is partitioned off for living quarters which proves insufficient accommodation. It will be necessary to extend the building. It will be possible to obtain certain material from the old school building, which is to be demolished. I would request you to make the necessary arrangements for the building of the addition. Funds for the purpose are provided in the Estimates for the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nP. S. - It is intended to demolish the old school building which was built for residential school purposes, but, for the last number of years, only part of it was occupied for two classrooms and living quarters for the teachers of the day school. There is, no doubt, a quantity of material which would be of use, some of which might be utilized in the building of the addition to the new school and the teacher's living quarters and the balance, sold or disposed of to the Indians. I would request that you arrange also, for the taking down of this old building, the levelling of the site and the disposal of the materials.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Julia Bondy,\nWikwemikong,\nOntario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | To payment made for labour cleaning new Wikwemikong Indian Day School. |        |\n|      | paid Ellen Shawana for 4 hours labour at 10\u00a2 per hr | $5.00 |\n|      | Mrs. L.

In order to have this work carried out Miss Goody hired Indian labour and paid for the work herself. As it was necessary to have this cleaning carried out she was asked to forward a receipted statement for the amount paid out for this work and the same would be submitted to the Department for consideration of payment being made in her favour covering the amount paid out.\n\nThe receipt which she furnished is enclosed herewith showing that each Indian signed opposite the amount paid in each case.\n\nAs it was necessary to have this work done I would recommend that Miss Goody receive a refund for this amount which she paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Julia Oandy\nFitzsimmons, Ontario\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1935 | Apr. 11 | Authorized by Dept. letter No. 19-1-5 dated December 19, 1934.\n\nMay 26 | To: Payment made to J.

The estimate cost of having the grounds cleaned and levelled with amount to at least $250.00 as there is a large amount of stone to be removed and a number of low spots to be filled which will require much labour, but when the ground is levelled and put in shape it will be an excellent playground for children as the surface is of light soil with good drainage.\n\nIn order to enclose these grounds with a fence of suitable wire, cedar posts cut from sound timber, and two gates, the approx. cost including labour would be $150.00.\n\nIf the Department have funds available to warrant this expenditure I would most respectfully recommend that the work be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to levelling the ground and erecting a fence at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.

The Department is prepared to allow an amount of $6.00 a month during this period for the purchase of the necessary articles. The teacher should be consulted with reference to what should be purchased.\n\nYou may, also, authorize the teacher to expend an amount of $10.00 in the purchase of prizes for the Christmas entertainment at this school.\n\nPlease arrange for the purchase and delivery of the sewing material required by the teacher of this school at a cost not exceeding $15.00.\n\nThe Department has been informed that the furnace is not working properly, as it does not heat some of the classrooms. We are, also, informed that wood is required for the kitchen. Please let me have a report, as soon as possible, regarding these matters, stating the approximate cost of any work that is necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitowaning, November 23rd, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the last paragraph of Departmental Letter No. 19-5-5 of the 10th instant to the effect that the Department has been informed that a porch is required for the kitchen at Wikwemikong Indian School, and that the furnace is not working properly, as it does not heat one of the classrooms, I have to report that during winters past there has been a storm door on the kitchen, but the teacher would like to have a porch over the door. A suitable porch built on a new foundation with floor, one that can be removed during the warm weather and again set up in cold weather, will cost approximately $25.00.\n\nThe teacher complains that at times the furnace smokes, and is not working properly. I have examined this furnace and found that the chimney, pipe and furnace are kept clean, and seems to be in perfect working order. The only reason I can account for smoke in the classrooms is that the chimney is too low for sufficient draught. I believe if the chimney is extended two feet above it would give the furnace more draught and stop the smoke from backing up in the basement and classrooms when the wind is from the north. The chimney is a high structure and in order to add another two feet in will be costly as it will require a lot of labour and material in erecting scaffolding to reach the top for men to work in extending it higher. I consider that the cost of material and labour in having this chimney built up two feet higher will amount to $25.00 or $30.00, but I believe that it would be wise to have this work carried out as it is the only remedy to stop the furnace from smoking.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, you may have a suitable porch built for the kitchen at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School.

O'Driscoll, made request that a change be made to the entrance doors from the cloak rooms to the two classrooms, as there are not any windows in the cloak rooms. It is necessary to leave the classrooms doors open in order to enable the children to find their wraps on account of being dark. In order to overcome the necessity of having to leave the doors open she would like to have glass inserted in the upper part of the doors which would let in sufficient light from the classrooms. There are four doors which require this alteration, and I have made an estimate of the cost of material and labour in making these changes would be approx. $12.50. As these two rooms are in need of some light, and as there are not any outside walls to have windows installed, I would recommend that a change be made in the doors as suggested by the teacher.\n\nThe basement window where the supply of wood is piled is in need of two glass, and a portion of the hot air pipe in the furnace room should be re-covered with asbestos paper, the cost of material and labour in these repairs will amount to $5.50.\n\nA supply of furnace and kitchen wood is required at an early date as the supply on hand is getting low.

Ross, who will supervise this building, will make an inspection of the old school building while in this vicinity and endeavour to obtain the information you request.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nEXTRACT from letter dated July 5th, 1938, from Engineer R.R. Ross, Engineering & Construction Service.\n\n\"As instructed I have inspected the old building at Wikwemikong which was formerly used for both residential and day school purposes. According to local information, this building was erected approximately 60 years ago and has not been in use since a number of years.\n\n\"The building is two story, 50 feet by 100 feet, of frame construction on a stone foundation. The joists under the floors are 2\" x 10\" and 2\" x 8\" over the second floor ceiling, 15' and 14 feet long, spaced 16\" on centres. The rafters are 2\" x 6\" and the studs 2\" x 6\" and the inside and outside sheathing is rough one inch boards. The exterior walls and ceilings are lathed and plastered and the interior walls are finished in a tongue and groove V joint.\n\n\"All the lumber appears to be white pine and in a fairly sound condition, with the exception of most of the exterior woodwork which has rotted in places. The windows are large and of little value, each containing six lights, 8 by 10 inches, of an inferior quality of glass. The only flooring of any value is in a portion of the building that has been refloored with maple. It is understood the local Indians are requesting this hardwood flooring for use in an Agricultural Hall which they are now constructing.\n\n\"The roof has commenced to leak badly and the building will further deteriorate rapidly since mudstall filling has been used in the interior, evidently for sound deadening.\n\n\"The cost of demolishing the building would depend largely upon the care with which the materials are salvaged. However, it is estimated that to salvage most of the sound lumber and to clean up the premises would cost approximately $400.00.\"\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Old Building, Wikwemikong, Ont.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of the 10th ultimo, we have had our Engineer, who is supervising the contract work for the new day school at Manitoulin Island, look over the building and he has now submitted a report, a copy of which is attached. There is also forwarded herewith six photographs of the building received from our Engineer.\n\nIt will be noted that the estimated cost of demolishing this building, including the salvaging of most of the sound lumber, is $400.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 18, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch:\nFor Old Building, Wikwemikong, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of July 13th, in which your engineer estimates that it would cost $600.00 to demolish the above building, including the removal of most of the sound lumber. In his report the engineer does not state whether materials to the value of $400.00 would be available if the building were demolished.\n\nI should appreciate receiving the engineer's opinion whether or not the material secured from the building would justify the expenditure necessary to demolish it.\n\nActing Director.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental Letter No. 19-5 of the 21st of June, I have the honour to report that on making an inspection of this building recently I find that the roof has been leaking again. Since this school has been built there has been a great deal of trouble with the roof, and especially in the winter months as ice forms and when the weather becomes mild the moisture soaks through around the dormer windows. The roof over each dormer window is too flat, and there does not seem to be any flashing in the meeting of the two roof-slopes which is necessary. In order to have a dry roof it will be necessary to have all the dormer windows re-shingled with galvanized iron flashing placed in all the valleys around the dormers, and in order to have this work carried out it will be quite expensive and a large amount of the shingles will have to be replaced by new material. I estimate that it will be necessary to this roof will cost at least $100.\n\nMiss Trudeau's class-room is also leaking. In order to safeguard against any further damage the plaster will have to be removed and the walls repainted.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nJuly 30, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant in which you estimate that the repairs to the roof of the Wikwemikong School will cost approximately $100.00 for material and labour.\n\nIf the material will cost more than $50.00 it will be necessary to secure it through our Purchasing Branch and in this case you should forward full particulars regarding the material necessary.\n\nIf, however, the material does not cost more than $50.00 you may proceed with the work. In this event, of course, any material necessary should be purchased from firms on the approved list.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of labour and material for repairing the plaster in one of the class rooms will not exceed $15.00. This expenditure is authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI think it well to let you know that the roof of the Wikwemikong school is badly in need of repair. The rain comes in freely through the ceilings of four rooms, one of which is the junior class room. In this room much of the plaster is from all appearances about to fall. We placed pails on the floor to catch at least some of the water so that it might not lodge on the floor during the holidays and destroy it. The rain comes freely through all the upstairs windows.\n\nSince the engineer at Rabbit Island perhaps it could be arranged to have the work of necessary repairs done before the workmen leave there.\n\nAnother defect is that the two entrance doors to the schoolhouse are broken. They are properly speaking, inside doors and of course warped and cracked so that the snow drifts through. I drew the attention of the Indian Agent to this several times.\n\nA bath and toilet have been installed, but the water has not been piped up nor has the hot water tank been connected.\n\nWill you kindly consider my request that the water be piped up so that the toilet and bath can be used and that the necessary connection of the hot water tank be made.\n\nI trust that you may find it possible to consider my request favourably.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nKatherine O'Brien\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\nDear Miss O'Driscoll:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant Indian Agent Lewis has already been instructed to repair the roof of the Wikwemikong School.\n\nI am writing him today regarding the doors and the piping to the toilet and bath.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelen,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss Catherine O'Driscoll,\nGirls' Residential School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe teacher of the Wikwemikong Indian Day School has written to the Department as follows:\n\n\"Another defect is that the two entrance doors to the schoolhouse are broken.

I would, however, recommend that the building be sold for wrecking.\"\n\nIt is considered that there are two possibilities of disposing of this building:\n\nFirst: In view of the Engineer's report, tenders might be received from local firms for the complete removal of the building and salvage material. It is quite probable that the method would net the department more than $200.00 which it is estimated would be saved through the demolition of the building by day labour.\n\nSecond: The Indian Affairs Department might possibly consider that the Indians on the reserve could utilise the salvaged material to an equal if not greater advantage than the estimated cash value of $600.00. On this basis, arrangements might be made by the Indian Agent to have the building demolished by Indian labour in return for the salvaged materials.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

Nor has anything been done toward pumping the water upstairs.\n\nThe serious question of heating the classrooms still confronts us. I had a furnace-fitter who was installing a new furnace in the rectory, come to see what was the matter with the one here. He said that it was by no means large enough to heat the building. That there was a large number of pipes that were too small and the length of several of them (some over two or five feet) were altogether out of order. He said that anyone who understood anything about a furnace would not pretend to say it would heat a building like this, and that it would be condemned by any furnace fitter, not that there was anything much the matter with it put on account of the way it was piped etc.\n\nMr. McCookin was here before I had this information, but I told him that we were most uncomfortable in the class rooms, despite the fact that we kept all upstairs pipes turned off so as to have the heat for them. Only one of the two hot air pipes in the house room functions properly. I told the furnace fitter this pipe was examined, but, according to the furnace fitter, the too long stretch of pipes etc., they could not function properly nor could it be remedied. The same furnace, he said if placed in a different place, would be believed to heat half the building.\n\nThe parents have been, and are complaining, that the children are cold and it is with good reason. Poor tots are so poorly clad it adds to their misery.\n\nI have a suggestion, yes, more... a request... that a chimney be built at the front end of the building (it could be built outside and braced to the roof) and that a cooking range be placed in the senior room. The furnace pipes of senior room could be turned to junior room and in this way perhaps heat it properly.\n\nBesides heating the senior room, I could very conveniently take the cooking lesson right there. The children could make their soup during the winter months as well. This too would fall in with Mr. Healy's desires of household science. I would be delighted to have this convenience for the cooking class, as well as to have a comfortable class room.\n\nWith hopes to receive your kind assistance in this difficulty.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada\nOttawa,\nNovember 23, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letters of August 11 and October 3 with reference to arranging for the installation of some piping at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School. Please give this matter your immediate attention.\n\nI understand that Inspector McCookin authorized you to purchase some storm doors for use at the Wikwemikong School. If you have not yet installed these they should be purchased at once.\n\nI am also informed that it is extremely difficult to heat the class rooms. It has been suggested that a chimney be built at the front end of the building and that a cooking range be installed in the senior room. The Department would appreciate your visiting this school at the earliest possible date and advising us what action you consider should be taken to secure proper heating of the class rooms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

For the convenience of the teacher the water from this well has been piped to the kitchen with a pump installed beside the sink, so that there is an ample supply of water for kitchen use inside.\n\nIn order to get a supply of water to the bath and toilet upstairs, and make use of the hot water tank in the cellar, there would have to be a water system installed which would mean a pressure tank, gasoline power pump and extra piping, as the water would have to be forced from the well to the bathroom and hot water tank.\n\nI estimate that the probable cost of having a water system in this school would be $200.00, and if the Department feels inclined to authorize an expenditure to that amount the work will commence upon advice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Mr. Chelan:\n\nThe letter which you wrote to Mr. J.

I am writing to ask you for a few things which are necessary to make things a little more comfortable here.\n\nMr. McGoogan was here a short while ago and he took note of some of the things which were needed. But as yet I have received nothing for my living quarters.\n\nThe digging of the well is just about completed. I wonder if it could be piped into the kitchen and a small sink installed. It is very inconvenient running outside to empty even little bit of dirty water.\n\nIn the living room there is only a small table and a quite useless old sewing chair. There was a Congoleum rug sent out but I put it in the kitchen as the kitchen floor is walked on and looked worse than the living room.\n\nIt is quite a bore keeping the floor...\nin the living room even as it is,\nI would appreciate very much if\na small rug could be bought for\nit. A couch of some kind is\nneeded too. I see in Eaton's where\na very nice looking studio couch\n(63-1249) can be purchased for only\n$5.95. And a comfortable rocking\nchair in the same catalogue for\n$7.95.\n\nI am certainly delighted with\nthe school and if these additional\narticles could be purchased it\nwould be almost like home\nliving here.\n\nHoping this meets with\nyour approval and thanking\nyou for your interest shown\nin our school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Teacher]\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nDecember 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 25th ultimo no further action need be taken regarding the installation of piping in the Wikwemikong School as the Department is unable to supply the funds for the purpose.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter of the 23rd ultimo I referred to the heating of the class rooms.

I wish to again direct your attention to the fact that while this work was no doubt necessary you did not obtain authority for the expenditure. It is impossible for us to control expenditures if Indian Agents take authority for disbursements without first obtaining our approval. As a matter of fact the cutting of woods on the school grounds is part of the caretaker's duties and should have been provided by the teacher from the amount allowed her for janitor purposes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. R. Johnston, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitoulin, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI wish to report, the teacher of Wikwemikong School, has asked to have a porch 10 ft. by 12 ft. built at the back kitchen door, which would serve as a shelter from winter storms, as their quarters are very cold in winter. They also need the space for storing a little wood, washing and possibly an oil stove in the summer time.\n\nIt could be built inexpensive, with sheeting and paper on roof, studding and V-Joint siding, with one door and one window. It can be built and painted by Indian labour for about $50.00 for material and labour. There should also be provided about 20 ft. of eaves troughing to catch rain water, which would cost about $3.00.\n\nThe two outside doors at main entrance to classrooms are so badly checked that snow in large quantities blows in and is damaging the floors. I have consulted some local contractors and find the doors cannot successfully be repaired without considerable expense; in fact it would be impossible to get a decent job done here and I would recommend the purchase of two new doors 7' X 3' X 4\" white pine, can be procured locally for $2.50 each delivered. It would be advisable also to install new locks, as the old ones are in very bad shape. I would recommend a double grip combination lock with night latch, which costs $12.00 or with one grip and one knob $10.00. An ordinary front door set with knobs would cost $6.00, labour to hang $4.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa,\nOctober 3, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo the Department will allow an amount of $60.00 for material and labour in erecting a porch at the Pikwemikong school.\n\nYou may also purchase 20 feet of eaves troughing, two doors and a double grip combination lock.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nManitouining, Ontario.\nOctober 5, 1939\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to report that Miss Catherine O'Driscoll, teacher, has requested the following articles be furnished for use at the Wikwemikong Indian Day School and that they be purchased from the T.

The building was evidently intended to have pillars in the class rooms, which was substituted with stub posts under the beams, with heavy rods crossing underneath to support the ceiling. Through time the upper floors have settled away from the walls and partitions leaving openings nearly two inches wide, through which the wind comes in, making the place very hard to heat. I would recommend placing about a three inch moulded base board over the other base-board in the rooms upstairs, to close the openings.\n\nIt will require about 100 lineal feet of 3\u00a2 moulded base, which will cost about .03\u00a2 per foot delivered. Possibly .50\u00a2 for nails and should be painted I suppose, although that is not so important at the moment. I think a carpenter would quote it for about .50\u00a2 and about $2.00 for material and labour to rent it.\n\nThe teacher at Wikwemikong School has also requested to have three benches made for use of the children taking hot lunch. I can have these made for about three dollars for material and labour.\n\nThe school organ also needs some little repairs, which will cost about $2.00. I would recommend these expenditures be authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JR\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nJanuary 5, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to make a report on the school building at Wikwemikong.

This amount was intended to cover the 8 day schools in your Agency. We have already authorized a small amount for repairs at the Best Bay and Buswan Schools.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let me know immediately what further amounts you consider should be expended in order to keep these day schools in good condition. When forwarding this information you should specifically mention the amount you suggest be expended at each school. It is understood, of course, that if repairs are not required at any school you will not recommend any expenditure but, in that event, you should give the name of the school at which you consider no repairs are required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFr. C.R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nR.A. Rosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter File No.16-9-5 dated May 23rd; in regard to repairs etc., for the various Day Schools in the Agency, I wish to advise that with the amount of money available, two schools is all we could attempt to paint on the outside. I would say Puzwah and Kaboni are in the worst need of it, about $175.00 each.\n\nWest Bay School needs renovating, repairing plaster and painting on the inside of both class room and living quarters, which will require about $120.00. Birch Island needs renovating and painting inside class room about $75.00.\n\nSucker Creek and Rabbit Island Schools need some gravel hauled to cover the clay around entrances and the floors need shellac and varnishing and a little paint on the entrance platforms, steps and guard rails. This will require about $25.00 each.\n\nAt the present time, I do not know of anything urgently required at Gheshegwaning School.\n\nI believe it has been customary in the past at some of the schools at least, to give the school one thorough cleaning each year in addition to the usual cleaning by the Janitor.\n\nThe salaries of the Janitors are very small, and I think, were based on the assumption that such things would be paid for extra, although I am of the opinion it would be preferable to pay the Janitor sufficient to take care of all the cleaning, putting on storm windows, etc.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCRJ / JH\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nReceipt\n\n$175.00\n\nCash $175.00\n\nBank Draft $100.00\n\nBank Draft $75.00\n\nTotal Cash $21.00\n\nTotal Bank Draft $21.00\n\nTotal $575.00\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Peirce\n\nWith reference to your recent telephone inquiry regarding possible improvements to the schools in the Amiskwai Island Agency I have now received the following recommendation from Indian Agent C.R. Johnston:\n\n1. Povesh Indian Day School -- paint exterior; estimated cost of material and labour $175.00.\n\n2. Kahani Indian Day School -- paint exterior; estimated cost of material and labour $175.00.\n\n3. Nest Bay Indian Day School -- repair plaster and paint interior of class room and living quarters; estimated cost of material and labour $100.00.\n\n4. Birch Island Indian Day School -- paint interior of class room; estimated cost of material and labour $75.00.\n\n5. Sucker Creek Indian Day School -- minor repairs; estimated cost of material and labour $25.00.\n\n6. Rabbit Island Indian Day School -- minor repairs; estimated cost of material and labour $25.00.\nFunds for the above are available in the current year's appropriation and before authorizing the Agent to proceed with the work I should appreciate receiving any instructions that you desire to give.\n\nR.A.

Although an amount was included in the estimates for West Bay School, with the exception of the roof, the outside painting could be left for another year.\n\nThe inside of the Kaboni and Shuswap Schools are in the worst need of attention, but I am enclosing herewith a requisition to cover both inside and outside of Wikwemikong School if funds are available.\n\nThere is a very large roof on Wikwemikong School, and it is a little more economical to purchase the stain by the barrel. One barrel should be about sufficient for Wikwemikong and West Bay School. You will note I have selected a creosote stain for these buildings, which is much cheaper than that used on the agency office and residence last year.\n\nI have quoted prices obtained from the local hardware merchant, C. W. Hinds, which are just ten per cent above wholesale prices to cover cost of freight, cartage etc.\n\nFor convenience, I would recommend that the supplies be purchased locally, as quite frequently a little more or less of certain colors of paint are required.\n\nI expect to be able to secure Indian labour at thirty to thirty-five cents per hour, and the cost of labour for all work at Wikwemikong School, renovating, painting, laying linoleum on kitchen floor, installing new blackboards, overhauling and cleaning furnace and pipes is estimated at $190.00.\n\nIf the funds are available, please forward an advance cheque for this amount, to pay wages, when purchase of material is authorized.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nNOTE:\n\nThe prices shown on the attached list were secured by Indian Agent Johnston from C.

They have also\ncomplained a great deal of the furnace pipes smoking; In an\nattempt to remedy this, I propose to have an extension and cap put\non chimney, which will cost about $5.00.\n\nTo prevent pigs entering the school grounds, I propose\nto put one strand of barbed wire at bottom of wire fence, which\nwill cost about $10.00 for material and labour.\n\nBy purchasing a 25 gallon barrel of creosote stain,\nit can be procured for $1.90 per gallon; Fifteen gallons should\ncover Wikwemikong school and the remainder is required at West Bay.\nThis is a great protection to the shingles, and I would recommend it\nfor these two schools; The cost of labour to apply would be about\n$18.00 for Wikwemikong school.\n\nThere is also the matter of urinals in outside toilets,\nI propose to get advice from Mr Arnell on his return next week, but\nwould like authority to purchase material for the other work and\nwill submit paylist for the labour.\n\nAbout $4.00 is also required to apply varnish to class\nroom floors.\n\n[Signature]\nC.

There will also be an additional cost for having this installed, and I would recommend its purchase, as something must be done to prevent the smoking.\n\nI also wish to report the 25 gallons of stain was sufficient to cover the large roof on Wikwemikong School. I was told by the travelling salesman that this colour may not be available next year, so have had Mr. Hinds order twenty gallons more which can be applied next year.

GREENING'S REPORT,\non the above school, dated May 20th, 1946.\n\n\"I believe that this teacher is doing as well as could be expected. She is interested and devoted, and tries in every way to help her young pupils.\n\nYoung Indian children, however, with their imperfect knowledge of English, present their own problems, and, as remarked previously, fifty-four such children are too many for any teacher to handle with any degree of satisfactory results.\n\nSince the granting of Family Allowances is bound to keep attendance up to a high level, it is more than likely that there may be even more pupils in this junior room next year.\n\nWhether the Indian Schools branch is in a position to provide additional accommodation is not known, but, I believe, the lower floor of the Council Chamber at Wikwemikong, (it was the upper floor of this building in which the pictures mentioned in report on Miss Gattie's class were shown) could be used in an emergency. Perhaps the Agent might be asked to look into the matter of this overcrowding and submit a report.\n\nEnrolment:- Junior Room 44\nSenior Room 29\nOttawa, June 7th, 1946.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nIn a recent report from Inspector Greening, he expressed the opinion that due to the large attendance that can be expected in the Wikemikong Indian School for the academic year 1946-47, a third teacher will be required.\n\nDue to present conditions it will not be possible for us to erect another room this year. Mr. Greening thought that it might be possible to secure the lower floor of the Council Chamber at Wikemikong, as a temporary school for the academic year for 1946-47.\n\nPlease let me have your views regarding this recommendation, and if the Indians are willing to grant use of this portion of the building, you should let me know what rent they will require.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 25, 1946.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitouining, Ontario,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. B.S. Arnell, Inspector of Indians Agencies, with reference to the large number of children who wish to attend the Wikwemikong Indian Day School during the academic year 1946-47.\n\nMr. Arnell states that the old chapel can be rented for $2.00 a month and you may make arrangements to with Reverend Father Dyer for the use of this building. You may also carry out the minor repairs required to make this building suitable for a temporary classroom.\n\nPlease let me know immediately the size of blackboards required.

Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wikwemikong Indian Day School\n\nThe Hardine Sisters have given up teaching services at the Wikwemikong School and consequently Miss Louise Cattie will not return after the summer holidays.\n\nWe are endeavouring to complete arrangements to have the Sisters of St. Joseph take charge of this school. I understand you recently discussed the situation there with Inspector Arnell and Rev. Father Drouin. The school and two rented annexes were surveyed by Mr. Clark of this Department (on Sunday, June 29th) and representatives of the Sisters of St. Joseph.\n\nIt will be necessary for us to improve the accommodation for the sisters as they intend to send three teaching sisters and a housekeeper.\n\nFollowing Mr. Clark's return to Ottawa, Departmental officials have carefully considered the whole matter and we would like you to give immediate attention to the following:\n\n(1) Repairs to Furnace in the School - You should have a competent furnace man look at the heating plant and supply a detailed estimate of the repairs that are required to make the furnace operate satisfactorily. Mr. Clark is of the opinion that the chimney and pipes should be cleaned and that the seams on the fire box and hot air compartment should be cemented. It is also possible that new grates are needed and that the hot air delivery ducts should be insulated.\n(2) Extend the Lean-to at the rear of the School. In this connection Mr. Clark discussed the situation with the sisters and I enclose a rough plan showing two additions which can be placed on the building. If these were erected they would give considerable additional accommodation. The present lean-to at the rear of the building was built by John King in September, 1939. You will note from the plan it is proposed to extend this addition both ways from the existing lean-to. Please obtain an estimate on carrying out this work and if necessary additional windows can be placed in the additions.\n\n(3) The Installation of Electric Plant. We are favourably disposed to installing a small electric plant and available types are being considered. In this connection please obtain from Father Dwyer and forward a description in technical terms and the price of the motor which he told Mr. Clark was available.\n\n(4) Septic Tank. The plans and files that we have on hand do not indicate whether a septic tank or cesspool exists. Please ascertain if either was supplied at any time. If there is such an installation, you should let me know the cost of putting it in proper operation. However, if neither a cesspool or a septic tank has been installed, you should let me know what expenditure would be involved in providing it.\n\n(5) Please obtain and forward a detailed estimate of piping necessary in the building and securing a supply of hot and cold water. This is on the understanding that electricity for operating the pump (but not for heating the water) will be available.\n\nWe would appreciate it very much if you would give this matter your immediate attention and let us have a complete report at the earliest possible date.\nDuring the course of Mr. Clark's conversation with Father Dwyer, the latter stated that the Jesuit Order would be prepared to consider selling the large stone building which they at present own. We are not prepared to consider this offer at the present time but within the next few months we will have one of the officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch examine the building with a view to ascertaining what expenditure would be involved in placing it in proper condition to be used for classroom purposes and in providing living accommodation. We have had experience in renovating such buildings in other places and usually a large expenditure is necessary.\n\nIf the official who visits Wikwemikong decides that we can renovate this building at a reasonable cost, we will provide the funds in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nThe renovations mentioned in the first part of this letter are only intended to be temporary and if carried out reasonably soon, will provide fairly comfortable living quarters for the sisters for the academic year 1947-48.\n\nBernard Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\n11/26\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to C.

Ref. No. 1\n\nWith reference to paragraph (5) of Departmental letter No. 17 dated July 11, 1947, I beg to advise that Father Dwyer mentioned in the above letter has requested the following equipment:\n\n- 1000 Watt Automatic Generator\n- 110 Volts A.C.\n- 12 Volt Start Battery\n- Duro Electric Pump and Pressure Tank\n\nFather Dwyer stated that he would not guarantee the delivery of the equipment by then this week so, I would request you to wire as early as possible to secure this equipment.\n\nIn this connection, I wish to advise, it would be necessary to provide a cistern in the basement for water supply to the bathroom.\nOtter, 26 July, 1947.\n\nJ. W. Wardle Esq.,\nDirector Surveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nCarter Bldg., Elgin & Linger Sts.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Wikwemikong Day School.\n\nIt is intended to supply an Electric Lighting Plant for the Wikwemikong Day School. The plant will be used to light the whole building and to operate the pump for the water system.\n\nIt is suggested that the most satisfactory type of equipment will be an Automatic Plant delivering a voltage of 110 A.C.\n\nThe building is already wired but lacks electric fixtures. A full set of plumbing was installed but there is no Septic Tank or Water Cistern. These are also to be installed along with the Electric Plant preferably before school opens in September.\n\nThe plan for the school is No. 625, dated June, 1938. The building has been modified since that date. It now has a full basement and a lean-to at the rear, the dimensions of which are 12' x 10'. This lean-to is being extended to give an additional floor area of 300 square feet.\n\nThe agent has had an offer of the following items:\n\n- 1000 Watt Automatic Delco Plant 110 Volts A.C. $596.00\n- 12 Volt Start Battery $36.00\n- Dare Electric Pump and 542 Pressure Tank $108.00\nThis equipment must be purchased or refused within the next few days. Your opinion is, accordingly, requested as to whether this equipment is of suitable type and particularly of sufficient power to guarantee adequate service.\n\nIf you consider that the equipment described above should not be purchased, or if no recommendation be received, please, concerning the type and price of adequate equipment, provide that fluorescent lighting fixtures would be installed in the school-rooms and kitchen only.\n\nGAP/MD.\n\nDirector\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd ultimo regarding the Wikwemikong School, we are obliged to consult the Surveys and Engineering Branch. Their electrical expert has been absent from the office on business but will return on August 5th at which time he will be interviewed and we will endeavour to forward you more definite information immediately afterwards.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would let me know what progress is being made with the other items mentioned in our letter of July 11th.\n\nBernard F.

Wawaikong Indian Day School - The school plumbing is leaking between the two floors above the kitchen. The Agent has been authorized to have this checked immediately and the necessary repairs made. The school roof leaks at two places. The Agent has been authorized to have this thoroughly inspected and have the spots where the leakage occurs re-shingled. This may entail a few shingles or a couple of square feet. However, as it is ruining the ceiling on walls, it was necessary to have this done immediately. Ceilings at the spot of leakage will have to be re-plastered. It is not more than a few square feet at each spot.\n\nThere is plenty of water in the well but apparently the cylinder of the pump is leaking and would need new leathers. The Agent has been asked to have this done. It should entail very little expense.\n\nThe Department confirms the decisions made by Mr. Doucet and wish you to have the above done as soon as possible.\n\nWe have received your wire re the condenser and coil for the electrical plant. These articles have been ordered through Fairbanks-Morse and will be forwarded to you as soon as they arrive.\n\n2.

Quotations have been obtained from C.W. Hinds and S.W. McPhee of Manitowaning and a few items from Eaton's Catalogue.\n\nI would suggest the purchasing agent secure the Sewing Machine, Looms, Softball bats and volley ball. The Looms are quoted from Moyer's Arts and Crafts Catalogue Page 62.\n\nIn connection with the generating plant furnished for this school, I beg to advise the plant is still not in operation. Mr. George H. Hamilton, Electrician, who set the plant up has been endeavoring for some time to get another magneto from the Company. He did manage to get it to operate for a short time by manual control and then the oil pump assembly had to be returned to the Company. This was considered to be defective and was being replaced free of charge but was not the proper parts and had to be returned again on December 20, 1948.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department can do anything to expedite shipment of repairs for this machine.\n\nC.

It will still not operate on the magneto but appears to work quite satisfactorily on batteries.\n\nThe Sisters at the School would, I believe, be very glad to have it even as it is (Manual Control,) however, in telephone conversation with Mr. Doucet, he advised me to have the machine returned if it did not give satisfaction, however, before returning the machine would it be possible that the Company would send their own mechanic to examine it?\n\nI would suggest we should not keep the machine unless it will operate automatically, that is, by remote control.

Sime, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa, October 31, 1906.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to call your attention to the very unsatisfactory attendance at the Whitefish River school. The return for the quarter ended September, last, shows an enrolment of only two pupils, with an average, to quote the teacher's remarks, of \"Reductio ad absurdum\". They only attended six days out of the whole quarter, although the teacher was present every day.\n\nThe average attendance for the year ended June 30, last, was only three, and for the past five years the average has never exceeded four. Your Lordship will see that the Department can hardly be expected to maintain a school which shows such poor results as the Whitefish River, and it thinks that an effort might be made to have the few children on the reserve placed in the Shingwauk Home, where there are vacancies, as it will be impossible to continue the school much longer.\n\nThe Department would like to have Your Lordship's views on this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nS. STEWART\nAsst. Secretary.\n\nRight Reverend G. Thorneloe, D.D.,\n\nBishophurst,\n\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSancti Maria O\nNov. 9th 1906\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received this day from Mr. Rev. George Pierson who is in charge of the mission at Attikamag River. The letter is only preliminary as you will see. I hope soon to have a more definite statement to lay before the Department.\n\nGreat hearts assure you that it is our work to make the work as thorough as we can, and that it is a great task to meet so many adverse forces, withstand them in our efforts.\n\nBelieve me\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nTo the Sec'y\nIndian Department\nOttawa, O.\nMy Dear Lord Bishop,\n\nReplying to yours of the 2nd inst., I have the honour to communicate from the Department of Indian Affairs having reference to the unsatisfactory condition of things in connection with the school at Shuswap Lake. I have to say that my experience for the present, and most of the coming weeks are such that I shall be unable to get to the North Shore in time but if the weather shows an inclination to help me, I will try to get on and make thorough inquiry into matters. But should it become evident that I may not be able to get there till after the Lakes are frozen sufficient to admit of travel by them, I am only aware in a general way, in the present situation, that the Department is correct in its statement, and also agree that it would appear better to have the few children sent to the women. In any case, the Church can do no less than a mission and can do nothing in that direction whether the Indians can be induced to take the views of it or not.\n\nI am anxious to know what the Indians who do not attend are doing that should be sent to the women. I do not think the cause of the non-attendance lies with the teacher. Mr. Ross has been very satisfactory to all parties, and we have often answered his complaints but our knowledge was insufficient in order to come to better results. We do not think there are more than six children of school age on the Reserve, that we could call permanent, perhaps not that number, and it would appear that these have been about almost all summer. It is a habit with these Indians to go off to the \"few hills mines\" to obtain work, taking their families with them where they get literally paid pay, but they do not work steady and as a rule a part deal of what they earn is used to purchase whisky. And I fear the minds of the women do not improve by their\nComing into contact with unscrupulous whites, they are seduced beyond all control and are put in touch with anything such as alcohol or sickness for a long period of time. In winter the men go to the lumber camps where wages are paid but they do not work. They are paid and permitted to spend their earnings in liquor. In many cases the women accompany them and are provided with a hut to live in upon condition that they agree to work for the man belonging to the camp. And of course the children have to go too. At such places shelter is often given to women friends or relations of the Indians and their wives and their residence there is often fear is not for the best purpose. When Indians living in the number of persons belonging to Birch Island, i.e., Whitefish River there are quite a number owing to the Board of School age, yet they do not reside there and I should judge surely that their health would suffer, but are paid at whatever place they present themselves to the Agent. If these Indians with their families were compelled to reside within the Reserve and instructed the land to come to participate in the annuities or benefits of the Board I feel certain that there would be a marked improvement in the number at school and also in the general welfare of the Indians as a whole. I expect to hear to say that drunkenness among the Indians is increasing at such a rate that a sober man is almost rare, and this situation is only to be borne until the law is applied, the restriction of liquor to the Indians is carried out.\n\nI have an appointment set for an interview with the local Indian attorney for better to manage in regard when I go fully into this matter with him and also regarding the way in which parties who have already committed marriages are allowed to their and the law and at this juncture take up with other men or women as the case may be, will in turn cause problems in marriage testimony. It is with regret reluctance may feel that I have had to make these statements. But I feel that the welfare of our Indians can only be advanced by our removing itself to get at plain fact and then deal with them in an effective way. Without I think these questions can not even run the half halt mile. Better run my own buck, but by please\nOttawa, November 29, 1906.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., with enclosure from the Rev. George Prewer, resident missionary, in regard to the very small attendance at the Whitefish River school, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will await further information before taking any action in regard to this school.\n\nThe other matters referred to by Mr. Prewer will receive the attention of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nMOLEAU\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Reverend G.

P.\nPovesh, having reference to the School at White\nFish on the North Shore, about which the\nDepartment wrote me some time ago. Mr.\nPovesh's letter deals with the question of\nsmall attendance, and makes certain\nsuggestions which I am sure the Department\nwill carefully consider.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\nGeorge Algoma\nShepwin Lake - Oct.\nJanuary 14th 1907\n\nMy Dear Lord Bishop,\n\nI have to report that on Friday the 28th ultimo while over at the matter then points, I called a meeting of the Indians to consider the matter of the closing of the school by the Department owing to the meager attendance of pupils at the White Fish River School. There was a fairly number present and all appeared pretty interested in the matter. Nothing and all the leading people were present opposed to the school being closed. They all agree that the attendance has been small they state that the number of children of school age resident on the reserve is approximately 100 would appear that there were only two - this quarter apparently the school will only open until June or the 30th. The Indians say that they will do all that is possible to put better at dinner. It is evident that a \"pull\" exists between the Indians in the own residents in between those that reside in the reserve and their resident at the mouth of the White Fish River. Where there are a number of children of school age. It appears that they have wanted the school there. But as they hear my signature to the land and are outside the reserve limits I feel that it would be wrong to ask for the change. They have done of them promised to make an effort to send their children to where the present school is in the summer. It is supposed that the new Railway will run through this portion of the country and the Indians believe that they will be able to sell their improvements and with the proceeds move to within reach of the present school and build new dwellings. Then the Indians excellent claim that there will be more children about a number of school age that will attend them. This coming summer, and they are partly opposed to the proposition of the department to close the school. We haven't heard anything in this matter at the end of June. And the Indians say that a strong\nAmputated teacher - a married man of private means, and that he be paid a salary of $250 per month instead of the present salary. I am aware that the department feels that it is not justified in paying so much salary at the present salary, but the Indians think that an efficient young man would draw more and mean a better attendance, and they believe that such a man can not be had at the present salary. I think the suggestion would be worth a trial. In view all agree that in spite of the increased number of children of school age in the Thompson Lake Reserve, Mr. Major, the present teacher has accomplished wonderful results. The Indians have taken a big interest in the work and some very complimentary remarks have been made by the chief and leader, likewise in the lack of their wishes and the management in general. I think that in order to secure the best result the teachers of the Indian schools should be paid as high as those of the usual white schools, and at the present time a male teacher can readily command a salary of $250 per month.\n\nBelieve me, my Lord Bishop,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp: Poor Copy]\nOttawa, January 20, 1907,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 31st inst., inclosing a communication from the Rev.

McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss D.C. Petrant,\nBear Islands,\nOnt.\nIf the Department views the suggestion of His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma favourably and decides to give the school at Whitefish River Reserve another trial it will be necessary that the school building receive certain repairs and it will also be necessary to provide accommodation for the teacher. In order to know what the cost of repairs and providing a place for the teacher to lodge and board I would have to pay a visit to the reserve and take a mechanic with me to make an estimate as this school is situated in an out of the way place and not accessible through ordinary routes of travel.\n\nThe Church authorities have a man that they can place in charge in the person of Mr. Harry Cartilidge the present teacher of the Sheguinandah School who they intend replacing at Sheguinandah with a Mr. Adams should the Department decide to have the Whitefish River School re-opened. Personally I would like to see a school in operation at this reserve but, to be candid, I fear that the attendance will, if the school is re-opened, be a disappointment. The greater number of children live at the mouth of the Whitefish River which is about four miles from the Reserve where the school is situated and as I remarked before these Indians are living on surrendered land and belong to several bands. If a school were put in operation at this point the expense of same could not be charged to any particular band could it? According to the suggestion of the Bishop the re-opening of the school at the Reserve is entirely dependent upon the teacher being allowed to teach one half the time at the reserve and the other half off the reserve as it is off the reserve where they expect to get the attendance. Trusting I have placed the matter before you in an intelligent manner that you may be able to understand the exact condition of affairs and awaiting your instructions\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning, Ont.\nSeptember 7th 1911\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma has expressed his wish to have the school at Whitefish River re-opened. When I was at the reserve in July I took a careful census of the resident children thereof school age and who if the school were re-opened would be expected to attend.\n\nI found that at that time there were five children between the ages of six and fifteen years resident on the reserve. Since my visit I understand that three of these have been admitted to the Shingwauk home which would leave only two of school age there. There are also two children that are in their fifth years and who might attend if the school were re-opened. The Bishop also suggested that the teacher be allowed to teach for six months on the reserve and for six months at the mouth of the Whitefish River where there are several Indian families residing. I do not view this proposition favorably as I do not think the Indians at Whitefish River mouth should be encouraged in any way to remain there as they have no rights, but, are simply squatters on surrendered land. There are seven or eight families living at this point who are members of Sucker Creek, Spanish River, South Bay and other bands and there might be half a dozen Indian children of school age there. There is no school house accommodation and I do not consider it would be practical at all to establish a school at this point.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant and in reply I beg to say that under the circumstances the Department is not prepared to give consideration to the question of re-opening the school on the Reserve. As there are so few children either there or at the mouth of the River, it is thought that they can be accommodated at the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG.

Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. This Department provided the funds for the materials used, viz: $500, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band. We approved of an expenditure to the extent of $45.00, the same being paid from band funds.\n\nThe Department owns this building.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RO 10, Volume 6182)\n\nFile 448-5, part 8\nManitoulin Island - Wikwemikong Day School -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts,\n1912 - 1949\n\nFile 448-8, part 1\nManitoulin Island - Wikwemikong Day School -\nTeachers' Residence - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts, 1900 - 1903, 1909, 1914,\n1925 - 1927\n\nFile 449-1, part 1\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Day School -\nAdministration, 1887 - 1911, 1923\n\nFile 449-1, part 2\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Combined School -\nAdministration, 1916 - 1949\n\nFile 449-3, part 1\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Combined School -\nSalaries, 1916-1946\n\nFile 449-5, part 1\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Combined School -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts -\nAdministration, 1887 - 1923\n\nFile 449-5, part 2\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Combined School -\nBuilding Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts,\n1916 - 1937\n\nFile 449-8, part 1\nManitowaning - Whitefish River Day School -\nTeachers' Residence - Building Maintenance,\n1896 - 1899\n\nFile 450-1, part 1\nChristian Island - R.C.

There are 20 Indian children of school age, besides 9 white children, in all 30 children with no provision made for their schooling. The range where all the Indians reside is less than one square of a mile in extent. All the Indians are in three families of which are Protestants excepting one Indian family, French, who are nearly all the Indians being of the Shagor and Creeks. There never was a school at this village, but there is a building at Whitefish River about 7 miles south, that is now used for Anglican church, the school having been closed for some years. The house of John Kishkoperais (marked X on the enclosed sketch), which is now used for services on Sunday, can be rented in town for a year, for the use of the school. It is a commodious well lighted log house, with a church bell in it, big enough to accommodate all the children in the Village.

The white settlers have promised to\ncontribute one hundred dollars annually to the support\nof the teacher, who is a Mr. Bell from Aspin and expects\nto take charge about the first of next month.\n\nThe authorities of the church claim that they are making\na start on their own initiative rather than see so many\nchildren neglected, but as the Indian children are to attend\nthey feel justified in asking the Department to assist in\npaying the teacher's salary, and help equip the school\nwith desks, blackboard etc.\n\nThe teacher is a man of mature age, not eligible for\nmilitary service, who will also do missionary work among\nthe Indians, which should mean a big improvement at White-\nfish.\n\nWould the Department be good enough to advise me if it\nis in favour of starting this union school, and if not, what\nboarding school are the Indian children to be placed in,\nwhether it be Chapleau or the Shingwauk Home at Sault Ste.\nMarie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwho may attend.

The amount of this grant will be dependent upon the qualifications and experience of the teacher and in any event will not exceed $400.00 per annum. Kindly let the Department have full information as to the qualifications, experience, etc., of Mr. Bell, who you state expects to take charge of this school about the first of the month. When this information is received the Department will be in a position to decide the exact amount it will be prepared to contribute towards the teacher's salary.\n\nThe Department is also prepared to furnish desks, blackboards and school supplies for the Indian children.\n\nR.

Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n**REQUISITION FOR SCHOOL MATERIAL**\n\nFor Whitefish River Union School on Whitefish River\n\nReserve in Manitowaning Agency\n\n| ARTICLES          | No. on Hand. | Date of Ind.

You must be the Indian Department in the facts, and add that when they get another folder to hold schoolwork, they will give you a fresh outfit.\" May I therefore apply to close up if possible and send the last of requirements to Mr. Lewis, as usual.

Original on 456267/7.\n\nMr. Bell informed me that on account of the high cost of living at the present time he is afraid that he will have to resign his position, as $400.00 per year will not support his family.\n\nAs Mr. Bell is a valuable man to the Indians at Birch Island and Whitefish as well as in the class-room, I would recommend that he should have a raise in his salary.\nOttawa, January 9, 1918.\n\nMr.\u2014\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Whitefish River Joint school for the month of December, last, in which you recommend that Mr. Bell, the teacher, should have a raise in his salary, I beg to say that, before considering this matter, the Department would like to know how many white children attend this school and what amount the white settlers contribute to Mr. Bell's salary. Kindly furnish this information as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

When I visited this\nschool last month there was only one white pupil\npresent.\n\nMr. Bell informed me that the white settlers\ncontributed one hundred to his salary each year,\nand furnish him with a house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 21, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in reference to your recommendation that the salary of Mr. Bell, teacher of the Whitefish River Joint School, be increased, and reporting that there are ten white pupils in the vicinity of the school, but only one living close enough to attend regularly, and that Mr. Bell informed you that the white settlers contribute $100.00 to his salary and furnish him with a house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it is unable to grant Mr. Bell any increase at the present time, as it has no funds available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nSpecial report on the Oliver family.\n\nThe father is ill-health but very much under his wife's orders. He has two grown-up sons by a previous marriage, of a nice, living, of which they have been very fond.\n\nOf late the attendance of this family has been very bad.\n\nDeaths ending:\n\nMar. 18: June 18: Sep. 18: Dec. 18:\nBecky 4/5 3/6 0\nChar. 4/6 2/8 1/6 8/2\nJames 3 0 0 0\n\nDuring the present quarter none of the children have been at all.\n\nAs far as Charlie is concerned he does not come badly, but Becky, ever since she has been old enough to help at home has been kept away from school.\n\nJames came about 3 or 4 days ago very sick, but got a whipping and never came since.\n\nOliver is an unenfranchised Indian, but leads the Indian mode of life, a nomadic one on the reserve.\nI believe he has been ill, often suffering from illness. Some time ago, he allowed a great deal of drinking at his house, but I could never get two witnesses; tho' on one occasion I did get one woman who told Mr. Lewis (Agent) & Mr. Shields (Law P.C.) that she obtained the liquor at Oliver's, but of his children (now dead) was at Spanish Industrial school, & Oliver was very displeased with the treatment she received there, & is against any other of his going to a Home. Therefore I propose, a letter from our at headquarters to him, telling him plainly that unless the children, Becky, Clara & James, show good attendance at this period they will be removed to a home, will probably produce results.\n\nThe keeping him here has a bad effect on all the other Indians. I convinced them you can do something in this matter. Mr. Lewis leaves far away, that he can do but little.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature] Bell\nOttawa, March 1, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Whitefish River Joint School for the year ending December 31st, last, together with a special report on the attendance at school of the three Oliver children.\n\nIn connection with this report I beg to say that the Department will inform Oliver that if his children do not attend school regularly, steps will be taken to have them committed to an Industrial School. However, before doing so, you will be good enough to state Mr. Oliver's Christian name, his postoffice address and the age of the three children referred to in your report.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Dist.\n\nAge of children: Becky Oliver... about 13.\nCharles Oliver... 10\nJames Oliver... 8.\n\nThese ages are so far, appear also they may not be quite correct.\nI must thank you very much for your kindness in enforcing attendance, as there is no particular benefit to me to have more pupils of the troublesome sort. It is more like Oliver who causes a lot of trouble by keeping under cover & doing a bad example, & making it very hard for me to maintain discipline in the school.\n\nI will report again late to find these children around. The reason excuse just at present perhaps for the girls absence is my mother is not well & his wife only recently confined, but for a long time there was no excuse at all, nor has there ever been any excuse the boys are concerned.\n\nI am faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSimeon Bell\nOttawa, April 11th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo, in regard to Henry Oliver's children who do not attend school regularly.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department is instructing Agent Lewis to inform Oliver that unless he sends his children to school regularly, he will be put off the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDuncan Bell, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWhitefish River Combined School\nWhitefish Falls\nvia Little Current,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 11th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is informed by Mr. Duncan Bell, teacher of the Whitefish River Combined school, that Henry Oliver an unfranchised Indian, living on the reserve refuses to send his children to school, regularly. By so doing, he sets a bad example for the Indians.\n\nOliver's address is Whitefish Police, via Little Current. You will be good enough to inform him that, unless he sends his children to school, regularly, in future, he must get off the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.J.

You will be instructed to inform the teacher accordingly. He should forward a return showing the attendance and days taught during the quarter, in order that the amount of salary and bonus due can be paid him.\n\nAll school material should be stored, in order that, if this school is re-opened at any future time, the necessary material such as desks, school supplies, etc., will be on hand.\n\nYou should inform the teacher promptly of the Department's decision regarding the closing of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJanuary 30th, 1920\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 486167/1\nof the 5th ultimo, in regard to closing the\nWhitefish River Union School, I have the honor\nto report that I informed the teacher on the\ntenth ultimo, that the school would be closed\nat the end of that quarter.\n\nI visited the Whitefish Reserve on the\n9th instant, and stored the school material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nJanuary 9th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to report that I visited the Whitefish River Reserve on the 4th instant, and found when there that the school has been re-opened, the teacher in charge gave his name as Mr. Lawrence Gordon, and he claimed to have authority from His Grace, the Archbishop of Algoma, to re-open the school. On the day of my visit there were only four young Indian children in attendance and in looking over his daily register I found that he had ten Indian pupils registered, but the majority of these are too young to permit them to attend regularly.\n\nAfter conversing with Mr. Gordon for sometime in connection with the re-opening of the school, I was given to understand that on account of the Archbishop authorizing the school to be re-opened the Indian Department would pay the teacher's salary, supply wood, stationery, etc., as it had been done when Mr. Duncan Bell was in charge of the school.\n\nIf it is the wish of Mr. Gordon to continue to teach in this school, as there are a number of White children attending, I would most respectfully recommend that he be paid at a rate per capita per annum for each Indian child who is of school age, on the average attendance from the time the school opened after the Christmas holidays.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that all the pupils of the Whitefish River Reserve, who were of school age and physically fit, were placed in boarding schools last summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 12, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 9th instant, referring to the re-opening of the Whitefish River Union School. In reply I beg to state that the Department has not authorised anyone to commence teaching operations at this point. I am of the opinion that, before the school equipment was used by the teacher, Mr. Lawrence Gordon, you, as Indian Agent, should have been approached for the necessary permission.\n\nConcerning teacher's salary and a supply of wood and stationery, etc., the Department is not prepared to take the responsibility. You will remember that this school was closed two years ago, because of poor attendance and the fact that, with only a few Indian children available, we are not warranted in an expenditure such as was incurred in the years 1918 and 1919. Such children of school age can be placed in the Shingwauk Home or Spanish Residential Schools.\n\nIn view of the fact that His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has given Mr. Lawrence Gordon instructions to commence teaching; whereas the building was erected by the Church of England authorities and whereas some Indian children wish obtain benefit from the operation, I am convinced that the equipment that the Department of Indian Affairs has supplied be allowed to be used for the time being. You may inform Mr. Gordon that the Department will not be responsible for salary or any other expenses in connection with the upkeep of the school. If you report, however, that a few Indian children are obtaining an education at this school, we might allow school supplies and stationery.\n\nThis activity was initiated at this time by the Church authorities, without reference to the Department of Indian Affairs, and they will have to look to themselves for the financing of the project.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nDept. of Indian Education.\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\n31st March 1922.\n\nMy dear Dr. Scott:\n\nAt the earnest request of the people concerned we are making a fresh venture at Whitefish Falls by reopening the school, and have placed Mr. A. M. Newby, a capable man, in charge. The school is to open tomorrow, the 1st April, with some ten children in attendance.\n\nWe have been unable to procure the proper instruction books here, and I am therefore writing to ask if the Department can see its way to making a grant of the supplies usually furnished to such a school. The instruction books required would be from the Primary Grade up to and including the Third Reader. I would be glad if a school flag could also be provided.\n\nI recognize that this request is not quite in order, as the Department has not authorized the reopening of the school; but the great need has been our excuse for making the attempt, and we trust that the Department may be able to help us to this extent.\n\nShould our request be granted the supplies should be sent to Mr. A. M. Newby, Whitefish Falls, via Little Current.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge Algoma\nOttawa, April 4, 1923.\n\nRt. Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ultimo, concerning the re-opening of the Whitefish River (Union) Indian Day School. I have noted that the teaching activities commenced on the first instant and that certain supplies are needed in connection with the operation of the classroom.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that Mr. Agent Lewis, of Manitowaning, is being instructed to have Mr. Meeby, the Teacher, requisition for what school supplies he believes to be needed. In the interim, I have directed that a quantity of scribblers and pencils be sent without delay.\n\nIf this venture proves a success, this Department may be able to assist in connection with the missionary teacher's salary, and we will be as generous as possible in the matter of supplies.\n\nI am,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nThe school & the teacher's rooms require disinfecting badly, so I should be very grateful if you can send me a supply of formaldehyde.

I am notified the main aspect of my appointment is hopes I may have the pleasure of a visit from your honor when he is in the vicinity. If you can allow me a supply of school material, will you kindly send me some requisition forms also a School Register if you can get it.\nI am sure I hope to open the school for a few weeks before the holidays.

I understand that at present you do not support this school but I hope if we make a success of the work that you will at any rate encourage us.\n\nMy wife has had several years experience teaching in the city of Bristol, & holds a King's scholarship, & in certain subjects she will undertake the teaching which I ought to be of great value. At present the school has an unfinished & neglected appearance, & the rooms for the teacher\nI would require to be lined with Beaver board to make them warm enough for winter use, and in order to make the school a credit to the Department of the Dominion, I would recommend the following improvements.\n\nIn the school-room we require a supply of school materials, and outside as soon as I am putting in a garden a desire to plant out trees & flowers, a few\n\n4'6 absolutely necessary, with one large gate & two small ones, a swing & see-saw for the play-ground also a flag-pole should be erected before Dominion Day.\n\nThe school has never been painted, and as the school is close to the new York Road, & also in sight of the Railway, it is most important that it should have a neat & well kept appearance.\nOttawa, June 10th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Mr. Lucius F. Haruyman, Whitefish Falls, Ont., in which he states that he has recently arrived from England to take charge of the school at that point. He requests that certain repairs be made to the building and teacher's residence, and that school material and medicines be supplied.\n\nI may say that the Department has not authorised anyone to commence teaching operations at this point, and is not prepared to incur any expenditure at the present time in carrying out Mr. Haruyman's requests. We are informing him that if this activity was initiated at this site by the Church authorities, without reference to the Department of Indian Affairs, he will have to look to them for the financing of the project.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state if you have any information regarding the re-opening of this school and the engaging of Mr. Haruyman. You should also state the number of Indian children of school age who would be likely to attend, also whether this school was formerly known as the Whitefish River combined school, or the school at Birch Island, or the Whitefish River Reserve. We are anxious to determine from Mr. Haruyman's letter as to which of these schools he has reference to. Your early reply giving me full information as possible regarding the activity of Mr. Haruyman will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. J.

This school was closed a number of years ago because of poor attendance, and it is felt that, with the number of Indian children available, we would not be warranted in incurring the expenditure required in placing the school and teacher's residence in a good state of repair. We are not prepared to undertake any responsibility for salary or for any other expenses in connection with the upkeep of the school. If this activity was initiated at this time by the Church Authorities, without reference to the Department of Indian Affairs, you will have to look to them for the financing of the project.

At the present time there\nare several of these children attending Shingwauk Home\nat Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., and after the mid-summer\nholidays there are at least three more Indian children\nwhich should be sent to the Shingwauk School.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department\nthat I find it very much better for the welfare of the\nchildren at Whitefish Falls to place them in boarding\nschools, and if it is the desire of the Church authorities\nto continue the school they should finance the undertaking\nthemselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIndian Office, Manitowaning,\nAugust 14th, 1924.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nReferring to Official Letter No. 19-0-1 of June the 10th last, regarding the re-opening of the Whitefish River Joint School, I have the honour to report that I am in receipt of a communication from Mr. Hardyman intimating that the school will be re-opened after the holidays and requesting that the matter be taken up with the Department in view of the necessary school material supplied by the Department.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that in this school is reopened after the holidays there will be a few Indian children attend for while, and I would recommend that if Mr. Hardyman should make out a small requisition for stationery for the use of these children the same should be furnished by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n19-10-1.\n\nOttawa, August 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 163-19 of the 14th instant, informing me that Mr. Hardyman intends to open the Whitefish River Combined School.

Hardeman, who taught in Indian schools for many years and who is now teaching at Whitefish Falls. I am informed that when this teacher resigned from Indian school work, in 1916, the Department gave very favorable consideration and a retiring allowance equal to six months' salary was granted. Allowance cannot be given in his case, as teachers of Indian day schools do not contribute to any superannuation fund.\n\nTeachers of Indian day schools are nominated, in the great majority of cases, by the churches interested in the work and the Department of Indian Affairs does not feel largely responsible for these matters upon their retirement. Mr. Hardeman, during his service, was the joint employee of the Church of England and the Department. At the present time, he must be considered solely a church employee as, apparently, the Whitefish Falls School is parochial in character. I understand that the Archbishop of Algoma sent Mr. Hardeman to conduct this school, which is held in a building owned by the Church.\n\nIn the light of these facts, you will understand that I cannot arrange anything further for this gentleman.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.

LEWIS, INDIAN AGENT, MANITOWANING, DATED JANUARY 9, 1929.\n\n---\n\nMr. Hardiman, who is doing mission work at Whitefish and conducts the school, wishes it to be made plain to the Department that he is not urging such a grant but that on account of it being difficult to conduct this school through shortage of funds it was thought that the Department might see their way clear to grant such favour.\n\nAs there are nine Indian children attending this school, would it be possible for the Department to allow a grant per capita such as has been allowed the Separate School at Little Current for each Indian pupil.\n\n---\n\nNOTE - The grant referred to was a request that this Department provide the sum of $80 for the purchase of fuel.\nOttawa, January 18, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 9th instant, in which you ask to be informed if it would be possible for the Department to allow a tuition grant for the Indian children who are attending the mission school conducted by Mr. Hardyman at Whitefish, I have to request that you will furnish further particulars regarding the Indian children who attend. You should state the band to which they belong and whether you consider that all the children classed as Indians are wards of the Department. Please state who is responsible for the expenses in conducting the school and whether it is entirely a missionary enterprise or if the Provincial Government provides a grant.\n\nAs you are aware, this Department has never recognized this activity other than to provide a small quantity of school material.\n\nWhen we have full information as to the status of the children referred to by you, consideration will then be given to the providing of a tuition grant such as is allowed in the case of the Indian children attending the separate school at Little Current.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He was also requested to state the Band to which they belong and whether they are wards of this Department or not. When we have full information as to the status of these children, consideration will then be given to the providing of a tuition grant such as is allowed in the case of Indian children attending white schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Office, Manitouwining,\nFebruary 21st, 1939.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Departmental Letter No. 153-19 of January 18th last, with reference to the question of allowing a tuition grant for the Indian children who are attending the mission school conducted by Mr. Hardyman at Whitefish, I have the honour to report that there are seven Indian children attending this school who have been recognized as wards of the Department as follows:\n\n1 from family No. 38 Whitefish River Band\n1 from family No. 40 Buck Creek\n2 from family No. 56 Sheguianah\n3 from family No. 60 Hevey Inlet Band.\n\nThe last three children are not paid annuities from the Hevey Inlet Band but the family have always been recognized as wards of the Department and the older children have been educated at the Shingwauk Home by the Department.\n\nThe daily register shows also that there are five half-breed Indian children attending who are not wards of the Department.\n\nNo grant is received from the Provincial Government in connection with this school. It is entirely a missionary undertaking. A few years ago the Department provided a grant toward the payment of the teacher's salary but this grant was discontinued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 27, 1939.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is considering a small grant on account of the mission school which is conducted by Mr. L. F. Hardyman at White Fish Falls. Before a final decision is reached, I should like to know how this school is financed. Perhaps Your Lordship will be in a position to answer this question. Further, if the Department makes a small grant, should we pay it direct to Mr. Hardyman or would it be better to have it paid to the diocesan office. I understand that approximately one-half the pupils who are regularly attending are wards of this Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. R. H. Smith, D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishopricat,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 103-19 of Feb. 2nd inst.\n\nYesterday I wrote you say my letter was unsigned & undated, please accept my apologies.\n\nI was quite unaware that I did so. With reference to the Indian children attending this school who are not Treaty Indians, I contend we have not been fairly treated, all we ask is fair play. If you get the Indian Agents or Manitoulin Island to make a list of all the children attending the schools & pick out all who are not Treaty Indians you will find my whole average attendance. I have stated only 4 of the 12 Indian children are eligible, but they are all of Indian mothers, they are living here, their fathers in most cases lived with the women for some time before marrying them, he eventually\nIn the case of the Bourgouin children, the mother was a daughter of John Raynolds, & he married a Polish, & he deserted her some years ago, & the village has no support him as best we can. I am now living in the house of the Rays straight. He has three children at school. In art the Raynolds has had children but only one is eligible, as the youngest was born out of wedlock.\n\nHenry Oliver, is non-treaty, but are Indians not half-breed. He has 3 children attending, 2 of his boys were educated at the boarding schools.\n\nWe have 21 pupils on our register all attending except Charlotte Mitchell, I have been told she has gone to Shequinda School just lately. When we came here nearly 5 years ago this school was not fit for habitation, & no out-buildings & the hard work entailed too.\nbroken my health, I have had to raise all the money to get the place in good order, whereas if we had not been discriminated against, I would have been saved all this work & worry. Mr. Lewis knows exactly how the school is being run, also the Rev. P. Weller, but I feel convinced the authorities at Ottawa are not intentionally unfair, and I will gladly give you any further information.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLucius F. Hardyman\nDiocese of Algoma\n\nBISHOP: THE RIGHT REV. ROCKSBOROUGH R. SMITH, M.A., D.D.\n\n1st March, 1929.\n\nIn reply to your letter number 19-10-1 of February 27th, I am very glad to hear that your Department is considering a small grant on account of the mission school for Indians at Whitefish Falls because I am convinced that Mr. Hardymann is doing a splendid work there and has much improved both the building and the tone of the school.\n\nThis school was built by the Church of England and is wholly financed by this Diocese which pays for the upkeep of the school and also pays the whole salary of the teacher. This is the only instance in the whole Diocese where the Department does not pay the salary of the teacher. For a man of his age, experience and standing, Mr. Hardymann receives a very meagre stipend namely, only $700.00 a year and I may add that any collections which may be made at the services which he conducts on Sundays are not taken by him but are used for the improvement of the property. If, then, your Department could find its way to assisting towards raising Mr. Hardymann's stipend or in increasing it, I should be extremely grateful and I think that the fine work which Mr. Hardymann and his wife (who is unpaid) have done for so long deserves some special mark of recognition.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRocksborough R.

F. Hardyman for the benefit of white and Indian children.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will allow a grant of $20 per teaching month from the 1st of January, last. This will be paid direct to the Diocese of Algoma upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns which should be prepared by Mr. Hardyman and should show the attendance of Indian children only. These returns should be forwarded to the Department through the office of Mr. R. J. Lewis, Manitouining, who is the local Indian Agent.

This grant will be paid direct to the Diocese of Algoma upon receipt of quarterly returns prepared by Mr. Hardyman showing the names of children actually in attendance only, and which should be forwarded through your office. His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma has been informed of the grant that will be allowed. You should take this matter up with Mr. Hardyman and instruct him to prepare the usual quarterly returns and send them to you to be certified and forwarded to the Department in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nA short time ago your Department very kindly decided to make us a grant of $500.00 a year towards the salary of our Indian teacher at Whitefish Falls, Ontario. Mr. Hardyman, the teacher, who has done most excellent work, has not been at all well of late, his health being affected, and feels that he must relinquish the work. He has been in receipt of a very small stipend as he undertook the school as a piece of missionary work. I can assure a suitable successor for him but, of course, I shall have to pay him more. I can get one of our clergy to undertake the school, who is properly qualified teacher and has recently married a wife who is also qualified under Ontario rules and who has recently been teaching in one of the schools of the province. But in order to do this, I shall have to pay a larger stipend. I am writing therefore to ask you if you would be prepared to increase your grant to this school, as it will be impossible for the Diocese to pay the larger stipend required unless assisted. I may point out that your Department supports schools where the attendance is even less than ten, and I therefore have every hope that you will favourably regard this application for a school which has twenty-six pupils on the register, 17 of whom are of Indian mothers. Of these, no less than seven are treaty Indians. As Mr. Hardyman is anxious to give up the work as soon as possible I should be very grateful if you would give early consideration to this application. The stipend which I think might offer could be $1200.00 a year which is extremely moderate of course, when one considers that we obtain the help of two qualified teachers and I would venture to suggest that your Department might give us half of this.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+ Rocksbrough R. Algoma\nOttawa, September 18, 1929.\n\nRight Rev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 13th instant, requesting an increased grant towards the salary of a teacher of the combined white and Indian school at Whitefish Falls.\n\nIn this connection I have to say, in view of the number of wards of this Department who attend, the Department will provide the sum of $600 per teaching year towards the salary of a teacher as long as there is a sufficient attendance to warrant continuing the grant towards salary at the above rate. I shall be obliged if Your Lordship will state the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you engage to undertake the teaching activities at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

As a matter of fact, in order to accommodate the children a new room entirely should be built on as well as substantial repairs to the old building.\n\nI am informed that it might be possible for the government of the province of Ontario to assist if the Indian Department would assist and it seems to me a case where there should be cooperation. There is no municipality, there is no organization to levy taxes and as a matter of fact the property available for taxation is extremely limited. It is just one of those small little isolated settlements where there are a number of Indians and half breeds and a few fishermen.\n\nCould you advise me what possibly might be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.B./A.U.\nPlease report attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nNovember 1, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Nicholson:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the combined white and Indian school at Whitefish Falls and suggesting that a new classroom be erected as well as substantial repairs made to the old building.\n\nI feel that the Department is already contributing generously towards this activity.

The mother of these children was formerly a member of Whitesfish River Band. She married a White man who deserted the family some years ago and left the mother to support these children by her own earnings. As the mother is of Indian origin Mrs. Stump enters these children on her quarterly reports as Indians.\n\nThe returns from this school have been submitted to the Department by authority of Letter No. I9-10-I of March 5th, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. Augustine's Mission School,\nAbitibi Falls, Ont.\nSept. 29, 1936.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing you in regard to some Indian children who are not attending school.

Stump concerning Indian children in attendance at the Whitefish River Combined School.\n\nMrs. Stump has a number of pupils on her return who are not wards of the Department. There are only five Indian children in attendance whom the Department is responsible for their education. There are many children at Whitefish Falls with Indian blood, but in each case the child is of illegitimate birth, or the mother married to a white man, outside of the five who belong to a Band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 16, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to your request that this Department assist in the erection of a new two-roomed school at Whitefish Falls. I understand that approximately sixty-one (61) children attend this school, of which number six (6) are Treaty Indian children and seventeen (17) might be designated half-breeds, some of whom reside on the reserve.\n\nThe above-mentioned figures show that there are twenty-three (23) children for whose education this Department might be considered responsible. However, it is practically impossible for us to consider making a contribution to the cost of a building which will not be situated on a reserve. At the present time we allocate $600 towards the salary of the teacher. In the event of your proceeding with the erection of a new two-roomed school and making adequate provision in this building for the six (6) Treaty Indian children and seventeen (17) half-breeds, this Department will favourably consider increasing the annual allowance towards the maintenance of the school from $600 to $1,000.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

The cheques are made payable to Mrs. Stump and sent in care of the Bishop of Algoma.\n\nI cannot find from my records that the second payment of $180.00 was received last year; it should have come in or about the month of April. I should be grateful if you would kindly look into this matter and inform me whether or not the cheque was issued and cashed.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, February 23, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant regarding payments of grant for the Whitefish Falls School, I find that quarterly returns for the quarters ended March 31st, 1936, and June 30th, 1936, were not forwarded to the Department. Consequently, no payment was made for these two quarters. If the school was open during the March and June quarters of 1936, the usual returns should be prepared by the teacher and sent to H. J.

I have communicated with Mrs. Stump, and she has assured me that these reports have now been sent to the Inspector. It is unfortunate that she neglected to send these in at the proper time.\n\nWith reference to this annual grant, I learn from the Rev. C. F. Elves, the member of our Executive Committee who has charge of this matter for us, that the Department has told him that it \"allows $600.00 towards the salary of the teacher.\" I would say, however, that only in one year have we received this sum. The figures are as follows:\n\n| Year   | Amount |\n|--------|--------|\n| 1929 (part year) | $150.00 |\n| 1930   | $290.00 |\n| 1931   | $600.00 |\n| 1932   | $766.00 |\n| 1933   | $484.00 |\n| 1934   | $394.00 |\n| 1935   | $430.00 |\n| 1936 (report missing) | $240.00 |\n\nThe average for the six complete years, 1930-35, is only $476.00.\n\nI should be grateful if you would kindly let me know if the full grant has been supposed to be $600.00 all the time; and if so, has the shortage been caused by lack of reports as in 1936.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, March 13, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, I may say that the allowance of $600 a year towards the salary of the teacher at the Whitefish Falls School dated from the year 1929. Previous to that, only $200 a year was allowed.\n\nEnclosed is a statement showing the actual payments made to this school since the year 1930. During 1932 and 1933, and part of 1934, the grant to this school was subject to the 10% deduction which affected salaries of all Government employees.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that the teacher has forwarded the returns for the March and June quarters, 1936, to Mr. R.

As soon as these are received from him, the grant for those two quarters will be paid.\n\nI regret that present regulations will not permit our considering paying for the September quarter, 1933; the June quarter, 1934; and the June quarter, 1935; for which no returns were received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Mr. Harold R. Bell who is very strongly recommended to me. He possesses Interim Second Class Certificate No. 25697, dated July 14, 1932. He has completed Junior Matriculation, and has Upper School standing in English, Zoology and History, with Queen's University credit also in French, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry and English. He has half the credits required for a degree at Western University. I do not know if this appointment requires your sanction, but if so, I desire to apply for it. I am convinced, from several sources, that he is a very satisfactory type of man. Believe me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n+Rockesbrough R.

I understand that the new building has been completed and, consequently, we will allow the increased amount from September 1, 1937.

There was a large gathering of neighbouring clergy and parents of the children, while Mr. T. H. Wrightman represented the Education Department. It was a great disappointment to us that you were not able to be present, as we owe so much to your kind interest and support. \"Failing yourself,\" we would have liked to have had some representative of the Indian Department in order that the Department might be informed of the character of the school.\n\nI must say that I was extremely pleased with its appearance, both inside and out. There are two classrooms of good size, with a very useful basement, and a roomy attic, which could easily be turned into one or two apartments for teachers if we had sufficient money.\n\nWe are not able at present to put in a septic tank, which will cost about $600 I am told; but we hope to be able to do this later on.\n\nI find that the parents very much appreciate the great help which has been rendered from the Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal of the Shingwauk, who has supervised the work.\n\nI very much hope that a representative of the Department will see the school before long, and will be pleased with it.\n\nAll best wishes,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n+ Rocksbrough R.

Marie, Ontario\n\n11th May, 1938.\n\nThe Superintendent of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my return to the Sault I have found your letter of April 26th regarding the Whitefish Falls combined school and have made some enquiries. Our missionary in charge and his wife, Mrs. Stump, are of the opinion that the attendance in the fall at this school will probably be increased by at least ten Indian children. During the past year they report that the attendance has been bad for several reasons.\n\nThe reasons which they refer to are as follows:\n\n1. There has been a great lack of work and this has caused the parents to move about from place to place taking their children with them.\n2. Several of the children have reached the age of thirteen or fourteen and have stayed away from school because they feel too old. There is no truant officer and I am told that the Indian agent never visits the school.\n3. Many children have been kept at home owing to lack of clothing.\n4. In a year's time it is expected that a number of small children at home will be of school age.\n\nI gather that under normal conditions the school attendance should within another year be considerably improved.\n\nI do sincerely hope that the Department is not going to let us down after having encouraged us to spend a very large amount of money on building a really good school where the white and Indian children can be taught together. It was definitely stated at the time that the Department would increase its grant in order that there might be a surplus each year in order to help pay for the school in time. Surely the Department is not going to let us down after less than a year. I notice that in your letter of August 30th last you definitely say that, \"In the event of the Anglican Church authorities...\"\nerecting a two-room school making adequate provision in this building for both the Treaty Indian children and the half-breeds, the Department will increase its allowance of $600 to $1000 a year.\n\nMay I venture to add that I hope you will not pay too much attention to what the Indian Agent says on this matter because I had occasion a few months ago to report him to the Department in connection with slackness in another Indian mission on Manitoulin Island, and it is probable that he does not feel well disposed towards us on that account, although a reference to my letter will show that I delayed taking action until I could no longer avoid it.\n\nI will make further enquiries with a view to sending you the names and ages of all the Indian and half-breed children in the mission and will communicate with you again when I receive a reply.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rockenbrough R.

The March quarter return showed an enrolment of 11 and an average of 8. In forwarding the return the Indian Agent stated that there were actually only 4 children in attendance for whose education this Department is responsible.\n\nIf you refer to my letter of January 16, 1937 you will note that when it was promised to increase the amount allowed to the teacher from $600.00 to $1000.00 it was on the understanding that there were 23 children for whose education this Department might be considered responsible. Unless the attendance shows a decided increase we will be unable to justify payment of such a large grant to this school.\n\nIn view of the comparatively small attendance and the further statement of the Agent regarding the number for whom this Department is actually responsible I would appreciate receiving your comments regarding the possibility of a larger number of Indian children attending this school in the future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. Rockesborough R. Smith, M.A., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishopure,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 12, 1930.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI may state that I was somewhat disturbed when I learned from the agent's report that there were comparatively few Indian pupils in attendance at the Whitefish Falls School.\n\nFor a number of years the Dominion Government followed a somewhat liberal policy with respect to the education of half-breed children. In view of the fact, however, that the Indian pupil population of Canada is now increasing at the rate of approximately 300 per annum, the Government has been compelled to review the claims of half-breed children. A letter, approved by the Minister, and dated Ottawa, December 10, 1937, was sent out to inspectors, Indian agents and principals of Indian schools. I am enclosing herewith a copy of this letter for Your Lordship's information. It is scarcely necessary to state that there are still in the Dominion a number of districts in which provision has not yet been made for the education of Indian children.\n\nIt is just possible that a misunderstanding exists with respect to the construction of the school at Whitefish Falls. I was not aware at any time that the Department encouraged the church authorities to proceed with the erection of a school at that point. We did, however, very definitely promise an increased grant if such a school were constructed, on the understanding that approximately 23 children for whom education the Department was responsible would be enrolled at the institution.\n\nHalfbreed children are, of course, definitely the responsibility of the provincial government. This applies also to enfranchised Indians. Unless there is a steady increase in the number of Indian pupils at the Whitefish Falls School, it is altogether likely that our right to pay the present grant will be challenged by the auditors. I feel confident that a little cooperation between the teachers and the Missionary in charge and the Indian agent for the district would result in a substantial increase in the attendance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Marie, Ontario.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 6, 1938,\n\nDear Mr. Greer:\n\nFor some time past a number of Indian children have been attending a white school situated near Whitefish Falls, Ontario. This school is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, Bishop of Sault Ste. Marie, and I understand that a new building was erected there last summer.\n\nAs this school is situated in an unorganized district I presume that the Department of Education makes a special grant to it, and, if possible, I would appreciate your advising the amount of the grant which you allow.\n\nFor your information I might add that we are allowing a grant of $1000.00 a year toward the salary of the teacher but I am not certain that we will be able to continue to pay this amount in view of the fact that the reports usually received it would appear that there are only very few Indian children attending this school. The great majority seem to be white children and half-breeds for whom we have no responsibility.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Ishlan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR. H. Greer, Esq.,\nChief Inspector, Public & Separate Schools,\nDepartment of Education,\nToronto, July 22nd, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th ultimo, and regret of the delay in answering it. The Anglican Mission School at Whitefish Falls, Ontario, is a private school, and, therefore, it does not share in the regular schedule of grants apportioned to the public and separate schools of this Province. However, the Department of Education feels, from the information contained in the half-yearly reports of the local school inspector for that area, that satisfactory work is being done in this Mission School, that qualified teachers are being employed, and that the regular course of studies for the schools in this Province is being followed. As an encouragement, therefore, to the work which is being done, this Department approved of a grant on June 26th, 1937, of $800.00, for each of the years 1937, 1938, and 1939, these amounts to be used partly for building purposes and partly for the maintenance of the School.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Inspector.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n19-10-1\n\nL.M.D.\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 27, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Creer:\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the grants that are being allowed the Anglican Mission School at Whitefish Falls, Ontario.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nV.

Lewis, with regard to the Whitefish River Combined School.\n\nYou will note in that letter that Mr. Lewis was of the opinion that there were only 4 children attending the school for whose education this Department was responsible. The other children in attendance were either white or half-breeds. I also enclose a copy of our ruling concerning half-breeds and copies of letters dated April 26, 1938, and May 12, 1938, forwarded to Rt. Rev. Rockborough R. Smith, Bishop of Algoma. The Bishop replied to both of these letters and at that time it was decided to continue the grant which we were allowing; namely, $1000.00 a year.\n\nDue to the economic conditions now confronting us it is necessary to curtail expenditure as much as possible. I should therefore appreciate it if you would visit the Whitefish Falls Combined Indian Day School at the earliest possible date and ascertain how many recognized Indian children are in regular attendance at this school. Their names and the bands to which they belong should be stated.\n\nAs a matter of information you might also let us know the number of half-breeds and white children who attend the school. At the present time I am inclined to feel that we should reduce our grant at the end of June, 1940, but a final decision in this regard will not be made until your report is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Half-breeds & Training.\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter No.13-10-1 dated January 22nd, I wish to report there is only one legitimate Indian child attending the Whitefish River Combined School, at the present time.\n\nThere are fifty-one white and half-breed children enrolled, fourteen of whom are half breeds, that is, Indian mothers, four of whom are illegitimate children whose mothers have later married white men.\n\nThere are seven protestant Indian children on the Whitefish River Reserve, who are not attending any school at the present time, being anywhere from three to seven miles distant from the Whitefish River Combined School.\n\nI wonder if it is possible to have some means of transportation provided so that these children could attend.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ / JH\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nOttawa, February 26, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nYou may probably remember an interview you had with me when I first entered the Department a little over three years ago. We discussed at that time the desirability of establishing a school for the education of a number of Indian children who were without educational facilities and who resided at Whitefish Falls, Ontario. The Department agreed at that time that if the Indian population justified it we would be prepared to contribute $1,000 toward the salary of a teacher at that school.\n\nHowever, we find ourselves unable at this time to justify such a grant, or indeed any grant, in view of the reports that have come in to us from the Indian agent. In a letter dated February 29, 1940, the Indian agent writes:\n\n\"I wish to report that there is only one legitimate Indian child attending the Whitefish River Combined School at the present time.\n\n\"There are however 51 white and half-breed children enrolled, 14 of whom are half-breeds, 4 of whom are illegitimate children whose mothers have later married white men and lost their Indian status. There are 7 Protestant Indian children on the Whitefish River reserve who are not attending any school at the present time, being anywhere from 3 to 7 miles distant from the Whitefish River school.\"\n\nAn attempt will be made to pay the grant promised in full for the academic year 1939-40, but no grant can be made immediately following that date. I am writing a confidential letter to you at this time, remembering the interest you took in the establishment of this school. I personally find it exceedingly difficult to understand why the education of these white and half-breed children has not been assumed by the provincial authorities. I feel confident that if the plight of these children was brought to the attention of the Ontario Minister of Education he would immediately make provision for their education.\n\nIn any event, you can readily appreciate that it is impossible to take funds voted by Parliament for the education of Indian children and use such funds for the education of either white or half-breed children. I am enclosing herewith copy of a letter relating to the education of half-breed children, sent out by the Department in December, 1937.\n\nYou might acknowledge receipt of this letter and let me have any comments you may care to offer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Hives, to call at your office to lay before you a matter concerning our School at Whitefish Falls, Ontario, and this letter is to ask you to be good enough to receive him and to give the matter as much consideration as you can, as we think it is of importance from all points of view.\n\nMr. Hives is authorized to act in our behalf if any immediate action may be necessary.\n\nThank you for your co-operation in this matter.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nPercy A. Paris\nAdministrator, Diocese of Algoma.\nAfter my interview with Mr Jackson, which I feel was very satisfactory, for he informed me the whole matter would be reconsidered, and in view of facts regarding our forty years work in White Fish Falls, and also the fact that we are looking after the education of the Indian children of that place, even though the attendance of legitimate Indian children is at present so low, etc., it is bound to rise, and in fact, there are prospects of an increase in the near future. In view of this, Mr Jackson said he would go into the matter with you again, and gave me some hope of a grant, perhaps half of what you have been giving, for the education of Indian children at our school at Whitefish Falls.\n\nAfter leaving him, I decided to go to Toronto, and interview the Department of Education there. I made an appointment with Mr McArthur who received me very kindly, and listened very sympathetically. The Deputy Minister of Education said he could not give me anything official, but informed me of his willingness to recommend an increase of $500.00 to the grant his department have given. He asked me to inform you of this with the hope that your department would continue your interest and support in connection with the Whitefish Falls School. The people at that place are quite unable to support the school, as they are made up of Tourist guides, who get work just during the tourist season, and are mostly on relief during the Winter.\n\nIf this arrangement can be made, the situation will be on a very good and fairly permanent basis, and we can continue to operate for the good of children of school age of that district, and the welfare of the community.\n\nI would like again to express my appreciation of your kindness, consideration and courtesy, which you have, at all times accorded me and our cause.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr R.

In view of the National crisis now confronting us it has been impossible to secure the funds that would be required to continue the payments at this school in view of the information before us that only one recognized Indian child is attending the school.\n\nWe will continue the present rate of payment until June 30 at which time it will be discontinued.\n\nDuring the academic year 1940-41 if there are any recognized Indian children attending this school payment will be made for their tuition on the basis of the per capita cost of operation, without taking into consideration any capital expenditure.\n\nI am directing this letter to you in view of the interest that you have taken in this school and I feel certain that you will discuss the matter with His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nJanuary 27th, 1941\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing on behalf of the Bishop of Algoma in regard to the school at Whitefish Falls.\n\nYou will recall that a grant of \u00a31,000.00 a year was given to this school some time ago, in consideration of the fact that a large part of its pupilage was Indian. This grant, supplemented by one from the Ontario Department of Education, was to assist in the payment of the two teachers and in the reduction of the debt on the school. The grant was withdrawn last summer, much to our disappointment and the financial embarrassment of the school.\n\nThe reason for the withdrawal of the grant was a report from the Indian Agent that only one legitimate Indian child was attending the school at that time. I have just received a copy of the report for the last quarter of 1940, a report which has been submitted to the Indian Agent, and will no doubt soon reach your Department. From this I learn that three out of the twenty Indian pupils attending the school during last year, were the children of Treaty Indians, namely:\n\nBeatrice Naverabow\nElaine Aquimau\nJune Aquimau.\n\nI am advised by the Principal of the school that another has been enrolled this month for 1941.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nJanuary 27, 1941\n\nIn these circumstances, the Bishop desires me to ask that a per capita grant be made for these three children for the latter half of 1940, and that this arrangement be carried on in future.\n\nAs you are aware, the Church of England began this work in a small way many years ago when there were only a few Indian and a few White children at Whitefish Falls. The work has grown steadily and with increased efficiency but it has been carried on at great expense to the Church. We trust, therefore, that some assistance may be granted to us on account of the Treaty Indian children attending, and in any other way that may be possible.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nManitowaning, Ontario,\nFebruary 5, 1941\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated February 1st File No.19-10-1, regarding Indian children attending Whitefish River Combined School.\n\nThese Indians of course are living on the Indian Holdings in the surrendered portion of Whitefish River Reserve. Any who are members of Whitefish River Band are out of reach of the Indian Day School at Birch Island, which is six miles distant.\n\nI have tried several times to induce the members of Sucker Creek Band, to locate on their own Reserve, but these few families have lived at Whitefish Falls for at least two generations and seem determined to stay there.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nCRJ / JH\nCopy sent to Mr. Johnston\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1941.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the school at Whitefish Falls.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to the whole situation at the above-mentioned point and it is rather difficult for the Department to decide exactly what our course of action should be due to the fact that the families of the recognized Indian children who are attending this school are members of reserves where Indian day schools are located. If these families resided on their home reserves there would be no question of extra expenditure for the education of these children.\n\nAfter reviewing all sides of the case it has been decided to allow an amount of $20.00 a teaching month toward the salary of the teacher at this school on the understanding that this amount will be accepted as payment for the tuition of the recognized Indian children attending the Whitefish Falls School.\n\nDid this school re-open on September 1, 1940, or October 1, 1940? As soon as you let me have this information a cheque at the rate of $20.00 a month will be issued in favour of Mrs. Stump.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Canon F. A. Collator, D.D., D.D.,\nSecretary-Treasurer,\nDiocese of Algoma,\nSynod Office,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hesey,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n29th July, 1942\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFor some years we received a grant of $1000.00 from the Dominion Government through the Department of Indian Affairs for the Church School at Whitefish Falls. This was based on the fact that a number of children of Treaty Indians were attending the school. Two or three of these have been cut off, because the number of children of Treaty Indians attending the school had been reduced to two or three. We appealed this decision and a grant of $200.00 was made for the academic year of 1940-1, and this has been continued in 1941-2.\n\nDuring the past year a change has taken place, and again we have a considerable number of Indian pupils attending Whitefish Falls school. The list of children whose parents are Treaty Indians is appended, and we are assured by Miss Murray, Principal of the school, that these pupils will be in attendance again during the next academic year. On the basis of this fact we beg to apply for a substantial increase in the grant, to help pay the teachers and to operate the school. I shall appreciate it very highly if you will give favourable consideration to this request.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Frederick Algoma\nBishop.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with the Whitefish River Combined School, you advised the Department in your letter of January 26, 1941, that there were only 5 children for whom this Branch was responsible. We accordingly reduced our grant to this school to the amount of $20.00 a month.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Rt. Rev. G.F. Kingston, Bishop of Algoma, in which he encloses the attached list of children who he states, are bona fide Indians and are now attending the Whitefish River Combined School. I would request that you would check this list very carefully and advise me if all those named are attending regularly and if they are all recognized as Indians. When replying the attached list should be returned for our file.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nOttawa,\nJuly 31, 1942.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th instant, with reference to the Whitefish River Combined School.

Julian is the illegitimate son of Annie Keshikgobness \"deceased\" formerly paid under number 46 Whitefish River Band, but was never entered on the Band Membership.\n\nLionel is said to be an illegitimate child of Susan Keshikgobness No. 49 Whitefish River Band, but was never taken on the band membership, as it was the practice at that time to exclude illegitimate children.\n\nSusan later married a white man, and as near as I can determine, James is a child of this marriage, although Susan is now deserted by her husband.\n\nSeveral of these children did not attend regular last winter and spring for various reasons as you would see by the school report. Some were just beginners, and live a long distance from school, and others had whooping cough, while some of it is just negligence on the part of the parents.\n\nFive of these at least will not be attending Whitefish Falls School this year. Harry Cegwetch was killed in a car accident, and numbers 5, 6, 10 and 14 were admitted to Shingwauk Residential School. I understand Adelore Cegwetch was also going to Shingwauk School, but as he belongs to Smalt Ste Marie Agency, I cannot advise you definitely.\n\nThe opening of quite a large industry at Whitefish Falls is to a large extent responsible for the increase last year.\n\nThe list of names is re-enclosed herewith.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nORJ / JH\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1942.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of July 29 and official reply of July 31 in connection with the Whitefish River Combined School. The list of pupils which you forwarded with your letter was sent to the Indian Agent and I have just received his reply. Your list included the names of 25 children but the Agent states that several of these have recently been placed in the Shingwauk Home and, as a result, there will be only 9 or 10 Treaty Indian children attending the Whitefish River Combined School this year. Our usual rate for white children for tuition of Indian children is at the rate of $20.00 per child per year. As we are allowing $20.00 to the Whitefish River School it appears that the amount provided is the same as allowed other white schools. Under these circumstances I cannot see my way clear to recommending an increase in the payment at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.F. Kingston, Ph.D., D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, October 10, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you state that Mrs. H. J. Stump gave up duties as teacher of the Whitefish River Combined School on June 30. We had not been previously informed regarding her resignation.\n\nIt is noted that Miss Jean Johnson is now in charge of this school, and we will continue to pay her the same amount as in the past, namely, $200.00 a year, plus bonus.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFor Deputy Minister.\n\nRev.

We had not previously been informed of her resignation; consequently Cheque No. L 092000 for $83.40, which was forwarded to her for the month of September, has been returned to your office and should be deposited.\n\nTo succeed Mrs. Stump the Department is approving the appointment of Miss Jean Johnson, effective from September 1, 1945, at a salary of $200.00 a year, plus bonus.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, October 12, 1945.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have just been advised by Canon F.W.

She was advised that the records in this office did show that there had not been any returns received for the above periods, and therefore the grants would not be paid to the Diocese, but if she would prepare returns for the above quarters and forward to this office they would be submitted to the Department for consideration of the grants long past due being paid to the Diocese, but that it might not be possible for the Department to make payments as payments of grants so long standing is against the regulations.\n\nSince Mrs. Stump has taken charge of the Whitefish Falls Mission School as teacher, she has been mailed a supply of forms in due time at the end of every quarter to enable her to prepare the usual return concerning Indian children in attendance, and on almost every occasion she has been negligent in returning these reports, and now since she has found that the Diocese of Algoma has lost heavily through laxity on her part she is very much worked up over the matter and has asked me to make special request to the Department to have these grants paid to the Diocese.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPROVINCE OF ONTARIO\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED March 31st, 1937.\n\nNAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT IN SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT\n---|---|---|---|---\nMrs. Helen J.

I state that in my opinion and that of some others of the Band, it is an unnecessary expense. The seats now in use are made of wood and strong and in every way suitable for the school. Consider that there are other articles which we stand in more need than these seats. Farming implements for instance. The Chief did not consult me in this matter nor any of the councillors. I therefore beg strongly to object to such unnecessary wasting of our funds.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJas. Robitaille,\nsecond Chief.\nI have the honor to report that Chief Waheminiak of the White Fish Lake Band has applied for 20 new seats and desks and one Teachers Desk for the School House at White Fish Lake. The desks asked for are such as are supplied by Messrs A McMillan and Son of Chatsworth Ont., and cost $3.50 for seat and desk and $7.00 for teachers desks. The number is more than is required for strictly school purposes, but as the school house is used for church purposes and also as a council room the quantity applied for is not too great.\n\nI enclose a communication from the second chief who objects to the expenditure being incurred.\n\nI respectfully recommend that the Indians should be instructed to hold a council and decide the matter of the seats and desks by a vote.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 30, 1893\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask the favor of you letter of the Assistant Superintendent that Chief Matochimick of the White Bear Band has applied for 70 new teak boards to be delivered here for the school house at White Bear Lake and succeeding copy of a communication from the Board Chief who objected to the building being incurred; and respectfully request that you will state whether the school house is properly commodious and furnished with other necessary conveniences.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Office Manitowaning November 3rd 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of official letter dated 30th October relative to the application of Chief Wahominike of the White Fish Lake Band for 20 new seats and desks, and beg respectfully to state that the present seats are of an uncomfortable pattern for the children, and they have to write at a table which is not nearly as convenient as the seats and desks combined as applied for by the Chief. I do not consider that the school house is properly and commodiously furnished for school purposes\u2014the number applied for by the Chief is more than is required for strictly school purposes, the number of children attending school being 18.

They are very intelligent and the chief has proposed that they should have a school house and a teacher. The two places are very near together and the people are few. Consequently, they choose they might all live at Kettle Island. But the fact remains that 6 families have gone to Kettle Point, and are living there; and since so children belong to that little settlement, it seems, from all accounts, that school. As it is they are having no school facilities.\n\nI would bring the case before the Department and ask what view they take of this case. Will they dispense to build a school for these people and give them necessary work? And will they arrange for the teacher at Kettle Island dividing his time in some way if he is willing between the two schools?\n\nI again request you to urge that the teacher at Kettle Island, Mr. S. Harris, whose work is trying in those present circumstances, should receive $200 per annum instead of $300.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge [Signature]\n\n[Seal: Dept. Ind. Affairs]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 12th December, 1898.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship\nthe Bishop of Algoma for the opening of a school for a\nportion of the Indians of the Whitefish River Band who\nare settled at a point about ten miles from Birch Island\non the Whitefish River, near the mouth of the Georgian Bay,\nI have the honour to state that there is already a school at Birch\nIsland under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nAccording to the report for the September quarter received\nfrom Mr. S.H. Perrin, there are 11 children\nin the roll, with an average attendance of 4. The\nsalary, which is voted, is $200.\n\nIn his annual report Superintendent Ross does not\nmention the portion of the Band settled at the point in\nquestion. Speaking of the Band generally he says:\n\"The Indians have a good school and the general profi-\nciency of the pupils is satisfactory.\"\n\nIf the school at Birch Island, which has been es-\ntablished for some years at a point suitable for the\nmajority of the Whitefish Band has an attendance of only\n4, it is hardly likely that a new school for the conve-\nnience of only a portion of the Band would have a suffi-\ncient attendance to warrant its being established.\nOttawa, 24th December, 1896.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 25th ultimo, in regard to the establishment of a second school for the conversion of six families of the Wabash River Band who have settled on the Mississauga River four miles from the school at Couch Island.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the school already established at a point suitable for the majority of the band, although in operation for some years, has only 11 pupils or so well, with an average attendance of about 7, not convinced likely that a second school would be sufficient to justify its establishment.\n\nI regret, therefore, that the suggestion does not see its way to increasing the number of schools for the Wabash Band at present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

The Bishop wishes a reply at an early date, so that action may be taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo stating that the Indians of the Whitefish River Reserve are anxious to have a school opened there.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a building there at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Department contributed the sum of $300, which was provided from our vote towards the erection of the building. The Indians performed the labour, and they were paid subsistence money at the rate of 50 cents per day while at work on the building. This building was to be used for both church and school purposes, under the auspices of the Anglican Church.\n\nWe are making enquiry regarding the order given the Indians to discontinue the holding of council meetings in this building.\n\nAs soon as this information is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChief Wm. McGregor,\nMcGregor Bay P.O.,\nOnt.\nOTTAWA, April 7th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nA communication has been received from Chief Wm. McGregor, of the Whitefish River Reserve, in which he states as follows:\n\n\"Lately a man came and ordered the schoolhouse to be closed and prevented the members of the band from holding our council meetings and informed us that the old schoolhouse was sufficient to hold our council meetings.\"\n\nThe building referred to is situated at McGregor Bay village, and was formerly used for school purposes. This building was erected during the summer of 1900. The Department contributed the sum of $300 towards the cost from the school vote, and it was understood that it was to be used for both church and school purposes.\n\nI will be pleased if you will make enquiry regarding the complaint of the Chief and ascertain upon whose authority the Indians were refused to hold council meetings, as it does not appear to the Department that there should be any objection to their using the building for this purpose.\n\nAs full particulars as you can supply will be appreciated at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

Mr. Scott, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. The Department provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No monies have been contributed since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band.

Marie, Ontario,\n26th April 1923.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nEver since I became Bishop of the Diocese of Algoma, twenty-six years ago, we have had the use of a small building at Birch Island, part of the Whitefish Indian Reserve. The Indians at that point are divided between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Communion. There is a disposition at the present time to claim the building for use by the band as a council chamber. This is not at all satisfactory to us, as it interferes with our use of it for religious purposes. Will you kindly tell me the history of this building, and what rights the Church of England has in it. One of the oldest residents declares that the materials were provided by the Church, and that it is to the best of his knowledge and belief a church building. Of course, if it is a Government building the Department has a right to determine what its uses shall be; nevertheless, after so long a period of use, some clear and generous rights should belong to the Church of England, her use of it having been unbroken through the period referred to. Will you kindly let me have an answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma.\nThis building was put up in 1879 for a combined church school under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Scott. The Department provided the funds for the materials and the Indians furnished the labour.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nCANADA\n\nMay 1st, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWith reference to the communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma regarding the combined school house and church building at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Indian Reserve, I beg to say that this building was erected in 1899, under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. This Department provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band. We approved of an expenditure to the extent of $45.42, the same being paid from band funds.\n\nThe Department owns this building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. L. Hutchison\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Thorne,\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the building at Birch Island.\n\nI have looked up our records and I find that this building was erected at the expense of the Department, the Indians supplying the labour. Last October, on a resolution of the band, the building was re-shingled at the expense of band funds. It would appear, therefore, that the Church has no proprietary interest in the building.\n\nNo school has been conducted since June, 1907 and it seems to me that the building should serve as it has for some time past, both the Church for purposes of service and the Indians for Council meetings.\n\nI shall communicate with the Indian Agent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Reverend G. Thorne, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Lewis,\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has written me in reference to the building on Birch Island which for some years past has been used by the band as a Council chamber and for the purpose of holding church services.\n\nIt seems that the band is claiming all the interest in the building and want to use it for council purposes only.\n\nThis building was erected by the Department. All the Indians contributed the labour until last fall when it was re-shingled at their expense.\n\nIn view of this fact there would appear to be no reason why the arrangement which has obtained for some time should not be continued, that is that the building should be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of Council.\n\nKindly let me have a report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 4th instant, giving information as to the building at Birch Island. I am communicating its contents to our clergyman in charge of that region.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter of the 4th instant, in regard to the report made to the Department by His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma in reference to the building at Birch Island which for some years past was used as a combined church and school, and in reply I have the honour to report to the Department that His Grace must have been mis-informed in this matter as the Indians do not wish to rob the building of its semi-sacred character, they only ask the privilege of holding their meetings of the council in the building as they have not any other place to meet in council. After each council meeting the building has been cleaned and everything left in perfect order.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that it is not the Indians that want to use the building for council meetings only, but it is the Missionaries that are trying to prevent the Indians from holding any council meetings in this building and wish to use it for church purposes only, and the teacher in charge of the school at Whitefish River, who is acting as Anglican Missionary among the Indians, has gone so far as to lock the building in order to prevent the Indians from making use of it for council meetings.\n\nAs far as I can see there should not be reason why the building should not be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of council, and the Indians are perfectly willing to abide by that decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 29th, 192.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the dispute regarding the building at Birch Island. In view of your explanations the building should continue to be used as for sometime in the past both for council meetings and for church services. Will you please advise both the missionary and the Indians to this effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent (for 1)\n\nJ.

B. Phipps, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nQuanitowaning.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed today that Chief Saginaw has sent in a request for seats etc., for the White Fish Lake School. I beg to state that in my opinion and that of some others of the Band, it is an unnecessary expense. The seats now in use are made of wood and string and in every way suitable for the school. I consider that there are other articles which we stand in more need than these seats. Farming implements for instance. The Chief did not consult me in this matter nor any of the councillors. I therefore strongly object to such unnecessary outlay of our funds.\n\nYours the humble servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. C. Cobytte,\nSecond Chief.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that Chief Waheminike of the White Fish Lake Band has applied for 20 new seats and desks and one Teachers Desk for the School House at White Fish Lake. The desks asked for are such as are supplied by Messrs A McGill and Son of Chatsworth Ont., and cost $3.50 for seat and desk and $7.00 for teachers desks. The number is more than is required for strictly school purposes, but as the school house is used for church purposes and also as a council room the quantity applied for is not too great.\n\nI enclose a communication from the second chief who objects to the expenditure being incurred.\n\nI respectfully recommend that the Indians should be instructed to hold a council and decide the matter of the seats and desks by a vote.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOctober 30, 1892\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask the favor of you letter of the 7th instant whether that Chief Mabeenamko of the White Bear Lake Band has applied to be Re-located to the School House at that said Lake and having copy of a communication from Council Chief who objected to the Band being removed; we respectfully request that you will state whether the other Chiefs in proper accommodations furnished or whether there may be room to change his residence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of official letter dated 30th October relative to the application of Chief Waheminike of the White Fish Lake Band for 20 new Seats and Desks, and beg respectfully to state that the present seats are in an uncomfortable pattern for the Children, and they have to write at a Table which is not nearly as convenient as the seats and desks combined as applied for by the Chief.

I found that there are still some Indians living near the Red River Settlements, and I talked to them about the possibility of building a school for their children. They were very interested in the idea, and they asked me to come back and see them again.\n\nI am enclosing this letter to you, Sir, so that you may be aware of the situation. I believe that it is important to provide education for these children, and I urge you to consider the possibility of building a school for them.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge [Last Name]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa 12th December, 1898.\n\nTHE SECRETARY,\n\nWith reference to the application of His Lordship\nthe Bishop of Algonquin for the opening of a school for a\nportion of the Indians of the Whitefish River Band who\nlive about ten miles from Birch Island\non the Whitefish River near some of the Georgian Bay,\nI have to say that there is no present a school at Birch\nIsland under the auspices of the Church of England.\n\nAccording to the report for the September quarter received\nfrom Mr. J.H. Watts, there are 11 children\nin the roll, with an average attendance of 4. The\nsalary, which is voted, is $200.\n\nIn his annual report Superintendent Ross does not\nmention the portion of the Band settled at the point in\nquestion. Speaking of the Band generally he says:\n\"The Indians have a good school and the general profi-\nciency of the pupils is satisfactory\".\n\nIf the school at Birch Island, which has been es-\ntablished for some years at a point suitable for the\nmajority of the Whitefish Band has an attendance of only\n4, it is hardly likely that a new school for the conven-\nience of only a portion of the Band would have a suffi-\ncient attendance to warrant its being established.\n\nH.C. Ross\nOttawa, 14th December, 1896.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 25th ultimo, in regard to the establishment of a second school for the same number of six families of the Matapedia River Band who have settled on the Matapedia River four miles from the school at Birch Island.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the school already established at a point suitable for a capacity of the Band, although in operation for some years, has only 11 pupils on the rolls, with an average attendance of 4. It is not anticipated likely that a second school would be attended sufficient to justify its establishment.\n\nI regret, therefore, that the Department does not see its way to increasing the number of schools for the Matapedia Band at present.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.M.

The Department contributed the sum of $300, which was provided from our vote towards the erection of the building. The Indians performed the labour, and they were paid subsistence money at the rate of 50 cents per day while at work on the building. This building was to be used for both church and school purposes, under the auspices of the Anglican Church.\n\nWe are making enquiry regarding the order given the Indians to discontinue the holding of council meetings in this building.\n\nAs soon as this information is received, you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

This building was erected during the summer of 1900. The Department contributed the sum of $300 towards the cost from the school vote, and it was understood that it was to be used for both church and school purposes.\n\nI will be pleased if you will make enquiry regarding the complaint of the Chief and ascertain upon whose authority the Indians were refused to hold council meetings, as it does not appear to the Department that there should be any objection to their using the building for this purpose.\n\nAs full particulars as you can supply will be appreciated at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

This band has since provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for council purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to grant payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band.

Marie, Ontario,\n26th April 1923.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nEver since I became Bishop of the Diocese of Algoma, twenty-six years ago, we have had the use of a small building at Birch Island, part of the Whitefish Indian Reserve. The Indians at that point are divided between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Communion. There is a disposition at the present time to claim the building for use by the band as a council chamber. This is not at all satisfactory to us, as it interferes with our use of it for religious purposes. Will you kindly tell me the history of this building, and what rights the Church of England has in it. One of the oldest residents declares that the materials were provided by the Church, and that it is to the best of his knowledge and belief a church building. Of course, if it is a Government building the Department has a right to determine what its uses shall be; nevertheless, after so long a period of use, some clear and generous rights should belong to the Church of England, her use of it having been unbroken through the period referred to. Will you kindly let me have an answer at your earliest convenience.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma.\nThis building was put up in 1877 for a combined school and church under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Scott. The Department provided the funds for the materials and the Indians furnished the labour.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMay 1st, 1923.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. MacKenzie,\n\nWith reference to the communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma regarding the combined school house and church building at Birch Island on the Whitefish River Indian Reserve I beg to say that this building was erected in 1865 under the supervision of the Rev. Mr. Frost, the Anglican minister on the reserve at that time. The Department provided the funds for the material used, viz: $300, from our appropriation for Indian education, and the Indians furnished the labour gratis. No school has been conducted since June 30, 1907; the building since that time has been used for church purposes and by the members of the band as a council chamber.\n\nLast October a resolution of the band was received requesting the Department to give payment for sufficient shingles to re-shingle the roof from the funds of the band. We approved of an expenditure to the extent of $48.42, the same being paid from band funds.\n\nThe Department owns this building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. T. Hetherington\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Thornlee,\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 26th ultimo in reference to the building at Birch Island.\n\nI have looked up our records and I find that this building was erected at the expense of the Department, the Indians supplying the labour. Last October, on a resolution of the band, the building was re-shingled at the expense of band funds. It would appear, therefore, that the Church has no proprietary interest in the building.\n\nNo school has been conducted since June, 1907 and it seems to me that the building should serve as it has for some time past, both the Church for purposes of service and the Indians' for Council meetings.\n\nI shall communicate with the Indian Agent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Reverend G. Thornlee, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nMay 4, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Lewis,\n\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Algoma has written me in reference to the building on Birch Island which for some years past has been used by the band as a Council chamber and for the purpose of holding church services.\n\nIt seems that the band is claiming all the interest in the building and want to use it for council purposes only.\n\nThis building was erected by the Department. All the Indians contributed the labour until last fall when it was re-shingled at their expense.\n\nIn view of this fact there would appear to be no reason why the arrangement which has obtained for some time should not be continued, that is that the building should be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of Council.\n\nKindly let me have a report.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. J. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 4th instant, giving information as to the building at Birch Island. I am communicating its contents to our clergyman in charge of that region.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of Official Letter of the 4th instant, in regard to the report made to the Department by His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma in reference to the building at Birch Island which for some years past was used as a combined church and school, and in reply I have the honour to report to the Department that His Grace must have been mis-informed in this matter as the Indians do not wish to rob the building of its semi-sacred character; they only ask the privilege of holding their meetings or the council in the building as they have not any other place to meet in council. After each council meeting the building has been cleaned and everything left in perfect order.\n\nI might say for the information of the Department that it is not the Indians that want to use the building for council meetings only, but it is the Missionaries that are trying to prevent the Indians from holding any council meetings in this building and wish to use it for church purposes only, and the teacher in charge of the school at Whitefish River, who is acting as Anglican Missionary among the Indians, has gone so far as to lock the building in order to prevent the Indians from making use of it for council meetings.\n\nAs far as I can see there should not be reason why the building should not be available for the use of the Missionary for church services and the Indians for meetings of council, and the Indians are perfectly willing to abide by that decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 29th, 1927.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the dispute regarding the building at Birch Island. In view of your explanations the building should continue to be used as for sometime in the past both for council meetings and for church services. Will you please advise both the missionary and the Indians to this effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. J.
