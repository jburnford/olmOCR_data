The number of patients and thirty new cases were reported in the hospitals today. In ten minutes there have been nine admissions for burial. Rumors are prevailing among the ignorant classes that many have been buried alive without examination. At Marqued there were sixteen deaths and twenty new cases were taken to the hospital. Notwithstanding the efforts of the doctors there was a lack of food.\n\nA Telegram from London states that an English diplomat visited the province and expressed great satisfaction there was such a lack of food.\n\nThe consumption is spreading all along the Frontiers and cannot be stopped. There are three dead people reported at Hay, where the disease has made its appearance where throughout the country preparations are being made to meet the situation.\n\nDr. Keith said that the prospect of a spread of the disease over all provinces was not very certain; but also the fear that the disease might be carried from one province to another and reach the whole province, being met with.\n\nThe opinion is that the disease will be carried from one province to another and reach the whole province, being met with.\n\nThere may be cases of carriers but there are several who are carrying the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, it was stated that the situation was not very certain; but also the fear that the disease might be carried from one province to another and reach the whole province, being met with.\n\nMr. W.B., Enfield (Nottingham), reports that the disease is spreading throughout the provinces and the government has been unable to do anything to prevent it.\n\n(Top of page)\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nAND\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW\n\nSPINK & MAVEETY\nJ.

A short time ago it was Annam that had submitted itself to France, and now the king of the large and populous province of Cambodja, which has administered his kingdom under a French protectorate, voluntarily abdicated and handed over all his possessions to the negociation of the French Government General of Canton, China at Saigon, for a financial consideration. Some day, soon it may be, we shall hear of the French in Morocco, for the Sultan, the only person there who is new on the scene, and will shortly be in Madagascar. The situation is a most interesting one.\n\nM. Ferry's ambition, for a long time, has been to stretch the frontier of Algeria from the River Oum Er-Rbia to the Mediterranean. He placed an Emiraut\u00e9 on the throne, who would rule the new province in the name of France. The Sheik of Wazan, a formidable rival of the Sultan, whose descendants are the Prophet, and exercises a moral religious sway over the Mohammedans of the Province, has accepted French nationality. It seems certain that the French will succeed in the plan. First because the Sultan has accepted French nationality; secondly, because with French help he can reach the throne; and third, because France has already sent Commissioners who will have no difficulty in having a strong fleet on the coast. The Sultan is powerless, not able even to put future no mason will be guilty of holding his own against a weak Spanish screening a bad mason, because he cannot attack France, nor any other European power. Egypt by Britain, Tripoli by Italy, Tunis by Spain, and Algeria by France. Morocco being the last independent Arabian State, will soon fall into the hands of France. No one is likely to interfere with it. If Europe does she interferes with the British extension to the Mediterranean. Germany cares little how France may transfer her power in foreign countries, so long as it does not diminish her power in Europe. Besides, when the Dutch line comes to an end in Holland there will be a further partition of small States to be made in which both Germany and France will be interested.\n\nABOUT RELIEF.\nThe question of Bradlangh for sitting and voting as a non-English parish member without having been sworn in by the Speaker is attracting attention in England, and it is hinted that Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, the presiding judge, observed the oath to which Bradlangh swore, but would be unwilling to swear the Lord Chief Justice did, as he is a liberal minded man, and if there is any doubt as to Bradlangh's capability, Bradlangh is entitled to the best treatment in the world. In regard to the point raised by Bradlangh to the effect that the Speaker had acted illegally in refusing to administer the oath to him without having his religious belief proved, the court held that the question must be reserved for the decision of a jury. The whole question rests upon this point, as how can he be declared a Non believer besides Bradlangh can tell what is Bradlangh's religious belief? Even Bradlangh himself might have some difficulty in intimating just what his belief is, between his beliefs and his belief and ours. No man can draw a line around his belief and say that beyond that line he does not go. Much less can anyone make up his mind what he really believes and what he thinks he believes, or what he says. How is a jury to settle the question? Even if a jury were able to take language and get inside of a man's head and examine his mental processes they could not declare what he believed or what he did not believe. For all that any person knows to the contrary, half the members of the British Parliament do not believe what most men Bradlangh does, and yet they sit and vote with impunity, with none to molest or make them afraid. Bradlangh is not the only atheist by any means who has a seat in parliament.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\nWe do not hold ourselves responsible for the views expressed by correspondents.\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE TRAVELLER.\nTo the Editor of The Times.\nSir,\u2014I quite agree with the letter signed \"Rehabus,\" in your last issue, in reference to Freemasonry. Some claim Masonry is a bad religion. Masons are human beings, the same as church members. We have hypocrites in our churches, but we do not denounce religion on that account. Masons do not choose to be hypocrites. They are human beings together to whom murderers and vice, as I have been frequently told by men that should know better. I consider a mason that will violate his obligations willfully, intolerable to tolerate. I hope no future no mason will be guilty of holding his own against a weak Spanish screening a bad mason, because he cannot attack France, nor any other European power. Egypt by Britain, Tripoli by Italy, Tunis by Spain, and Algeria by France. Morocco being the last independent Arabian State, will soon fall into the hands of France. No one is likely to interfere with it. If Europe does she interferes with the British extension to the Mediterranean. Germany cares little how France may transfer her power in foreign countries, so long as it does not diminish her power in Europe. Besides, when the Dutch line comes to an end in Holland there will be a further partition of small States to be made in which both Germany and France will be interested.\n\nJUSTICE.\nThe Woman's Philanthropist.\nA woman's philanthropy is a woman's work for humanity.

Wm. Creighton, President, Louis Simond, Secretary.\n\nGentlemen\u2014As your delegates for that purpose, we have made a journey of about 700 miles to seek an interview with Mr. Riel. We had to go into the country of Mr. David Thompson, near St. Peter's Mission, in the Counties of Leduc and Clark, beyond the River Red, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We found him there after having approached him with the object of our mission; we handed him our credentials and told him our errand. We then proceeded to meet with him, also the document whereby he had public notice given to the North-Western people that he was prepared, if he could, and did, to make peace. This interview took place on the 4th of June. Mr. Riel said that he would be willing to be allowed twenty-four hours to think the matter over before giving us an answer. He spoke to me very kindly. Mrs. Riel in a very friendly manner. Their conduct was smooth, simple and true. They invited us into their house of a very poor man, the feeling of the winter was more or less painful, but certainly Mr. Riel was very kind. The dinner was delicious. The kindness of his house reminded us of the opportunities that had been afforded us to become rich, and how easy it makes to become rich, and how easy it makes to become poor, and how all risks are stood by the conductors of this great work. We were very much struck by the Manitoba and how much she struggled for the whole North-West, and seeing how much she was doing for the Indians back, after a long trip of about 1,000 miles, with twice as much cold, disease, sickness, and death, and seeing her seek him in a foreign land. After taking into consideration the object of our mission, we thought that Mr. Riel from the other side of the line would be of use to the North-West, also that he had been very kind to us, and that he would do what he could to help us, so far as he had any power, those who happened to be in need of help. We thought that the North-West Indians needed particular care due to the fact that they had suffered a great deal for the cause and suffering, that he had yet interest in the Indians, and that he was willing to go and stand behind them, and that he would do what he could to help us. We thought to accompany us with his wife and children, and to start with him on the 18th of June. That trip would have been pleasant in every respect, except that Mrs. Riel had great trouble with her baby, which fell sick through exposure; we sincerely hope that she will get well soon, and that child will soon recover. Mr. Riel came to help in many ways, and we hope that he will be quite content and that this settlement will see its way to do what is right for the North-West. Further information with regards to our delegation will be given to your committee at your earliest convenience, as you may see fit, and we have the honor to submit herewith the written answer given to the delegation by Mr. Riel, which answers all the questions we put to him, and gives a full account of the result and on the line of action which we have to follow. His communications are very clear and to the point, and we feel very confident, as his intentions are to help us, but, if we understand him well, he will not be able to give us any great assistance to embarrass the Government. We have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your delegates and representatives,\n\nJ. H. DUNBAR, J. BOWLES, MONTREAL, JULY 10, 1884.\n\nNEW SPRING GOODS.\n\nJUST ARRIVED AT J. M.
