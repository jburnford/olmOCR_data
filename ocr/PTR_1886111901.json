The land of his adoption was the land of his love\u2014his whole life was consecrated to its welfare, and good of those amongst whom he laboured and he devoted his great abilities, his time and his life to promote their highest interests.\n\nThe late prelate was a man of high scholastic attainments. He was well versed in his subject, and his knowledge of the Bible was profound. He was a man of rare ability and a teacher of young men he had few superiors.

JOHN NOLAN, BISHOP OF SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nA PUBLIC TRIBUTE TO DEPARTED WORTH.\n\nSERMON BY ARCHBISHOP M'CAVY.\n\nOn Sunday last all that was mortal of the late Right Rev. John Nolan was laid to rest in the grandeur attesting his rank at St. Mary's church, and within short distance of Emmanuel College. Tonight at five o'clock, died the day previous, owing to the absence of members of his family and their friends. In about an hour thereafter, came the mourners\u2014more than thirty of them, including the Bishop himself, until the final departure of our chief and nearest relative until the soul has already passed away. It has been marked by deep sorrow, by intense compassion with heartfelt sympathy this day on the part of his fellow-men. May He, the head shepherd of our Church, bless all these things and make us once more to experience that which we have lost. So also to those who have passed from this world, may He comfort and make ease in his great mercy and love.\n\nPRAYERS AND BREVIARY IN USE.\n\nNo knell was heard. Our Lord's prayers were read, and the burial rite performed. The coffin was placed in the ground, and then solemnly closed by the hand that had raised it. \"And the peace of the Lord be with you always,\" said the Bishop as he walked away. And there was silence.\n\nBy appointment Mr. J. R. Sharp took charge of the ceremonies at Emmanuel Church.
