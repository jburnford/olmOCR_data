KING, M.A., CONVENER,\nPRINCIPAL CAVEN, D.D., PROFESSOR GREGG, M.A.,\nAND ROBERT MONTEATH.\n\nPrinted by Order of Presbytery.\n\nTORONTO:\nGLOBE PRINTING COMPANY, 26 & 28 KING STREET EAST.\n\n1875.\nThe Presbytery of Toronto, as now constituted, embraces the Counties of York, Peel, Cardwell with the exception of the Township of Adjala, the Townships of Trafalgar and Esquerring in the Counties of Halton, Mulmur in the County of Simcoe, and Melanethon in the County of Grey. The two latter were added to its bounds some years ago at the request of the Presbytery of Simcoe. The addition which was designed to promote the more efficient working of an important and somewhat neglected mission field, and which has probably had this result, has given to the Presbytery, as a glance at a map of Ontario will shew, a very irregular shape.\n\nIt is to be observed, that no considerable section of this territory was originally settled by a population predominantly or even largely Presbyterian,\u2014whether coming directly from Scotland, Ireland, or from older settled portions of Canada; with the exception of the township of Scarborough, and the larger portion of the Presbyterian population in this township was connected with the Church of Scotland branch and remained in this connection after the division in 1844. On the other hand, some large districts numbered at the first, only a few Presbyterian families among the settlers by whom they were occupied. A reference to the minutes and statistics of the Presbyterian Church of Canada will shew that this branch of the now United Church was very weak within the limits of the Presbytery at the time of its formation, and for some time continued to be so. At first, it had but one settled pastor within its bounds, the Rev. Mr. Rintoul of Streetsville, and even four years after the disruption, there were but four such. There was a vigorous, but not numerically strong cause in the city of Toronto; while in the country districts, there was not one congregation which, in comparison with some congregations then existing or soon afterwards formed in the western peninsula, could be regarded as strong in numbers. Things were not much, if indeed, any better, in those early days with the United Presbyterian branch. The number of organizations was smaller, more of them in proportion were enjoying the benefits of a stated ministry. On the whole, it will be seen that the prospects of Presbyterianism within the area of the Presbytery, so far as it was represented by these bodies, were not encouraging between 1844 and 1854, and, with the difficulty that existed in getting suitable ministers, the work of sustaining and advancing it in the circumstances stated above, was an exceedingly arduous one.\n\nIn estimating its growth within the limits of the Presbytery during the period to be reviewed, viz.: that between 1862 and 1875; it must still farther be kept in mind that at the commencement of this period there were almost no new tracts of country to be occupied with settlers; the territory was already for the most part an old settled and well cultivated one; and, accordingly, as the census returns shew, the population has not made any great increase within the bounds; in some districts, if the returns are not inaccurate, it has actually diminished. In addition, it is to be noted, that there are no large and growing towns within the bounds of this Presbytery, such as are found in many parts of Ontario. On the other\nhand it embraces in Toronto, the largest and wealthiest city of the Province; and though the increase of Toronto in population has not in the period been proportionately greater than that of some of the other cities of the Province\u2014in point of fact between 1861 and 1871, the rate of its increase was considerably less than that of Hamilton, London and Ottawa\u2014still in the Theological Institution with its Professors and Students, which has its seat here, the Presbytery has possessed an undeniable and an important auxiliary in promoting the interests of Presbyterianism not only in the city but in the remotest country districts which it embraces.\n\nThese considerations need to be taken into account before the proper value can be attached to the details which follow. These have respect to the condition of Presbyterianism within the bounds of the Presbytery and in connection with our own branch of the Church in the years 1862 and 1875\u2014that is, over a period of thirteen years. It would have been more appropriate to have selected 1861, the year of our happy union, as the first term of the series; but unfortunately no detailed statistics were published by either of the churches that year. The statistics for 1862 are comparatively full. Only four pastoral charges seem to have failed to give returns that year, and the two or three mission stations which then existed are in the same category. These four pastoral charges all report in 1863 and to prevent a too favourable view being taken of the advancement made, the returns for that year have been inserted, an asterisk in the accompanying tables marking those congregations from the others. Likewise a membership of 140 has been allowed for the mission stations, one, it is believed, fully representative of their strength. Coming to the other term of the series, the defects in the returns as they were put into the hands of your Committee have, by correspondence with ministers, been made good in every case but one. The only alternative available, in order to give something like completeness to the returns and to make the comparison of the two periods a really just and fair one, was to insert in the case of this congregation (Claude and Chinguacousy), from which no returns could be obtained, the report of membership, contributions, etc., for 1874.\n\nIn this way your Committee has been able to draw up two tables which are annexed to this report, and which, it is believed, will greatly interest not only the ministers of the Presbytery but the great body of its membership.\n\nTable I. contains, (a) the names of the pastoral charges and mission stations in 1862 and 1875, those being inserted in red ink, which have been formed since the former date; (b) the names of the pastors, at both dates; the late and the present pastor, where a change has taken place, being similarly distinguished; (c) the membership, or rather, the number of communicants, of each congregation at the respective dates; (d) the number under instruction in Sabbath schools and Bible classes; and (e) the salaries paid in each congregation in 1862 and in 1875, with the rate per member in each and at both dates.\n\nTable II. contains a statement of the contributions of each Congregation and Mission Station at the dates already specified, (a) To the College Fund, (b) To the Home Mission Fund, (c) To the Foreign Mission Fund, (d) To all the Schemes of the Church, including in addition to those already named, the Synod or Assembly Fund, the Aged Ministers' and Ministers' Widows' Fund, with the French Evangelisation Funds, and (e) to all purposes, Congregational and General, with the rate per member in the two latter cases. In this second table, the congregations of the Presbytery are arranged in the order of their rate of contribution to the schemes of the General Assembly.\nIt is difficult to summarise the results which are brought out by these tables, and by the statistical returns generally. The attempt to do so, may be made under the following general heads.\n\nI. Churches.\u2014In 1862, as far as can be seen, there were 36 Churches, or places of worship in connection with the denomination, within the bounds of the Presbytery, many of them small in capacity and without much pretension either to architectural grace or to durability. There are now 54; the more recently erected of which are generally tasteful and solid structures. These 54 churches are reported to furnish accommodation to 15,857 worshippers. There are still at least 6 places where public ordinances are administered by our Missionaries, where no place of worship has been erected. At two of them, McMillan's Corners, in the Queensville Group; and Honeywood, in the Mulmur Section, steps are being taken to have Churches erected during the present summer. It is difficult to estimate with accuracy the money value of this property. From an examination of the latest returns on this point and making allowance for the churches since built, the property cannot represent a value much less than $400,000.\n\nII. Ministers.\u2014In 1862, there were 21 pastoral charges within the present limits of the Presbytery, some of them very weak; 4 were vacant at the date of the report for the year. There are now 28, with several Mission Stations, almost, if not altogether, ripe for settlement. There were on the Roll of the Presbytery at the former date 17 Pastors; there are on it at this date 26; 6 only of the 17 being now found among the 26, viz.: the Ministers of Knox Church, Toronto, of Richmondhill and Thornhill, of Brampton and Derry West, of Union and Norval, of Caledon, and of King. Of the remaining eleven, one now occupies a Professor's chair, two are on the list of infirm Ministers, the rest have either died, or are labouring in other parts, one in England, and one in the United States.\n\nThese Ministers are assisted by 200 Elders, while 508 teachers give religious instruction to the youth of our Church in the Sabbath School. The reported attendance on Sabbath School and Bible Class instruction was in 1862, 2,274; in 1875, 5,450.\n\nIII. Manses.\u2014There are 11 Manses or residences for Pastors within the bounds of the Presbytery, according to the last returns. In addition 2 have houses rented by the congregation for their use. These Manses are all situated outside the city. The smallness of the salary given to many of the Ministers of country charges, as well as the difficulty of getting a suitable house to rent, convenient to the church, at any price, makes the Manse almost indispensable to the country Minister. It is hoped that each year will see an addition to the number, until all are provided. The statistical tables of 1862 contain no returns under this head, so that no comparison is possible.\n\nIV. Stipends.\u2014Having stated the facts as to the Ministry and the Manse-accommodation within the Presbytery; this report may now present the results of the comparison of the statistics of the two periods in regard to Stipends. These will be found to be of a very gratifying kind. The state of things is given below, first for the city charges, then for the country charges, and last for the whole Presbytery.\n\n| Pastoral Charges | Total amount paid for Salary | Average Stipend of each Minister | Membership | Rate per Member for Salary |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|\n| For City of Toronto 1862 | $5,100                        | \u00a31,020                          | 1,300      | $3.92                    |\n| For City of Toronto 1875 | $16,100                       | \u00a32,012                          | 2,849      | $5.65                    |\nIt thus appears that the average Salary in the city has all but doubled; in the country it has been increased by 62 per cent., and in the whole Presbytery by 85 per cent.; while the rate of giving per member or communicant, for this object, has advanced by between 45 and 55 per cent., the still higher percentage of increase in average salary, being due to the increased membership of the congregations of the Presbytery, especially in the city. If the question is asked, Whether the increase 88 per cent. in the average salary of the Ministers in the whole Presbytery in 13 years, does more than represent the increased expenses of living in that period? our Committee believe it does; and that the position of the Minister in this respect, while not all that might be desired, is a considerably improved one at the later period. It must be remembered that this is due in part to the excellent supplementary system now in operation and which could scarcely be said to have been initiated at the former date. If we compare the average above stated with that reached throughout the whole Church, it will be found to be considerably ahead of that, both in respect to Salary of Minister and rate of giving per member, as given in last Statistical Report to the General Assembly. The average Salary was $700, against $1,073 in this Presbytery, and the average rate per member $4.71 against $5.42 in this Presbytery. Only one Minister reports arrears of Salary, to the amount of $30.20. Surely this indebtedness might be wiped out without much difficulty.\n\nV. Membership, or Number of Communicants.\u2014It will be readily admitted that in coming to this item, we approach that which more than anything else will indicate the real growth, or the absence of growth, of our Church during the period referred to. The increasing wealth of the community may multiply churches and manses, and remunerate, if not liberally, yet more adequately, the ministers of the Gospel; but if a larger number do not wait on the ministry, and are not moved to make personal profession of faith in Christ, the Church must be held to be stationary or retrogressive. It is cheering then, to have to report a large increase in the number of communicants within the area covered by the Presbytery of Toronto. As in the former case, we give the figures first for the city, then for the country; (a) Regular charges only; (b) Regular charges, including Mission Stations, and last for the whole Presbytery.\n\n| Charges | Total number of communicants | Average number to each congregation |\n|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| City of Toronto | 1862 | 5 | 1,300 | 260 |\n|         | 1875 | 8 | 2,849 | 356 |\n| Increase | 1,549 | or 119 per cent. in 13 years, or 9 per cent. per annum. |\n\n(a) Regular Charges\n\n| Charges | Total number of communicants | Average number to each congregation |\n|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 1862 | 16 | 2,068 | 129 |\n| 1875 | 20 | 2,690 | 134 |\n| Increase | 622 | or 30 per cent. in 13 years, or 2,413 per cent. per annum. |\n(b) Regular Charges, including Mission Stations... 1862 20 2,208 110\n1875 28 3,114 111\n\nIncrease 906 or 41 per cent. in 13 years, or over 3 p. c. per annum.\n\nWhole Presbytery, including Mission Stations... 1862 25 3,508 140\n1875 36 5,963 165\n\nIncrease 2,455 nearly 70 per cent. in 13 years, or 5.5-13 per cent. per annum.\n\nThis statement would be incomplete, as shewing the relative position of our Church at the two periods, without some comparison of the increase here indicated with the increase of the general population within the same area. We have no means of ascertaining this for the entire period. The nearest approach we can make to it is the period extending from 1861 to 1871.\n\nAccording to the Census returns, we have the following results:\n\nCountry districts of the Presbytery of Toronto. 1861 107,148\n1871 110,444\n\nIncrease 3,296, 3.1-5 per cent in 10 years, or 3.10 per cent. per annum.\n\nCity of Toronto........ 1861 44,821\n1871 56,092\n\nIncrease 11,271, or 25 per cent. in 10 years, or 2\u00bd per cent. per annum.\n\nThe whole Presbyterial Territory.............. 1861 151,969\n1871 166,536\n\nIncrease 14,567, or 9 per cent. in 10 years, or scarcely 1 per cent. per annum.\n\nThus while the general population in the Country Districts has been increasing at the rate of 3-10 per cent annually, the membership in full communion of the Canada Presbyterian Church has been increasing within the same area at 3 per cent.; while the general population in the City of Toronto has been increasing at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent per annum, that of the membership of the Canada Presbyterian Church in it has been increasing at the rate of 9 per cent.; and while the population in the whole area, city and country, has been increasing at the rate of scarcely 1 per cent per annum, the membership of the Church in the same area, has been increasing at the rate of over 5 per cent. per annum.\n\nThis gratifying increase is very generally distributed over the Presbytery. It is, as has been brought out by the figures already submitted, much the largest, both absolutely and relatively, in the city. Of the country congregations, Scarborough, Richmondhill and Oakville have made the largest numerical increase in the 13 years now closed. Seven congregations report a smaller number of communicants in 1875, than in 1862. In at least two of the cases, this may be traced to the formation of new congregations in the neighborhood; and in others, it may be due to changes in the population, if not to its actual diminution. Whatever the explanation, it is a circumstance which the Presbytery would do well to ponder. Much of the increase in country districts is due to the opening up of Mission Stations, and the organization of congregations in parts of the Presbytery, especially\nin the Newmarket and Mulmur Districts, where our Church was almost unknown 13 years ago. It would be difficult to infer, with much confidence as to the conclusion from the figures now submitted, what the amount of the population adhering to our church is. If we allow 3 persons for every communicant, this would give to our branch of the Presbyterian Church an adhering population of 17,889 out of 160,336. The number of families reported as belonging to the Presbytery in the returns of 1875, is 2,893. Taking 5 as the average number of the family, a common basis of calculation in such cases, the result would be an adhering population of 14,465. The number of persons, not easily embraced in any ecclesiastical return, who within the area of the Presbytery of Toronto, receive their chief religious instruction and influence from the Canada Presbyterian Church, is probably larger than either of the numbers given above would make it.\n\nVI. Contributions to Schemes of the church and for all purposes.\u2014No part of the results brought out by the comparison of 1862 and 1875 gives indication of greater advancement than that exhibited in Table II. It is impossible to bring out fully by means of any summary the general advancement which has been made in giving for the support of the Gospel and the extension of its knowledge and influence in our own and other lands. The attention of the Presbytery, however, is called to the following particulars.\n\n| Home Missions | Knox College | Foreign Missions |\n|---------------|-------------|------------------|\n| (a) Contributions for 1862 | $332 86 | $1,105 80 | $225 35 |\n|               | $3,008 37 | $1,935 03 | $1,518 80 |\n| Increase of   | $2,675 51 | $829 23 | $1,293 45 |\n|               | or 900 per cent. | or 73 per cent. | or 574 per cent. |\n\n(b) Contributions for all the Schemes of the G. Assembly... 1862 $2,108 10 or 60c. per communicant. 1875 $8,819 20 or $1.47 per \" Increase $6,711 10 or 313 per cent. in 13 years.\n\nThe rate of contribution per member for these schemes ranges from $3.27 in Gould Street, $2.71 in Charles Street, and $2.54 in Knox Church, Toronto, to $.25c. and $.23c. in others. The increase, however, is very general, and while there were but two congregations which were giving over $1 per member for these schemes in 1862 (Gould Street & Knox Church, Toronto), there are now 13; only one congregation is giving for these schemes at a lower rate per member than in 1862. One, York Mills and Fisherville, is giving for them at a rate twelve-fold that of the earlier period.\n\n(c) Contributions for all purposes in ............... 1862 $22,485 00 rate per member, $6.40. 1875 $66,290 00 rate per member, $11.11. Increase $43,805 00 or 194 per cent. in 13 years.\n\nComparing the rates of contribution per member within the Presbytery, first for the Schemes of the General Assembly, second for all purposes, with those reached in the whole Church as stated in the last report presented to the General Assembly, it will be found that the rate for the former in the whole Church was $1.11 per member, as against $1.47 in this Presbytery, and the rate for the latter was $11.90, as against $11.11 in this Presbytery. The rate attained for the former object, so intimately connected with the general interests of the body\u2014nearly one-third higher than that reached\nin the Church at large\u2014is a matter on which the Presbytery may fairly congratulate itself, especially in view of the fact, that its country congregations are, generally speaking, numerically weak, only one of them having a membership in full communion of over 200. The lower rate attained for all purposes, is sufficiently explained by the circumstance that there has been but little churchbuilding or liquidating of debt, within the Presbytery for the last year; without insisting on the fact, that in the general returns presented to the Assembly, the whole amount expended on Church, or Manse-building seems to be sometimes included in the report for a single year, while the actual raising of the money is distributed over several.\n\nIt may be interesting to see how the rate of giving in the Presbytery of Toronto compares with that obtaining in one of the Presbyteries of Scotland. A very full table is now before us of the membership and contributions of the Metropolitan Presbytery of Edinburgh, in connection with the United Presbyterian Church. The membership is 26,262; the contributions for all purposes \u00a343,808, being at the rate \u00a31 13s. 4\u00bdd., or a little over $8 as against $11.11 in this Presbytery.\n\nWhile the results, which your Committee has the honor to submit, are so far of a very gratifying character, it does not forget that these do not themselves constitute the highest object for which the Church of Christ exists. It has been instituted, not simply to raise money in the name of religion, or to increase a nominal membership, but to promote the spiritual life of its members, and to add to the number of true believers. Your Committee is of opinion, however, that the increase in membership and in liberality, herein reported, may be taken as affording satisfactory evidence of a considerable measure of religious life among our people, and could not have been obtained without it. It would respectfully impress on the Presbytery the conviction which it entertains, that the degree of outward strength which has been reached, can, in the circumstances in which Presbyterianism exists within its bounds, only be sustained, and made the basis for further advancement, by zealously and prayerfully maintaining the religious life which exists; or better still, by securing for it through faith in Christ and the operation of His Spirit, increased purity and warmth. Without this, a proportion of the more wealthy and fashionable members of our Church will drop away into communions, in which their worldly aspirations will be more fully gratified, while not a few of all classes may be induced by the more demonstrative, if not deeper, religious life of some other bodies of Christians existing along side of them, to leave the Church of their fathers. On the whole, it is not a fact to be stated with regret, that nothing but a good measure of that life which the Spirit of God originates and sustains, can preserve for our Presbyterianism in this country its present proportion of numbers and wealth. It is rather a matter to be thankful for, that however some churches may hope to increase from the growth of wealth and the tastes which wealth brings with it, the Presbyterian Church, while not fearing either wealth or culture, can only hope to maintain and extend itself in this land, through the maintenance in its membership of intelligent piety.\n\nThus while \"the things that remain\" are happily among us \"not ready to die,\" we may still hear the voice of the Head of the Church saying to us as to the Church of Sardis, \"Be watchful and strengthen them;\" or as to another of the Churches of Asia, \"Hold fast that which thou hast; that no man take thy Crown.\"\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nJOHN M.
