Mould & Son, Ltd., Edmonton, for plumbing work done at the Edmonton Indian School.\n\nThis covers the installation of the plumbing material purchased from Crane Limited, Edmonton, on P.O. 18450, plus the purchase and installation of 24 oak closet tanks which had rotted out. As far as I can ascertain, this latter item was not authorized. However, I am satisfied that it was necessary and would recommend that payment be authorized.\n\nLetter from J. W.

We are returning the voucher as it should show the number of hours each of the four men worked and the rate per hour. The charge for labour appears high.\n\nIn any case, the labour amounted to approximately $360, and the voucher is for $631. In other words, additional equipment at an approximate cost of $271 was secured without any purchase order or authority from the Department.\n\nIt is simply impossible for us to consider the payment of accounts unless regulations are followed; otherwise we would be totally unable to control our expenditures. Both the Principal and yourself are no doubt aware of purchasing regulations and in future the Department must insist that these be carried out to the letter. Otherwise payment of the accounts will not be made. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to bring this matter to your attention again.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Regional Supervisor Gooderham.\n\nBernard F.

In regard to quotations from other firms, would say that these boilers were in such condition that the Inspector intended to condemn them until it was pointed out to him by one of his assistants that this action would mean closing the school as no new boilers of this kind are available at present. We could not find any other firm who would even consider looking over the job and it was only after a great deal of talking that we were able to persuade the Saskatoon Welding Co. to undertake the work. When the boilers were torn down they were found to be in even worse condition than was at first thought.\n\nIn regard to supervision of the work, I was at the school once while they were working at the job and once when they were finishing. The Boiler Inspectors were there four times to inspect the work being done and either Mr. Staley or Mr. Faunt were in the building all the time the work was being done and inspected it on numerous occasions.\n\n(Signed) E.A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nTerrace Building,\nEdmonton, August 1, 1947.\n\nAttention Rev. Staley, Principal.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConfirming our verbal report on the condition of your boilers, the following are the repairs necessary in order that the boilers may be operated for the coming heating season.\n\nBoiler No. (A) 6894 requires the bottom 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" of the water legs cut off and new plates and foundation ring welded in place. New washout openings and a new return connection will be necessary in replaced outer sheet. An additional row of stays will also be necessary.\n\nBoiler No. (A) 6895. The water legs of this boiler are extensively and deeply pitted with the pitting still active. We would suggest that this boiler be treated with zinc, lime and graphite to arrest the pitting, and that a connection for the blow-down be provided just above the foundation ring.\n\nThe above repairs will enable the boilers to operate for the coming winter, but we strongly recommend that serious consideration be given to replacing these boilers during the Summer of 1948.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) R.

Gooderham, Esq., Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nRe: Mastic Flooring - Edmonton Residential School.\n\nReferring to your letter of Nov. 25th, re above.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I wired the Department requesting that payment of my voucher No. 488-47, Nov. 3rd, $757.00, be held up until further advised. Mr. Freeze has not yet shown up to make this inspection and Ottawa are asking me for further advice as to payment.\n\nI think possibly your attention was called to these floors when you were at the school on Oct. 24th. They had not looked just right to me when I first saw them but as they were the first mastic floors I had ever seen, I thought possibly I could be wrong. I phoned the Manager of the Taylor Tile & Contracting Co., and told him that he would have to go out to the school and satisfy Mr. Staley that the floors were all they should be. Mr. Grover, the manager, went to the school and finding Mr. Staley absent, inspected the floors with Mr. Faunt and the Matron, and Mr. Faunt phoned me that they were satisfied that floors were O.K., and I as a consequence, vouchered the account Nov. 3rd. However, Mr. Staley was apparently not notified that Mr. Grover had been out.\n\nMr. Staley now feels that in view of the guarantee given as to workmanship and materials by the Taylor Tile & Contracting Co., in their tender for this work, that it would be in order to pay the account and if the floor does not stand up, to make them replace it later.\n\nWill you please advise your wishes in the matter.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Dec. 16th, in connection with Voucher No. 486-47, Nov. 3rd, 1947, $259.50, in favor of Gemmell Electric Co., Edmonton, covering electrical repairs at Edmonton Indian School.\n\nI am now returning Voucher together with time slips from Gemmell Electric showing men employed, time worked and rate per hour.\n\nIn regard to Voucher No. 488, Nov. 3rd, $757.00, in favour of Taylor Tile & Contracting Co., covering mastic floors laid at the School, my wire requesting that payment of this account be held up was sent on instructions received from Mr. G. H. Gooderham, who wished to have Mr. D. A. Freeze, District Architect, Dept. of Public Works, inspect the floor before the account was settled.

We were only able to take care of the main items which were requested of us by the gentlemen in charge. We are satisfied that in the very near future you will also be faced with other necessary repairs, as this installation has now been in service for a good period of years, and owing to the type of school which you are operating, it is subject to rather heavy usage.\n\nIt is quite likely that the heating installation will require certain attention in the very near future.\n\nThe enclosed invoice covers those items which were brought to our attention by the gentlemen in charge.

He has submitted the attached accounts amounting to $859.50 and as an explanation of the increased expenditure he writes as follows:\n\n\"In regard to the additional expenditure of $59.50, you will note from my letter of Aug. 16th, that Mr. Allan would not make any definite tender for the work as there was no way of telling exactly what repairs would be required until the work was in progress and the $800.00 was a very indefinite figure.\"\n\nIn our first communication of August 26th to the Deputy Minister we stated that Colin Allan would be employed to do the electrical work as his name had been given to us in Indian Agent Robertson's letter. However, Gemmell Electric were employed to do the work and in explanation of this change Indian Agent Robertson writes,\n\n\"At the time your authority for this work was received, the Gemmell Electric were at the school doing other work...\"\nfor Mr. Staley and as it was desired to have the repairs made before the students returned if at all possible, and Mr. Allan was not in a position to start the work immediately, Mr. Staley had these people go ahead with the work.\"\n\nPlease issue purchase order so that the account may be paid.

This was overcome by placing a different coloured strip on each side which made a very fine appearing job.\n\nI have vouchered the account and if this can be passed I would recommend that it be paid, if not will you please return the account and it will have to be paid by the school.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEAR#kt\nEncls.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWould you be good enough to ask the Dept. to have done\nthe necessary repairs to the various buildings at the school\nneeded by reason of the falling away of the brick veneer.\nThe situation is steadily getting worse and with the weathering\nnow that breaks have been made in the brick work unless\nsomething is done a much more expensive job will be involved\nin the future. The estimated cost is $350.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nCould consideration be given to having the roofs on\nthe two very large barns at the school painted this summer.\nThey are badly in need of paint and it would add greatly\nto the appearance of this place if the work could be done.\nThe roofs as you know are very large and the cost would\nbe in the neighborhood of $500 but I would urge that the\nwork be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAll the buildings belonging to the school are badly in need of paint and it would be appreciated if all the outside woodwork and shingles on the following buildings could be done this summer.\n\n1.

Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWould you be good enough to please consider a request for a small electric washing machine to be used for incidental washing purposes at the school. At present we have just the large power machines and it is a very expensive proposition running this outfit for many items that could best be done by a smaller machine. I refer to such things as the washing of dish towels from the kitchen and other such items that must be done each day. It would be a big asset if a small machine could be provided. The estimated cost is $175.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWould you ask the Dept. if they would consider the purchase of a potato peeling machine for the kitchen. With almost one hundred and seventy five pupils and staff to be cared for the business of peeling potatoes is a dreary and long task and not exactly an educational one. A suitable machine could be provided for $225.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn,\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe tables and benches used in the children's dining room have reached the place where further repairs cannot be effected to them and the matter of replacement must be considered. Twelve new tables and twenty-four benches are required. These will have to be made and for sanitary reasons I would recommend that the tops of the tables be of battleship linoleum. I may add that this request has the emphatic endorsement of Miss McCready the travelling dietician. The estimated cost is $500.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWould you be good enough to ask the Dept. to consider having new wooden floors laid in the two dormitories on the upper floor of the school. The rough flooring has given way completely and the matter is one of urgency if we are to continue using these rooms for the children. The estimated cost is $750.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nWould you be good enough to ask if the following list of painting inside the school could be done this summer.

There are several places on the walls where the bricks have bulged out and fallen and the rain and snow getting between the walls make them deteriorate very fast. This work should, I think, be done if at all possible.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith several letters from Mr. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, requesting authority for painting, repairs etc., at the Edmonton School.\n\nI have listed these requests in what I consider their order of importance.\n\nDuring the past year it has been necessary for the school to re-open the 2 dormitories on the upper floor which had not been used for a number of years. These rooms badly need decorating and new floors as requested.\n\nThe sewing room and the north-east class room also are in need of re-decorating as nothing has been done to them for a number of years. The table and benches in the children's dining room are also in poor condition and I believe Miss McCready, the dietician, may also have recommended that they be replaced from a sanitary view point.\n\nIn regard to the potato peeling machine, this would appear to be a reasonable request as they have about an average of 175 to feed and peeling potatoes by hand for this number takes a lot of time which could be used to better advantage in other ways. The washing machine requested for the laundry is also recommended. At the present time, if they wish to wash a few dish towels or something of that kind they have to turn on the big machines in the laundry and require the services of the engineer and the matron to oversee the work.\n\nIn regard to painting the residences and barns, this of course can be delayed if funds are not available, however, the painting is very badly needed.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Repairs & Painting,\nEdmonton Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton Agency\n\nAttached hereto please find copy of Mr. Robertson's letter of June 23, together with letters from the Rev. Mr. Staley and estimates on painting, repairs, and new installations required at the Edmonton Residential School. It is hoped that the funds are available to do this work. As much of it as possible should be undertaken during the current holiday period. You might advise Mr. Robertson by direct letter as to how much of the program he might expect to have approved for this year. He has listed each item in order of preference.\n\nForwarded and recommended.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nMr. Robertson,\nSupt. Indian Affairs,\nWinterburn.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nArising out of our conversation on the occasion of the school and all the buildings I would request permission to make alterations to the large barn formerly used as a horse barn in this respect. All horse stalls on the south side to be taken out and in their place twelve cow stanchions built. We shall never need the barn for horses again but our dairy herd is being constantly enlarged and now we have not room to accommodate all the dairy cattle in the cow barn. If consideration is given to this request I would use the new stalls for my dry and young stuff. Prices on the cost of alteration can be secured if authority is given to effect the changes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter from Mr. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School requesting permission to make some alterations in the horse barn at the school.\n\nThis is a large veneer barn with metal stalls for 16 horses, 8' on each side of the barn as well as several box stalls. At the time the barn was built all the farm work was done with horses and accommodation for quite a large number was required; however, the work is now done by tractor and I do not think there is any possibility of their going back to horse labour. At the present time the farm has 6 horses which are very seldom used. Mr. Staley has the cow barn filled up at present and has considerable young stock. It is his intention to increase the herd if possible and he would like to have permission to remove the horse stalls from one side of the horse barn and replace them with cow stalls where he can stable his dry milk cows and young stock.\n\nIf alterations of this kind can be permitted would you please advise and I will secure and forward an estimate of the cost.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nJuly 19, 1948.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Winterburn, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding repairs and new equipment requested by the principal of the Edmonton Residential School, the Department approves the following expenditures:\n\n(1) Painting two dormitories on upper floor.\n(2) New flooring in third floor dormitories.\n(3) Replacement of tables and benches in the children's dining room - $500.00.\n(4) Painting principal's residence - $310.00.\n(5) Repairs to brick veneer on two barns - $250.00.\n\nThe other repairs suggested will have to remain until next year. You should, of course, forward the usual requisition for materials required. At that time you should state if the labour will be performed by white men or Indians. You may also forward a requisition for a potato peeling machine and a washing machine. Complete information should be given regarding the type of machine required in each case.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Staley, Principal, Edmonton Residential School, re the above.\n\nI concur in the plan suggested, whereby the horse barn will be made over into a cow barn to accommodate the growing herd. Mr. Robertson should be advise direct if the Department approves of the change, so that he may obtain an estimate of the cost.\n\nG. H.

After a two hour fight the flames were subdued and it was found that apparently the fire had started in a cupboard containing soaps and other laundry materials. We were actually at a loss to determine its real cause but judging by the charred and blackened appearance of the wall and ceiling the wooden cupboard contained the start of the difficulty. The flames got a good hold on the ceiling and holes had to be cut through the flat upper roof to fight the blaze.\n\nThe children in the meantime had all been alerted and dressed and were standing in the corridors of the main building awaiting the outcome of the fight.\n\nThe fire was happily confined to the laundry but considerable damage was done.

I was unable of course to get in touch with you but reported the matter to your office on Tuesday morning and also phoned Mr. Gooderham.\n\nI was compelled to deal immediately with the electrical problem in order to carry on the regular work of the school and because the fused wiring was threatening further trouble and I also ordered belting for the machines because without the belts it was quite impossible to tell what damage if any had been done to the machinery. I am not as yet able to report on this matter.\n\nIn conversation with Mr. Battle in Calgary he advised that any further repairs should await the consent of Ottawa.

Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEAR#kt\nEncls.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: Fire at Edmonton Residential School.\n\nFurther to Mr. Gooderham's letter of Oct. 27, to you in connection with the above.\n\nOn my return to the office from Lac La Biche on Friday, Oct. 29th, I was advised of the fire in the laundry at Edmonton School on Oct. 25th, and went to the School to inspect the damage on Saturday, Oct. 30.\n\nFrom the appearance of the room, I would agree with Mr. Staley's suggestion that it started in a cupboard containing soap and cleaning compounds, but whether it started from spontaneous combustion or from defective wiring or some other cause, it would be impossible to say.\n\nThe cupboard and one or two tables in the laundry were completely destroyed. All belting for the machines was also burned. The electric wiring and all switches and outlets were destroyed and all the window glass was shattered and will have to be replaced. The room has a metal ceiling and the heat burned all the paint from this.\n\nOne or two wooden pulleys may have to replaced later but the machines do not appear to have been damaged.\n\nIn fighting the fire it was necessary to cut several holes in the roof in order to get at the fire in the boards under the metal ceiling but the cost of repairing the roof will be very small.\nMr. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nOn the night of Monday Oct. 25th our night man on duty going his rounds about seven forty five discovered smoke seeping from the laundry. He raised the alarm and alerted the staff and children and then opened the laundry room door to be greeted by a solid mass of flame and smoke. A two hour fight resulted in the blaze being brought under control but not before considerable damage being done to the laundry. Investigation showed that the fire had broken out in a wooden cupboard used for storing soaps and other light materials. How the fire started I do not think will ever be known because everything wooden in the room was destroyed together with some $500 worth of clothing. The room had been used all day and had been inspected at six and at seven o'clock and at these hours there was no sign of anything out of order. The fire was put out largely because of the changes made by your department that resulted in our having an automatic pump to keep the pressure up. A year ago the building would have burned down.\n\nI would like to comment too, on the excellent behaviour of the children which augers well if any further difficulty should arise.\n\nI have taken up the matter of repairs with your office and feel sure that the figure of $350 I mentioned will be close to the actual amount needed to fully restore the department.\n\nI have of course taken all the precautions I can to see that an efficient system of inspection and control be put into operation to prevent any further difficulty.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.

It would seem that we will have to consider the following major expenditures at this school next year:\n\n(a) Plumbing - installation of drinking fountain and toilet near dormitories,\n\n(b) Fire Escapes - installation of tubular or other type escapes,\n\n(c) Water Supply - replacement of present tanks by elevated water tanks,\n\n(d) Heating - installation of two new boilers,\n\n(e) Spires - removal of metal work above the louvers. Such spires were always installed in our Residential Schools built in the 1920's and '30's, and we consider that they are no longer necessary.\n\n(f) Laundry - replacement of present laundry machinery,\n\n(g) Sewage Disposal - installation of an additional septic tank.\nI would like to recommend that a meeting be held between our Education Officials and those of your Engineering and Construction Service so that a decision can be reached as to the best way of having this school brought into an efficient state of repair. It will probably be necessary to have a fairly substantial sum placed in our 1949-50 Supplementary Estimates for the various items mentioned above.\n\nActing Director.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nThe report from the Donald Inspection Company with reference to the Edmonton Residential School has been removed from the file and has been placed in the special drawer with the reports of the same service regarding other Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIt will be noted that memorandum dated December 4, 1948, on this file acknowledges receipt of the report of the Donald Inspection Company.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nTO\nEdmonton Butchers and Packers,\n9953 Jasper Avenue,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nFILE NUMBER 86375-15-2 Alta\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nRev.

No school anywhere is likely to be more of a death trap than this if fire really gets going. Just a few months ago, a fire was discovered by the alertness of the night watchman, that could easily have destroyed the whole place. Its origin is not known but it was only put out with extreme difficulty.\n\nIt might be well if you and Mr. Gooderham were consulted before there is any thought of cutting off the small pittance that is now given. You, at least know what the situation is while the writer very evidently knows nothing except the financial obligation.\n\nIt would be very wise to call the attention of the Dept. to the visit and recommendation of the Provincial Fire Inspector made in the fall of 1946. Nothing has been done to remedy the main faults of that time. The water supply is useless to meet any size blaze. If the fire is not found and controlled in a few minutes the case is hopeless. There is a trickle of water in the attic, a few minutes supply on the top floor and so it goes.\n\nThe fire escape are antiquated and useless. In winter, the children have to climb out through windows three feet from the floor, then down a frozen pole to the ground, many feet below.\n\nInstead of saving a few dollars what is needed is the spending of many to modernize this place and enable the staff to sleep at night without being afraid that their charges may be fried by morning.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Voucher No. 34-49, Edmonton Indian School,\n$40.00, Night Watchman's Salary, January.\n\nReferring to your letter of Feb. 17th, 1949,\nin regard to the above.\n\nI conveyed the information contained in your letter\nto Rev. Mr. Staley and am enclosing herewith copy of his reply,\nwhich is very self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Staley's statements as to the fire escapes and\nthe lack of efficient fire fighting equipment are, of course,\ncorrect and the fire which broke out a few months ago was\ndiscovered by the night watchman and checked before it could\nspread to any great extent. Until the fire protection can\nbe modernized, I would strongly recommend that the allowance\nbe continued.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttached hereto are letters from Superintendent Robertson and Rev. E.J. Staley re voucher covering the salary of the night watchman, Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nA copy of your letter of February 17th, file 753-5 (E.1.), was forwarded to me and it would appear there is no authority to employ a watchman since April 1947. Mr. Staley makes a strong bid in his letter and is supported by Mr. Robertson. I must add that this institution should have a night watchman, as it is not fire-proof and is an old building.\n\nDr. Dorey and Mr. Staley are demanding more pupils in order to try and operate this school within the earnings of the farm and the per capita grant. Every endeavor is being made to increase the pupilage, and I am also trying to get the Province to give some financial assistance for three mixed blood children who are attending. This added revenue is not available.\n\nIf the salary of the night watchman must be added to the Church's expenditure, then I fear that the calibre of the teaching and supervisory staff will be that much poorer. It is our experience that qualified teachers are not employed when there are not sufficient funds.\n\nI hope you can reconsider this and allow the salary of the watchman until the end of April.\n\n[Signature]\nG.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n19th March, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant\nwith further reference to the request of the Principal\nof the Edmonton Residential School for an allowance\ntowards the salary of the night watchman. In a\nrecent ruling by the Deputy Minister, he indicated\nthat an allowance towards the salary of a night\nwatchman could be allowed on the following under-\nstanding:\n\n(1) That the person employed is not\none of the regular members of the\nstaff at the school.\n(2) That an engineer has certified\nthat a definite fire hazard exists.\n\nIn view of the information contained in\nRev. E.J. Staley's letter that the Provincial Fire\nInspector feels that a fire hazard exists at the\nEdmonton Residential School, I believe this report\ncovers requirement No. 2 of the Deputy Minister's\nruling.\n\nWe will rely on you to see that ruling\nNo. 1 is followed.\n\n.......2\nWith the above in mind, we are prepared to make an allowance of $60.00 a month towards the salary of the night watchman at the Edmonton School from the date on which he began duties during the present heating season to 30th April, 1949. We can review the matter again before the heating season of 1949-50.\n\nI enclose for your information, a sample Voucher.\n\nPP/ST\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

At present there is a staff of 14 persons and 150 pupils. The school is operated by the United Church of Canada with financial aid from the Dominion Government.\n\nSewage from the school and three residences flows into a three-chamber septic tank, then into a low, fenced area some 300 yards from the school and 100 yards from the nearest barn. The septic tank was installed in 1923 when the school was built and is of poor design. Entering sewage flows to twin chambers each 12 feet square and only two feet deep, then through a chamber 12 feet long, 24 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. The capacity of the tanks (10,800 gals.) is approximately correct for the population (175) but the design is such that the influent passes quickly through the three compartments without allowing sufficient time for deposition of suspended matter or providing suitable conditions for sludge digestion. The first two compartments are shallow, and built-up sludge forms a channel to the third compartment which allows the sewage to flow across its least dimension.\n\nThe disposal pond creates a nuisance in the summer time for odors reach the school. The laundry drain bypasses the septic tank. Drains from the school have been plugged four times in the last fifteen months, probably due to settling and cracking of the tile.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nIt is believed if the sewage received better treatment before discharge into the pond, the odor would not be so noticeable. This could be accomplished by construction of a septic tank of good design which would give a better degree of treatment than the present one.\n\nHowever, odors would still arise and it is preferable that the effluent be piped further away. To the northwest there is a large, suitable flat area covered with trees. Some 250 yards of pipe would be required to discharge the effluent into a gully which flows to the flat area. Levels need to be run to determine the exact length of pipe and depth of trench.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n1. The existing sewer from the school to the septic tank be replaced.\n2. A suitable septic tank of proper design be constructed.\n3. The septic tank effluent be discharged to the pond northwest of the barn.\n\nStanley Epp\nSanitary Engineer, District No. 8.\nDEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\n808 Jackson Building,\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMarch 16th, 1949.\n\nMr. D.

He stated as follows:\n\n\"The north west classroom is poorly lighted and poorly ventilated. Two fluorescent lights to replace the front drop lights would do much to enable the children to see the blackboard with less eyestrain. The chance to ventilate the room would probably improve if the top windows might be lowered. The classrooms are tidy and clean. Good seating is provided. The library is fairly good. Classroom supplies are available as ordered.\"\n\nI would appreciate your comments on his suggestions particularly concerning the fluorescent lights.

At present there is a staff of fourteen persons and an enrolment of 150 pupils. The school is operated by the United Church of Canada with financial aid from the Dominion Government.\n\nWater is supplied from a drilled well 180 feet deep, in which the water rises 75 feet. The hole is steel cased with 6 inch casing at the bottom and 8 inch at the top. It is drilled through sedimentary strata containing hardpan and numerous coal seams. An electrically-operated Myer's pump produces a flow of 25 to 40 gallons per minute to two 1200 gallon pressure tanks in which a pressure of 25 - 45 pounds per square inch is maintained. This is the only storage provided and there is not sufficient fire protection since the well will not produce water at a sufficient rate to maintain pressure for water to reach the top storey.\n\nFour samples of water taken from the distribution system (see attached sheet) indicated the water to be of good bacteriological quality. The attached chemical analysis shows the water to be of fair chemical quality since it has a total dissolved solids of over 2300 p.p.m., which is largely sodium sulphate. However, the water is quite soft and when it is cold the soda is not unduly noticed.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations.\n\nThe water at this residential school appears to be satisfactory bacteriologically and since water is very scarce in the area with no streams or springs nearby, the present water supply, although only of fair chemical quality, should be satisfactory. An elevated storage tank would be protection against fire since the present supply could not combat one successfully.\n\nStanley S.

Tender from the Gemmell Electric for installation of three 2 light fixtures in this room is enclosed. These people recommend three 2 light fixtures in this classroom rather than two 4 light fixtures.\n\nMr. Staley has also asked for installation of similar lights in front of the blackboard in the other classrooms and tender from Gemmell Electric for this work is also enclosed.\n\nIf funds are available I would recommend that the lights be installed in all three classrooms.\n\nE.

Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School,\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nIn accordance with a request from Major MacKay our heating engineer visited the above on his recent inspection trip to Alberta and British Columbia, and the following report is submitted for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThis school is twenty-six (26) years old and is in fairly good condition. However, due to a number of reasons, hereinafter outlined, several major items of mechanical equipment have simultaneously reached a stage of deterioration where costly operations will be required within a short time if these services are to function with reasonable efficiency.\n\nThe heating system does not give satisfaction. Practically all rooms farthest away from the boilers are difficult to heat. As is the case with a number of other schools, it can be stated that the principal reason is due to the original faulty design of the piping system. This design was based on a so-called vapour system which is supposed to operate on several ounces of pressure. In a building of this size satisfactory distribution of steam cannot be realized on such low pressures, and when the pressure is increased the steam simply short circuits through bleeder connections taken from the ends of the mains and connected to a system of wet returns and consequently the radiators near the ends of the mains and branch mains receive little or no steam.\n\nThis system can be made to function satisfactorily by the installation of float and thermostatic traps on the ends of all mains and branch mains. These traps will prevent short circuiting and since the steam cannot get into the returns, it must pass through radiators as it should. In addition to that feature of the system, it was found that the condensation was returned to the boilers through what is now considered to be an obsolete arrangement consisting of a boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly. This equipment must be replaced by a modern and inexpensive condensation pump and receiver together with minor piping changes in the boiler room. With this set-up normal operating pressures of one to two lbs. per square inch can be used and the problem of distribution overcome.\n\nThe heating system is powered by two Pascol steel fire box low pressure steam heating boilers each rated at approximately 48 H.P. These boilers were condemned several years ago by the Provincial Boiler Inspector, but since it was impossible at that time to obtain new boilers extensive and somewhat unusual repairs were carried out to permit the boilers to remain in service. One boiler had a complete new base welded.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\non. It can be stated that at present they are in somewhat less than fair condition and cannot be expected to give further satisfactory service.\n\nThe domestic hot and cold water system has also been a source of trouble for a number of years. There are two 1200 gallon water pressure tanks located in a space adjacent to the boiler room. Water is pumped from a well into these tanks and distribution from the tanks is made to the various parts of the building and to several adjacent residences. The piping going to the residences is undersized, and fixtures on the second floor are for the most part inoperative. The tanks which have been in since the school was built are in bad shape. They have been patched and welded on various occasions and the time has arrived when they can no longer be successfully repaired and it naturally follows that they will have to be replaced at as early a date as possible. The distribution piping is in a critical state. Many sections of hot and cold water lines have been replaced from time to time by the operating engineer until the system is now a mess of patchwork. A chemical element in the water has corroded this steel piping to such an extent that innumerable pin holes and leaks of all kinds are in evidence throughout the entire system. It will likely be found when this water is analyzed that copper piping will be required for the new work.\n\nThe sewage disposal system has been a constant source of trouble for many years. The septic tank is of a unique and somewhat unorthodox design and instead of being buried in the ground in accordance with generally accepted principles, it is installed at grade level and is provided with a frame roof which is far from being tight or waterproof. No evidence of bacterial action was to be found. The siphons were reported to be continually blocked and this is not surprising in view of the fact that the raw sewage due to a lack of bacterial action is not broken down into a liquid. The raw sewage overflows into a discharge line laid in tile underground and carried to a slough about 250 to 300 yards away from the school. This slough is nothing less than a huge cess pit and bad odours are wafted towards the school and the surrounding buildings according to the caprices of the wind. This results in an abominable condition and in spite of efforts to keep the tank clean only temporary relief has been gained. This tank will have to be abandoned and replaced by one of a proper design.\n\nMost of the W.C.'s in the boys section in the basement have been practically ruined by what appears to be willful destruction. It is evident that a lack of proper supervision is responsible for the condition of these fixtures. In most cases the porcelain is cracked and huge chips broken leaving the battery of fixtures in a sorry state.\n\nNo drinking fountains were provided in the dormitory section on the top floor and this has resulted in a hardship for the pupils in residence during the night.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing there are numerous other minor items all in a state of progressive deterioration, and it is evident that operations on a major scale will be required if this school is to continue operations.\nIt is therefore recommended that the following operations be carried out.\n\n(a) Provide one new steel fire box low pressure steam heating boiler and thoroughly repair the other existing boiler for standby use.\n\n(b) Provide new condensation pump and receiver unit.\n\n(c) Provide and install float and thermostatic traps on ends of all steam mains and branch mains.\n\n(d) Provide several additional radiators in rooms which are insufficiently heated.\n\n(e) Replace the entire domestic hot and cold water system of piping.\n\n(f) Replace the two existing cold water pressure tanks.\n\n(g) Build new concrete septic tank.\n\n(h) Install several drinking fountains.\n\nUntil a layout has been prepared it will be most difficult to estimate the cost of these operations. It can be safely assumed however that this work will cost in the neighbourhood of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), and it can again be stated that every item previously mentioned is vitally necessary.\n\nWhen approval is received to proceed with the design and specifications covering the revisions outlined, we will prepare a layout as soon as possible.\n\nChas.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nMr. Graham, Indian Commissioner, met us here on the 9th inst., and we spent the day looking over a number of farms which could be purchased, and of which nearly all were valued at about $100.00 per acre.\n\nWe made a selection, which is by all odds, the best when viewed from a three-fold stand-point, namely; location, quality of land, and price. The latter being about $70.00 per acre. I enclose you a copy of the option, which contains a description of the location of the land. You will notice that the option expires on October 15th.\n\nOn the 10th, Mr. Graham and I visited the Red Deer Institute for the purpose of inspection the buildings, and the farm.\n\nMr. Graham has a clear conception of the proposition, and all that it involves. He will send you his report on his return to Regina.\n\nIn the meantime, I wish to call your attention to the following facts:\n\n1st.-That the Red Deer Institute Buildings are in a very poor condition. Nothing has been spent on them for over 15 years, beyond what was actually necessary to keep them in repair. They never were suitable, and never can be made so. There is very little value in the out-buildings, beyond the Principal's Home.\n\nTo put up proper buildings would cost at least $100,000, since the boy's building as well as that of the girl's would have to be pulled down and rebuilt. If this were done, the Institute would still be geographically in the wrong place.\n\n2nd.-Edmonton is geographically about the centre of the constituency we wish to serve.\n\nThis constituency has in the neighborhood of 240 Protestant Indian children of school age.\n\n3rd.-We understand that there is $60,000 available for the Methodist Church for plant. The Department has the assurance through the commission composed of Dr. Endicott and myself, that the Church is willing that this $60,000 shall be used towards making the change from Red Deer to Edmonton.\n\nThis amount will purchase the land in question.\n\nover.\nMr. D. C. Scott,\n\n4th.-The Red Deer farm, consists of 1,120 acres of land, of which, 480 acres is first class agricultural land, and 640 acres is fine pasture and is used for such. This land can be easily sold, already enquiries are being made. The proceeds of the sale of the 1,500 acres of ranching land at Morley, will go a long way towards putting up the necessary buildings.\n\n5th.-The Red Deer Institute is closed, waiting a decision on this question. The option runs out on the purchase of land selected, October 15th., which requires that a decision must be made without delay.\n\nThe general board of Missions of the Methodist Church, meet during the first week in October.\n\nIf you will give this your immediate and favorable consideration, and inform me at Toronto, before the 7th of October, you will greatly oblige.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Ferrier\nSeptember 18th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nIn Mr. Scott's absence I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing option on some land in the vicinity of Edmonton which it is proposed should be utilized as a site for our new industrial school.\n\nMr. Scott is absent from the city and will not return until the 1st October when your communication will be brought to his attention. I may state that Mr. Graham's report has not yet come to hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nPrincipal,\nBrandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\nIn accordance with your wishes expressed in letter of the 6th of August, I went to Edmonton on the 10th of the present month and met there the Rev. Ferrier, Rev. Woodward and Rev. Bannier who comprised a Board representing the Methodist Church, for the purpose of dealing with the matter of selecting a site for a new Boarding School to replace the one now situated four miles from the town of Red Deer.\n\nIn company with the above named Gentleman I visited three locations, two of which appeared to me as being very desirable sites for a school, but the one that appealed to me most was about 85 acres, which can be purchased for $70.00 per acre, a total of $60,000.00. It is situated on the Sturgeon River, eight miles from Edmonton; the soil is a rich black loam and judging from the grain stocks on this land and the adjoining farms, I can safely say the land is of the very best for grain raising. Part of this land is facing the Sturgeon River, which means a great deal when raising stock, which all Indian schools should do. I am told that water in wells is easily obtained; in fact there are two good wells now on the land. Situated on this land are several farm buildings amongst which are two fairly good dwellings which could be moved if necessary, to the site on which the school buildings will be erected. There is a considerable portion of this land covered with light scrub and poplar bluffs; this can be easily cleared off and the result would be the finest land imaginable. Of course there is a proportion of this land already under cultivation and the paved streets of the City of Edmonton come within four miles, which means a great deal.\n\nI did not visit any of the Reserves in the district for the purpose of looking into the matter of pupils for a school, should one be established, as I was familiar with conditions.\n\nD.S. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI visited the Red Deer Industrial School, in company with the above named Gentlemen. Here I saw a very fine farm of 480 acres, 400 of which were under cultivation. Some of the standing grain was as good as any I had seen anywhere this year. There is also a good section of farming land owned by the Government. The two main buildings of this School are simply unfit for habitation. It is difficult for me to go into full details, but I shall however mention a few. The floors are completely gone in most rooms; the walls and ceilings require complete renewing; the doors are all more or less broken; the windows are in bad shape. The building was poorly laid out in the first place, and from what I could find out it has been with difficulty that the work has been carried on for the past fifteen years.\n\nI am satisfied that if the Red Deer property is disposed of little or nothing will be obtained for the two main buildings, as they are worthless as they stand today. The only thing that could be done with them is to tear them down and save what material there is in them to reconstruct other buildings. The outside walls are the only part of them that is of any value whatever. I understand that nothing has been spent on these buildings for the last fifteen years, excepting what was actually necessary. In my opinion it would be economy to erect new buildings rather than to put the present ones in shape, so that they could be classed as up-to-date. In fact I doubt if this could be done, for as I said, we have only got the outside walls that are of any value whatever.\n\nThe principal's dwelling and two other small houses are not in bad shape, but this is all there is in the way of buildings that are of any value.\n\nI understand this property would readily sell for $55.00 to $60.00 per acre and that the Department have 15,000 acres set aside at Morley for school purposes that could be sold for $15.00 per acre. It seems to me the question of financing a new School for Edmonton could be easily arranged.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Edmonton is the proper place for an Indian Industrial School and not Red Deer.\n\nThe former\nThe former's place is about the centre of three large Agencies, where the children will be drafted. The latter is off to one side and the Indians will not send them long distances, which makes recruiting difficult.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCommissioner.\nAnd if you get that property, \nit will have been before the \noption expires.\n\nThey had hoped to have seen you \nyesterday when you were in the City. \nI've heard them say that you were fine \nand that I would let you know \nabout the activity of these parties \nin buying up land.\n\nWith best wishes, dear\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nF.S. McCall\nRev. J. Ferrier,\nBrandon, Man.,\nDear Bro. Ferrier:\n\nThere seems to be some activity in the section where the new Industrial Home is to be located. I was called into the office today and was told that the biggest concern in Canada was getting options or trackage right up and beyond when they have the option. They have approached the owner of the site you have and they also sent a representative in here. There is a rumor that the C.P.R. will take over the Edmonton & Deer wegen Road and early this week their CPR offices went north block out the road. Evidently something is doing...\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nSince writing you this morning I have received the enclosed letter from Mr. McCall. He is the principal of Alberta College North, and understands the value of lands throughout the vicinity of Edmonton. I enclose also a map of the city of Edmonton showing the location of the land in question. You will notice the railroad runs through one part of the land. There is a siding right on the property. This siding is eight miles from the Edmonton Post Office. There is no question in my mind that if we do not accept it before the option expires we will not be able to purchase it for $100.00 an acre. There is no waste land to the property. Some of it has considerable timber on it, but this does not diminish its value the land being number one. There should not be days' delay in securing it. If you have any legal firm doing your business in Edmonton it would be well to communicate with them immediately.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF GF\nOctober 8th, 1919.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Meighen -\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report received from Commissioner Graham dated 19th September on the project of removing the industrial school conducted by the Methodist Church at present located at Red Deer to a location to be chosen at Edmonton. In this connection I would refer you to my memorandum of July 25th last and to my letter to Commissioner Graham of August 6th. In the letter you will note that I followed your directions and informed Mr. Graham you were not disposed to favour the project at present. Notwithstanding that fact Mr. Graham has reported in favour of the change.\n\nHe condemns unreservedly the buildings at Red Deer and says they are simply unfit for habitation. He states that there is no doubt in his mind that Edmonton is the proper place for an industrial school and not Red Deer, and he finds the property which had been selected by the Church authorities, and upon which they have an option, is admirably adapted for the purposes of the school.\n\nI am now pleased to recommend that the change take place in the interests of this institution, and would propose to purchase the property from funds provided by Parliament for the educational work of the Methodist Church among the Indians. It will probably cost us $70,000.00 to erect a new building, but as against the total outlay, both for land and buildings, we have assets that will be worth at least $60,000.00. We own 1500 acres near the Stony Reserve, Morley for which we have been offered $15.00 an acre, and we ought to get at least $40,000.00 out of the Red Deer property. I would like your authority to investigate the title to this property and proceed with its purchase if that is satisfactory. The option expires on the 13th inst.\n\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\nOctober 10, 1919.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI hope that you have received the decision of the Minister re the Red Deer and Edmonton propositions and that the firm of land agents and your local advisors will be instructed to close this deal before Tuesday night next.\n\nThanking you for all your kind consideration to the requests I placed before you on my recent visit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[T.

We therefore enclose you herewith abstracts of title covering the lands in question showing the property now to be registered as indicated aforesaid, subject only to the mortgage to the National Trust Co., Ltd. You will notice that the abstract shows the mortgage at the original amount, namely, $18,000.00. We have paid the National Trust Co. the payment of principal and interest which matured on January 1st, amounting to $2365.00 and we enclose herewith the Trust Company's receipt for this amount. This leaves the mortgage standing as on the 1st January, 1920, at $16,000.00. We also enclose receipts for taxes for the current year, all taxes on the property being paid in full to December 31st, 1919.\n\nAs was pointed out to you by the writer, the Department were to pay to Mr. Hume interest on his equity\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.  \nJan. 23/20\n\nin this farm from the date of the expiration of the option until the actual date of payment. Your remittance covered interest only up to December 15th; there is consequently interest from December 15th to December 29th on the sum of $41,926.90, being Mr. Hume's equity, this interest amounting to $128.80. You will remember also the writer discussed with you the matter of fire insurance premium. There is an unearned premium on these policies which should be paid to Mr. Hume amounting to $40.00. The Department would therefore owe Mr. Hume the further sum of $168.80 on these adjustments.\n\nYou remitted to us to cover the payment of interest and principal on the mortgage, the sum of $2500.00; we disbursed from this sum, $2365.00, leaving a balance of $135.00 in hand, so that if the Department will remit to us the difference between $168.80 and $135., which we have on hand, or the net sum of $33.80, this will cover the adjustments with Mr. Hume.\n\nIf you desire a complete description of these lands, as shown upon the title, we will be pleased to have same prepared and forwarded to you. In the meantime you are no doubt aware that the Duplicate Certificate of Title to the property, although issued in the name of His Majesty the King, as above set forth, will according to the Land Titles Act of this Province, remain in the Registrar's Office until the mortgage is discharged.\nDuncan C.

Church, Esq.,\n406 Tegler Building,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n827 Tegler Block,\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nDecember 1st, 1920.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:-\n\nYour No.114622, Dated Nov. 20th, 1920.\n\nI am in receipt of your communication re Mineral Rights on N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 12, Tp. 54, R. 25, W. 4th M., and also one from the Dominion Lands and Crown Timber Office, of Edmonton, dated Nov. 26th, 1920, dealing with my Application for a Lease of the Mineral Rights under the N.W. \u00bc of Sec. 11, Tp. 54, R. 25, W. 4th M.\n\nFrom the aforementioned communications, it would appear that the mining rights under this area are not available. It is not apparent to me whether this is a ruling generally applied to all lands held by the Department for Industrial School purposes, or whether this particular case has been considered on its merits.\n\nI am venturing to set forth conditions which would arise if a lease were granted and the mineral worked in the hopes that you will bring the matter up for special consideration by this Department.\n\n1. It is believed that a coal seam 12 feet thick underlies the area at a depth of 147 feet.\n\n2. Such a seam economically worked would produce 8,600 tons of merchantable coal per acre, yielding at the Royalty exacted exacted by the Department of the Interior, viz: 5\u00a2 per ton, $432.00 per acre.\n\n3. Systematic working of such a seam would not result in spoiling the surface for agricultural purposes by the causing of breaks or holes due to subsidence, but would result in the lowering of the surface without breaking.\n\n4. Any buildings proposed, or existing, can be protected against any subsidence by the leaving of pillars in their vicinity.\n\n5. Should the Department see its way to granting me a lease, I am prepared to undertake the following, in addition to paying Royalty:\n(a) A payment of the market value per acre of the surface considered as farm land, for each acre under which coal is mined as and when such occurs.\n\n(b) Should any holes occur as the result of mine workings, a payment per acre so damaged of four times the value of the surface as farm lands.\n\n(c) Should any scholars of the Industrial School desire instruction in mining, etc., to employ same at the regular wage obtaining in the Edmonton Field.\n\nFrom the foregoing it may be seen that owing to its peculiar situation this School may become more than self-supporting, in fact make sufficient out of the mineral to equip it in any manner desirable without prejudice to the site.\n\nI shall esteem it a favor if you will be good enough to consider these points at your leisure and communicate further with me.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames A.

Under an old right the mineral rights go with the title on the river lot and also the quarter, but this law does not hold for the main section. The other day I heard a rumor that coal mining operations were to be commenced at Campbell, which is where we are located. Now the well log gives us an eleven foot seam of coal at a depth of 135 feet, and it is possible that mining operations would be profitable for us at some future date. I would suggest that the Department protect its interests in this matter and if possible take steps to secure the mineral rights on this property. I am not very thoroughly acquainted with law in this matter and it is possible that being owned by the crown carries its own rights. This however will draw your attention to the matter. I would also suggest that you take the coal mining proposition up with Mr. Graham and Mr. Ferrier when they are in Ottawa.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. H.

Abbott & McLaughlin,\nBarristers, etc.,\n702 McLeod Building,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nsome predecessor in title. As you searched the title of this land for the Department when it was purchased would you be good enough to advise the Department as to whether Mr. Hume conveyed all his right title and interest in the said property to the Department, or whether the reservation as to the two parcels above referred to originated with himself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I noticed that there is registered against the property a \"MACHINISTS LIEN\" by C.H.Rodarmel, the well driller for $771.10, the balance which he says is due him from the well contract. I asked the clerk in charge if the Department had been notified of this lien and he said no notice had been given. Under the circumstance I thought it my duty to inform you of this fact.\n\nRegarding the seats in the class room at Red Deer:- is it the wish of the Department that these seats be moved to Edmonton. Or will new ones be purchased when the new school is opened? I am working at further statements in regard to last year's operations. I have now everything pretty well in order.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.

In our letter of December 3rd, 1919 particular note was made of this reservation, and it was impossible for Mr. Hume to convey the rights inasmuch as they had been reserved prior to his title.\n\nYours truly,\n\nABBOTT & McLAUGHLIN,\n\nA/T.

If it is convenient I would be glad to have you examine this title after the expiration of thirty days, giving Mr. Rodarmel a few days' grace, and advise the Department as to whether Mr. Rodarmel has complied with the request of the Department.\n\nThe matter of the seats in the class room, as referred to in the last paragraph of your letter, will be dealt with under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I told Mr. J.F.

Woodsworth\nPrincipal\nIndustrial School\nOttawa, 23rd December, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Rodarmel's claim for $772.00 being the balance of his account for drilling the well on the site of the Indian Industrial School near St. Albert, in the Province of Alberta, as referred to in his letter, hereunder, of the 19th October, I have to say that I do not think that we can successfully resist payment thereof. It appears from the information on file that on account of defective piping the lower part of the well is jammed with casing and earth with which Mr. Rodarmel struggled for five weeks to clear before giving up. The drilling contract provides that \"due and reasonable allowance shall be made for faulty material supplied by the owner.\" Principal Woodsworth, who had this matter in hand, after reviewing the circumstances recommends that Mr. Rodarmel be paid on the basis of 525 feet. I would also recommend the payment of this account, $771.10, which will be found on file 522194-5A, dated October 9th, 1920.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAppr. Del\nOttawa, 24th December, 1921.\n\nRevd. Sir,\n\nI beg to transmit herewith Mr C.H. Rodermal's account of $771.10 being balance of claim for services in drilling a well on the site of the Indian Industrial School near St. Albert, Alberta. The Department, I may say, has decided to make payment in Mr Rodermal's favour in satisfaction of this claim, but before doing so desires that you will be good enough to certify the account as correct. Kindly return the account duly certified at once, in order that there may be no delay in sending forward a cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd J.F.

H. Rodarmel.\n\nIn doing so I wish to refer you to my letter of October 22nd 1920. Conditions remain about the same as when this letter was written. We are getting a sufficient supply of water for our present needs, which comes I suppose from the depth of 168 feet where the casing was dynamited. What the well will do after the school is opened we of course do not know. Just how far the casing was to blame for the wreck of the well and just how far Rodarmel failed to use good judgment is of course a matter pretty difficult to decide. With these reservations I sign the accounts.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe statement given below shows the amount that will become due and payable on your Mortgage on the 2nd day of January 1925 and we wish at this time to impress upon you the necessity of providing for payment promptly on the date mentioned.\n\nYou may have insistent demands from others for the settlement of various accounts, but do not lose sight of the fact that this mortgage is the first registered charge against your land and the interest takes priority over all other debts. We are calling your attention to this matter now so that you may make proper provision for the payment of the amount due.\n\nTaxes must be paid promptly and receipts forwarded to us with your remittance as provided for under the terms of the Mortgage.\n\n| Item                  | Amount       |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Principal             | $14,000.00   |\n| Interest on $14,000.00| @ 6% 2/1/22 | $1120.00 |\n| Arrears of Interest   | $            |\n| Insurance             | $            |\n| Taxes                 | $            |\n| Costs                 | $3.00        |\n| E. & O.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nCanada's Greatest Natural Resource\n\nAlberta Tar Sands\n\nUnlimited Supply\n\nInstructions for Using Alberta Bituminous or Tar Sands\n\nFOR SIDEWALKS, STABLES, FLOORS, ETC.\n\n1. The Bituminous Sands should be heated to about 300 degrees and mixed with an equal amount of gravel and sand or crushed stone. The proper heat can be easily determined. At first, the mass is sticky, but when it spreads easily like soft mortar, it is ready for use.\n\n2. The heating can be done on a \u00bc\u201d or \u215c\u201d iron sheet by raising it about one foot off the ground and building a wood fire under it.\n\n3. The gravel and sand or crushed stone should be spread on the plate and the tar sands piled on top. As the mass becomes heated, it should be turned with a shovel the same as concrete.\n\n4. Care should be taken not to over-heat the tar sand or let it take fire.\n\n5. An old consolidated cinder or gravel walk is an ideal base on which to spread the tar sands.\n\n6. For light traffic sidewalks, cellar floors, etc., the mixture should be spread about \u00bd\u201d thick, raked even and then rolled with a 250 to 300 pound iron roller. This will leave the wearing surface \u00bc\u201d thick. For heavy traffic sidewalks, stable floors, etc., the wearing surface should be spread about 2\u201d thick.\n\n7. For mixing a small quantity of the material, an old steel scraper could be used for the heating.\n\n8. Farmers will find the Tar Sands excellent for floors of horse and cow stalls and granary floors. Mice and rats will not eat through it, and the alkali soils or the ammonia of stables do not injure it as they do concrete.\n\n9. It can be patched easily, or broken up, heated and re-laid. This Alberta Natural Resource is, by its elasticity and resistance of chemical action, especially suited to Alberta soils and climate.\n\n10. We also manufacture a Tar Sand heated and mixed by which the tar sands and gravel or crushed stone are mixed hot and can be laid cold.\n\nMcMurray Asphaltum and Oil Limited\nLegislators Inspect Tar-Sand Deposits\n\nALBERTA SOLONS ARE IMPRESSED WITH UNDEVELOPED WEALTH\n\nSufficient asphalt sand lies in Athabasca district to pave every road in Canada, geologist says.\n\nScientists endeavor to place development on paying basis.\n\nMEMBERS of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta have completed an inspection tour through the tar-sand districts of the far-northern section of that province. The trip was made over the Alberta and Great Waterways line as far as the town of Waterways, where the legislators were deeply impressed by the possibilities for developing the oil district after viewing several experimental stations in operation where efforts are being made to add to Canada's crude oil supply and to develop cheap and dependable asphalt for good roads throughout Canada, particularly for the prairie provinces.\n\nThe raw materials with which experiments have been carried on are the famous Athabasca tar-sands\u2014that undefined but assuredly immense deposit of petroleum-impregnated sandstone lying for hundreds of miles along the Athabasca River and its tributaries.\n\nOwing to the difficulties of exploration through a muskeg country, the extent of these tar sand deposits has never been accurately determined. There are indications, however, that the tar sand area extends over 400 miles from east to west; while from north to south there are outcroppings for a distance of 150 miles.\n\nIt is claimed that in the Athabasca district there is sufficient asphalt sand to pave every highway in Canada and to leave a great deal of the material for export. It is further stated, on no less an authority than the word of Dr. J. O. Hosworth, the British petroleum geologist, that the crude oil content of the tar sand deposits, if it could be extracted on a commercial basis, would be sufficient to meet the world's needs for at least 200 years, at the present rate of consumption.\n\nThere has always been, however, the apparently insurmountable difficulty of getting the crude oil out of the tar sands.\n\nWas Once Huge Oil Field\n\nThe Athabasca district is not a normal oil field, despite the vast amount of oil it still contains. It consists of a fault that it was once a huge oil field; but that by some means\u2014glacial erosion, probably, in the great ice age that once prevailed over most of Canada\u2014the large rock covering the oil deposits was scraped away, and now lies, leaving the oil sands themselves exposed. In the thousands of years since then, the lighter constituents of the crude oil have evaporated, leaving an impure bed of sandstone saturated with bituminous asphalt oil.\n\nFor many years efforts have been made to develop the tar sand deposits. First, oil operators tried drilling, as in any other oil field; but though oil was met at comparatively shallow depths, the oil which was heavy and viscous. Later, a great many experimenters worked on processes for separating the crude oil from the bituminous sand, or for separating both the oil and bitumen from the sand.\n\nMany of these processes were scientifically workable. That is, they succeeded in extracting the crude oil, or the asphalt, as the case might be. The difficulty was that they were too expensive to operate on a commercial scale. The finished product which was got than it was worth.\n\nA couple of years ago, Thomas Draper, of Petrolia, Ont., came forward as a practical oil man and a manufacturer of asphalt. He had a relatively small plant producing asphalt from the tar sands, and he started a larger plant, which was successful at Edmonton, Alta., and Great Waterways, and Great Waterways district with the result that he was interested in the development of the Athabasca district.\n\nIn 1922, extracts were made from the tar sands at Edmonton, and a small plant was also installed at Great Waterways, and Great Waterways district with the result that he was interested in the development of the Athabasca district.\n\nThe cost of mining the tar sand and transporting it to the extraction plant; and it may be said that the plant is now operating on something approaching a commercial scale, though it is still necessary to develop a market for the output.\n\nProcess In Operation\n\nIn the plant at Waterways, two processes can be operated. One of these separates the oils from the other material; the other extracts the asphaltum. By the first named process, when the bitumen gravity is obtained, yielding 5 per cent, gasoline, 3.25 per cent, kerosene, 2.5 per cent, light gas oil, 15.625 per cent, medium gas oil, 43.75 per cent, lubricating oil and 20 per cent, refined asphalt. There is a small amount of wax, a trifle over 1 per cent.\n\nOwing to the small percentage of the lighter constituents and the presence of sulphur, the crude oil is not the most satisfactory for producing gasoline or kerosene; but the bitumen oil stands an excellent chance to be an excellent product for use in cold climates. It does not congeal at 20 below zero.\n\nThe asphaltum process gives a much larger yield of merchantable product, ranging from 15 to 25 per cent, of the raw tar sand. It is to all intents and purposes similar to the Trinidad asphalt, which, with that of California, is now imported into Canada in large quantities. Incidentally, though there are other known sources of asphalt in Canada, the Athabasca deposits contain more asphalt than the Trinidad and California deposits combined.\n\nNaturally, if an abundance of cheap asphalt can be produced in Alberta, that fact will mean a lot for road building programs, at least in the northern part of the province; and if satisfactory freight rates can be secured, the Athabasca product should ultimately displace the imported asphalt throughout the Dominion.\n\nSand Coated With Asphalt\n\nHowever, besides these possibilities, there is a likelihood of utilizing the tar sands in their natural state for road making. Every grain of sandstone is coated with an asphalt film which cannot be deducted by any mechanical mix. For thousands of years, the asphalts oils have been soaking into the sandstone deposits of northern Alberta; and while exploration and seepage have taken off the lighter constituents of the oil, the asphalt has coated every grain of sand.\n\nIn the laying of asphalt pavements, the refined asphalt is heated and mixed with sand and gravel in certain proportions by mechanical means; but in the tar sand deposits the work has been already done by nature; and all that is necessary is to heat the tar sand and roll it.\n\nExperimental pavements constructed of the raw tar sand, thus treated, have been laid at Edmonton, as well as pavements of asphalt and other materials in various proportions. It is hoped in this way to find out the best method of utilizing the tar sands.\n\nOf course even a bulky product such as the raw tar sand, after a certain distance freight rates would become prohibitive. But within the low freight rate zone it is believed the raw tar sands will be the favorite material for paving, while at a greater distance Athabasca is prepared to supply refined asphalt. Both methods not merely help to solve the good roads problem but develop an important, valuable, but heretofore neglected asset of the Dominion.\n\nTar sand development work is yet in its infancy. The hills all along the river carry millions of dollars worth of potential wealth in tar sands. With the oil-fields of the world being drained daily to meet the ever-growing demand for more and still more oil, there must some day be created a demand for all the oil which some hitherto unsolved commercial process will eventually secure from those hills of unmounted wealth.\nThe Relation of Alberta Tar Sands to Modern Road Construction\n\nAlberta Bituminous Sands for Rural Roads\n\nNature has mixed the bituminous binder of the Alberta Tar Sands in a manner which it is practically impossible to duplicate mechanically, and each grain of sand has been impregnated with the bitumen by Nature's hand. Nature works surely, slowly and with definite purpose, and when working in this case did its work uniformly. However, while each and every grain has been impregnated with a film of asphaltum, it is necessary to add more sand or gravel to the mixture when using, according to the type of work being done, but the tar sands in their natural state can be handled and mixed in as small or as large a quantity as is required.\n\nHitherto, the chief research work in connection with these sands has been along the line of extracting the bituminous content, and adapting the same to commercial purposes. No real experiments as to the value of the tar sands in the raw state for road surfacing have been entered into, with the exception of an experiment made in 1915, when a small piece of pavement was laid of this material on Kinnaird St. in Edmonton, and this experimental piece of pavement, although subjected to heavy traffic, has stood up well and is still in excellent condition.\n\nThe Kinnaird Street Experiment\n\nHere, pavement made of raw Alberta Tar Sands, to which the proper admixture of sand and gravel was added, was laid down in 1915. Today, despite years of traffic, some eight years in all, that pavement is just as good as when it was laid. It has stood the test of traffic, the test of weather, the test of climatic extremes, of frost, snow and summer heat, and is as good today as the day it was laid.\n\nTherefore, it can safely be assumed that these tar sands are adaptable for road use in their raw state, if the cost of transportation of the same from the bed to the road can be overcome along commercial lines.\n\nValue of Tar Sands in Road Construction\n\nThis article deals with the question of using the raw tar sands as a binding material for the rural roads and main highways of Alberta, and it is from this point of view that their use is being suggested and discussed. Experiments are at the present time being conducted to extract the asphaltum content on commercial lines, but when the following information, facts and figures concerning the commercial use of these sands is digested, it will be readily seen that the most feasible line along which these sands can be quickly adapted for use commercially, is along the line of road surfacing. It is true that there are no other known sources of asphaltum in Canada outside of this deposit, and that in consequence millions of tons of asphaltum are imported each year from Trinidad and California, this notwithstanding the fact that we have, in the hills of Northern Alberta, more asphalt than the combined resources of Trinidad and California. When the process of extraction of both asphaltum and oils from these enormous deposits is more fully developed, it will be a straight manufacturing proposition, and it is to be hoped that the day is not far distant when the development of methods of extraction will serve to bring the production of asphaltum and oils on as sure a basis as wheat or steel, but until that day arrives, the most logical use to which the tar sands of Northern Alberta can be put to, is the surfacing of roads with the raw or treated sands, to which other sand or stone has been added to make the proper spreading content.\n\nThe Exhibition Experiments\n\nThrough Mr. Thos. Drayton, Manager of the McMurray Asphaltum and Oils Limited, who are developing these sands for their oil content at the present time and are emphatic as to the\nfact their interests lie more in this direction than in the use of the raw tar sands for road surfacing, it has been possible to make further experiments in connection with road surfacing with these tar sands. During each day of the Exhibition, pieces of road were surfaced in the presence of many representative men and bodies, the whole of the laying, preparing and completion being done with the crudest of tools, and all present were convinced that these tar sands are adaptable to Alberta's road problem, as a proper surfacing material for the hard clay base that obtains in dry years.\n\nIn these experiments Mr. Draper received the co-operation of the Huff Gravel Co., Ltd., of Edmonton, who supplied the necessary gravel and sands.\n\nThese experiments were made in the following form: A sidewalk 100 feet long and twelve feet wide was laid as an approach to the Manufacturer's Building. The thickness of this sidewalk was \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inches, and although there was no attempt to compete as to cost of construction with other forms of pavement, the actual cost of laying the yardage with the crudest of tools was only $1.50 per square yard. This surfacing is heavier by half an inch than the ordinary sidewalk surfacing used on city streets, and if it was laid at the lighter thickness, the cost should not exceed $1.00 per square yard, leaving a good profit for the contractor. A contractor who witnessed the experiment at the end of the week, after seeing the way this piece and other pieces had stood up under the heavy traffic of the fair crowds, especially the piece across the main road, where constant traffic of motor vehicles and heavy trucks had occurred, said, \"We contractors intend to use this stuff hereafter, we are concrete men, but we simply have to use this material, because it is cheaper laid, and so to live we must use it. Already,\" he added, \"we have some thousands of yards of sidewalks and small work to lay for various people, who have decided upon these sands for approaches to houses, and other purposes.\"\n\nThe Exhibition Experiments\u2014Rolling the Tar Sands After Laying\n\nExperiments Prove Utility\n\nThe various experiments made proved to the satisfaction of all present the fact that provided the raw tar sands could be landed on the job at a reasonable cost their use for road surfacing in Alberta was possible, and that the using of them would without a doubt improve the chances for road extension on permanent lines in Alberta. These experiments were witnessed by Lt. Governor Brett, Hon. H. Greenfield, Premier of Alberta; Hon. Chas. Stewart, Minister of the Interior; Hon. Alex Ross, Minister of Highways; Hon. Vernon Smith, Minister of Railways; J. A. Dalrymple, Vice-Pres. C. N. R.; A. E. Warren, Gen. Manager Western Lines; D. C. Coleman, Vice-Pres. Canadian Pacific Rly.; Geo. Stevens, Freight Traffic...\nin the ordinary way asphalt is mixed with other ingredients, mostly sand, it would therefore appear that there would be no saving in extracting the asphaltum and shipping that in preference to shipping the sands in the raw state, for, as previously stated, in the latter case the sands have been thoroughly impregnated by Nature with the asphaltum content in a manner it is impossible to do by mechanical means, in fact, it seems as if Nature has given us a perfect road surface mixture. This mixing of the raw material with the necessary amount of more sand, clay or gravel is governed entirely by the class of work required.\n\nWatching the Process of Laying the Tar Sand Pavement\n\nA Class Examination of the Pavement Fifteen Minutes After Laying\n\n(1) Mr. Theo. Draper explaining the process to (2) Hon. H. Greenfield, Premium of Alberta; (3) H. Ramsford, Manager of the Dominion Bank of Canada; (4) Hon. A. Ross, Minister Public Works; (5) C. H. Grant, C.

Stutchbury, Trade Commissioner, Alberta Govt.; (13) John Blue, Secretary Board of Trade; (14) R. Huff; (15) F. MacMillan; Mayor Duggan.\n\nsuggested co-operation between the city and the province in the laying of an experimental stretch of road with this material.\n\nCost of Transportation\n\nTransportation from the fields at McMurray by rail over the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway, a Government owned line, to Edmonton is the main feature that enters into the commercial use of these sands.\n\nAs the refined products, if used for road building and pavement, would have to be mixed\n\nAn Important Feature\n\nPresent indications point to the fact that tar sands will enter largely into the construction of the permanent roads of Alberta in the future, and it may, therefore, be wise to discuss the conditions under which such should be laid down to get the best results. The first and most important feature that must be considered is drainage, which applies equally to roads no matter what material is used in construction. Local materials can always be used as foundation for tar sand surfacing, even clay, which abounds all over Alberta may be used as\na mixture if dried and ground, which can be done on the spot where it is excavated while the road is being built.\n\nThe drying and grinding of clay is an easy matter in Alberta where in nearly every part either seams of coal or wood abound for fuel.\n\nWherever there is gravel no difficulty is anticipated in using tar sands, as the experiments at the Exhibition, where roads and side walks which were thoroughly tested afterwards by traffic, were laid on practically no foundation at all except the natural flooring, proved its utility.\n\nResults of Actual Tar Sand Road Construction in the United States\n\nThe Kentucky Rock Asphalt Company, of Louisville, Ky., have been using the low grade asphalt rock (tar sands) for many years in the surfacing of roads. It has been used in its raw state and the quality has been of a much lower grade than that of the Northern Alberta material, and, unlike Alberta sands, it will not stand mixing with other aggregates.\n\nAll of the railways in the district in which this material is used issue special low freight tariff rates covering the movement of this material, and it has been transported for use in its raw state, as far as 750 miles from the source of production. The railway company quote rates on this material to the following States: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nIts Use on United States Highways\n\nParts of the Lincoln National Highway, the Dixie National Highway and many other of the leading trunk roads in the Central and Southern States are surfaced with this material and practically in every case the best wearing satisfaction in the carrying of the enormous traffic these highways are subjected to, has been obtained.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe vast quantities of raw material lying within rail distance of practically every part of Alberta, its cheapness delivered on the job, its durability as a surface covering, the ease and economy with which it can be handled, and the fact that successful experiments and tests have proved its adaptability, although made with the crudest of tools and under conditions just as crude, appears to prove that Alberta has all the material within the Province for road building, and careful further consideration will without a doubt be given to its commercial use.\n\nEditor's Note\u2014The facts contained in this article are commended to the attention of all interested in better roads for Alberta, all interested in the economical laying down of roads, streets and pavements in cities and towns of Alberta, both from a permanent point of view and from the view point of economy. It is suggested that the City of Edmonton give the matter of using Alberta Ave. with these products serious consideration as without a doubt their use will prove that Alberta in addition to its wheat fields, its dairy lands, its coal lands, its mineral lands, has also a vast field of the best of road surfacing material which all Canada will eventually use. Why send asphalt rollers to Trinidad, when they can come to Alberta just as well.\nPort Huron, Mich., April 11, 1928.\n\nANSWERING YOURS OF Re paving sidewalks with Alberta Tar Sands at Indian Residential School, Edmonton.\n\nMr. R.

April 26th, 1934.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa; Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI have been directed by the Council of this Municipal District of Ray No. 549 to draw your attention to the serious difficulty which this Municipality has encountered in the matter of road maintenance which has been brought about by the large amount of traffic between the Indian Industrial School and the City of Edmonton. There appears to be a continuous traffic from the said school which is located on Section 11-54-25-4 to the pavement at the Edmonton Dunvegan Yards, a distance of some five miles. As this road is only a clay surfaced road it is almost impossible to maintain it. The tax-payers of the Municipality who have to pay for the cost of maintenance of a road which is continually being destroyed by the occupants of land not paying taxes creates an ill feeling which we believe should not exist.\n\nOur Council request in this connection is that your Department surface the said road with gravel, in asking for this, the District considers that it is only fair that your Department should contribute its fair share to the cost of maintaining this road.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your favorable consideration and that you will be able to appreciate the difficulties\nMay 14, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter sent in by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Municipal District of Ray No 549 requesting that assistance be given towards the improvement of a road leading to the Edmonton I. R. School, on a distance of some five miles, which speaks for itself.\n\nWill you please investigate this request as early as convenient, and advise me whether the matter should be given any consideration by the department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1109-1-9 of the 4th instant and note that the Secretary-Treas. of the Municipal District of Ray, No. 549, had written to the Department requesting that assistance be given towards the improvement of a road leading to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, a distance of 5 miles. This matter has received my attention and I wish to report as follows: The road in question is as a rule in very bad shape and more or less the grade has sunk down to the level of the ground, and as there is considerable traffic on this road it is generally very rough.\n\nWhat the Municipality proposes is that they place the grade in first class shape according to Government Standard, Secondary road. This will cost approximately $5000.00. Then, they expect our Department to gravel the road which would cost as follows; according to an estimate furnished by the Reeve of the Municipality: Gravel from city pit - 3645 cubic yards @ 50\u00a2 = $1822.50; Hauling - $3554.00; or a total of $5376.50. They figure the cost of this should be born by our Department as the school uses the highways probably more than the farmers. In other words, putting this five miles in first class shape would constitute an expenditure of over $10,000.00. After that, as far as I know, the Provincial Government would maintain the road. The question now is, are our Department prepared to spend this amount of money? I believe the Department were probably under the impression that it would take just a few hundred dollars to put the road in proper shape. I shall be glad to know what view the Department take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\n\nM.

The grade of this road which is formed of clay soil is reported to be in continuous need of repair owing to the heavy and constant traffic over it between the City and the Residential School.\n\nThe reason for this request is that the cost of its upkeep up to the present has been at the sole charge of the Municipality.\n\nUpon submitting this request to Inspector Christianson for a report the Department is advised that the above mentioned road is as a rule in a very bad condition on account of the heavy traffic over it, and that the suggestion of the Municipality in this case would be that the department undertake the graveling of the road after it has been graded by the Municipality in accordance with the Provincial Government specification for secondary roads, which work would entail an expenditure on their part of approximately $5,000.\n\nIt is estimated that the department's share, that is the surfacing of the road with gravel, would cost approximately $5,376.50. It is presumed that if the road was improved in the manner described above the Provincial government would take charge of its future maintenance.\n\nI may say that no provision has been made in this year's estimates for such an expenditure, and there are no funds from which a grant of the nature applied for could be paid, and that it is not the policy of the Department to contribute towards construction or maintenance of roads outside Indian Reserves.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nJune 15, 1934\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th of April requesting some assistance from this department towards the improving of a road from the City of Edmonton to the Edmonton Indian Residential School, on a distance of some five miles, which road you state is always in need of repair on account of the heavy and continuous traffic over it.\n\nIn reply I regret to say that it is not the policy of the department to contribute towards construction or maintenance of roads outside Indian reserves. However, the department might consider contributing towards the improvement of that portion of the road within the boundary of the school farm, and I writing today to obtain an estimate of the cost of this work in order that the matter may be given further consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

This does seem to constitute a real grievance if his statements are correct. His suggestion is that the land be resold if not required by the school management, in order that it can become taxable for rural school purposes.\n\nWould you be good enough to make enquiries and ascertain if his complaint is justified.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

This land may be briefly described as:\n\n1. N.E. \u00bc Sec.11, T.54, R.25, W.4th, 159 acres more or less, excepting 1.6 acres for roadway and 7.19 acres for railway.\n\n2.

River Lot 56, St. Albert Settlement, T.54, R.25, W.4th, containing 258 acres more or less, excepting 4.01 acres for roadway.\n\nAs the title to the above land is in the Crown, it is exempt from provincial and municipal taxation. Reports received from the Principal indicate that 500 acres are under cultivation, and, as there is a large herd of cattle and a number of horses, the Department understands that the balance of the land is being used for grazing purposes.\n\nThe Department has not granted any authority to rent any of this land, nor are we aware that it has been rented without our approval.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Edmonton is being written and requested to advise the Department at once whether or not any of the land at the Edmonton Residential School is rented.

The Department has received a complaint that a portion of this land is not being operated by the school management but has been rented for some time.\n\nThe Department has no information concerning the rental of any portion of this land. I would request that you submit a report, as soon as possible, stating if the whole of the above quantity of land is being utilized for farming purposes in connection with the school or if any part of it is being rented and, if so, upon whose authority. You should state, also, the name of the person to whom rental is made, the acreage rented, the amount of the rental and to whom paid. The information that a portion of this land is being rented is a surprise to the Department.

The Principal, the Rev. Mr J.F. Woodsworth informs me that owing to the fact that most of the big boys who were attending his school have left and as he did not have a staff large enough to work all the land under cultivation he found it necessary to make some arrangements last year to ensure having sufficient feed for the school stock and also to keep the land under cultivation, after giving the situation careful thought he decided that the best thing to do would be to rent part of the land on a crop share basis. On April 1st, 1934 Mr Woodsworth drew up an agreement with Mr William Davidson and Mr Alfred Latimer of Edmonton, to rent 275 acres on a crop share basis, both of these men are farmers living near the school, the agreement with Mr Davidson and Mr Latimer was that the school management should have full control over the land rented, having the rights to stipulate what crops should be grown each year and how much should be summer fallowed. The school management to furnish one half of all seed required, purchase one half of the binder twine and pay one half of the cost of threshing, and retain the right to buy all the grain these two men would have for sale out of their share of the crop, also all their share of the green feed, and the school to receive two thirds of the straw. The agreement also calls for the school threshing outfit to be used to thresh the grain, this being done to guard against any weed seeds being carried on the land. Mr Woodsworth informed me that the school purchased grain and green feed to the value of approximately $1,000.00 being part of Mr Davidson and Mr Latimer's share of the crop grown on the 275 acres of school lands.\n\nI wish to state that out of the 855 acres of farm land connected with the school 550 acres are under cultivation the balance being used for pasture. I was not aware until today that any part of this land had been rented and to the best of my knowledge no authority has been given to the school management to rent any part of the land by any official of the Department.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.C. Leight\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFARMING:\n\nThe school owns approximately 55 acres of land, all fenced, 550 acres of which is under cultivation, including gardens and the school grounds. The Principal informed me that he had leased between 275 and 300 acres of the cultivated land on shares to two neighbouring farmers. The farmers in question are Wm. Davidson and Alfred Latimer, and the arrangements between them and the school are on the usual crop-share basis. The school authorities reserve the right to determine what land is to be farmed and summer-fallowed each year, and the threshing machine belonging to the school is to be used in threshing the crop. Mr. Woodsworth also reserves the right to purchase green feed or any grain he requires for the school from the farmers who are working the land. The reason given me for entering into this agreement with the outside farmers was that all of the older boys had been discharged from the school and they did not have the staff to handle the land in question. The balance of the land under cultivation was handled by the school staff and boys. The farm work at this institution is carried on in a very satisfactory manner and the work on the land is always well performed, as I have seen the summer-fallows several times during the summer.\nMarch 9, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to my memorandum dated February 25th, last, with reference to the Honourable Charles Stewart's letter to you of the 18th ultimo, regarding the leasing of a portion of the Edmonton Indian Residential School lands, I attach hereto copy of a report just received from Mr. G.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Laight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton,\nAlta.\nMarch 26, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of your report of the 9th instant (your File 403-11 A.U.), on your recent inspection of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, regarding the farming operations and the lease, by the Principal, on a share basis, of a portion of the school land.\n\nThe leasing of the land was brought to the attention of The Honourable the Minister in a private communication - this being the first intimation received - the Department having no knowledge that the Principal had part of the school land under lease. We requested Mr. Agent Leight to interview the Principal and submit a report. His reply, setting forth the terms of the lease, is along the lines mentioned in your report.\n\nWhile the terms included in the lease appear reasonable from the school standpoint, yet, the Principal was wrong in assuming to rent any portion of the land, which he had no authority to do.\n\nUnder the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931, it is necessary that any rental obtained from lease of Government land be forwarded for deposit to the credit of the Receiver General, and the school would not financially benefit. The Principal has placed himself in the position where he could be called upon to refund any proceeds accruing from the rental of the land last year.\n\nI would request that you visit the school at your earliest opportunity and investigate the whole matter. The Department is opposed to the renting, on any terms, of land used in connection with Indian residential schools. If the Principal, in the interest of the school, requires to utilize the full quantity of land for farming purposes, he should engage sufficient help to farm all the land. I suggest that you carefully study the situation in order to ascertain whether it is necessary, from a departmental standpoint, to retain such a large area for the use of the school. If it is considered advisable to lease any portion of the school lands, it must be done by a formal lease from the Superintendent General, in which case the lessee would be liable to be assessed and taxed by the municipality in respect of his interest in the said lands during the term of the lease.\n\nYou should enquire if the Principal cannot obtain the necessary staff to utilize all the land for farming and grazing purposes. If not, would you recommend that the portion not required be sold, and, if the latter, state if there would be any sale for same at the present time and the approximate price per acre that could be obtained. After your visit, please furnish the Department with a full report.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Leight that this matter has been placed in your hands.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nC a l g a r y, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\nPB CALGARY, Alta., April 23rd, 1935.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 403-11A-H, also to date of the 26th ultimo regarding the leasing of some school land by Mr. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I was in Edmonton last week, and while there went out to the school and discussed this matter thoroughly with the Principal.\n\nI advised Mr. Woodsworth that this land had been leased contrary to the regulations of the Department and that the lease would have to be cancelled or the Department would take over the land, and either lease it or sell it. The Principal at first resented this attitude, and advised me that he was going to wire to the Church authorities in Toronto, which I informed him he was quite at liberty to do. What the Principal really dreaded was to face the lessees, as the arrangements made with the two neighbouring farmers called for a 3-year lease, and it had only run one year, and he was afraid they would demand some recompense. One thing I made clear to the Principal was that if the land was required it would have to be worked by the school and not by any of the neighbouring farmers; and I quite agree with him that to take care of their feed requirements, etc., the land is actually required by the school. I see no reason why it could not be handled by that institution without any lease.\n\nMr. Woodsworth finally asked me if I would assist him in settling the matter with the lessees and I stated that I was quite prepared to do what I could. He sent over for the two lessees and the matter was finally settled without any difficulty whatever: The two men in question were quite reasonable and when I left, after having spent a whole day in dealing with this matter, everyone concerned seemed to be quite satisfied, and the land in question will be worked by the school. Mr. Woodsworth informed me that the lease was only a temporary arrangement as most of the boys at the school were small and not able to do much work on the farm, but it had been his intention to take the land back at the end of the three years. The amount of grain threshed on this lease last year was about 7000 bushels of wheat, oats and barley, of which 50% belonged to the school. Besides this, practically all the lessees' share of the grain was purchased by the School.\n\nI trust we will have no more difficulty in this connection in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I hope, as stated by you, that there will be no further difficulty in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSgd O.S. Williams\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nM.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Murphy:\n\nRE: INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nEDMONTON - CONTRACT WITH DAVIDSON\n& LATIMER\n\nI wired you today as follows:\n\n\"WOODSWORTH PRINCIPAL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL EDMONTON\nMADE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THREE YEARS FROM APRIL EIGHTEENTH\nTHIRTY FOUR WITH TWO FARMERS TO WORK THREE HUNDRED ACRES\nSCHOOL LANDS ON TERMS STOP ON EIGHTEENTH CHRISTIANSON\nNOTIFIED THEM VACATE CLAIMING WOODSWORTH UNAUTHORIZED MEN\nCANNOT MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS NOW URGE CONTINUANCE CON-\nTRACT THIS YEAR WRITING\"\n\nI have before me the typed original agreement,\ndated April 14th, 1934, regarding the cropping and cultivation\nof the lands of the above school being Section 12, Twp. 54,\nRge. 25, W4th. The agreement is signed on the 18th April,\n1934 by J. F. Woodsworth and the two farmers in question and is\nwitnessed. It is expressed as being \"to maintain and hold\ngood from the 18th day of April 1934 to the 18th day of\nApril 1937.\" Under its terms the two parties of the second\npart (Davidson and Latimer) agreed to cultivate the lands accord-\ning to three carefully drawn maps or plans, one for each year,\nin which the fields are plotted out and each field marked with\nthe acreage and crop and how it is to be treated. The culti-\nvated land in all is about 320 acres but there was a proviso\nenabling Mr. Woodsworth to withdraw and occupy and work himself\nor by the available labour of the school, small parcels amount-\ning one year to 40 acres and another year to 30 acres; but\nlast year only about 15 acres of land was withdrawn and worked by\nthe school, so that you may say the agreement covered 300 acres\nof cultivated land. The parties of the second part were to supply\none-half of the twine for harvesting the grain and the green-feed\nand pay one-half of the threshing expenses computed on the bushel-\nage threshed and the current rates, the reason for this being that\nthe school owned the threshing outfit, separate and tractor, and\nstipulated that the expenses of the threshing should be the regular\nthreshing charges and not the mere out-of-pocket expenses. The\nparties of the second part were to do all the work, including\ncutting, stocking and stacking as well as putting the crop in and\nkeeping it free from weeds, etc., etc., and were to receive one-half\nof the green-feed and threshed grain. The school was to supply all\nthe seed-grain & one-half of the twine used in the harvest operat-\nions for grain and green-feed and was to receive one-half of all\ngreen-feed and threshed grain. The school was also to receive two-\nthirds of all straw and the parties of the second part the remaining\none-third. This is the essence of the agreement except that there\nis a final clause that the parties are entering upon it with good\nwill and with the idea of mutual cooperation.\n\nThe facts as I have them are that the school not\nhaving a sufficient number of large boys to work the farm in 1934,\nMr. Woodsworth got in touch with Davidson and Latimer or with one\nof them, and himself put the proposition up to them. They did not\nseek it. I understand they worked the lands very carefully and\nfaithfully last year; but as a result of the frost the proceeds\ngave them little better than very poor wages if it gave them that\nmuch. They were counting on making any profit from the operations\nof this land this year and next.\n\nOn the 18th of this month, that is the very day on\nwhich the second year commenced, Mr. Christianson saw them and\ntold them they would have to vacate the lands as Mr. Woodsworth\nhad no authority to enter into the agreement and that the agree-\nment was therefore null and void. They accordingly consulted me.\nLatimer is the son of a very old client of my firm, very respect-\nable people, and Davidson seems to be an equally respectable and\nreliable man. It is extremely hard on them now to take the stand\nthat Woodsworth was without authority. Surely the situation might\nhave been known and should have been known long ago, some time\nlast year, and reasonable notice given to them even assuming that\nWoodsworth had no authority and that the contract is void.\n\nIn that event and assuming that the Department did\nnothing which would have the effect of holding out Woodsworth\nas its agent, Davidson and Latimer would have an action against\nWoodsworth and possibly against the school authorities; but they do\nnot wish to take this course and I certainly shall not advise them to. Under the circumstances, however, would it not be possible to let the contract run this year at least, even if it is not allowed to run its whole term. As time is pressing I should be glad if you could give the matter immediate consideration and wire me the result. Meantime I have advised the two men that they should not be asked to take Mr. Christianson's mere word that the contract is null and void. That is a question of law depending on all the facts and neither I nor they yet have anything like all the facts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) A---- U. G. Bury\n\nAUGB/AM\nMEMORANDUM\n\nApril 30th, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe Minister has received the accompanying letter from Mr. A.U.G. Bury, M.P., concerning a contract said to have been made in April, 1934 with two farmers who worked 300 acres of land connected with the Indian Residential School at Edmonton.\n\nThe Minister has been informed that the difficulty referred to in Mr. Bury's wire (quoted in the letter) has been settled. He would like to have from the Department a report as to the settlement and its terms. You might also let him have a statement as to the contract made by the Indian Agent with Messrs. Davidson and Latimer.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMay 3rd, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 30th ultimo, with accompanying letter from Mr. A. U. G. Bury, L.I., concerning the leasing by the Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, of 275 acres of the school lands. In this connection I would refer to my memoranda of February 26th, March 9th and April 29th last. This land, the property of the Crown, was leased by the Principal, Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, without referring the matter to the Department or receiving any authority. No copy of the lease has been received, but the Department has been informed by Mr. G. C. Laight, the local Indian agent, of the terms of the lease, as follows:\n\n\"On April 1st, 1934, Mr. Woodsworth drew up an agreement with Mr. William Davidson and Mr. Alfred Latimer, of Edmonton, to rent 275 acres on a crop share basis, both of these men are farmers living near the school; the agreement with Mr. Davidson and Mr. Latimer was that the school management should have full control over the land rented, having the right to stipulate what crops should be grown each year and how much should be summer fallowed. The school management to furnish one half of all seed required, purchase one half of the binder twine and pay one half of the cost of threshing, and retain the right to buy all the grain these two men would have for sale out of their share of the crop, also all their share of the green feed, and the school to receive two thirds of the straw. The agreement also calls for the school threshing outfit to be used to thresh the grain, this being done to guard against any weed seeds being carried on the land. Mr. Woodsworth informed me that the school purchased grain and green feed to the value of approximately $1,000, being part of Mr. Davidson and Mr. Latimer's share of the crop grown on the 275 acres of school lands.\"\n\nMr. Woodsworth, the principal of the school, was entirely at fault in leasing the land. The leasing of Crown Lands must be done by formal lease from the Superintendent General, and, under the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, 1931, it is necessary that any rental obtained from the lease of government land be forwarded for deposit to the credit of the Receiver General.\n\nMr. Inspector Christiansen was instructed to proceed\nproceed to the school and inquire into the matter. When the Department received his report, dated the 23rd ultimo, a copy was attached to memorandum to the Honourable the Superintendent General dated the 29th ultimo.\n\nI would refer you to the final paragraph of Mr. Christianson's report. He states that, after discussing the matter with the two lessees, they seemed to be quite satisfied to cancel the lease.\n\nMr. Christianson states that all the school land is actually required for farming and grazing purposes and that, in future, it will be farmed by the school staff.\n\nMr. Woodsworth, having no legal authority, was not competent to execute a lease of crown land. As stated above, lease of crown lands must be executed by the Superintendent General and the proceeds accruing under such lease must be forwarded for deposit to the credit of the Receiver General. Therefore, the agreement made between the Principal and Messrs. Davidson and Latimer would appear to be null and void.\n\nRegarding the suggestion of Mr. Bury to let the contract run during this year, I would point out that the land is necessary for school purposes and that the Principal will arrange for the cultivation of same this spring.\n\nI am returning herewith Mr. Bury's letter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nCOPY\n\nApril 27th, 1935.\n\nIn respect to the agreement drawn on April 18th, 1934 between Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Indian Residential School and William Davidson and Alf Latimer, neighbours adjoining the school farm; regarding the farming of certain lands under the management of the above named school, we hereby affirm and declare that upon the payment by the Principal, J. F. Woodsworth of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) to William Davidson and Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) to Alf Latimer this agreement shall become null and void and in all respects both legal and moral. Upon the payment of the above sums there shall be no further claims of any nature upon the school by either Latimer or Davidson, either personally or collectively. It is agreed that there shall be no claims for labour, work, damage, time or material, and that the parties concerned accept the settlement with satisfaction and good will.\n\nThis action has been taken in harmony with the recent action of the Department of Indian Affairs as represented by Mr. Christianson, in declaring the above-mentioned agreement of April 18th, 1934, as being irregular and that the Principal of the Indian School exceeded his authority in permitting the agreement to be signed. It is to be understood that the Department terminated the agreement as far as legal aspects were concerned.\n\n(Signed) \"WM. DAVIDSON.\"\n\n\"ALF.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI enclose herewith a document signed by the men David-\nson and Latimer who were interested in the farming agreement of\nlast year. Since I saw you a fresh development has taken place:\nSome days after you were here, and before we were able to get to-\ngether, these two men took the matter to A.U.G.Bury, K. C., of Ed-\nmonton, the federal member for East Edmonton. They explained the\nmatter to him, gave him a copy of the agreement and had him send\nit to Ottawa. He also sent a telegram to Ottawa, protesting against\nthe action of the Department, and trying to have them reinstated in\nworking the land. At first they would have nothing to do with me,\nor consider a settlement such as was proposed when you were here.\nThey also apparently disregarded the closing of the matter which\nthey agreed upon, with you as witness, but were trying to open up\nthe whole matter again. However I told them they would not be able\nto make any headway and would lose the chance of any settlement which\nI was then prepared to make. They at last came to see me and I gave\nthem $200.00 apiece, as per statement. In consideration of all\ntheir plans, their actual loss, and our good name in the community\nI felt it better to make a settlement rather than have complica-\ntions. They told Mr. Bury of their settlement and he is wiring\nOttawa to take no further action in the matter. It is just poss-\nible however that you may hear more about it from Ottawa, so thought\nI would tell you about it so that you would know what was going on.\nI do not like parting with $400.00 but they might have stuck for\nless, and stirred up a lot of fuss, and now that the original\nagreement has been set aside I think it better to be clear of\nthem in every way.\n\nI may say that I have followed your suggestion and\nhired a man to work the land under our direction. So things may\nbe much better for us in the fall than if we were complicated with\nneighbours.\n\nThings at the school are normal and we are now getting\non the land. I expect on Monday our new man will come to work.\n\nI have written to Mr. Beaton suggesting that the com-\nmission spend a day with you in Calgary. They will be with me\non May 14th.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"J. F.

The name of the School is not given in the correspondence but you will be able to identify it from the fact that the Principal is Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nThe road is said to be in very bad shape as a result of the heavy traffic which passes over it, and a delegation of farmers who use this piece of highway from the School to Edmonton, have requested that the road should be gravelled. It is not suggested that the Department should bear the full cost of the road work, but that a contribution should be made towards it.\n\nThe Minister would like to have the Indian Agent make a report on the situation. Will you please see that this is furnished.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nSept. 28, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to advise that representations have been made to the Department that some repairs are necessary for the improvement of the road about three miles long leading to the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is reported that the stretch of road in question is at present in a bad condition as a result of heavy traffic, and that the roadway at least should be surfaced with gravel.\n\nWill you kindly make an inspection of the above mentioned piece of road and furnish me with a report and sketch showing its location with regard to the school property.\n\nI might add that this question has been discussed with Inspector Christianson by the Deputy Minister, however, the Department would like to have your views on the matter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nG. C. Leight, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter File No. II0-0-9 of the 28th ultimo, and in reply beg to report that I have been over both roads leading from the Edmonton City limits to the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I am attaching a rough sketch of both roads leading to the school; in your letter you state that representations have been made to the Department for the improvement of the road three miles long leading to the school, I have shown this road on the sketch but wish to point out that there will be a considerable amount of grading to do on this road before gravel can be put on the road, on the other hand the 4\u00bd mile road is graded and will require very little work before the gravel is put on.\n\nYou state in your letter that the Department would like to have my views on this matter, I wish to state that I consider that if the Department should decide to have either one of these roads surfaced with gravel that before any further action is taken that the Municipal Council be interviewed and asked to share the costs, if the 4\u00bd mile road is the one selected then the Edmonton City Council should also be asked to gravel the half mile running from the pavement to the city limits, this \u00bd mile is shown on the sketch.\n\nThere is no question but that the road to the school is in very bad condition and that the traffic to and from the school has a great deal to do with the road being in this condition, but at the same time I consider that it would be unfair for the Municipality to expect the Department to pay all the costs of graveling either of these roads.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nG. G.

Is it out of harmony with any policy either with Church or Government? Would it in any way create a local difficulty, in regard to taxes etc.? If there are no insuperable difficulties, I believe it would solve, for the time many trying problems of administration. I believe that for the present our large farm has ceased to be an educational factor in our school life, and while I would not like to dispose of the property entirely at present\u2014no one does not know future developments\u2014still I think it would be a wise war provision.\n\nI have tried to be frank in presenting this matter, and I would appreciate very much a presentation of the position and attitude of the Department. I am quite aware of the big question mark in regard to the future of this institution, and the attitude of the Department may be affected by this factor. However there is not likely to be much change for a matter of three years.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. Dorey, again in case the attitude of the Church is involved, our Board will be informed.\n\nI may say that I have gone into detail with the men who have applied for working the farm, and conditions are quite satisfactory from the school standpoint.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nNovember 16th 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a year ago I wrote to Dr. Dorey, of our Board of Home Missions, in regard to the possibility of leasing part of our farm lands. Dr. Dorey took the matter up with Mr. Hoey, and according to a letter from Dr. Dorey last January it would appear that the matter might be adjusted with the Department if terms and conditions were satisfactory. It should be explained that owing to a number of reasons it is practically impossible for the school management to operate the large acreage which is at present under school direction. We have under cultivation something like 500 acres, about 350 of this is usually under grain crops. In the past of course this has brought us in good returns and has enabled us to operate quite satisfactorily from a financial standpoint.\n\nDuring the last few years however it has become increasingly difficult to carry on. In the first place the ruling of the Department in discharging the pupils at 16 years of age has seriously affected the help problem. Then Mr. Goodland, my farm instructor, who has been 43 years in the service is growing old and is unable to give the physical and nervous strength to the work as in other days. Since the war started it has been almost impossible to secure farm labor, and we have been operating on a ragged edge. This fall after harvest Mr. Smith, who has been with me for some 16 years bought a place of his own and is no longer with me, as it was we put in only a small acreage and arranged with outside parties to combine the crop. Part of the hay was put up on shares. I find it is necessary to cut down drastically in the number of hogs we raise, and in other ways we are trying to operate within the bounds of our ability. I mention these matters simply to give you a picture of our farm life. We are well fixed for the winter, plenty of feed and grain and vegetables, but you will agree that it is necessary to look to the coming spring.\n\nDuring the last month I have had two requests from reliable farmers to operate the farm, or at least the east three-quarter section on shares. Only differing in detail\u2014the proposition is that they supply all labor, equipment, seed, and responsibility, giving us one third of the crop. This would be nearly sufficient to feed our stock, that is hogs and cattle. The area affected would be about 320 acres. It would of course be necessary to give them a lease of three years. Such an arrangement would solve our labor problem, and still give us enough land for garden and hay.\n\nThe Department may recall that some seven years ago, I attempted such a plan and was sharply rebuked for in any way disposing of Crown Lands. I again come back with the proposition, this time asking about it first. May I ask if there is anything\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nThis is a Government-owned school and is operated under the auspices of the United Church of Canada.

This claim was for crop damage on our farm, estimated by them at $875.00 - I think it was. This amount was satisfactory to us, and was forwarded to you by Mr. Laight.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter No. IIO-0-9 dated December 10th, 1944, and addressed to Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, Principal, Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alta. I beg to report that subject to the approval of the Department arrangements have been made with Mr Jack Glen Harrold, Farmer in the Edmonton District, Post Office address Box 535 Edmonton, Alta., to lease some of the land at the Edmonton Indian Residential School for a period of three years commencing on April 15th, 1944 on a one third share crop basis of all grain grown on the land. Following is an accurate description of the land it is desired to lease:\n\nPart of Sec. 12 Tp. 54 Range 25 W., 4-Ms. comprising approximately 450.95 acres more or less.\n\nApproximately 300 acres under cultivation, 140 acres in bush and 10 acres used for Right of Way for Railway Spur to the Namao Air Port.\n\nIt was suggested at a meeting of Rev. Mr Woodsworth, Mr Harrold and myself that the following be embodied in the lease.\n\n1. The following shall be put in crop in 1944, approximately Seventy-five acres of wheat, One hundred acres of oats, Seventy-five acres of barley and Fifty acres of Summer Fallow done. That Fifty acres of Summer Fallow shall be done in 1945 and 1946.\n\n2. The Party of the Second Part shall use for seed only good seed grain, free from dirt and weed seeds and properly treated with Ceresan, or otherwise treated chemically, and fertilize such crops of wheat and barley as approved methods of husbandry demand, provided that such fertilizer is obtainable.\n\n3. The Party of the Second Part shall supply all equipment and labour required to seed and harvest the said crop, and will deliver the said share of crop to the granaries of the Party of the First Part at his own expense.\n\n4. The Party of the Second Part shall use his best endeavour and approved methods of husbandry to prevent the growth of and to exterminate all noxious weeds, and will meet and fulfill all requirements of municipal or provincial authorities in this connection.\n\n5. The Party of the Second Part will in each year of the said term thresh the crop as soon as conveniently possible after cutting, and will exercise proper care that the combine outfit be one that will not bring weed seeds onto the land.\n\n6. The Party of the Second Part agrees that the Party of the First Part shall have the use of the bush land for pasture and the right to cut firewood off the bush land, the Party of the First Part agrees to keep all fences around the bush land used for pasture in good repair during the term of the lease.\n\nOver.\nThe Party of the First Part shall provide all the granaries required for his one third share of all grain grown on the land each year.\n\nFor the information of the Department I wish to state that I am very much impressed with the appearance of Mr Harrold, he is about 27 years of age and married, he has a full line of equipment and has had considerable experience in farming which includes a course in agriculture at one of the Provincial Agriculture Colleges in Alberta.\n\nIt is expected that work on the land will commence within a week or two and I would respectfully ask that I be advised by Air Mail if the Department approves of this lease or not, Mr Harrold is anxious to start works as soon as it is fit to get on the land.\n\nG. G.

The writer can see no reason why such a leasing arrangement should not be approved if it is your desire to lease the land.\n\nIt is suggested that a lease should be prepared embodying the terms contained in the letter for submission to Mr. Jack Glen Harrold for his signature. This service will be glad to draft the lease for you if such is your wish in the matter.\n\nIn the meantime you will probably want to advise the Agent that the proposed contract is satisfactory and the leasing approved.

You realize the magnitude of the task confronting you; as a devoted and conscientious worker, you have at heart the success of your undertakings.\n\nI take this opportunity to express my admiration for your employer: the Municipal Council of Morinville #91, which is composed of men who willingly accept their great responsibility of administering the Agricultural Problems of their Municipality as men who have a long time view of our agriculture wishing to make every ratepayer a responsible and reliable farmer.\n\nIndeed, I am very pleased to assist you, to the best of my ability, and submit to you a Crop Rotation which should, when completed, eradicate the class \"A\" noxious weeds at present prevalent on the above mentioned farm thereby making it unproductive and a public menace.\n\nUseless to say that when pollution exists as in the present case, to be effective, drastic measures have to be used. My work would have been more pleasant had I to deal with a clean farm and recommend a Rotation to keep same productive.\nMr. W. Ellett,\n\nYou may rest assured that I have given lot of thought to the present problem and kept in mind the interest of both; the owner and the renter before drafting the enclosed plan and making any recommendations.\n\nIn order to have as much uniformity as possible in the size of the fields, for economy and efficiency of operation, also to clean the farm as quickly as possible, I have taken the liberty of combining the following fields: No. 4 & 3, 5 & 6. Therefore, these fields should ultimately be dealt with as one respectively. I wish to bring to your attention the only difference of 20 acres between the smallest and largest field on the farm.\n\nI am recommending a four year rotation as described and explained in the enclosed Plan, i.e.: summerfallow, early barley, fall rye, fall rye.\n\nIt is rather unfortunate that the whole farm has been neglected to the extent that no crop can be allowed to mature during the year 1946 except the field #2 which was summerfallowed in 1945 and field #4 seeded down to Fall Rye this fall according to our earlier recommendations.\n\nTo assist the Institution in having enough feed for their livestock, we thought it advisable to grow green feed in field #3. After said green feed has been harvested, about Aug. 1st., the land should be tilled and cultivated twice at regular intervals, and seeded down to Fall Rye on or about Sept. 1st. along with field #2 which should receive the same preparation as field #3 after the Olli barley has been taken off.\n\nI understand that an arrangement can be made between the Institution and the renter for the purchase of the green feed.\nDue to the degree of infestation, field #1, 5 and 6 must be well summer-fallowed in 1946. They should be first tilled and then cultivated every 12 to 14 days from July 10th or 15th till freeze-up. This means that the 154 acres contained in the 3 fields mentioned above must be thoroughly worked about 10 times mostly during the harvest season.\n\nEnclosed is a letter of approbation of this Crop Rotation from Mr. Mather, our Provincial Weed Supervisor.\n\nI really hope that the programme herewith outlined will be put to practice and trust that expected results will reward your efforts. It should be used as a demonstration to other farmers who might doubt of the possibility of totally eradicating Canada and Sow Thistles when polluting the land as in the present case.\n\nHumbly submitted by\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.M.

S\u00bd Sec. 12-54-25-W4th.

Harrold whom rents this land was also present and it was agreed that drastic measures would have to be taken to control the weeds, which would require at least five (5) year plan of crop rotation and summer-fallow.\n\nOur District Agriculturist, J.M. Fontaine, B.S.A., in his usual wholehearted and efficient manner got to work on this plan and now I can present it to you with a strong recommendation that it be adopted for at least five (5) years.\nI would recommend that a lease for five (5) years be drawn up in this regards.\n\nMr. J. Harrold the present lessee has advised that he would be prepared to carry out the work under our supervision.\n\nI can assure you that at the end of five (5) years that this property will be producing good clean crops, and that the land would not be a menace and disgrace to the Community as at present.\n\nTrusting you gentlemen will give this matter your early and favorable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWalter Ellett\nMunicipal Field Supervisor\nMunicipal District of Morinville No. 91\nMorinville, Alberta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Edmonton Agency,\nUpperburn, Alberta. September 3rd, 1945.\n\nRef: No. of Sec. 19-84-4S-24th.\n\nThe above described land is that portion of the farmland of the Edmonton Residential School, which was leased in 1944 to Mr. J. Harrold on a crop share basis.\n\nI understand that the reason for granting this lease was that the school was not in a position to properly farm the land, on account of the scarcity of help, in order that the land be kept in a proper state of cultivation until such time as the school could resume operation of the farm.\n\nThe idea may have been all right, but it has not worked out in the way it was intended and the land has become so badly infested with weeds that the provincial Government authorities have stepped in, demanding a cleanup.\n\nJust a year ago, when I went over the place for the first time with Mr. Heathcote & Mr. Woodsworth, I remarked on the slowness with which the place was being handled, and said that I thought the place was being ruined rather than farmed. At that time there was a small piece of land which was badly grown to weeds, which was described to me as that year's sunflower. To the best of my knowledge that piece of land was never touched again until this spring, when a tiller combine was put onto it and it was seeded down along with all the other acreage which had been in crop in 1944, with the exception of 37 acres which have been underflowed this year.\n\nI am enclosing copies of correspondence, dealing with the matter, also a copy of a plan of crop rotation and summer fallow which has been drawn up by the District Agriculturalist which would take five years to carry out and which presupposes the cultivation of the land by the present lessee, of which I would not be in favor. The plan itself is all right, but it would have to be carried out strictly. In the letter I am attaching that Mr. Harrold is not the man for the job.\n\nTo be in with the 10 acres which were seeded to barley this year and which he was told to sow with a combine at the beginning of August, then to burn off the stubble to kill the weed seeds, the land was then to be sowed and worked down then seeded to fall rye before the end of August, but instead of doing this he left it till last week to seed the land to rye with a tiller combine, without burning the stubble or even plowing the land. This I consider to be just wasting the seed, which at this late date will not germinate, if it does the plants will not have sufficient time to become properly rooted, before frost comes \"killing them off\".\n\nThe lease in the first place was rather loosely drawn as there was no provision made for the summerfallowing of a specified acreage each year. A man like Harrold was quick to take advantage of this, with the results as outlined in the reports submitted.\nProvision is made in the lease however for the cancellation of the agreement between November 15th & February 15th, and with this in mind, I think it might be just as well if I, or Mr. Woodworth were given instructions to look around for a more suitable occupant, who would farm the place according to the plan submitted, and if such a man is found, Harold could be given notice of cancellation of his agreement.\n\nI might say that Mr. Woodworth is not in favor of a five year lease being given to anyone, as he feels that with the end of the war, there should be no difficulty in obtaining the required help at the school to allow them to farm the place themselves. But, supposing a lease were granted for a term of five years, provision could be made for cancellation between seasons - providing for the indemnifying of the lessees for any surplus labor done - from which he would not get any returns.\n\nAs an alternative, money could possibly be found to hire all the work done on the farm this next year & from then on the crops raised on the land should pay for all future costs of operations.\n\nThis of course would require rather close supervision.\n\nJ.T.

Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nI enclose for your information a copy of letter received from Indian Agent Faunt.\n\nWe have reviewed this letter very carefully and I am inclined to feel that Mr. Faunt's recommendation should receive approval.

I instructed Mr. Faunt to report fully to the Branch as it was obvious the lessee was not working the land properly, and only 37 acres of summerfallow had been done, which at the time required further cultivation.\n\nOn the 8th instant, while in Edmonton, I took this matter up with Rev. Mr. Woodsworth, the Principal, and Mr. Faunt together: Both agreed that the work of seeding 80 acres to fall rye in the autumn was not well done, and not in accordance with the instructions given the lessee.\n\nI recommend that the lease agreement with Mr. J.G. Harrold be cancelled at once, -- (I understand this has to be done before February 15th, next.) -- and that Acting Indian Agent Faunt be authorized and instructed to arrange with someone else to take over the land for a three-year period -- 1946-47 and -48; and that a proper rotation of crops and summerfallow be planned, and mentioned in the agreement; the School to receive one-third share of the crop. Rev. Mr. Woodsworth says that they (the School Staff) are not equipped to work this land, and he does not expect to be prepared to do so before 1949. If the School are prepared to take over the land in 1949, the lessee should be entitled to remuneration for the land summerfallowed in 1948, unless it is arranged that he seed and harvest this summerfallow.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. Harrold may ask for compensation for seed and labour on the 80 acres of rye seeded this fall, or perhaps in this case also, if the crop shows up well in the Spring, it might be arranged that he harvest same in the fall.\n\nI would ask that immediate action be taken in this matter, so that Mr. Faunt may have time to look for another lessee before spring. Both he and the principal have given me to understand that Mr. Van Brabant, a neighbour, who has new and up-to-date power machinery, and four sons to help him with the farm work, would be interested, as they have not sufficient acreage of their own.\n\nC.

What he is trying to get at is, that the question of raising a crop on the 31 acres is pretty much a gamble this year on account of the condition of the land he does not want to gamble all alone.\n\nAfter the first year we would get one third share of the crops grown on the land, which would be farmed according to good farming practice, but not altogether according to the plan as laid down by the Seeds Branch. Mr. Van Bremant feeling that he is being tangled up in the growing of a crop with which he is not familiar, and the growing of which is not at all common in this section of the country. I tried to tell him that besides being a good cleanup crop, it had proved a very profitable crop in other sections of the country, but he\nbut he said he would like to see it for himself.\n\nI had expected to meet Mr. Harold too yesterday, but he was not there - was not at his home either, having gone into the city for a couple of days.\n\nIn connection with the 80 acres which he seeded to rye last fall, I think the best way to do with this would be for us to pay him for the seed - possibly the seeding - get him off the place, as it would not be comfortable for the new tenant to have the old tenant around. I don't think we would be called upon to pay out a great deal for this work, as blocks 13-5-4 has been plowed up in 1942 and ready for crop in 1944 and all Harold did on this was to drill the crop in, in 1944. I am very doubtful of there being any crop of rye on the eighty acres, but if it should prove to be all right the crop would belong to us & the returns would pay for any outlay in connection with Mr. Van Brabant's proposed plan for the summerfallow. If it is a failure, we could know in lots of time to allow of Mr. Van Brabant's plowing of the land & getting it into oats this year.\n\nI have asked Mr. Woodworth to contact Mr. Harold as soon as he gets home - arrange for me to meet him early next week.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Faut Schmidt Lee., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School - Farm Lands.\n\nFurther to my letter of January 17th, in which I advised you that I had arranged a meeting for this morning at Mr. Mather's office\u2014\n\nMr. Miller, the agricultural weed inspector for Leducville was unable to get through to attend the meeting, on account of the drifted condition of the roads and Mr. Harold broke his arm yesterday, while trying to start his tractor\u2014 he is in hospital.\n\nBoth Mr. Mather and I spoke to him over the phone, I mean Harold and he was quite agreeable that the weed control people set a cutoff date in the spring at which time it could be determined whether the rye was going to make a crop or not so that some form of agreement could be drawn up to this effect.\n\nMr. Fontaine, the district agriculturist, who was at the meeting, was of the opinion that such a date should be set so that it should be just as early as possible and in the case of a rye crop it could be quite early, so as to allow of lots of time for reseeding if necessary and that he was ready willing to act in the matter, along with the other authorities interested.\n\nI showed Mr. Fontaine the statement of costs as submitted by Mr. Harold in connection with the seeding of the 40 acres to rye and he was of the same opinion as Mr. Mather, in that the charges were excessive so that they should be revised downwards, in the event of the Department deciding to pay off Harold for the work done.\n\nI asked Mr. Mather & Mr. Fontaine if they were prepared to give me figures as usually paid in the neighbourhood for work\nwork of this nature and they were and in regard to the charge of $2.03 for the seed, they both remembered that Harold had told us at the previous meeting that the seed had cost him $1.53 per bushel & that he was not entitled to charge any more.\n\nIt would have to be determined also whether any barrowing was done on the land, which I myself would be prepared to dispute, as I went over the ground some little time after it had been seeded & the disc marks of the tiller-combine were quite distinct.\n\nThe telephone calls are a small item, but the charge for hauling is excessive & would have to be supported by receipts.\n\nWith regard to the charge for summerfallowing the 37 acres; this too is out of line & further, as an offset against this there was 162 acres of land prepared for crop by the school, part of which work was hired done, in 1943 and all Harold had to do, was to drill the crop in, in 1944.\n\nHarrold not being able to be at the meeting, we were unable to arrive at an amended figure for settlement, if it were decided to buy out Harold, but Mr. Lather & Mr. Fontaine said that the 162 acres of prepared land as taken over by Mr. Harold in 1944, would more than offset the work he did on the 37 acres in 1945, even if he were allowed the full charge as submitted.\n\nUnder the circumstances I think it would be better to let Harold take off the crop of rye, if there is one and in which event we would get one third and if the crop proves a failure, the new lessee would prepare & seed the ground to a new crop, of which we would get one third, clear of all expense. In this way we will have no further outlay on the 30 acres & have a chance to get enough out of it to pay for the cost of summerfallowing the 100 acres as outlined in my letter of January 3rd.\n\nI am enclosing my file in connection with this lease, as requested by you, in order that you make what copies you want and shall be glad to have the said file back as soon as convenient.\n\nJ.J.

Faunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School Farm.\n\nI understand from you that you are proposing to cancel my lease of the above farm and as discussed with you the other day, you will recall the land was very dirty and the weed inspector for that district suggested that I seed the southeast 80 acres to fall rye in order to clean up this area, which I did. In addition to this, I summer-fallowed 37 acres just south east of the track and west of the bush during the 1945 season.\n\nAssuming that the lease will be cancelled, you have asked me to submit to you my expenses for summer-fallowing and for cultivating and seeding the 80 acres seeded to fall rye. I, of course, would prefer to harvest the 80 acres of rye because this grain is now a very good price. However, as requested, I give you the figures of my actual costs.\n\n1. Tilling and sowing 80 acres to rye at $2.00 per acre.............. 160.00\n   Harrowing 80 acres twice at 30 cts per acre.................. 48.00\n   Rye seed, 1 bushel per acre at $2.03 per bushel............. 162.40\n   Paid expenses and telephone calls in looking for seed........ 5.60\n   Paid cost of trucking seed from Camrose to the farm........... 28.00\n\n2. Summer-fallowing 37 acres, going over land six times; plowing, discing, cable weeder 3 times, tilling, keeping land black all summer................................. 165.00\n\nThe above two items are actual expense to me and if the lease is to be cancelled, I am surely at least entitled to be repaid for my out-of-pocket expenses on the farm. The new tenant will get the advantage of it, or the school, whichever farms the land.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Jack G.

Schmidt Esq., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School - Farm Land.\n\nWith reference to our meeting with Mr. Harold and the statement of expenses submitted by him in connection with the putting in of 30 acres of rye last September, I beg to advise that along with Mr. Woodworth I met Mr. Lether, Provincial seed supervisor, at his office, yesterday morning.\n\nI showed him the statement as submitted by Harold and he promptly described it as unreasonable & outrageous. I showed him the similarity of the water marks on the paper used & of those on previous correspondence & he said he was satisfied there was collusion between Mr. Allott, the seed inspector for Morinville Municipality & Harold.\n\nI asked him then about a cutoff date in the Spring at which it could be decided as to whether the rye could be considered a crop or a failure & if he would undertake to set that date & make the decision.\n\nHe said that he could do that, but that such decisions were usually made by the municipal seed inspectors, as the administration of the seed controls act had been turned over to the municipalities, though there was nothing to stop him from overruling any such decision.\n\nHe said he would like to have the different parties together again in his office, either Monday or Tuesday morning so he wanted to have it out with Mr. Allott about the very apparent discrimination being shown by him in the carrying out of his duties & to have it made clear that there would have to be a date set for judging the rye crop, and that, early enough in the season to allow of our re-seeding to something else, if the rye proved a failure.\n\nI have arranged things for Tuesday morning and will immediately after the meeting send you a report.\n\nover.\nI was wondering if meantime it would not be wise to ask the Department to notify Harold of the cancellation of his lease, pending the submission of a full report.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Lether about deviating from the plan as suggested by the District Agriculturalist and he said he could see no good reason for not doing so, if we wished. The plan as outlined was merely a suggestion \u2014 no more and that any good farm practice used by us for the eradication of weeds would meet with their approval \u2014 need not extend through five years, if the desired results could be attained in a shorter period.\n\nJ.F. Jeupt.\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nP.S. When I next write you, I will send you my file, so that you may have copies made.\nWith further reference to your letter of December 20th and my partial report of January 3rd, I beg to advise that I met Mr. Woodworth & Mr. Harrold in Edmonton this afternoon and we discussed the terms under which Mr. Harrold would settle for his interest in the eighty acres seeded to fall rye.\n\nMr. Harrold brought with him the municipal seed inspector, the district agriculturalist and the provincial supervisor of soils & weeds, with the idea of showing me that he was not responsible for the weedy condition of the farm and also to recommend that Harrold's tenancy of the farm be continued.\n\nI told these gentlemen that I was not prepared to discuss these matters with them and that the Department had already decided that there be a chance in the tenancy of the farm and that I had arranged to meet with Mr. Woodworth & Mr. Harrold for the sole purpose of discussing terms of relinquishment.\n\nAfter talking things over, Mr. Harrold said he was ready to accept payment for the seed & seeding of the eighty acres & relinquish all claims which he might have on the farm.\n\nI asked him if he could furnish me with a statement off-hand, but he was not in a position to do so, but that he would give me a statement by the end of the week. He did however intimate that he had seeded a bushel to the acre & that the seed had cost him $1.53 per acre. I would imagine that this would be the largest item of the expense.\n\nI think the most satisfactory arrangement would be to pay him off.\n\nMr. Harrold has not yet received official notification of termination of his lease.\nCalgary, January 30th, 1946\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School - Farm Land.\n\nFurther to your letter No. 100-0-9 of December 26th, last, and our letter of the 7th instant, even number, with enclosures: I beg to report that I intended leaving here on the evening of the 6th instant for Rocky Mountain House, and from there proceed to Edmonton, but unfortunately I was put to bed by the Doctor on the P.M. of Sunday, the 6th, with a very bad attack of 'Flu, which kept me there for a few days, and left me somewhat weak afterwards, for which reason I did not go to Edmonton until the 22nd.\n\nOn the 24th instant, together with Mr. J.T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, we met Mr. J.G. Harrold in Edmonton, when he handed to Mr. Faunt a statement of his claim for expenses incurred for seeding 80 acres to Fall Rye and summerfallowing 37 acres in 1945. I told Mr. Harrold there and then, that I considered his claim quite high, and that he would no doubt be asked for receipted statements for certain charges made.\n\nWe (Mr. Faunt and I) pointed out to him that he had previously said that the Rye seed had cost him $1.53 per bushel; his reply was that he had had difficulty in finding this seed; that the grain he purchased was dirty, and he had to clean it. He also remarked that the price of Rye was now more than $2.00 a bushel. We also remarked to him that we considered the charges for trucking ($28.00) were high.\n\nMr. Faunt also remarked that in his opinion the charge for harrowing was not a fair one.\n\nMr. Faunt drew his attention to the fact that when he took the farm over in September, 1944, there were 182 acres of summerfallow; to this Harrold remarked that this was not good summerfallow; that it had not been kept black by cultivation, and that weeds thereon were tall. He admitted seeding it in 1945 without extra cultivation. Mr. Faunt remarked that these 182 acres should offset the 37 acres he summerfallowed in 1945, and then some.\n\nTo all this Harrold did not have much to say, other than that if his lease were cancelled, he would lose money, as he had ordered a new 24-run Seed Drill. He said that he was willing (preferred) to harvest the 80 acres of Rye, as Rye was at a high price at present. He then remarked that he had not yet received notice of cancellation of his lease.\n\nI told him that a report would be made to the Branch of our interview, and that if they decided to cancel his contract, which was what we (Mr. Faunt and myself) had already recommended, he would receive notice, by mail, from Ottawa. This ended our interview with Mr. Harrold.\n\n(OVER)\nWe then met Rev. J.F. Woodsworth, Principal of the School, who is interested in this farm, as he receives one-third share of all crops grown thereon by the lessee. The point I wanted to bring before Mr. Woodsworth was that any expenditure (payments) made to Mr. Harrold or a new tenant (Mr. Brabant) for 100 acres of summerfallow this year (1946), if paid by the Branch, should be refundable and paid from the proceeds of the School's share of the crop.\n\nRev. Mr. Woodsworth said he considered the amount of the claim (statement) submitted by Mr. Harrold to be excessive; he disagreed with the remark made to Mr. Faunt and myself by Harrold that the weeds were \"high\" on the summerfallow (182 acres), pointing out that Harrold had seeded it without any special cultivation.\n\nI then pointed out to Mr. Faunt and Rev. Mr. Woodsworth that if we allowed Harrold to retain his interest in the 80 acres of Rye during 1946, there should be a cut-off date set, at which time it should be decided whether to leave it grow and mature, or plow it under. Mr. Faunt has stated that this Rye was poorly farmed, and he has very little hope that it will be a good crop because of the class of work done, unless we have a very favourable season next summer. My reason for wanting a cut-off date is to enable us to cultivate (plow) this 80 acres and seed it to oats in proper time. I suggested consulting Mr. H.J. Mather, Supervisor, Soil Conservation and Weed Control, for the Province, regarding this point as it would be well to have an independent and competent party make the decision. We phoned his office for an appointment, but were told that he was out of the City and would not return before Saturday A.M., I then asked Mr. Faunt to interview him, which he has done. (Vide his letters enclosed herewith).\n\nMy recommendation is, that Mr. Harrold's contract be cancelled immediately on all but the 80 acres of fall Rye, and that this be left to him on the understanding that this crop will be inspected by an independent party who shall decide whether to leave same to mature or plow it under; if plowed under, Mr. Harrold is to have no claim whatever against us.\n\nNotice of cancellation should be in his hands before February 15th, next. His address is P.O. Box #535, Edmonton, Alberta. (Vide his statement of claim).\n\nG. Pant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nHandwritten note:\n\n\"Cancel out a notice of cancellation before Feb. 1st if such is your wish but it will have to be absolute in case of reservations.\n\nAfter cancellation has been effected you can then bargain with farmer as to whether you will pay him an agreed price for his crop or compensation - or permit him to harvest the share of seeded crop in lieu of such compensation. You can impose your own conditions in such arrangement as to the date at which the decision is to be reached as to whether he leaves the crop to grow & not plow down.

James A. MacKinnon,\nMinister of Trade & Commerce\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Jim:\n\nJack Harrold is the son of John Harrold of Namao. He had a lease from the Department of Indian Affairs covering the Indian School land just west of the Harrold Farm at Namao, Alberta.\n\nUnder the terms of the lease, which was a tough one, the Department had the right of cancellation if notice was given any year during the term of the lease before February 14th. The lease had one more year to run that is for the year 1946.\n\nLast Fall Jack tilled and seeded 80 acres to fall rye at a cost of $404.00 and he summer-fallowed 77 acres at a cost to him of $185.00. Out of the blue the Indian Department gave him notice of cancellation of the lease and proposed to take over his 80 acres of rye and use the summer-fallow which he had prepared last season without making any payment or allowance to him. They finally agreed, however, through Mr. Faunt, the Agent, that they would have a committee inspect the rye and if it was suitable to permit growing till harvest they would let him have his share of the crop, but if the committee decided that the crop should be plowed down, Jack would get no allowance.\n\nWe had a very cold dry backward spring this year\n\n..... and no\nand no Fall rye in the area looked any good until today. We had good rain all day yesterday. The committee inspected the land one day last week and decided to plow it down and allow Jack nothing for his summer-fallow, nor for his work or seed provided on this 80 acres.\n\nNow this seems to me like pretty high handed business on the part of the Indian Affairs Department. No private individual ever used his tenant in this manner. Landlords always pay the tenant for summer-fallow which he has prepared the year before and allow him to harvest his fall grains.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD.)

This land (32 acres) was thoroughly prepared before seeding and the crop on it looks very well indeed.\n\nPlot No. 4 (80 acres) which had been seeded to fall rye by Mr. Harold was left till the latter end of May and was then inspected by the Provincial weed authorities as previously arranged and pronounced no good, with the recommendation that it be ploughed under and the land reseeded to barley & oats and this I had Mr. Van Brabant do and this crop also looks very good.\n\nThis means that there is 162 acres in crop this year.\n\nIn addition to this Mr. Van Brabant has proceeded with the summerfallowing of lots No. 1, 5 and 6 containing in all 154 acres and in addition has ploughed up another 9 acres which was badly infested with Canadian thistles in that section marked \"Bush\" and located between plots 3 and 4. This means that all the cultivated land on the farm is either under crop or being prepared for crop on practically a fifty fifty basis.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous letter Mr. Van Brabant does not care to undertake the farming of this place according to the plan outlined by Mr. Fontaine, the District Agriculturist but is prepared to use ordinary good farm practice in the handling of the farm, and this will meet with the approval of the Provincial authorities, who have inspected the place & have expressed their approval of the work done so far.\n\nMr. Van Brabant is prepared to farm the place on two thirds, one third basis starting with the present crop and to summerfallow a reasonable amount each year & at the end of the term of his lease to leave not less than one hundred acres of summerfallowed land.\n\nI would recommend that a lease be granted Mr. Van Brabant for a period of five years, dating from April 1st 1946, with the proviso that the lease may be terminated by giving notice between November 15th of any year & February 15th of the year following.\n\nI am satisfied that in Mr. Van Brabant we have a good tenant and with the help he has at his command, we may look for very satisfactory results in the way of cleaning up the farm.\n\nThe name and address are as follows:\nAime van Brabant of the Post Office of St. Albert, Alberta.\nOttawa, July 25, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McMillan,\n\nEdmonton Residential School Farm Lease.\n\nI have prepared the attached draft letter for Mr. Pratt's signature.\n\nI understand from the letters on this file that you are interested in this case and therefore would appreciate your comments on this draft.\n\nBernard F.

James A. MacKinnon,\nMinister of Trade and Commerce,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Jack Harrold\n\nDear Jim:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant.\n\nI am sure the Honourable Mr. Glen misunderstands my request. I am not so much interested in the 37 acres of summer fallowing as I am in the 80 acres of rye. I gave you the figures that Mr. Harrold spent in connection with seeding the rye from which he absolutely derives no benefit. For your information I enclose copy of report dated September 15th, 1945, given by the Field Supervisor of the Municipal District of Morinville to Mr. Faunt. This report confirms my idea of the condition of the farm. As I mentioned to you in my previous correspondence I have hunted for many years on this land and never in my experience have I seen such a dirty weedy place.\n\nMr. Harrold was at the meeting referred to by the Supervisor and thought he was to get an extended lease for a five year period.\n\nMr. Glen is mistaken in his dates. Jack Harrold did not take over this farm in September, 1944, but he did take the farm over in the Spring of 1944 and cropped it in the season of 1944 and again in the season of 1945. True, the lease was not signed until September, but the lease was completed during the winter of 1943 and 1944 and Mr. Harrold seeded to crop the summer fallow, but before seeding it was necessary to plow part of it and till the remainder and never admitted that he seeded it in 1944 without extra cultivation.\n\nI am quite prepared to forget about the summer fallow but surely Jack is entitled to be repaid his actual out of pocket expenses for tilling and seeding 80 acres to rye. This amounts to something over $400.00.\n\nI feel confident that when Mr. Glen has the full facts he will deal fairly with Jack Harrold. It will be quite in order for you to pass this letter on to the Honourable Mr. Glen.\n\nI will be writing you in a day or so about a personal matter. In the meantime I am,\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\n(SGD) A.F. Duncan\nMr. W.J.F.

Jas. A. MacKinnon,\nMinister of Trade and Commerce,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Jack Harrold\n\nDear Jim:\n\nYour letter of June 12th received.\n\nIt is not a question of the Officials of the Department helping Jack. It is a question of the Dominion of Canada being fair and reasonable with a common, ordinary, every day citizen of Canada.\n\nAt no time was there ever any complaint of any kind that Jack Harrold was not doing his best to keep ahead of the weeds, and when the writer of the letter to you says that Jack Harrold was not complying with the terms of his lease, Jack does not know what he is talking about. No complaint was ever made that Jack was not fully carrying out the terms of his lease, nor was any complaint of any kind ever heard.\n\nI have hunted on this land for many years and know it all just like a book. I have never in my life seen a farm so badly infested with sow thistle. I defy any human being to walk through the bush and open land from the North to South where it is bush land without being smothered with sow thistle. Now this is not on cultivated land and never has been cultivated, but I never in my life saw such a crop of sow thistle. The farm is simply polluted and has been for years to the knowledge of the Superintendent of the School, the Weed Inspector, the Indian Agent and the Provincial Department of Agriculture.\n\nFinally last summer the Weed Inspector, the Supervisor under our Provincial Agricultural Service Board Act, the Indian Agent, Dr. Woodsworth, the principal of the School, Mr. Mather of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Jack Harrold met. It was then suggested that the lease be extended for a period of six years rather than one year which it had to run.\n\nThe District Agriculturist, the Weed Inspector, the Indian Agent and Dr. Woodsworth set out a rotation of crops for Jack Harrold to follow for the remaining six years. One of the suggestions was that Jack was to prepare and seed down the 80 acres in question to rye, in addition to summerfallowing properly the 38 acres which he was then doing. This report was to be\n\n..... sent down\nsent down to Ottawa which I believe was done and the Officials in Ottawa have this report.\n\nPursuant to this recommendation, Jack proceeded to complete the summerfallowing and to seed down the 80 acres to rye.\n\nThe excuse the Indian Agent now gives is that Ottawa did not approve of the report and recommendation and Jack took his chances without the approval of the authorities at Ottawa. Now what is the answer to this suggestion. Here it is: Ottawa moves very slowly. Jack arranged for his lease in March, 1944, but never received the lease until November, 1944, after he had already put his crop in and harvested it. He fully expected the recommendation to be carried out by the Officials at Ottawa and had he waited for a reply, it probably would not have been received until November, 1946.\n\nCertainly had Jack Harold realized or known that his lease was going to be cancelled, he certainly would not have gone to the expense of summer and keeping back 38 acres and preparing and seeding to rye the 80 acres in question.\n\nIt may be that the attitude of the Officials of the Department is as mentioned in the memorandum to you, but I cannot believe that such is the attitude of the Government of Canada. It is ridiculous for the person sending you the memorandum to say the lease was first granted on September 1st, 1944. It was not delivered until November, 1944, but the arrangements were made for the lease in the early Spring and Jack cropped the land that season.\n\nThere is not a farmer in Alberta who leases a farm on which the tenant has done summerfallowing and the owner by virtue of a clause in the lease to cancel in the event of sale but what makes a fair and reasonable allowance to his tenant for extra work done on the farm.\n\nI might add that in addition to sow thistles, Canadian thistles also abound and grow right in the bush so thick that you simply cannot walk through it. In fact three years ago, I had my little girl with me and she had to turn back because of thistles.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(SGD) Fraser Duncan.\nMINISTER OF TRADE AND COMMERCE\n\nOTTAWA June 22, 1946.\n\nMr. W. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary to the\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pratt:\n\nUnder date of June 1st we wrote you regarding the cancellation of a lease held by Mr. Jack Harrold of Namao on land owned by the Department of Indian Affairs. You replied under date of June 6th and we passed the information contained in your letter to Mr. Fraser Duncan who is representing Mr. Harrold. We now have a further letter from Mr. Duncan, copy of which I am enclosing to you.\n\nCould you let us have a further report from your officials at the earliest possible moment?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) A. C. L. Adams\n\nA. C. L. Adams,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, July 30, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Adams:\n\nI am writing in reply to your letter of June 22nd, with attached correspondence from Mr. Duncan, dealing with the cancellation of a lease held by Mr. Jack Harrold, of Namao, on land owned by the Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Indian Agent Haunt dealing further with this matter. In this letter, he stated, \"I might say that Mr. Harrold had a notion he was entitled to be reimbursed for the thirty-seven acres of summerfallow on the place when his lease was cancelled, but gave up the idea after I had talked with him, so that we may figure ourselves clear with him.\"\n\nYou might also draw to Mr. Duncan's attention the fact that when Mr. Harrold took over this farm in September, 1944, there were one hundred and eighty-two acres of summerfallow. Mr. Harrold has claimed that the weeds on this summerfallow were tall and that it had not been kept black by cultivation; but nevertheless he has admitted that he seeded it in 1945 without extra cultivation.\n\nIt is felt that these one hundred and eighty-two acres should more than offset the thirty-seven acres which Mr. Harrold summerfallowed in 1945.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Harrold has evidently made no mention of these one hundred and eighty-two acres of summerfallow to Mr. Duncan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMr. A. G. L. Adams,\nPrivate Secretary to the Minister of Trade and Commerce,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nPlease return to Indian Affairs when signed.\n\nOttawa, Ontario,\nAugust 27, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Adams:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of August 9th with which you enclosed a letter from Mr. A. F. Duncan regarding the Jack Harrold lease of land owned by the Department at Edmonton.\n\nThe correspondence was referred to the Indian Affairs Branch and the Director advises that it was necessary to request certain information from the Indian Agent at Winterburn, Alberta, before preparing a reply. On receipt of his report you will be advised further.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nA. C. L. Adams, Esq.,\nPrivate Secretary to the Minister of Trade and Commerce,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Aug. 23rd, 1946, in regard to losses held by Jack Harrold on the Edmonton School farm, and returning enclosures.\n\nI cannot see that Mr. Harrold has any claim for compensation for this summerfallow. Thirty seven acres of summerfallow out of a cultivated acreage of approximately three hundred and fifteen acres could hardly be considered excessive, especially in view of the fact that he had the benefit of one hundred and eighty two acres of summerfallow when he took over the farm and while this may not have been first class summerfallow, it was at least as good as the thirty seven acres he left behind. Most of our farmers in the neighborhood of the Agency figure on from one quarter to one third of their acreage in summerfallow each year.\n\nAs regards his expense for seed and seeding operations on the eighty acres of fall rye, I would refer you to the sixth paragraph of Mr. Faunt's letter of Sept. 23rd, 1945, as to the methods Mr. Harrold used to seed this rye, and under the circumstances, I could not recommend that any compensation be paid him.\n\nE.A. Robertson\nClerk in charge.\nDear Mr. Adams:\n\nFurther to my letter of August 27th, a reply has now been received from Mr. E.A. Robertson, Clerk in Charge of the Edmonton Agency.\n\nMr. Duncan states in his letter of August 7th, \"I am quite prepared to forget about the summer fallow but surely Jack is entitled to be repaid his actual out of pocket expenses for tilling and seeding 80 acres to rye. This amounts to something over $400.00.\n\nHowever on September 23rd, 1945, the Indian Affairs Branch received a report from Indian Agent Faunt about this 80 acres which Mr. Harrold seeded. His letter of that date reads as follows: \"To begin with, the 80 acres which were seeded to barley this year and which he was told to swath & combine at the beginning of August & then to burn off the stubble to kill the weed seeds. The land was then to be plowed & worked down then seeded to fall rye before the end of August, but instead of doing this he left it till last week to seed the land to rye with a tiller combine, without burning the stubble or even plowing the land. This I consider was just wasting the seed, which at this late date will not germinate & if it does the plants will not have sufficient time to become properly rooted, before frost comes & kills them off.\"\n\nOn January 24th, 1946, Mr. Harrold wrote to Indian Agent Faunt and submitted the following figures as to his actual costs in cultivating and seeding the 80 acres of rye:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Tilling and sowing 80 acres to rye at     |          |\n| $2.00 per acre                            | 160.00   |\n| Harrowing 80 acres twice at 30 cts per    |          |\n| acre                                     | 48.00    |\n| Rye seed, 1 bushel per acre at $2.03 per  |          |\n| bushel                                   | 162.40   |\n| Paid expenses and telephone calls in      |          |\n| looking for seed                          | 5.60     |\n| Paid cost of trucking seed from Camrose   |          |\n| to the farm                               | 28.00    |\n|                                           | $404.00  |\n\nMr. Faunt consulted Mr. Fontaine the District Agriculturist concerning these costs. On January 29th, 1946, the Indian Agent reported to the Department as follows: \"I shewed Mr. Fontaine the statement of costs as submitted by Mr. Harrold in connection with the seeding of the 80 acres to rye and he was of the same opinion as Mr. Mather, in that the charges were excessive & that they should be revised downwards in the event of the Department deciding to pay off Harrold for the work done.\n\n\"I asked Mr. Mather & Mr. Fontaine if they were prepared to give me figures as usually paid in the neighbourhood for...\"\nwork of this nature and they were and in regard to the charge of $2.03 for seed, they both remembered that Harrold had told us at the previous meeting that the seed had cost him $1.57 per bushel & that he was not entitled to charge any more.\n\n\"It would have to be determined also whether any harrowing was done on the land, which I myself would be prepared to dispute, as I went over the ground some little time after it had been seeded & the disc marks of the tiller-combine were quite distinct.\n\n\"The telephone calls are a small item, but the charge for hauling is excessive & would have to be supported by receipts.\"\n\nMr. Faunt also consulted Mr. Mather the Provincial Weed Supervisor about Harrold's costs. He reported as follows:- \"I shewed him the statement as submitted by Harrold and he promptly described it as unreasonable & outrageous.\"\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 24, 1946.\n\nE. A. Robertson, Esq., Clerk in Charge, Edmonton Indian Agency,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 27th regarding the land formerly leased to Jack Harrold at the Edmonton School.\n\nI note your remarks to the effect that you could not recommend any compensation. By letter dated January 17, 1946, Mr. Feunt suggested the best arrangement would be to pay Harrold off. In his letter of January 30th, he recommended that Harrold's contract be cancelled immediately on all but the eighty acres of rye and if at a later date it was necessary to plough the rye under, Mr. Harrold was to have no claim against us.\n\nIn order that we may definitely settle this matter, we would ask that you please interview Mr. Feunt and secure from him a statement as to the amount he considers we should pay Harrold. A reply by air mail will be appreciated.\n\nFor D. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept. 24th, 1946, in connection with land at Edmonton School formerly leased to Jack Harrold.\n\nI discussed this matter with Mr. Faunt before writing my letter of Aug. 27th as I was not familiar with all the details of their discussions with Mr. Harrold. I again talked the matter over with Mr. Faunt at the Edmonton School today and he advises as follows; after his meeting with Mr. Harrold on Jan. 17th, report of which was contained in his letter of Jan. 17th, he and Mr. C. P. Schmidt met Mr. Harrold in the Royal George Hotel, Edmonton, on Jan. 24th at which time Mr. Faunt proposed to reimburse Mr. Harrold for any expense incurred in putting in the rye crop but Mr. Harrold, as mentioned in Mr. Schmidt's letter of Jan. 30/46, said he would prefer to take a chance on the crop and this was supposed to be the final arrangement outside of the fact that an agreement was reached between Mr. Faunt, The Provincial Weed authorities and Mr. Harrold whereby if it were found in the Spring of 1946 that the crop of rye was not considered as fulfilling the purpose for which it was put in, namely that of cleaning up the Canadian thistles on the land, Mr. Faunt would have the right to go on the land and prepare it for a crop in 1946.\n\nIn May, 1946, the Provincial Weed authorities made inspection of the land and decided that the crop was a failure and in terms of the agreement originally entered into, ordered the rye crop ploughed under. This was done and he states there is a splendid crop of barley and oats now being threshed off the land.\n\nIn so far as the 37 acres of summer-fallow are concerned, Mr. Faunt says very definitely that so far as he can see Mr. Harrold has nothing to support his claim for\npayment for the work done on this land as when he took the farm over there were 182 acres of land already prepared and on which he put in crop without doing any further work on it and this should more than offset any claim Mr. Harrold might have in respect of the 37 acres.\n\nMr. Staley and Mr. Faunt have asked me to inquire whether any decision has been reached re granting of a lease to Mr. Van Brabant on his land. They state that he has done a very fine job on the farm this summer and is getting a little anxious about his lease.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nClerk in charge.\nOttawa, October 5, 1946.\n\nMr. E. A. Robertson,\nIn charge, Edmonton Indian Agency\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nClaim of Jack Harrold for reimbursement of farming expenses\n\nReference your letter 114 UC of September 30, it is now evident that the key to the whole situation is the agreement which was reached between Mr. Faunt, the provincial weed authorities and Mr. Harrold whereby if it were found in the spring of 1946 that the crop of rye was not considered as fulfilling the purpose for which it was put in, namely that of cleaning up the Canadian thistles on the land, Mr. Faunt would have the right to go on the land and prepare it for a crop in 1946.\n\nDoes this agreement exist in a written form? If so, then we will have no trouble convincing Mr. Harrold's lawyer of the true situation that existed. In Mr. Faunt's letter 114 UC-46 of January 29, 1946, he stated:\n\n\"Both Mr. Mather & I spoke to him over the phone, I mean Harrold, and he was quite agreeable that the weed control people set a cutoff date in the Spring at which time it could be determined whether the rye was going to make a crop or not & that some form of agreement could be drawn up to this effect\".\n\nInsofar as the summer-fallow is concerned, we have a written acknowledgment from the lawyer that he is quite prepared to forget about the amount claimed in this regard. It is the cost in cultivating and seeding the 80 acres of rye which is causing this further query.

I advised him that no lease had been executed, but Mr. Van Brabant, who cropped the land this year, had summerfallowed 154 acres and if the School intended taking over the farm and operating it this year, Mr. Van Brabant would be entitled to be paid for his work. It was my understanding from Doctor Dorey that he would look into the matter and arrange for payment to Mr. Brabant, and that they had funds from which they could buy the machinery required. I am, therefore, only suggest that Mr. Staley should get in touch with Doctor Dorey regarding the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D. J.

As will be noted from this letter, the occupant is not prepared to vacate the land on any terms that have already been put up to him. From reports and information in this office it would appear that there is no written contract, and it is therefore difficult to see how he can refer to the terms of lease.\n\nMr. Van Brabant occupied and worked this land on a verbal understanding in the presence of witnesses, and has faithfully carried out the contract as set out and reported by the Indian Agent Mr. Faunt in his letter of July 10/46. This fact was brought to the attention of Mr. Staley.\n\nIt was not within our province or authority to say whether or not Mr. Van Brabant could be removed from the occupancy of this land. However, Mr. Staley was promised that the matter would be put to you for legal advice and instructions.

Staley\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 22, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Van Brabant.\n\nYour letters of January 13th and 15th, addressed to Reverend E. J. Staley, Principal, Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alberta, with reference to the occupation and use of part of the school lands by Mr. Van Brabant, have been brought to my attention. It is regretted that difficulties have arisen through the use of the said land by Mr. Van Brabant, but it appears evident from the correspondence that all the aspects of his use of the property are not fully appreciated.\n\nThe lands in question are public lands of the Dominion of Canada which have been made available to this Department for school purposes and when used for any other purpose, as they were by Mr. Van Brabant, such use or occupation may only follow specific authority being granted by a Dominion Order in Council.\n\nYou speak in your letter of January 15th of Mr. Van Brabant entering into possession of the land pursuant to a lease, but no valid lease was ever executed and could not have been, as the requisite authorization by Order in Council was never given. I understand that a verbal arrangement as to the use of the land was agreed on by the then Indian Agent, Mr. Faunt, and Mr. Van Brabant, but this could not be binding in any way by the Department and could only be considered as negotiations leading up to a formal lease.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Mr. Van Brabant occupied the land during 1946 as a tenant at will of this Department and as we require\n\nJas. T. J. Collisson, Esq., K. C.,\nBarrister, etc.,\n907 McLeod Building,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nthe land for school purposes in 1947 he may not continue in occupation thereof. In order that there may be no uncertainty on this point, this letter may be taken as formal notification that the aforesaid tenancy will come to an end at the close of the 1946 farming season.\n\nAs to the summerfallow work which Mr. Van Brabant performed in anticipation of cropping the land during 1947, it is my understanding that the school authorities have offered to pay him compensation at the prevailing rates for such work in the Province of Alberta and I can only suggest that your client accept this compensation, for in so far as the Department is concerned he has no right to use the land during 1947 or thereafter and will not be permitted to continue in occupation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM\n\n1.

However, to avoid litigation Mr. Van Brabant is willing to accept $1,800.00 in full settlement of the work done on the farm last summer. Mr. Van Brabant considers that this is a reasonable amount for the work done and does not include anything for damages for breach of the lease.\n\nHe worked over 164 acres, some of which he had to work seven or eight times in order to destroy the noxious weeds. The rest of the land he worked over a large number of times in conformity with the provincial regulations for destroying noxious weeds.\n\nIf, therefore you will let me have a cheque for $1,800.00 Mr. Van Brabant will give you a release of the lease which he has and will also forget any damages for breach of the lease.\n\nYours truly\n\nsigned Jas.T.J.Collisson.\n\nJC/MR\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJanuary 18th 1947.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: School Farm and Van Brabant.\n\nFurther to correspondence in connection with the above, I have received another letter from Mr. Collisson, copy of which I am enclosing herewith.\n\nMr. Collisson mentions the sum of $1800.00 as the figure at which Mr. Van Brabant is prepared to settle for the work done on the farm last year and on receipt of this amount will give us a release of the lease held by him.\n\nAs in the case of Mr. Collisson's last letter, I have not acknowledged this letter either, but would just like to say that the figure as set by Mr. Van Brabant is unreasonable and both he and Mr. Collisson know it and theirs is just a game of bluff.\n\nI will not take any further direct steps in the matter pending instructions from you.\n\nMr. Faunt advises me that when he was at the Edmonton Agency and when trouble was being experienced in settling with Mr. Harrold, he obtained from Mr. Van Brabant a schedule of rates at which he would be prepared to perform certain operations on the farm and a copy of these rates was sent to you and should be on the Harrold file.\n\nIn Mr. Faunt's estimation the cost of all work done on the land might run to six or seven dollars an acre.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J.

It just so happened that Mr. Van Brabant came in this afternoon and I discussed the same with him.\n\nHe advised me that this land had been rented all along previously. Before he entered into negotiation for the lease he asked if the Government had given their consent to the renting of the land and was advised that the Government had. This land had become so full of noxious weeds that it was condemned by the Government. Mr. Van Brabant summer fallowed 164 acres of land. Some of this land he had to work over seven or eight times in order to get rid of the noxious weeds. The rest of the land he had to keep black all summer. To show that Mr. Van Brabant did good work, he has now received from the Provincial Government permission to sow the land this year.\n\nMr. Van Brabant is of the opinion that $1,800.00 would be fair compensation for the amount of work he and his boys have done on the 164 acres worked by them. Without prejudice to Mr. Van Brabant's claim that he has a lease on the land he will accept the sum of $1,800.00 in full settlement of all work done on the land and any damages which he might have against the school for cancellation of the lease or guaranteeing to him that they had the right to give him the lease.\n\nWe wrote a letter to this effect to the school on January 17th but we have received no reply whatsoever to this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJC/MB\nBoard of Home Missions\nThe United Church of Canada\n295 Queen St. West\nToronto 3 B., Ontario\n\nAttention of Mr. D.J.

I am not advised as to whether this correspondence was carried on between the Agency Office and your Office, or between the Agency and the Inspector's Office in Calgary. We should be glad to know what this correspondence was and what arrangements were made by Mr. Faunt, or by any officer of your Department, in Edmonton, Calgary or in Ottawa, regarding the giving of authority to Mr. Van Brabant to operate the farm.\n\nI am advised, particularly, that sometime in July, 1946, Mr. Faunt as Agent of your Department wrote a letter to Mr. Van Brabant, giving the details of the agreement. We should be very glad to know from you just what these arrangements were, because certain questions have cropped up. There is no need of our having copies of the letters -- what we want is simply information as to the nature of the arrangements made with Mr. Van Brabant by any of your representatives.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD, MLT\nOttawa, January 30, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMR.

It is not understood how Mr. Van Brabant could have been told by anyone that the Government had given its consent to the renting of the land to him for such advice could only have come from this office on authority being granted by the Order In Council and no Order In Council was in fact ever passed.\n\nAs we advised you under date of January 22nd last the land in question will be used by the School in 1947 and I can only suggest that you get in touch with the School authorities with a view to Mr. Van Brabant receiving compensation for the summer fallow work done on the land in 1946.\n\nYours truly,\n\nfor L.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nOttawa, February 13, 1947.\n\nDear Doctor Dorsey:\n\nRe: Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 29th with reference to the 1946 occupation by Mr. Van Brabant of part of the Edmonton Indian Residential School land. While the information which you have requested was given you verbally on your recent visit to the Department, it is thought you would like to have it on record as well.\n\nAs far back as January, 1946, we learned that Mr. Van Brabant was ready to take over the land on a leasing agreement, but at that time there was some difference of opinion as to the term which should be given and Van Brabant did not express any definite statement that he would lease on the Department's terms. Nothing further was heard concerning Van Brabant until the middle of July when Agent Faunt advised us that Van Brabant was prepared to farm the place on a two-third - one-third basis starting with the present crop, to summerfallow a reasonable amount each year, and at the end of the term leave not less than one hundred acres of summerfallowed land, and at that time Agent Faunt recommended the lease be granted for a five-year period.\n\nUnfortunately, at the date this advice was received at the Department we were involved in attempting to straighten out the claim of Mr. Harold, the previous tenant, and it is assumed that for this reason no reply was made to Agent Faunt regarding the use of the property by Van Brabant and I cannot find that any reply was in fact made to him and this is borne out by the fact that on September 30th last, E. A. Robertson, the Clerk in Charge\n\nThe Reverend Doctor George Dorsey,\nSecretary, Board of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street West,\nToronto 2 B, Ontario.\nof the Edmonton Agency, inquired as to whether any decision had been made re granting a lease to Van Brabant, for, as he stated in his letter, \"Mr. Van Brabant is getting a little anxious about his lease.\"\n\nIn short, therefore, although Agent Faunt recommended a lease to Van Brabant, the recommendation was never carried out and this Branch at no time stated to any one in writing that the Van Brabant lease had been approved.\n\nThe foregoing is the information as revealed by our files with the exception that apparently Agent Faunt, prior to recommending the lease to us, had told Van Brabant to go ahead and put in crop on Plots Nos. 2 and 3 of the farm and also gave him permission to seed to barley and oats Plot No. 4. As you are aware, Van Brabant summerfallowed Plots Nos. 1, 5 and 6. I understand that you expect to visit Edmonton shortly and, if so, you will be able to check the foregoing with Mr. Faunt and ascertain exactly what arrangements he may have made with Van Brabant other than those mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nfor D. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWhile at Edmonton School on Aug. 27th, I was advised by Mr. Staley that he had been approached by the Morinville Municipal District in regard to some assistance with a road which borders the west side of the school farm. As you no doubt know the road situation into the school is very bad during the winter and also during wet periods in summer, the roads are practically impassable at present.\n\nThe Municipal District are high grading and graveling the road along Sturgeon River from St. Albert to 127th St. The latter Street borders the East side of the school property and the proposed gravel road would pass along the north boundary of the school farm.\n\nThere is a side road on the west side of the farm which runs along the school property for approximately 1 mile and passes the school gate. The municipality has offered to high-grade this road and gravel the hill where the road comes up from the river bottom if the department will pay the amount of $250.00 as a portion of the cost. In connection with the road to be gravelled I might say that the cost of this operation is borne equally by the municipality and the individual farmers whose property it runs through.\n\nThe $250.00 they have asked for will not amount to one-half of the cost of the road past the west boundary of the property and they are not asking any contributions for the graveling north of the property.\n\n(over)\nIf funds are available I would strongly recommend this expenditure as it will provide a badly needed all weather road into the school at a very low cost.\n\nE.A.

In a report on file 110/25-1-753 dated June 15, 1949, I urged that this land be cleared and put into cultivation for school purposes. Mr. Regional Supervisor Gooderham countered on July 13, 1949, with the suggestion that the land be leased to an outsider, but your previous experience with leases at this school was not such as to encourage a resumption of such procedures.\n\nI suggest now that the Department have the land cleared by contract. There are, within 50 miles of Edmonton, several operators who have the sort of machine that enables them to clear off the trees and brush on land such as the Edmonton school land efficiently and quickly and at a predetermined cost. It would, I think, be possible to get competitive bids. The $5,000.00 mentioned above would go a long way to doing all the work necessary to be done by outsiders.\n\nIf our field officials could now be authorized\nto get competitive bids on this job, it might be possible to include in the supplementary estimates an item covering this project.\n\nThe resulting revenue from the use of this additional land should enable the Department to retard increasing the per capita grant at this residential school and thus effect a worthwhile return on the investment.\n\nC.A.F.

This boy's address is in care of Fred Green, R.R. No.2, Sedgewick, Alberta.\n\nChamoy Doxtator has a letter from his son of his to the effect that the boy would come home, but is short his railway fare and Chamoy Doxtator has applied to me for this assistance, which is passed on for your consideration and decision.\n\nChamoy Doxtator is not able to work his own lands on the reserve due to a severe hernia and could make good use of the money he was returned to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nSome years ago, Abram Doxtator, from the Caradoc Reserve in Ontario, was sent to the Brandon Indian Residential School. He was included among the number of those transferred to Edmonton from Brandon during the time of the erection of the new school at Brandon. He truanted from the Edmonton Residential School and was not apprehended.\n\nThe Department now understands that this boy's address is c/o Fred Green, R. R. No. 2, Sedgewick, Alta.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Caradoc writes that the boy's father is getting old and needs his son's assistance to work his land on the reserve. The Department would appreciate if you would endeavour to get in touch with Abram Doxtator and, if he is prepared to return home, you may issue a transport requisition for his transportation from Calgary to Muncey, Ontario. In the event of your issuing the requisition, you should mark on it that part of the ticket is to be charged to \"School Vote\".\n\nIn issuing the requisition, however, you should assure yourself that the boy is willing to return home and that, if he does so, he will use it for that purpose and\n\nYour request should receive your early attention, and I respectfully request you to defer other urgent business. I shall be obliged by correspondence to have the boy\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, March 30th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your 29-1 of the 25th instant, with reference to Abram Doxtator.\n\nMr. M. J. Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Calgary, Alta., is being written and requested to get in touch with this boy and, in the event of his being prepared to return home, Mr. Christianson will supply him with a ticket.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

A number of B.C. children did not return last fall after holidays. Their return was promised by the parents in the presence of the Agent, but I could not get them. What shall I do with their names?\n\nIn the case of pupil no. 0182, this number appeared alone for two quarters until the Department through Mr. Agent Laight asked for an explanation. Last Summer Aug 15th when the children returned from the Saddle Lake Reserve, Mr. Agent Cullion sent this child Evelyn Quale along with the other children, stating that as her case required some correspondence with the Department, her name better not appear for the time being. I put the number merely to reserve a space.\n\nSince her admission by the Department, I have included in her attendance the full number of days she has been in the school. I trust this will be satisfactory.\n\nThe report otherwise, is, I believe, correct.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 14, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the March quarter return of the Edmonton Residential School, please arrange to have the following application forms and certificates of health forwarded as soon as possible:\n\nNo. 187 - Charles Cardinal,\n0189 - Elsie Turner,\n0193 - Marie Cardinal,\n0194 - Grace Burnstick.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter of the first instant, it is felt that it would be advisable to apply for the discharge of the children mentioned. If, at any time, they decide to return, application can be made for their re-admission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. F.

I am today purchasing a ticket for him on a requisition, and sending it to Mr. Green, asking him to see that Doxtator gets on the train at Sedgewick.\n\nI trust this arrangement is satisfactory, and has been carried out according to your wishes. To bring this fellow down here would have meant an extra expense, and Mr. Green wrote me a very nice letter and I feel sure he will see that the Indian gets on the train there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

She is an advanced case of T.B. and the last few weeks she has been gradually losing weight and there appears to be very little prospects for recovery.\n\nWe think it advisable that she be moved to the Hospital in Hazelton, B.C. where she will be near her family.

She is about holding her own but not gaining, anything might happen, and my judgement is that she should be home. It would save much unpleasantness if she were among her own people in case the end came unexpectedly. I would suggest that authority be obtained from The Department to have the girl sent home under escort about July 1st. It would not be wise for her to go alone as she would require to be in bed all the way. I would suggest that Miss McDonald of this school be sent with her. Miss McDonald would only require her return travelling expenses.\n\nAfter returning to Hazelton it would be necessary for the girl to go immediately into the Hospital, as she is in no condition to return to an Indian home. In this connection it would be necessary to communicate with Mr. Agent Mortimer, and possibly Dr. Wrinch.\n\nI may say that Kate has been in the Edmonton hospital since December 11th 1934.\n\nI shall be glad to give any further assistance or information.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nPlease find attached two letters which I have received from Rev.

In the event of her going to Hazelton, an escort may be sent with her and payment of the expenses of both will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account in triplicate.

Pupils whose homes are a considerable distance from the school should not be allowed holidays.\n\nIn the case of pupils whose homes are near the school, arrangements should be made with the parents to come for their children and return them promptly on the expiry of their leave without expense either to the Department or the school management.

I understand Mr. Agent Gullion also wrote the Department and suggested that the full per capita be allowed because of the circumstances. It will soon be time to make out the September report and I shall be glad of instructions from the Department as to what allowance should be made. I may say that about the only saving we have is that of food and clothing for the sixty odd children who are not back. Otherwise our expenses are the same for overhead, teachers etc. The return of pupils from the other reserves is quite satisfactory, and if it had not been for this outbreak of sickness we would have had a full school. As the Department is aware I require my full per capita of $50 to properly carry on the work of this school.\n\nYours Truly;\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 30, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to children from the Saddle Lake Agency who did not return to the Edmonton Indian Residential School upon the expiry of their leave owing to illness on the reserve.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your request, but the Department is unable to approve allowing the per capita grant for them during their absence. In the case of each child who was allowed home on holidays and who did not return upon the expiry of his leave, grant should only be requested for forty-three (43) days, namely the holiday leave for which grant is allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Woodsworth,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast Monday the 23rd of this month I met our Indian Inspector, Mr. Christianson, and had a talk with him in regard of my children who are wishing to get an education. Mr. Christianson, who has advised me to write to you personally asking you if you could take my children into your school.\n\nMy two girls Mildred, age fourteen, Grace age twelve, are wishing very much to get an education as we have no school close around here, and they are not able to go to school the distance being too far. It is my sincere wish to have my children to be educated. I think I have done my part in teaching them to talk English from babyhood and I know they are eager to learn how to read and write. They have had a good start at home and I know they will learn fast in school. I would be very glad if you could take them in as soon as you can \u2014 the sooner they start in school the better, because they should have been in school before now.\n\nThere is one thing in particular I would like to ask: I have a boy who is school age, 9, but he belongs to the Anglican Church as my husband belongs to that Church. Could he go to your school? Of course my husband is not home just now and have not talked to him about this matter yet.\n\nAll my four girls and myself we belong to the United Church. My husband and my four little boys all belong to the Church of England.\n\nMr. Christianson says he will help me all he can to have my children in school and I hope you will too, Mr. Woodsworth. I take Treaty yet and I think my children should be taken into an Indian school like the rest.\n\nHoping you will write to me soon and let me know what you think about this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Christianson:\n\nI enclose herewith letter from Mrs. Eliza Jane Howse, daughter of Sam Bull of Goodfish Lake.\n\nAs you know, this woman some years ago married a half breed, and the usual results have followed. The woman herself is a graduate of this school. We have at present one of her children in the school, but the Department have evidently shut down on the others. If anything can be done to get these children into school, I shall be glad for the sake of the woman, as well as getting the children into school. I think otherwise the letter is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"J. F.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. P. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, January 20, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to enclose the December quarter return of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. On the last page of the return, there is an entry reading \"less error in attendance 284 days\". Please let me know why this entry is made on the return.\n\nI would, also, point out that application forms and certificates of health should be forwarded as soon as possible for the under-mentioned pupils:\n\nNo. 187 - Chas. Cardinal\n\" 198 - Alex. Jackson\n\" 199 - R. Seemun\n\" 0198 - Annie Hunter\n\" 0201 - Elenor Seemun\n\" 0202 - Ethel Hunter\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Residential School  \nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA  \nEDMONTON  \nALBERTA\n\nJanuary 28th 1937.\n\nMr. Philip Phalen,  \nChief Training Division,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nSee your letter No II0-0-10 of 20th Inst.\n\nRe. your enquiry regarding the item of 284 days.\n\n(1) In reviewing the report after it had been completed I noted that Pupil No. OIOI - Ruby Buffalo had been credited with full time whereas she had been 16 days late in returning to school.\n\n(2) It will be recalled that the Saddle Lake children were delayed this year in returning to school on account of Whooping-Cough. Most of them returned on October 1st and are credited with full time for the December quarter. There were 14 who returned late in two parties - eight pupils were fourteen days late, and six pupils were twenty six days late.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8 \\times 14 &= 112 \\text{ days} \\\\\n6 \\times 26 &= 156 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n\\text{Ruby B.} &= 16 \\text{ \"} \\\\\n\\text{Total} &= 284 \\text{ \"}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAt the time of the return of the Saddle Lake children I had a list and marked them off as they returned. In the case of the last two parties I fear I did not mark down the names of the children as they returned, with dates opposite each. I knew the totals however. I did not think it necessary at the time to make inquiries of the children themselves - as I do not like to consult the children re: office matters, so I put down the full time and then at the end...\ndeducted the correct numbers of days. I had a fair idea of who the children were, but I thought when there was a little uncertainty, one way of correcting it was as good as another.\n\nSince receiving your letter I have secured the names of the children from a check-up, by the pupils, and herewith submit the correction, which I have marked in red ink, which I trust will be satisfactory.\n\nI regret the error, and trust that future returns will be more explicit.\n\nIn regard to pupils whose applications and health certificates have not as yet been received by the Department, I may say that these are all new pupils and that I expect that forms will be forwarded in due time to The Department by the Indian Agent, Mr. W. F. Cullion.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 23rd, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am returning herewith the voucher which you submitted in payment of the amount you were authorized to expend for travelling expenses of pupils of the Edmonton Indian Residential School. It is necessary that you detail this account. For example, you should state the amount of fare paid per pupil and the points between which each pupil travelled. If you obtained receipts from the railway companies for the fares paid, you should attach to the voucher these receipts, or, in lieu of receipts, your paid cheques should accompany the voucher. In detailing the expenditure, you should state the fare of each pupil to Hazelton and the fare charged for each pupil to Duffield, Alta. This information should be given in the case of each payment.\n\nI would request that you prepare a new voucher, in triplicate, giving the details required, certify same and mail it in time to reach the Department before the 10th ultimo, in order that payment can be made before our books close for the current fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I have at present about 35 fro this agency. I have been planning to let about half of this number go, as most of these 18 are nearly 18 years of age, or at least over 16 and should be away for various reasons. Of the other children who would remain at the school, most of them are young. Some have not been home for three or four years, and in some cases longer. I have received some very insistant requests for children. Two months which is our holiday period this year seems a long time for about 20 little boys and girls to remain on the school campus while their companions are away. What shall I do? I know the risk of not getting them back. I lost a lot two years ago. None were home last year. What financial arrangement will the Department consider. I shall be glad of some definite instructions from the Department as soon as possible, either by letter or wire. I have written to the Acting Agent at Hazelton asking for his recommendation.\n\nYours Truly:\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 17th, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the children from the Babine Agency who have been attending the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that eighteen (18) of these children are being discharged at the end of the present academic year.\n\nRegarding the remaining seventeen (17), you should ascertain from the Acting Indian Agent at Hazelton whether or not their parents are living and in a position to properly care for them. If so, you might let me know what it would cost to send these home for vacation.\n\nIf there are any of these seventeen (17) children whose parents are dead or whose parents, though living, are unable to properly provide for them, it is believed inadvisable to even consider allowing them home for holidays.\n\nOn receipt of your reply regarding the estimate of the cost requested in the preceding part of this letter, you will be advised by wire with regard to the Department's decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEDMONTON, ALTA.\nThere are about five boys at the Edmonton Indian Residential School who should not have been permitted to leave the day school here. I strongly recommend that they be sent back to Kitwanga. I understand that their parents also desire this. Three of the above are the sons of Wallace Morgan, and the remaining two are Jeffry and James Fowler.\n\nI would further recommend that in future if Indian children have to be sent to a residential school from the Babine Agency they be sent to St. Michael's Alert Bay, and not to Edmonton. The parents are I am informed very anxious that their children be not sent to Edmonton and from what I have seen lately I am very much afraid that to send B.C. children to Edmonton to mix with Indians of such a different environment is neither fair to the children themselves or a wise expenditure of money. The school work is so different from our work in B.C. that the children are not able to take the same Grades on their return here. I do not believe that the Indian children sent to Alberta learn anything of the slightest use to them on the B.C. Reserves.\n\nI must also mention the case of MELBA WILITZU age 10 Grade I who has no parents alive and is just being made a slave of by others. She should be a residential school, and I recommend that an experiment be made and the child sent to St. Michael's if she can pass the medical tests and the Principal of St. Michael's will enter this recruiting field.\n\nIN FORWARDING THE ABOVE REPORT TO MAJOR D. M. MACKAY, INDIAN COMMISSIONER, MR. BARRY WRITES AS FOLLOWS:\n\nI may say that I am very unhappy with regard to the lack of progress made by the Indian pupils going to the residential school near Edmonton. I am told that the B.C. Indians are quite out of touch with various activities there as they are not considered by the Indians on the Alberta side of the Rocky Mountains as of the same stock. If children must be sent to a residential school, I certainly consider that Alert Bay would be the most suitable. The Indian parents are complaining of the long distance to Edmonton, and the fact that they do not see their children in some cases for years. The whole system of instruction at Edmonton appears to be different to that followed in British Columbia, and I would ask you to support my recommendation if you can see your way to do so.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, June 28, 1937.\n\nNIGHT LETTER.\n\nREV.

Provided they do so, the Department approves of their remaining in the Edmonton Residential School for another year, at the end of which time their cases should again be brought to our attention.\n\nIn the telegram quoted above, the Department authorized the expenses incurred in sending the fifteen (15) children home. In the event of Jeffrey Robinson and Annie McDames returning to the school, you may also submit an account for their return transportation.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to allow any expenses for sending home for holidays the other children from the Babine Agency mentioned in your letter.\n\nThe Department approves of Emma Simpson - No. 090 - remaining in the Edmonton School for another year.\n\nIt is noted that thirteen (13) boys and seven (7) girls under sixteen years of age, and also Jeffrey Fowler, Annie McDames and Emma Simpson, all of whom are from British Columbia, will be in the Edmonton School for the academic year 1937-38. At the end of June, next, you should advise the Department regarding the names of the children from British Columbia who, you consider, could be discharged at the end of June, 1938.\n\nIn view of the decision conveyed to you in official letter of the 19th instant, you should inform Richard Morrison of Kispiox that you cannot accept his grandson at the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

All the forms required are now in his hands, and have been since other official letters mentioned in your letters. It is just possible that Mr. Cullion finds difficulty in securing signatures.

However during the fall she gave indications of insubordination, which increased in the number of violations of discipline, and also in the violence which attended her outbreaks. At various times she not only defied various members of the staff, but even the Matron and myself. Her conduct began to spread to other pupils and seriously threatened the whole discipline of the school. Being a young woman we did not consider it wise to use severe corporal punishment, as this might raise unlooked for criticism. After a final outbreak of temper on her part, and after a great deal of thought and consideration on my part I decided to send her home. The girl admitted that she had been working to this end, and she gave no evidence of a desire to do better. So I was not able to do other than I did. I may say that her expulsion has made a great difference in the whole atmosphere of the school. I may also say that there is a background at home on the Reserve at Hobbema for this case. I trust my action is approved by The Department.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nOne of my pupils Gordon Bear will be leaving school at the end of June. He is sixteen and has completed grade VII and partial grade VIII.\n\nGordon is very interested in farming and as his father has machinery he is desirous of taking a technical course. I am writing you to see whether the Department would permit Gordon to attend the Brandon School so that he might take a course in agriculture, mainly with machinery.\n\nSince this boy has been my pupil he has shown keen interest in his school work and has attended regularly.\n\nI shall appreciate hearing what the Department can do to give this boy some assistance before he actually begins work on his farm.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours faithfully,\nFrank B. Day\nOttawa,\nApril 20, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 5th instant the Department approves the discharge from the Edmonton Residential School of Emily Little Poplar, No. 086.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nApril 20, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to Gordon Bear.\n\nI would consider that the Edmonton Indian Residential School would be much closer to this boy's home than Brandon. They have a good farm at Edmonton and there is no reason why he should not be able to receive at that school the training which he desires.\n\nThe Department is prepared to approve his admission to the Edmonton School and you should get in touch with your local Indian Agent and arrange to have him forward the usual application form and certificate of health. I am communicating with the Principal of the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. C.

Dey, Teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School, Tweedsmuir, Sask. He writes on behalf of Gordon Bear, a 16 year old boy who has completed his Grade 7 and has also obtained partial Grade 8. This boy is very interested in farming and his father has a farm with plenty of machinery.\n\nThe boy would like to obtain some further training in agricultural methods and I am suggesting to Mr. Dey that he arrange with his local Indian Agent to have the boy placed in the Edmonton School. When he comes to Edmonton it should be understood that it is not necessary for him to attend classes but that he should be given every possible opportunity along agricultural lines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Lapotac. This child was sent to the school for the purpose of getting him into the T.B. ward of the General Hospital. Dr. Williamson declined to sign the health certificate and my impression is that I sent the forms to Mr. Leight to deal with. However Mr. Leight cannot locate these forms. However he obtained authority to have the boy sent to hospital. See letter of Mr. Leight of Sept. 10th 1938 to Mr. Schmidt enclosing a report from Dr. Davidson. Also letter of October 8th 1938 from XXXXXX Mr. Leight Mr. Schmidt to Mr. Leight with authority from Mr. Baker to have the child admitted to hospital. The child was in the school but a few days.\n\nCase of Gordon Crowchild:- This lad is from Sarcee Reserve. His parents were very anxious to have him in this school as they live some distance from their day school. The boy already has a brother here, admitted some time ago. The Agent Dr. Murray appeared to approve of the move. Application forms were sent to Dr. Murray along with health certificate. I presume these forms are now in the hands of Dr. Murray or have been forwarded to Ottawa. The application was made out immediately upon the arrival of the lad in the school and at once forwarded to the Agent for approval.\n\nXXXXXXX In regard to the other eight cases they ALL belong to the Saddle Lake Agency. ALL application forms together with completed health certificates were IMMEDIATELY sent to your Indian Agent upon the arrival of the child at this school. In the past I have sent your requests to the agent for the forwarding of these forms to Ottawa. It is possible that Mr. Gullion may have difficulty in securing the signatures of parents, May I very humbly and respectfully suggest that a letter from the Department to your Agent may possibly bring a reply.\n\nYours Very Truly;\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn checking the December quarter return of the Edmonton Indian residential school it is found that although the under-mentioned children from your Agency are in the school no applications have been received for them:\n\nNo. 209 Francis Makokis No. 0217 Lily Steinhauer\n\" 213 Glen Houle \" 0218 Kate Houle\n\" 198 Alex Jackson \" 0219 Sophia Houle\n\" 0216 Lillian Hunter \" 0220 Annie Jackson\n\nPlease prepare the necessary forms and certificates of health for these children and forward them to the Department at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.

In a few cases sickness at home has prevented immediate return, but in practically all these cases I have been assured that the pupils will be returned as soon as possible.\n\nOn the report you will note that 25 pupils did not return from the Saddle Lake Agency. Mr. Gullion assured me that these would be in by Oct. 1st. To date no word has been received as to their return. I have been unable to secure from Mr. Gullion any word as to why they have not returned or at least a sufficient reason why. As you are aware this involves a serious financial loss to the school, and I do not think this wholesale neglect to return should be allowed to pass without notice.

Beaudry, O.M.I.\nper Rev. F. Gamache, O.M.I.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on September 1st, 1938 Margaret Sharphead granddaughter of John Sharphead No.168 Enoch Band, was admitted into the Edmonton Residential School, her application for admission shows her religion as Protestant and was signed by John Sharphead as father. Her admission was authorized by Departmental letter No.110-0-10 of November 2nd, 1938.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Sister Superior, Principal, Youville Residential School stating that having been informed that this child was of Catholic decent she had made research to ascertain the fact and that evidence has come in the form of a baptismal certificate, a copy being sent to me and is attached hereto.\n\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report that upon receipt of this letter I have interviewed John Sharphead and have obtained the following information; this is an illegitimate child, the father was William Ward No.196 Enoch Band, and the mother Eliza Story step-daughter of John Sharphead, the child was raised by Sharphead and is paid Treaty under his ticket, the mother afterwards married a half-breed by the name of Charlie Norwest, but the child was left with Sharphead. The mother is still in Treaty and paid under Ticket No.214 Enoch Band.\n\nWhen I took over the duties of Indian Agent at this Agency I was always led to believe that this child was John Sharphead's daughter, she was born on March 12th, 1929 and in 1929 was paid Treaty under John Sharphead's Ticket, the notation in the Treaty book being \"girl born\" this payment was made by Mr Geo H Race who was Indian Agent at this Agency at that time.\n\nJohn Sharphead was a Protestant but turned Roman Catholic, he was himself educated at the Red Deer Residential School and it is his wish that Margaret be educated at the Edmonton Residential School. The Reverend Sister Superior states that it is her duty to claim for this child her rights and that the child is entitled to a Catholic education under the Indian Act.\n\nIt is quite true that the father William Ward is a Roman Catholic but he did not do anything towards raising the child and John Sharphead respectfully asks that the child be educated in the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nWill the Department please advise me what action if any to take in this matter.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Leight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nNovember 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in connection with the admission of Margaret Sharphead to the Edmonton Indian residential school. One sentence of your letter reads as follows:\n\n\"John Sharphead was a Protestant but turned Roman Catholic. He was himself educated at the Red Deer residential school and it is his wish that Margaret be educated at the Edmonton residential school.\"\n\nDo you mean by this statement that John Sharphead was recognized as a Roman Catholic at the time he applied for Margaret's admission to the Edmonton school? If so, I should appreciate your advising why you approved the application.\n\nFurther consideration will be given to your letter of the 25th ultimo when your reply to this letter is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 110-0-11 of the 3rd instant, regarding the Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, experiencing a difficulty in securing the number of pupils for which per capita grant is allowed by the Department.\n\nI have endeavoured to co-operate to the fullest extent with the Principals of both schools, in seeing that all children of school age attend school.\n\nI have a problem at this Agency which is acute. There are a large number of R.C. children of school age who are not attending school. In my report for the month of September I suggested that I be allowed to use my authority under Sec. 10, Sub. Sec. 3 & 4 of the Indian Act for R.C. children and follow this up with the Protestant children. I meet with strenuous opposition from Protestant parents, who use for an excuse that the R.C. children do not have to go to school, so they won't send their children. Of course this is only an excuse. I have tried persuasion but to no avail.\n\nMay I suggest that the following action be taken:\n\n(a). Children who have been admitted to school, but have not returned: That Sec. 10, Sub. Sec. 3 of the Indian Act, be acted upon, and if this fails to have the desired effect, that Sub. Sec. 4 be evoked.\n\n(b). Children who are of school age but have not yet been presented at school for admission: That Rev. Mr. Law, United Church Missionary at this Agency, use his best endeavour to persuade the parents to send their children to school. If this fails, then Sec. 10, Sub. Sec. 3 & 4 be evoked.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Rev. Mr. Woodsworth and asking him to forward me his reactions to these suggestions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 23, 1933.\n\nRe: Attendance at Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Alfred G. B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Robbema, Alberta, which reads in part as follows:-\n\n\"I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant regarding the difficulty experienced by the Principal of the Edmonton residential school in securing the number of pupils for which a per capita grant is allowed by the Department.\n\n\"With respect to the children who are of school age but have not yet been presented at school for admission, may I suggest that the Reverend Mr. Law, United Church missionary at this agency, be requested to use his best endeavour to persuade the Indian parents to send their children to school and that if this fails Section 10 subsections 3 and 4 of the Indian Act be evoked. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Reverend Mr. Woodsworth.\"\n\nI am sending this excerpt forward for your information and for any action you may deem necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. George Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, November 23, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 8th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nI can readily appreciate the difficulties you may experience in persuading the United Church children to attend at Edmonton while a number of Roman Catholic children are absent from school on the reserve.\n\nThe records here indicate that we are paying grant for 140 pupils at the Ermineskin residential school. The claim of this school for additional pupilage will be carefully considered when the 1940-41 estimates are under consideration. In view of the war conditions now confronting us, however, I am not in a position to state just what action the Government is likely to take. I have been wondering if you ever discussed with the Principal the advisability of having a class of day school pupils organized at Ermineskins as a temporary measure. If a sufficient number of Roman Catholic children live comparatively close to the school, this experiment might be undertaken on the understanding that the children would be provided with instruction and a noon-day lunch. If a class such as this could be organized, some compensation would have to be allowed the school by the Government.\n\nI am communicating with the United Church authorities in respect to the suggestion made in the penultimate paragraph of your communication.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A. G. B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alberta.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1939.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 23rd ultimo, the Department approves the transfer of Barbara Cranebear from the Old Sun Residential School to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. H. Gooderham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGleichen, Alta.\nSir:\n\nAttention please Mr Philip Phelan, Chief Training Division.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. II0-0-10 of the 9th ultimo in connection with applications for admission into the Edmonton Residential School for Alice Adams No. 0226, and Effie Bull, No. 0227, in reply I beg to report that the application for Effie Bull has been forwarded to the Department, the application for Alice Adams was sent to the Wabamun Reserve for the signature of the father Edward Adams, I am now advised by Mr J.D.Bristow, Farming Instructor, that this man has been absent from his reserve for nearly three months and that he is still away, the application will be signed and forwarded to the Department as soon as the father returns.\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of the letter I beg to report that David Starr, No. 219 is a pupil from St. Johns Anglican School at Wabasca, this boy was sent to Edmonton and placed in the University Hospital for treatment for T.B.Hip, and was sent to the Edmonton Residential School by Dr.J.H.Conroy, M.D. for observation while still in the cast, this was done as it would be cheaper than keeping him in the University Hospital.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nAttention please Mr Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departments letter No. II0-0-10 in connection with Margaret Sharphead, in reply I beg to report that when this child was admitted into the Edmonton Residential School I was under the impression that John Sharphead was still a Protestant, but that upon investigation I find that he had turned Roman Catholic before Margret was admitted into the Protestant school.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nDecember 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with further reference to the admission of Margaret Sharphead to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nThe information contained in your letter and also in previous correspondence regarding this case has been carefully considered and the Department wishes the girl returned to her parents immediately. We are not prepared to consider her admission to any Indian residential school at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. C.

Chilton,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 110-0-10 of the 23rd ultimo, re. children at this Agency who are absent from school, both Roman Catholic and Protestant.\n\nRegarding the R.C. children attending Day School, this phase has been seriously considered several times since I have been here, but it is considered out of the question owing to the difficulties involved.\n\nWhen I first came here, pupils at Ermineskin School were constantly in and out of school, visiting at their homes; this was made possible by the large number of children over the 140 allowed for grant earning pupils, so that quite a number of children could be absent without the total number in school at any time being below 140.\n\nSince this time there have been two new principals and they have given me every co-operation in stopping this practice, and of course the Indian parents do not like this. They still think they should get their children out for a week or more whenever they ask. The children also think they are not being treated fairly by this privilege being withdrawn.\n\nThe Principal is quite anxious to help us in any way possible, but he is of the opinion that at present, at any rate, the establishment of a day school would tend to have disgruntled parents of grant earning pupils insist that their children also be day school pupils and the whole school system be disrupted.\n\nIt would also be necessary, if day schools for these children who cannot be accommodated in the Residential School, be established, to organise two other buildings as schools for children who live too far away to attend Ermineskin School. One at Louis Bull's Reserve and one at the South end of Samson's Reserve. This is out of the question owing to insufficient teaching staff for this purpose.\n\nTo overcome, in a small degree, the school problem, I with the assistance of the school authorities, organised a night school with Rev. Father Lawert, O.M.I., as teacher. This only lasted a few weeks as someone started a rumour that as soon as the school was going good the attendance would be made compulsory, and all I could do to rectify this was unavailing and the night school died a natural death.\n\nYou will readily see the difficulty I have in trying to get things to run smoothly, but I do hope some day to have everything running in a businesslike manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 19, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn reviewing the December quarter return of the Edmonton Indian Residential School it is found that application forms and certificates of health have not yet been received for the following pupils:\n\nNo. 209 Francis Makokis\n\" 222 Francis Jackson\n\" 0196 Annie Hunter\n\" 0215 Lillian Hunter\n\" 0218 Kate Houle\n\" 0219 Sophia Houle\n\nThere have been several communications requesting the above applications.

During the last week I have had a very satisfactory conversation with Mr. Gullion of the Saddle Lake Agency in regard to the problem of recruiting at that point. It would appear that there are a certain number of complaints, most of which are without any reasonable foundation. Some of the parents of Protestant connection are attempting to send their children to the Blue Quill R. C. School, and at the present time certain children are present in that school without being admitted by the Department, and are being kept there against the approval of the Indian Agent. The Indian Agent informs me that there are R. C. children on the Reserve who are unable to go to this school because of lack of room, and it seems an unreasonable thing that children of undoubted Protestant connection should be in residence.\n\nAs the Department is aware there are certain times when through some reaction on the part of a family or band the parents try to get their children into another school than that of their religious connection. As far as I can make out this is the case in\nconnection with the following children:\n\nA daughter of Rhuben Bull of Goodfish Lake.\n\nThree children of Tommy Heule\n\nA boy-Miles Hunter\n\nThree Hunter children John, Anna, and Annie children of Norman Hunter.\n\nMr. Gullion is writing the Department in connection with these cases and is anxious to have them put in this school. I do not think that there is any deep seated objection to sending the children here and I believe that some definite instructions from the Department would greatly assist your Agent.\n\nDuring the last months since the opening of school I have been trying to build up my attendance in accord with correspondence with the Department, and if I secure these children, it may quiet the objectors there and assist with further recruiting.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 2, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to recruiting for the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from the latter part of your letter that Indian Agent Gullion intends to write to the Department and as soon as his communication is received its contents will receive very careful consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The application for Esther Louis has also been forwarded.\n\nI would like to advise you that these applications were received in this office on Jan.12th, and after that the father's signature has to be had on the application, he possibly is out hunting or fishing, so that you can see that it is next to impossible to forward these applications as soon as they are received here. If it only required my signature it would be different.\n\nI am making this explanation so that you can see that fault does not lie with this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlfred G.B. Lewis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA review of the December quarter return of the Edmonton Indian Residential School shows the following pupils over the age of 16:\n\nNo. 098 Vera Rabbit          No. 0120 Jenny Bull\n\" 0113 Mary Steinhauer       \" 0148 Annie Ward\n\" 0114 Charlotte Hunter     \" 0150 Ruth Makokis\n\" 0118 Olive Whitford       \" 0155 Lena Waskatineau\n\nNo application for retaining these children in your school appears to have been received and in this connection I wish to direct your attention to circular letter of July 21, 1939, a copy of which is enclosed.\n\nAs pointed out in the circular letter the Department realizes that frequently there are reasons for keeping certain children after they reach the age of 16 but at the same time the consent of the Superintendent General (Minister) must be obtained.\n\nI may add that in the past the Department has been favourably disposed to allowing certain pupils, especially girls, to remain in residential schools after they reach the age of 16 if good reasons for such action are given by the Principal and approved by the Indian Agent. However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nFebruary 28th 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI have your letter of 23rd Inst. No. II0-0-10 in reference to eight girls, pupils of this school who are here over the age of 16 years.\n\nIn regard to the closing paragraph of your letter I may say that the eight girls mentioned in your letter can be discharged from school the end of this coming June. It is at this time that we have our closing exercises when pupils who have attained the age required are honourably discharged. I trust this arrangement is satisfactory to The Department.\n\nOf course there is the larger question of education which I have been trying for years to carry out in this school. With our Vocational objective in mind I feel that the best years that a boy or girl puts in at school where such a program exists, is between the ages of 16 and 18 or over. I have regretted the tendency during the last few years to discharge children at 16 years of age.\n\nAs you probably know, my problem is not with overcrowding of young children. I would like to see more come along. You will no doubt have observed that a number of children under the age are still on the reserve, and are not being sent in.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 5, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 28, written by you in reply to Mr. Phelan's communication dated February 23, 1940.\n\nIt is noted that the eight girls referred to by Mr. Phelan can be discharged from your school at the end of the present academic year.\n\nI find it exceedingly difficult to adjust the educational policy of the Department to the war conditions now confronting us. The Indian school population of Canada is increasing at the rate of approximately 300 pupils per annum. Despite this fact, I have no assurance at this date that we shall be able to proceed with our regular building program at any time throughout the duration of the war. If this building program is suspended, our educational institutions already in operation are likely to be taxed to the utmost to accommodate the steadily increasing school population. I feel, therefore, that our first duty is to the pupils ranging in age between 7 and 16. Should money be available at any time in the immediate future to proceed with our regular building program, the educational period of a number of our brighter pupils at residential schools might be extended.\n\nI am somewhat disturbed at the information that has reached me with respect to the location of your Edmonton school and the difficulty experienced in recruiting pupils. The Indian agent, in a lengthy letter dated February 13, states:\n\n\"The various points raised here were all brought up and discussed with Mr. Woodsworth at Edmonton\".\n\nYou are reasonably familiar with the tendency on the part of certain Indian parents to send their children to the Blue Quills school and the growing demand for the establishment of day schools on certain reserves. It is my personal opinion that these conditions are not likely to improve unless some attempt is made by the United Church or by the Department or by both to adjust them. I am frankly of the opinion that with a less efficient principal in charge of the school we would be at this date experiencing considerable difficulty in financing the institution, which fact in itself prompts me to think of the future.\n\nYou might let me know if you have ever seriously considered -\n\nReverend J. F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nconsidered the desirability of having a thorough survey made of the Indian reserves from which your pupils are recruited, with the object of determining what type of educational institution would be best adapted to the needs of the Indian population. If such a survey were undertaken and the recommendations made therein approved by the members of the Home Mission Board, the Government would have before it valuable information to guide them in working out a worthwhile program, for this particular section of Alberta. I can't at the moment think of a number of steps that might be taken but I am not at all sure that these would be acceptable to the church authorities. It seems to me very regrettable that the Edmonton school, a very costly institution insofar as its construction is concerned, was established in its present location.\n\nYou might at your convenience let me have any comments you may care to send forward in respect to these matters.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 27th 1940.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIn Account with:\nRev. J. F.

Mr. Christianson wrote to Mr. Gullion on April 22 regarding his remissness in this regard. He replied in a letter dated May 1 that he would forward shortly application forms for Francis Jackson, Annie Hunter and Lillian Hunter who had been in the Edmonton School for several months. As these forms had not reached us by July 10 I again wrote to Mr. Gullion and instructed him to forward them at once. He has not yet done so.\n\nI think you will realize that it is a great waste of time to be obliged to write several letters to an Indian Agent simply for the purpose of obtaining application forms which should be prepared and forwarded to the Department immediately on the admission of a child to a residential school. I should, therefore, appreciate anything you can do to hasten the forwarding of the forms for the children mentioned above.\n\nOn the September quarter return it is noted that George Breast was admitted to the school during the quarter. There is no sign of the application for this boy and judging by Mr. Gullion's actions in the past there is very little likelihood of its reaching here for several months unless you are successful in making him carry out his duties in this particular regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe pupils numbered as follows on the September quarter return of the Edmonton Residential School have apparently been absent from the school for some time:\n\n| No. 135 | No. 193 |\n|---------|---------|\n| \" 165   | \" 205   |\n| \" 181   | \" 219   |\n| \" 187   | \" 0198  |\n\nThe names of the pupils numbered as above should be removed from the return. If at any time they wish to return application can be made for their re-admission.\n\nOn the September quarter return 30 days' grant has been requested for Glen Houle, No. 215, and Rema Bull, No. 0207, although no grant has previously been requested for them since June, 1939. Please let me know definitely if these children have returned to the school and, if so, I would point out that in the case of children returning after an absence of some months a special note should be made opposite their names in the column provided for that purpose in order that the Department can be aware of your reason for again requesting grant for them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I've been planning to transfer back to Hobbema so I am not close to the children.\n\nPlease let me know if you had anything to do with these children. I was sick myself when Sam died so since I didn't hear a word from anyone about Sam's family I am writing to Mr. Lord to find out about them.

For years we have had their children in this school and Alex himself a graduate of the old Red Deer School. He is apparently very anxious for his children to be here - Mr. Murray, the Agent, is not sure of his ground, and of course I would not go over his head, and wrote him to that effect.\n\nI may say I have at present two Sarcee boys in this school who are here with recommendation of the Agent. It is quite possible that Alex Bull may have a good reason for his request. I shall be glad to have the children as my school is not full.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ. F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal\n\nKindly let me know your attitude in the matter.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the admission of the daughter of Alex Bull to the Edmonton Residential School. As I pointed out in my letter of the 29th ultimo no grant was requested for this girl from June, 1939, to the September quarter of the current year. Is the Department to understand that she was not present in the school during the intervening time?\n\nIn view of the fact that you wrote to Indian Agent Murray at Sarcee it is presumed that Bull is a member of that Reserve. If this is so why do you show on the return that she is from the Saddle Lake Reserve?\n\nI am communicating with Indian Agent Murray regarding this girl. I may add that when the parent or guardian is in a position to properly care for the children under their charge the Department considers that such children should attend the day school on the reserve, if there is one available. As you are aware there is a day school on the Sarcee Reserve.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth, B.A.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nNovember 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Edmonton Residential School has forwarded to us your letter of August 26 addressed to him with reference to the desire of Alex Bull to place his daughter in the Edmonton School.\n\nIs Alex Bull a member of the Sarcee Band and is he in a position to look after his daughter? If he is the Department considers that she should attend the day school on the Sarcee Reserve. It appears, however, that she has already been placed in the Edmonton School.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you with regard to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. T.F. Murray,\nIndian Agent,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant you may inform the Principal of the Edmonton Residential School that the admission of the following children is approved:\n\nJohn Curry\nD.D. Curry\nRuth Samson\nVelma Louis\nPauline Louis\nVictoria Looking Glass\n\nIt is noted that you will forward later the application form for Ruby Potts.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.G.B.

See your file no. 110-0-10.\n\nI fear you have confused this girl with another girl from Saddle Lake. This girl from Sarcee has never been registered at this school and belongs to the Sarcee agency. Alex Bull however is related to the Bulls on the Louis Bull reserve at Hobbema, and is a graduate of our old school at Red Deer. For some time he has been anxious to have his girl at this school owing to the fact that there is a day school at the Sarcee. Mr. Murray has confidently hesitated in recommending that she attend this school. The case has nothing to do with Saddle Lake \u2014 As stated I have told Alex that it is necessary for him to have Departmental Consent so I sent correspondence to you. The child is not at this school \u2014 Your letter to Mr. Murray will be dealt with promptly.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth.\nPovesh Bell 0207 Scoltah Lake\n\n15 yrs old until Sept 87\nOttawa,\nNovember 23, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the daughter of Alex Bull. As I previously told you I wrote to the Agent on the 14th instant and have not yet received his reply.\n\nWhen I received your letter of the 7th instant I was under the impression that you were replying to my letter of October 29 requesting information regarding Glen Houle, No. 213, and Rema Bull, No. 0207.

As I did not consider that the child should be allowed to attend the Edmonton School I did not inform the Department of Alex Bull's wishes. Without my knowledge and without my permission Alex Bull took his daughter up to the Edmonton School.

Under these circumstances I have no alternative but to request that you return Alex Bull's daughter to her parents at the earliest possible date.

When they were returned this September, I of course requested grant for them.\n\nIn the cases of the eight children mentioned in the first part of your letter I shall drop these names in the December quarterly Report, it being understood that they be re-entered in case they return.\n\nThe Department will note that a great many children are out from the Saddle Lake Agency. I indicated this on my September report. Besides the names mentioned in your list -- (five out of the eight being from Saddle Lake, the other three being hospital cases from other reserves) -- there are still ten enrolled children running the reserve at Saddle Lake who should be in school. The five Saddle Lake pupils whom you suggest should be removed from my list simply just stayed out until they grew weary of seeing their names on the roll. The ten still out are as follows:\n\n| Index Number | Name               |\n|--------------|--------------------|\n| 173          | Gordon Steinhauer  |\n| 182          | Ernest Hunter      |\n| 0154         | Ida Heule          |\n| 0168         | Anna Nyatatic      |\n| 0176         | Eva Breerton       |\n| 0187         | Victoria Jackson   |\n| 0202         | Jessie Hunter      |\n| 0212         | Muriel Steinhauer  |\n| 0213         | Doreen Steinhauer  |\n| 0214         | Kathleen Steinhauer|\n\nI may say that I visited the Saddle Lake Agency twice this fall, and spent a lot of money in transportation etc. I would be very glad if the Department checked up on the above list.\n\nI think a little compulsion in one or two selected cases would do a great deal of good. I am prepared to indicate where this compulsion might be used at least in one case.\n\nI would very much like to see something done in clearing up this Saddle Lake situation.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nDecember 10, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe under-mentioned children from your Agency were allowed home on leave from the Edmonton Indian Residential School and have not yet returned:\n\nNo. 173 Gordon Steinhauer No. 0187 Victoria Jackson\n\" 182 Ernest Hunter \" 0202 Jessie Hunter\n\" 0154 Ida Houle \" 0212 Muriel Steinhauer\n\" 0168 Anna Nyatatic \" 0213 Doreen Steinhauer\n\" 0176 Eva Brereton \" 0214 Kathleen Steinhauer\n\nYou should immediately arrange for all of the above children to return to the Edmonton School at the earliest possible date.

Boorse will be in charge of the Saddle Lake Agency until a permanent appointment is made. I am writing to the latter today instructing him to arrange for the return of the children from his Agency who were allowed home on leave and who have not come back to the Edmonton School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

No.110-0-10, in reference to daughter of Alex Bull of Sarcee Reserve.\n\nI may say that this girl has never been in Edmonton Residential School. As stated in former letters I was taking no action in regard to the girl until the decision of the Department was obtained. The father was merely making enquiries and I was merely taking the matter up with the Department.\n\nAs will be noted I have no girl to send home.\n\nThe ruling of the Dept. is quite satisfactory to me.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

This child is on the roll of the Edmonton Indian Residential school, having been placed in that institution in October 1936. While Annie Hunter was in the Edmonton school from this date to the end of the June term in 1939, the parents refused to sign the application for admission.\n\nIn November 1939, the parents voluntarily placed Annie in the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school. The father, Norman Hunter, offered to sign the application for admission of Annie into the Blue Quill's Residential school and he signed the form which I enclose herewith, on the 2nd December 1939. On the 22nd February 1940, the mother Mrs. Norman Hunter took Annie out of the Blue Quill's school. Mrs. Hunter took the girl home where she remained for a time. On the 23rd April 1940, Norman Hunter called the Reverend Principal by phone from Spedden, N. Hunter, why his children had been sent home. He also informed the Reverend Principal that he wanted to place his children in the Blue Quill's school and that he was sending Annie and another child to the school by train from Spedden and that he wished Reverend Father Balter to meet them. This was done and Annie has since April 23rd 1940, been in the Blue Quill's Residential school.\n\nThe parents insisting that they wished to have their children baptized into the Roman Catholic faith, Reverend Father Balter baptized Annie on the 19th May 1940.\n\nAnnie Hunter is shown on the Edmonton Residential school roll as pupil No. 0198 and is now shown on the Blue Quill's Residential school roll as pupil No. 0312.\n\nThe situation in this case today is, that the parents refuse to sign the applications for their children into the Edmonton Residential school. They insist that after taking everything into consideration, including religious faith, they desire that Annie remain in the Blue Quill's Residential school and that she be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nG.P. Schmidt Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nCalgary, Alta.\nI discussed the matter from every angle with the father but there is no change in the parent's attitude and they still insist that they do not want their children in the Edmonton school.\n\nNot being certain just what action should be taken in the matter, I am enclosing application form signed by Norman Hunter requesting admission of his daughter Annie into the Blue Quill's school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gillion,\nIndian Agent.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nNovember 25, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter No. 40-11A.U. or the 4th instant in regard to the applications for admission of certain children into the Edmonton Indian Residential school, I beg to submit the following:\n\nRegarding Annie Hunter, I wish to refer to my letter of even date, file 95 in which this individual case is dealt with fully. This individual case was dealt with separately in view of the fact that she is now on the records of the two schools.\n\nFrancis Jackson and Lillian Hunter are in the same category; children, the parents of whom refuse to sign the applications for admission into the Edmonton Indian Residential school.\n\nThese people advance various reasons for refusing to sign the forms for the Edmonton Residential school, such as distance being too great, difficulty in seeing children when they are sick, slow progress in academic work, difficulty in managing their children when they return from school, etc.\n\nThe attitude of these people is mentioned in my letter No. 95 dated February 19th 1940 dealing with the situation in regard to the Edmonton school. I attach hereto for your information, copy of my letter referred to.\n\nIn cases where parents of eligible children who have been placed in school refuse to sign, should the application forms be forwarded unsigned by the parent with an explanation mentioning reasons given by such parent. There does not appear to be any way of compelling parents to sign, other than moral suasion.\n\nIn regard to George Brest mentioned in the third paragraph of your letter above referred to, this boy is a new pupil and the certificate of health has not been received from the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton Residential school to permit of completion of the application form. Mr. Woodsworth is being asked for this.\n\nC.P. Schmidt Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Collin,\nIndian Agent.\nCalgary, Dec. 24th, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nReference your No. 110-0-10 of October 29th, last, re application for admission to Edmonton Residential School of Francis Jackson, Annie Hunter, Lillian Hunter, and George Breast, Indian children from the Saddle Lake Agency: I beg to say, that upon receipt of your letter, I wrote to Mr. W. K. Gullion, Indian Agent, and to Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, the Principal, regarding same.\n\nWhen at Saddle Lake Agency during the latter part of November, I took the matter up with Agent Gullion, and succeeded in getting certain information, which I asked him to put in letter form, copies of which I attach hereto.\n\nRe Annie Hunter: Agent Gullion, Mr. J.H. Boorse, Farming Instructor, (who is now in charge of the Agency), and myself called at the Blue Quills School in St. Paul: The Principal stated that he had refused her father's request to admit her, but that she had been left at the School. Later an application was signed by the father; this was witnessed by two Indians from Saddle Lake. At a later date the mother took her home, and shortly afterwards the father called the Principal on the phone, and insisted that he take her back. He sent her by train to St. Paul, where she was met, and brought to the School, where she now is. I do not believe Norman Hunter, her father, will ever send her back to Edmonton School. The Agent had no reasons to give for not referring this case to the Department at once -- or at least sooner. I might add that I found the application had been filed away at the Agency Office.\n\nRe Francis Jackson: This boy, I am told, is at the Edmonton School, but the father refuses to sign the application for admission.\n\nRe Lillian Hunter: daughter of Cleophas Hunter; This Girl is also at Edmonton School, and the father refuses to sign the application.\n\nRe George Breast: Agent Gullion's letter explains this case.\n\nWhen discussing the matter with Agent Gullion, he made the following remarks:\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\"In certain instances children are allowed to go, or are sent to Edmonton School with their brothers or sisters, who return there after the summer vacation. I do not know of Rev. Woodsworth visiting the Reserve for recruiting purposes. In some cases I later receive from the Principal a Physical Examination form, duly completed and signed by the Doctor, but the application for admission form merely gives the child's name and age -- not the parent's name and Treaty number. I presume these are sent to me to be completed, and for the signature of the parents. This I usually obtain when I visit the Reserve, and have found out who the parents are,\" -- Mr. Gullion might have added, \"When I don't forget!\" -- Mr. Gullion then continued: \"In some cases the parents refuse to sign, saying they might do so later, if the child likes it at the School. The more I insist, the more stubborn they become in refusing to sign.\"\n\nI might say that I saw a couple of these uncompleted forms at the Agency office. In my opinion, Rev. Mr. Woodsworth does not do his full part in this respect, and it is sometimes a puzzle for the Agent to know who the parents are. For example, Annie and Lillian Hunter, mentioned above: When I first mentioned this matter to the Agent, he stated they were sisters, Norman Hunter's children. When at Blue Quills School, Annie told me Lillian was her niece.\n\nI submit, that before accepting a child into his School, Rev. Woodsworth should have the application form filled in and signed by the parents: I appreciate the Agent's difficulty in having these applications signed months afterwards, by parents who are: (1) Indifferent as regards their children's education; (2) Who do not favour the Edmonton School for various reasons, as stated in the Agent's letters, No. 95 of February 15th and November 25th, 1940.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Pant Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo enclosing letters received from the former Agent at Saddle Lake with reference to certain application forms for children admitted to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. C.P.

No. II5-I-IO, in regard to the children of Lawrence Hunter of Saddle Lake.\n\nI may say that the boy Ernest was admitted to this school March 25th 1935 at the age of 10 years. It will be seen that this was a late age for a child to make a start at school having no knowledge of English or school life. It will also be noted that March is drawing toward the end of the school year and little could be expected of that term. Thus he has been in school not more than four years. I note also by the records that in the fall of 1936 the boy was a month and a half late in returning to school. Again in 1937 he was late. It will thus be seen that the parent was not extremely anxious for the education of his son. In spite of all this this he was in Grade III. Of course this year he did not return to school. I went personally to the reserve for the children and the Agent and myself did our best to get them back. The statement that he can neither add nor write is quite incorrect. It is an old excuse for parents who wish to have a case against the school, but I may say I have no apology for my teachers, or the academic standing of this school. The recent report of Mr. Scott the public school Inspector is no doubt in your hands, and his estimate of our school work should be of some value. I may say that most of the children of Lawrence have been in\nthis school, and have been as a rule very dull and stupid as far as class room work is concerned. Lawrence himself and his brothers and sisters have also been in the school, so I knew pretty much what to expect. Most of them as stated have been dull at books, but have otherwise been of little trouble. From past experience I am quite sure that the boy could be a perfect example of ignorance and stupidity if the occasion required. You ask about other reasons; it is partly a case of mind poisoning. Two or three people on this reserve are trying to be objectionable in regard to this school and this is one of the reactions. Mrs. Ralph Steinhauer, whose letter about this school was some time ago referred to Mr. Inspector Schmidt, has had some influence on the reserve. But little beyond a few malcontents.\n\nI would like to maintain that this Saddle Lake difficulty has been dreadfully overemphasized. I am in constant touch with the people from there, and most of them are as friendly as ever. Lawrence is just sane, and has an idea that he will get something more elsewhere. It would be a serious mistake in the interests of this school, at this time, to give in to Lawrence in the matter of sending his children to Onion Lake. It would merely create more competition and add to the confusion which now exists in the minds of some of these people.\n\nIn talking the matter over with the recent Agent, Mr. Gullion he was of the opinion that compulsion might be used in the case of Lawrence to some advantage, and in my letter to The Department of December 4th I suggested this. I am still of the opinion that it would harm no one, and do a lot of good to have\nthese children brought in to this school as soon as possible. It would clear up much incipient stubbornness.\n\nIn my letter of Dec. 4th I gave the Department a list of a number of children who have not returned to school. To date none of these have been returned. I would greatly appreciate the cooperation of the Department in securing the attendance of those children who are already registered at the school. In the quarterly report recently sent forward the Department will note the cases. I believe a firm attitude in regard to attendance of pupils from this reserve would be of value in every way.\n\nIn regard to the little girl Caroline. On our Roll it is not Caroline but Jessie. Pupil No. 0202. This child came in after Xmas 1936 and is now in Grade II.\n\nI trust this somewhat lengthy letter will be of some value to the Department in regard to the Saddle Lake situation. As stated I trust the Department will not consider the transfer of these children to another school.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 10th instant with reference to Ernest Hunter, No. 182, and Jessie Hunter, No. 0202, of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, whose parents refused to return them to the school upon the expiration of their leave last summer.\n\nFollowing the receipt of your letter we wrote to the Principal of the Edmonton School and it appears that there is no reason why Hunter should complain about the progress of his children.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given to all sides of this case and it has been decided that these children should be returned immediately to the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, Subsection 6 of Section 10 of the Indian Act provides that every member of the R.C.M.P. shall be a truant officer to carry out the sections of the Indian Act.\n\nI also direct your attention to Subsection 4 of Section 10. A member of the R.C.M.P. should be requested to notify Hunter that his children must be returned to the Edmonton School at once. If, after three days, Hunter has not complied the R.C.M.P. may arrest the children without a warrant and convey them to the Edmonton School.\n\nMr. J.H.

You request information in regard to the matter dealt with in paragraph one of the letter signed by Mr. Phalan of January 24th 1941.\n\nI may say that I answered this letter on January 30th 1941. The matter dealt with the cases of Mary Steinhauer and Rema Bull. I can only quote the contents of my letter of January 30th.\n\n\"In regard to Mary Steinhauer No. 0113. In the September quarter I requested that this girl be allowed to continue her time at school. The Department allowed the grant for that quarter and made no comment on my request, so I presumed the request had been granted. This was the only case where I have made a request for continued attendance. Both the mother and the girl herself wish to be continued. I trust my request will be granted.\"\n\n\"In regard to Rema Bull. In your letter of December 6th you are dealing with the same misunderstanding regarding the daughter of Alex Bull of Sarcee. This girl is from Saddle Lake and has nothing to do with your letter of December 6th. Again see your letter of Oct. 29/40 and my reply of December 4th 1940.\"\n\nI trust Mr. Hoey that we will be able to get this Rema Bull case straightened out. The girl was not discharged and apparently she has been confused in the mind of the Department with a Bull girl living at Sarcee, who was never at the school, but whose father made application for her admittance, which request was not granted by the Department.\n\nIf correspondence in regard to this matter cannot be located I shall be glad to forward my file on the matter.\n\nI would be glad if you would let me know if this letter clears up the subject in question.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nJ.F.

A certificate of honourable discharge was forwarded for her on February 28, 1940. We cannot find any record of your having applied for her to remain in the Edmonton School for another year. However, as you consider it advisable to keep her grant will be allowed for her until June 30, 1941. You should advise me on that date whether you intend to discharge her or you wish her to stay for a further period. In the latter event your reasons for so desiring should be stated.\n\nNo. 0207, Rema Bull of Saddle Lake -- entered September 1, 1937, at the age of 13. She is now 17 years of age.

H. Brown an Indian at Skeena Crossing B.C. on the Babine Agency. He wishes his two daughters admitted to this school this fall. Brown has had most of his children in this school from time to time and evidently appreciates what we are trying to do along educational lines. The girl Marthe was at one time in the school but was taken out when a number of other children did not return after holidays.\n\nI am submitting this application for consideration by the Department. If favorable I shall be glad to have the children in the school.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth  \nPrincipal  \nIndian Residential School,  \nEdmonton B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI desire to enrol with you this term my two daughters\u2014\n\nMartha Brown - aged 14 - Grade 9\nSusan Brown - 9\n\nMartha, who was a student of your College about 1936, has just completed Grade 8.\n\nI shall appreciate your early advice regarding this application so that I may send the girls to you on the date you name.\n\nYours very truly,\nThomas H. Brown\nOttawa,\nAugust 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant the Department is prepared to approve Mrs. Gouchier's children being kept at home and sent to the local school provided all expenses are paid by Mrs. Gouchier. The Department would like to be assured that these children are attending regularly. You should have the teacher prepare a statement showing that they are attending regularly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\nSir-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter of the 7th instant enclosing letters received by the Department from Mrs Joe Gouchier, Peers, Alta.\n\nIn reply I beg to report that on July 9th, 1941, I received a letter from Mrs Gouchier making the same request, I replied to her letter and stated that both of the children must return to the Youville Residential School at the end of the holidays.\n\nPeers is approximately 135 miles from Edmonton on the Jasper Highway and it is very doubtful if these children will return to school unless an escort is sent to bring them back. The Department will no doubt recall that it was necessary to have these children escorted by the R.C.M.P. Police when they were placed in the Youville School in September 1935, from Malboro, Alta. 144 miles West of Edmonton.\n\nRegarding Mrs Gouchier's claim in her letter dated August 1st, 1941 that her eldest daughter died from a fall when she was cleaning windows, this is not correct, her daughter Bessie age 8 years was admitted into the T.B. Wing in the Edmonton General Hospital on June 9th, 1938 and died in the T.B. Wing on March 21st, 1941. The parents were away at Peers and I was unable to get word to them and I had the child buried in the R.C. Cemetery at Winterburn.\n\nIn view of the fact that three of Mrs Gouchier's neighbours have stated that she keeps a good home and is quite able to care for the two children I would recommend that they be allowed to stay home and attend the local school, with the understanding that Mrs Gouchier pays all school taxes and any other expenses. Mrs Gouchier informed me in her letter dated July 5th, 1941 that she was receiving $79.00 per month from the Dependents Allowance Board since her husband enlisted in the Army. This being the case I see no reason why part of this money should not be used to educate the two children and save the Department a considerable amount of money.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Williamson M.D.\nOttawa,\nDecember 5, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to Ben Peacock and Percy Lapotac.\n\nBen Peacock was admitted to the Youville Residential School on August 19, 1936, and remained in that institution until June 30 last at which time he was allowed home on holidays. He did not return to the Youville School on the expiry of his leave. In view of the information just given the Department is not prepared to approve his admission to the Edmonton Residential School. You should make arrangements for his immediate return to the Youville Residential School.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your report on the application for the admission of Percy Lapotac. It is extremely doubtful if he is eligible for admission to the Edmonton School on religious grounds. However, the Department is not prepared to make a definite decision in this matter at the present time. As the boy is only 6 years of age, and in view of the difficulty that has arisen regarding his religious status, he should be returned to his guardian immediately. It would be interesting to know when his parents died and on whose authority Lapotac became the guardian of the boy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.C.

Laight,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\nExtract from Inspector Schmidt's report on the Edmonton Indian Residential School dated February 10, 1942.\n\nThe question of admission to this school has, in the past, caused a little dissatisfaction to Mr. W.E. Gullion, the ex-Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, and I am sorry to say that from remarks made by Agent W.F.B. Pugh, recently, he also is not satisfied. The point is this: Children are brought, or sent from their reserves on the Saddle Lake Agency, to the School, or to the School van, either on the reserve or in a neighbouring village, where they are gathered after the holidays. In some cases the parents bring the child, but the application for admission form is not signed. Later, the Principal has the child examined at the School by the Doctor, and if physically fit, sends the application forms to the Indian Agent at Saddle Lake to have them signed by the parents and approved by himself, as Agent. It may be several weeks, or even months, before the Agent can contact the parents, and there have been cases where -- as Mr. Agent Gullion stated in correspondence -- the parents have refused to sign. What the Agent asks is, that the Principal himself get the application signed by the parents. No doubt the resident missionary at Goodfish (Whitefish) Lake Reserve would assist in having these forms signed by the parents, and witnessed, before the child is taken to the school by someone other than the parent or guardian.\nCopy sent to Mr. Woodsworth\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your report regarding your recent visit to the Edmonton Residential School in which you mention that there has been some delay in securing application forms for pupils admitted to the Edmonton Residential School, due to the fact that the children were taken from the reserve before the application forms were signed.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would arrange to have an interview with Indian Agent Pugh and Rev. Mr. Woodsworth before the beginning of the next school year. All of you are familiar with local conditions and I feel that you are the best qualified to fully discuss the matter and decide what action should be taken in the best interests of all parties concerned. All of you are aware that the Department requires an application form and certificate of health for each pupil admitted to a residential school and, at the same time, it is expected that as far as possible the Indian Agent should know what pupils are being sent to a residential school before they are placed in that institution. This requirement is due to the fact that he must certify the application form and in doing so he certifies to the statements made on it.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Rev. Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. C.P.

I have gone into this matter very thoroughly with the members of my staff, also with the boys themselves, and I think that this is possibly the best arrangement that we can make.\n\nI have specified to Hector the various points of danger, such as around the machinery, around the stock yard when the bull might be out, the railway tracks and other places where there might be possible danger. It is Hector's duty to not only be there but to play with the boys which will give them, I think, the best type of supervision, he being an Indian lad from one of our best Indian families and one of our most trusted boys.\n\nYou might let me know what you think of this arrangement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant in which you state that you have arranged to have Hector Jackson supervise the boys outside of classroom hours. In your letter you state that Hector Jackson is 17 years of age. On the December quarter return of the Edmonton School Jackson is shown as 15 years of age. If the information on the December quarter return is correct, I am inclined to feel that Jackson is too young to handle the duties assigned to him. On the other hand, if his correct age is 17 this information should have been shown on the quarterly return as, in that event, he would have reached the age for discharge. I should appreciate hearing further from you regarding this boy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nMarch 17th, 1942.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of March 13th, in further reference to Hector Jackson, I may say at the time of writing, the age on the December Quarter did not enter into my mind. I am quite free to admit these ages are not always correct. In some cases the ages given by the parents when a child is admitted is not always absolutely correct. In the course of a number of years, in copying the New Quarterly from the old one, it is quite possible the ages vary considerably.\n\nIt was my definite thought in regard to Hector Jackson when he left school last summer, that he had not attained his 16th birthday. It was his wish as well as that of his parents, that he return to school to finish up his work during the following year. However owing to the fact that he was alone with considerable farm work, the boy did not return to school until recently.\n\nThe mother returned with the boy and the matter of his age came up in our conversation, and I was somewhat surprised when she told me that he was actually 17 years old. The request of the parents and also the boy is that he remain in school and get his Diploma. My request is that the boy remain in school until end of September when he will be given considerable work to do on the farm; this is also the wish of his parents. In the mean time he is part-time in classroom and other times attending to duties assigned to him.\n\nI trust this explanation is satisfactory to the Department, and that my request regarding the boy be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal\n\nAt present the boy is doing good work in caring for the small boys.\n\nJ.F.W.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant with reference to Hector Jackson. I note that it is now definitely settled that he is 17 years of age. We will continue to allow grant for him to June 30, 1942. If you wish to keep him after that date you will have to make your own arrangements with him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nApril 15, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn checking the March quarter return of the Edmonton Residential School it is found that the pupils numbered as follows are shown to be 16 years of age or over:\n\nNo. 172 No. 0109\n\" 183 \" 0133\n\" 189 \" 0175\n\" 199 \" 0207\n\" 200\n\nAt the end of June the Principal should either apply for their discharge or request permission to retain them for a further period. In the latter event, full particulars should be given regarding his reasons for wishing to keep them in the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.C. Laight,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn regard to the list of details mentioned in your letter to Mr. Laight and taken from my March quarterly report, I would make the following recommendations -\n\nPupil No. 172 - Willard Little Poplar. This boy is one of our best boys, has made good progress in his studies, and as far as I have been able to make out from his own attitude and that of his father, wishes to continue in the school. I would request that he may be allowed another year as a pupil of this school.\n\nPupil No. 183 - Stanley Sinclair. Stanley has been doing very good work both in the school and on the farm and I think another year would be of benefit to him in both these spheres. I would request that he be allowed another year.\n\nPupil No. 189 - Willis Morgan. See above correspondence. Discharge recommended.\n\nPupil No. 199 - Robert Seenum. The father has requested that this boy be allowed to remain at school for another year. He has good possibilities and I recommend that the father's request be granted.\n\nPupil No. 200 - Elmer Jackson. I recommend that this boy be discharged from school at the end of June. I might also add the name of Pupil No. 180 - Hector Jackson of whom we have had correspondence recently, that he be discharged.\n\nPupil No. 0109 - Sophia Steinhauer. This girl is 18 years of age and has been in the school since she was about five years of age. She has no home, is undersized, and is pretty much dependent upon the school for her well being. Her father is Mark Steinhauer of Saddle Lake - her mother is dead, and Mark has another wife and family. I would like to see this girl stay in school.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nPupil No. 0133 - Perle McDonell. Another girl without a home, also 18 years of age. I would like her to remain at school if at all possible.\n\nPupil No. 0173 - Sophie Waskatineau. Recommend her discharge from school.\n\nPupil No. 0207 - Rema Bull. I would recommend this girl's discharge from the school.\n\nMay I suggest that this list be appended to my report sent to you last month in reference to the pupils recommended for discharge.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nJFW/FF\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nMay 13, 1942.\n\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome weeks ago I was in receipt of a letter from Mr. Laight of the Edmonton Agency regarding the pupils who were up for discharge or otherwise at the end of June 1942.\n\nRe Matthew Wesley, pupil No. 170 from the Babine Agency - I recently had a letter from Mr. Mallinson regarding the B.C. children. It is now a good many years since they came here and there has been a good deal of pressure brought to bear upon Mr. Mallinson by the parents for their discharge. I feel from the human standpoint that it is hardly fair to keep them longer from contact with their parents and with their native surroundings, and I am therefore, requesting that all of the B.C. children, with the exception of Matthew Wesley, be discharged and sent home.\n\nMatthew is one of the best boys we have had in the school - there has never been any problem in regard to discipline or conduct and he has the capacity for development along either academic or vocational lines. As pointed out by Mr. Mallinson, he has no home in Hazelton and the other day in talking to the boy himself he said that he would rather remain at the school than go to his home. I would therefore, like to retain Matthew Wesley as a pupil of this school for at least another year, and endeavor to give him special instructions along vocational lines, particularly along the line of manual training, in which the Department has specialized.\n\nThe other B.C. children's names are as follows:\n\n- Willis Morgan - Pupil No. 189\n- Richard Morgan - Pupil No. 191\n- Matilda Gungoat - Pupil No. 0158\n- Elsie Green - Pupil No. 0165\n- Elsie Turley - Pupil No. 0189\n\nI may also say that particularly during the holidays these girls as they grow older present quite a moral problem for the school in the line of supervision and I think that they should go home.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to discharging pupils from the Edmonton Residential School at the end of June.\n\nThe discharge of pupils numbered as follows is approved:\n\n| No. | No. | No. |\n|-----|-----|-----|\n| 180 | 200 | 0173 |\n| 189 | 0158 | 0189 |\n| 191 | 0165 | 0207 |\n\nPupils numbered 172, 183, 199, 0109 and 0133 are 16 years of age or over and in the case of the last two mentioned it is noted that they are 18 years of age. There is no authority in the Indian Act by which we can approve children remaining in a residential school after they reach the age of 16 years. Besides, no difficulty should be experienced in these young people obtaining work this year. As a matter of fact we have had dozens of offers of positions for Indian pupils in Eastern Canada and many of these we were unable to fill. Taking these facts into consideration, the Department cannot see its way clear to approve these pupils remaining in the Edmonton School for a further period. Consequently, they should also be discharged at the end of June.\n\nThe quarterly return shows that Matthew Wesley is 15 years of age and the Department approves his remaining in the Edmonton School until June 30, 1943.\n\nRev.

Until a definite decision is made in this particular regard, no action can be taken on the application of Henry Giant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, July 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRecent information indicates that it is unlikely that the Edmonton Residential School will be used for other purposes than Indian work. Consequently the Department approves the admission to that school of Raymond Albert Giant and Henry Giant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nOttawa,\nAugust 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe possibility of using the Youville School and the Edmonton School for Japanese has probably received the attention of the Indians in your Agency. However, subsequent developments indicate definitely that these buildings will not be used for the purpose originally suggested and consequently both schools should continue during the academic year 1942-43. Rumours that have been current will no doubt have an unsettling effect on the Indians and, as a result, many of them may not wish to return their children to whichever school these children formerly attended. The Department, therefore, desires that you will co-operate fully with the Principal of either of the above schools in returning children. I have no doubt that you have done this in the past, but I feel that an extra effort will probably be required this year.\n\nI should appreciate your advising me later regarding the action you have taken in returning to the schools mentioned pupils who were enrolled during the past academic year and are eligible to return, as well as the assistance you give to the Principals to recruit new pupils who reach school age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSent to the following Agents:\n\nMr. G.C. Laight, Winterburn.\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Hobbema.\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Saddle Lake.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your 110-1-10 of the 17th Ult: regarding the return of pupils to the Edmonton Indian Residential School and in reply beg to report that as soon as I knew for certain that this school was not being closed I immediately informed all Protestant Indians at this Agency of the fact, and informed them that their children would be returning to the Edmonton School on the 1st September.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I requested the Farming Instructor to inform all Protestant parents that their children would be leaving for Edmonton on the 1.55 P.M. train on the 1st September. I posted notices in the Indian waiting room and informed all protestant Indians I came in contact with.\n\nI returned 20 old pupils, 3 new ones, from Hobbema; there are 4 pupils who spent their vacation at the Sarcee reserve, who will return direct from there, 2 boys given permission to remain out for a further two weeks and there are two new children going when the above two boys return.

The children from the Saddle Lake end of the Agency will be in however on September 2nd, as they are not affected by the epidemic.\n\nI may say that this outbreak means quite a setback to my enrolment, and I trust that some adjustment may be made in the per capita grant to take care of the loss entailed.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth.\nPrincipal.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\n\nAugust 28th 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nYesterday I visited the Indian Agent and the United Church Missionary, Mr. Law, at Hobbema. While there I discussed various problems with both these gentlemen. Two cases in particular were somewhat disturbing; first that of the two girls of James Louis who are now registered in this school\u2014Pupils Nos. 0245 and 0246 Mary and Lily Louis both of whom have been in this school for two years. I believe that an application has already been forwarded to the Department signed by Jim Louis and probably written by Father Moulin asking that these girls be taken from this school and placed in the Erminskin school. This has been done under the pretext that Jim has turned R.C. and wishes the girls transferred. If you will note, the applications were made out in good faith and signed by the father as a Protestant. From the information gathered I learn that Father Moulin has brought great pressure to bear upon this family, by constant coaxings and has evidently at last persuaded the father to sign the document forwarded to you. As Principal of this school and as a Protestant I feel this is a flagrant violation, at least in spirit, of the effort of the Department to have Protestant children attend Protestant schools and visa versa. I protest most emphatically against this action of Father Moulin. I have arranged for the children to return to school from Hobbema on Thursday Sept. 2nd, in accordance with your letter of June 15th 1943, No.150-37. It seems too bad that plans made to carry out Departmental wishes should be thwarted by an effort on the part of this Father Moulin to disrupt the efforts of cooperation which should exist at this time. I would like a communication to be in the hands of Mr. Indian Agent, Col Louis by Next Thursday authorizing the return of these two girls. I may say that Jim Louis\u2014or Lightning\u2014is a graduate of this school.\n\nAnother matter was brought to my attention, also another case of the activities of Father Moulin. The Department is also in receipt of a letter regarding this matter. Some two or three years ago I married, at Hobbema, Emily Littlepoplar to John Strongman of the Montana Band. Their child was baptized by Mr. Law. Since then Father Moulin has constantly pestered the family to have the child re-baptized as a R.C. Much against the protests of the mother whom the priest ignores. The action of Father Moulin has caused deep resentment among the Protestant people of this community. And yet, as Indians usually are, they seem unable to withstand the subtle approach he makes. As a measure of decency I do not think these unwelcome and incessant aggressions on the part of Father Moulin should be allowed to continue. No doubt Father Moulin thinks that any form of aggression is justified according to his conception of religion but I wish to enter my protest against the way he is interfering with our Protestant community.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\n\nCopy of this letter sent to Dr. Dorey.\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th instant, with reference to Mary and Lily Louis, numbers 0245 and 0246 of the Edmonton Residential School. Up to this date no request has been received by this Branch for their transfer to any other Indian residential school.\n\nI have also noted your remarks regarding the child of John Strongman. We do not appear to have received any previous correspondence regarding this matter.\n\nThe contents of your letter will be brought to the attention of Mr. Hoey on his return to the office from a business trip.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

In the statement signed by Louis and his wife it is stated that their children were baptized in the Catholic Church on January 23, 1939, whereas, in the letter of the Principal of the Ermineskin School, it is stated that these children were baptized on January 23, 1932. As you will note there is a considerable difference in these two statements and you should again interview both the parents and the Principal with a view to ascertaining which is the correct date. In replying you might let me know whether Louis and his wife were married in the Catholic Church or in the Protestant Church.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWe, the undersigned, James Louis (Lightning) (non-Catholic) and Justine Strongman, Roman Catholic, wish to have our two girls, Mary Elizabeth and Lily Rose, transferred from the Edmonton Protestant Indian School to the Roman Catholic Ermineskin Indian School of Hobbema.\n\nThe reason for our request is that our children have been rechristened in the Roman Catholic faith on January 23rd, 1939, and we hereby wish to have them educated and brought up in their belief and creed.\n\nFather: Jim Louis\nMother: Justine Strongman + (her mark)\nWitnesses: James Crowe (child)\nPoveshute\n\nHobbema Indian Agency,\nAUG 25 1943\nHOBBEMA, ALTA.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the presence of the two witnesses named: Chief James Crane of the Samson Band, and Mr Louis H.

The child having been brought up as Protestant by her grandparents since she was six months old I have always considered her to be a Protestant, I was unaware that the child had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Faith.\n\nThe mother Mrs. Jee Alexis has now asked that the child be transferred from the Edmonton Residential School to the Youville Residential School, I have received a Certificate of Baptism showing that Bella Marie Alexis was baptised at the Roman Catholic Mission at Lac-Ste-Anne on the 17th of September 1933, she was born on the 9th of August 1933.\n\nSince Mrs. Alexis requested that the child be transferred I have interviewed the grandfather who informs me that Bella was given to him and his wife by her parents when she was six months old, that they have always considered her to be their own child and had brought her up as a Protestant, and that it was his wish that Bella attend the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nIf I may be permitted, I would recommend that due to the fact that the parents have had nothing to do with the bringing up of this child since she was six months old that the grandparents request be granted and the child remain in the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nG. G. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1944.\n\nMr. A.G.B. Lewis, Indian Agent, Hobbema, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to Lilly and Mary Louis. I have reviewed your letter of September 21 and it would appear that the parents and children are now recognized as Catholics. However, before finally approving their admission to a Catholic residential school the Department would like to have a letter signed by both parents in which they agree to allow their children to remain in the school in which they will be placed until they reach the age of discharge.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1944.\n\nMr. G.C. Laight, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to Bella Marie Alexis. The information given in your letter was not supplied when application was made for her admission to the Edmonton Residential School. If you had supplied this information at that time the application would not have been immediately approved.\n\nAs no legal adoption has been made by the grandparents the Department is inclined to feel that the wishes of the parents should be recognized. However, before making a final decision on what school this child should be placed in we wish to see the statement signed by both parents stating the school in which they desire their child educated and also agreeing to allow the child to remain in that particular school until she reaches the age of 16 years.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAGENT'S REPORT\n\nRespecting the Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nFor the month of December 1943.\n\nROUTINE\n\nAt the time of my visit there were:\n\n102 pupils in the classrooms.\n\nAre the classroom registers kept up to date?

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to report that I have received a complaint from Rev. J. F. Woodsworth, Principal of the Edmonton Indian Residential School regarding the conduct of Pupil No. 0258, Lettie Rain, Age 14 years. I am informed by the Principal that this girl is very insulting to the teachers and matron of the school, that she has a very bad influence on the other children and that recently she tried to get three other girls to run away from the school. Mr. Woodsworth states that he has punished Lottie but that it has no effect and he has asked that she be expelled from the school.\n\nPersonally I am not in favor of the girl being expelled, in my opinion this form of punishment does not have the desired effect upon an Indian, it only encourages other pupils to misbehave themselves hoping that they will be expelled from school for the same reason. I would recommend that Lettie Rain be placed in the Home of Sisters of Our Lady of Charity Good Shepherd, 11409-96th Street, Edmonton, Alberta., for a period of four months from May 1st until September 30th 1944 then returned to the school, this would be more punishment than expelling her from school, as she would not be able to go home for the summer holidays, it would also be a lesson to the other pupils of the school. The cost of keeping her in the Home of the Good Shepherd would be $15.00 per month.\n\nG. G. Laight,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 29, 1944.\n\nMr. G.C. Laight, Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to Lottie Rain, No. 0256, Edmonton Indian Residential School.

Fully intending to leave here. When the mother was leaving she was going to take the little girl, and I simply insisted that the child remain. Of course the mother was rather cross at my show of insistence, but finally accepted her return fare for herself and child to Edmonton and back. I suppose she claims that the child was forced into school against her wish. But I did not consider that after the woman had spent several days at the school, that for the sake of a little whim she should take the child home. The too she accepted the train fare.\"\n\nFor your information the mother left here with the intention of putting the child in school.

I may say that I wrote to Col. A.G.R. Lewis, Indian Agent at Hobbema and received the following reply from him about Pupil No. 0268 Hazel Ward. See his letter May 15th No.R IO-a.\n\n\"Jim Ward has been declared of White Status, therefore is no longer allowed to share any privileges of the Samson Band of Indians.\"\n\nI may say that the whole family of Wards for the past 20 years have received their education in this school. I am aware that at Hobbema there has been considerable discussion regarding the status of this family. The little girl came into school in the fall as her brothers and sisters had done for the past 20 years. So I sent her application to the agent along with others. Being so late in the year (May 15), I did not send the child home until the end of June. I understand Jim Ward is still at Hobbema. Another sister is registered at the school as well as an older brother, having been admitted while Jim was in good standing in the Samson Band. Is it the intention of the Department to turn these children out of the school next term? The foregoing are the circumstances for the Department not receiving application for Hazel Ward.\n\nIn regard to Marina Hunter I sent applications to Mr. Pugh\nat Saddle Lake. I presume they will reach Ottawa when signed by parents. I am dropping a note to Mr. Pugh with your request.\n\nI note what you say about placing Nos. 201, 234, 235 in proper sequence.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nJuly 21, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to Hazel Ward, No. 0268, Bert Ward, No. 205, and Jenny Ward, No. 0250.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I made inquiries in this office and find that the status of Jim Ward was carefully investigated at the close of 1943 and from January 1, 1944, Ward and his family were removed from membership in the Samson Band under Section 18 of the Indian Act.\n\nIn view of the above the children mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter are not eligible for admission or further education in an Indian residential school and they should be considered discharged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

At the present time the girl is working in the home of the Rev. L. Rowe as a general maid. Susan's aunt Mrs Alex. Bull is a patient in our hospital suffering from an incurable disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis. As a result the aunt is unable to exercise any supervision or care of this young girl.

F. Murray, Indian Agent, Sarcee Indian Agency, asking his opinion as to whether this girl should be kept in school until she reached the age of 18 years, seeing that she was an orphan.

Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Complaint Alkie Simon\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 28th, in which you enclosed an extract from a letter supposedly written by one Alexis Simon, #114, Paul's Band, I beg to advise that a few days after I received your letter I had the man into my office & had a talk with him. He said that he did not write the letter himself but that the letter was the outcome of a meeting which several of the Indians had had on the reserve with some white man.\n\nI asked him if he had any specific charges to make against the doctor, but he had nothing definite, only generalities. He said however that some of the other Indians had complaints to make, so I told him that I would be at the reserve headquarters on October 12th & would be prepared to listen to any complaints & for him to let the other Indians know that I would be there.\n\nWhen I got there in the morning, there were no Indians around & after waiting for a time I went around & visited several homes, in fact all the homes where there was anyone staying. I then came back to headquarters & found Alexis & Peter Burnstick waiting for me, but no others. I had a talk with them & they claimed that Dr. Conroy did not give the Indians enough attention and that they were not at all satisfied with the way he examined the sick & mentioned several cases where he had been neglectful & where the patients had died, but these were all old cases & nothing recent. While visiting at the different homes & enquiring after the sick, I found that in every case the Indians were not satisfied with the service they were getting. They seemed to think that if an Indian had a toothache, it was up to the doctor to come out there forty or forty five miles & do what was necessary. I explained to them that it would be a whole lot easier for the Indian to go into Edmonton.\nEdmonton to see the doctor than it was for the doctor to come out to the reserve, unless it was in the case of an accident or some serious illness, but they seemed to have the impression that the doctor should come to them.\n\nI didn't at all like their attitude & it seems to me that they are being stirred up by someone on the outside. Everything seemed to be wrong with the way their affairs had been administered and I think they really have been allowed to get out of hand and have been allowed to do pretty much as they pleased, with the result that they have done practically no work and have made up their minds that it is up to the government to look after them.\n\nI arranged for another meeting on Thursday the 26th & had a much better attendance of Indians then. They had just got through threshing their crop & it was pitifully small.\n\nPrevious to the meeting, I had had the doctor visit the reserve & go around the homes with the farming instructor & check on any cases of sickness. This would appear to have pleased them for there were no more complaints about lack of attention and they told me they were glad I had the doctor visit them & he had listened to them & had paid more attention to what they had to tell them.\n\nIn a great many cases it is wasted effort for the doctor to go out to visit them, for, after visiting them & telling them what to do, they will not follow his instructions & will not go to the hospital.\n\nI think myself that if the doctor were to make periodic general visits to the reserve & go around the homes with myself or the farming instructor, a much better feeling could be established amongst these Indians & I would recommend that this be done about once a month, weather permitting.\n\nI hardly think there will be any more kicks.\n\nJ.T.Faunt,\nActing Indian Agent.\nDuffield Alberta\nSeptember 20th 1944\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWould you please inform me at what age our children must start school, is it compulsory to let our children be taken away from us to a boarding school at so young an age as 7 years. I have one child of 7 years that the agent and doctor insist I must let go, or the R.C.M.P. will get after me, this appears to be very unfair as my child cannot do anything for itself, why are not allowed a day school on the reserve for our younger children up to 10 years of age, this would be much better for our children, and more acceptable to us parents, surely we are entitled to some rights.\n\nI volunteered for service in this war, and have a discharged badge No. 6547, yet I have no right to expect fair treatment, nor right to express any opinion, just do as I am ordered, this treatment is creating a very discontented feeling among a lot of us.\n\nWe have also a strong resentment against the way our sick are being treated, we are not allowed to have any other doctor than Dr. Conroy of Edmonton, but when he is needed he comes when it suits him, sometimes 2 or 3 days late, and when he does consent to come he often does not get out of his car, just looks through the window, and says \"there's nothing the matter with you.\"\naway he goes, but I bet he don't forget to put in his expenses for the trip; it is very unsatisfactory, and certainly not fair to us, we get no examination, or very seldom, we are only Indians so why bother, the sooner we are extinct the better that's the attitude, why cannot we have our own choice of doctor its too bad we are such a bother to the government, but if agents and doctors were given to understand we are human beings and must be treated as such, there would be a better understanding between us and the White man, some of us do try and make good, but we are all treated the same, as if we are a nuisance.\n\nI regret having any complaint to make but many of us feel these two subjects could be dealt with in a better way.\n\nWish for a better understanding and fair treatment\n\nrespectfully yours,\n\nAlgie Simon\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReferring to your letters of November 10th & of September 29th, in which you enclosed copy of a letter received from one Alexis Simon of \"abamun reserve,\" I might say that on October 30th I replied to an excerpt from this same letter which had been forwarded to me by Dr. Falconer & am enclosing copy of my reply herewith.\n\nWith regard to the first portion of the letter in which Simon says that the agent & doctor insisted that Simon's child go to school, otherwise the R.C.M.P. would be after him, this is all fiction. I was there with Mr Laight at Duffield when the children were being examined prior to going to school & sending of the police was never mentioned by either Mr Laight or the doctor.\n\nSimon has a girl of school age, which should be in school but though he is a catholic himself, he wants the child to go to Edmonton Residential School, which is a protestant school.\n\nHe has seen Mr Woodsworth about it, but Mr Woodsworth wants nothing to do with it, as it would only cause friction between the two churches.\n\nThis child is 11 years old & is not very strong & am satisfied that she is much better out of school, but if you would consider an application to put her in the protestant school I can obtain one & send it in, though, as I have already said Mr Woodsworth does not want her.\n\nAttention of Mr Phelan.\n\nJ.T. Faunt.\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 6, 1944.\n\nMr. J.T. Faunt, Acting Indian Agent, Winterburn, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the communication received from Alexis Simon. In view of the information contained in your letter his daughter is not eligible for admission to the Edmonton Indian Residential School -- see Subsection 2 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. However, I note that, as the girl is not in good physical condition, you do not consider that she should be placed in any residential school at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name\nAge\nName of Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\nFather's full name and No.\nMother's full name and No.\nParents living or dead\nState of child's health\nReligion\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

But it was I that wrote the letter for her. The Duffield girls never do any dirty tricks to her. Also the ladies try their very best to do good things to us all; I just write what she say to me in the letter. I hope you will forget all about that lie. It is not true. By the way she thinks the girls are getting after her when they tease her. But will never do that again telling lies in the letter. I'm telling you the true. But I don't remember when did I saucy talk about the ladies in this letter. Because they are trying to be good us, and they sure work hard for the children. That was the first letter we told a lie. If she didn't tell me to write that I wouldn't want to tell a lie. I was surprised when she told me to tell on the Duffield girls. Because she never says anything about the girls, when I write for her. I really don't remember when did the girls say anything to her. Maybe she missed understood them. That's all I'm saying for now.\n\nSo goodbye\n\nFrom (signed) Leslie Jackson\n\nI'm very sorry I won't every do that again. Please forgive me all this dirty lies. (signed) Leslie Jackson.\nIndian Res. School\nEdmonton March 17/45\nAita.\n\nTo Mr. H. Sunday,\nSaddle Lake,\nAita.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDr. Woodsworth gave me your letter, which he received yesterday.\n\nI was surprised, as I have never heard of anyone hurting or getting after Martha.\n\nI questioned Martha and she says the girls are not bad to her.\n\nAs you know Martha cannot write a letter herself, and she got one of the Good Fish Lake girls to write it for her. I think this girl must or had a mean streak in her, and wanted to make trouble for Martha or the school. (\"there is no truth in it\").\n\nI am looking after the girls myself, and know fairly well what is going on. So you need not worry over Martha.\n\nWe have had one of the best winters in the school. No sickness and all pupils passed their X-ray without any active T.B. among them, so we have something to be thankful for.\n\nTrusting this will explain just how this story started.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nC.M. McDonald.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nMarch 14th 1945\n\nTo the Principal of the School,\nIna. Res. School, Edmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Preacher,\n\nI am writing to you about Martha. I heard that she is being treated meanly by the girls and so I do not want that girl to be treated badly. When I thought of putting her to school there I wouldn't have liked it. She was a bad girl, but I know myself that she is a good girl cause I've brought her up myself, and so I'm just going to take her out of school when she comes for her holidays. She won't be there any more. I thought of putting 2 more girls to school but I am not sending them. We have a district school here 2 miles from our place and so I'm sending them there. Maybe the ladies don't care and watch the girls the way they treat her, and so I am going to tell you about myself. I was in school at Red Deer Ina. School. My father used to tell me something to try and be good in school, and as I tried to do what my father used to tell me, I wasn't bad or mean in school, and the children were bad to me, no matter when I never said anything they used to hit me lots of times. And lots of times too they would fight me 2 or 3 getting after me, and from there the way they hit me I used to have pains all over, and not strong, and so that's why I don't like this the way the other girls treat her, cause she won't be strong enough, and so I'm just going to take her out of school that what I promise you. I am not doing this behind your back that way I am meaning this and telling you that I am going to do. That's all I could tell you.\n\nYours truly\n\n(Signed) Mr. Nathaniel Sunday.\nIndian Residential School  \nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA  \nEDMONTON  \nALBERTA\n\nMarch 21, 1945\n\nThe Secretary  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment of Mines and Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, herewith, a copy of a letter I received from Nathaniel Sumay of Saddle Lake, Alberta. Nathaniel is a Treaty Indian or the Saddle Lake Agency and has a daughter Martha in this school. As you will note, Nathaniel writes regarding the treatment of his daughter and states very emphatically that he does not intend to send the girl back to school after the holidays. I also enclose a letter which Miss McDonald, our Matron, wrote Nathaniel in reply to his letter. We also have evidence that this story is entirely false, as you will see by the enclosed letter signed by Elsie Jackson.\n\nThis whole thing may appear to be very trivial and something of a tempest in a tea-pot to be writing to the Department about. But I feel that it involves a matter that should receive the attention of the Department. It would hardly seem reasonable that the Department would allow a parent off hand to decide whether his child should attend school or not particularly after she has been admitted by the Department. There have been a number of such cases during the past few months where the parents for little or no reason whatever are keeping their children out of school. There are at present eight children from the Saddle Lake Agency who are still out of school, and the agent Mr. Pugh finds it impossible to get them back. As far as I know there is at present time no adequate reason why they should not be in school. I believe that Mr. Pugh has done all in his power outside of police action to get these children back. I am sure that it would be greatly appreciated if the Department would strengthen the hand of the Indian Agent in dealing with this and similar cases.\n\nI am writing this letter to you early in the year, long before holidays so that next fall when school opens some of these problems of attendance may be well in hand, and we may not experience some of the difficulties which we have experienced during the last few years.\n\nIn spite of the apparent triviality of this matter I trust the Department will give this letter consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth, Principal\n\nP.S.: I am sending copies of these letters to Mr. Pugh.\nOttawa, April 4, 1945.\n\nMr. W.P.B. Pugh, Indian Agent,\nSt. Brides, Alberta.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated the 21st instant from the Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, with reference to a request that he received from Nathaniel Sunday, of the Saddle Lake Reserve, for the discharge of his daughter from the Edmonton School. Mr. Woodsworth also enclosed copies of letters that have been sent to Mr. Sunday and he states in his letter that he has forwarded copies of these to you.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I feel that Sunday's daughter should remain in the Edmonton School during the current academic year. If you consider it necessary to review her case for the academic year 1945-46, you can write me in June.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, April 20, 1945.\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth, Principal, Edmonton Indian Residential School, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the March Quarterly Return of the Edmonton Residential School, a copy of Form I.A. 411 was not sent. Instructions regarding this form were given in circular letter of December 29, 1944 and in that letter Principals were informed that a copy of Form 411 must be forwarded with the quarterly returns.\n\nPlease obtain and forward application form and certificate of health for No. 0277 Sylvia Houle.\n\nPupils No. 197, 0186, 0201 and 0205 are over sixteen years of age and if they desire to remain in school after June, 1945, it will be necessary for you to make formal application to the Department for permission for them to remain and at that time you should state the reasons for desiring them to remain.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe Martha Sunday.\n\nReference to your letter of April 4th in regards to Nathaniel Sunday and his Agency having some unpleasant correspondence with the Principal of the Edmonton Residential School, I beg to report that I spoke to Sunday last week in this connection and he said \"that was nothing I might be sending two more children anytime now\". For your information Sunday is a very eccentric character, he is all for you one day and all against you the next day, for that matter I have constantly worked on him ever since I have been here to send his children to school and this Martha girl going to school was the first time I got him to allow a girl to go to school. I do not anticipate any further trouble over the matter.\n\nW.P.B. Pugh,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 19, 1945.\n\nMr. J. T. Faunt, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the June quarter return of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, an application form should be forwarded for pupil No. 0277, Sylvia Houle.\n\nPupils numbered 213; 222; 228; 230; 234; 0257; 0262; 0269 and 0271 have been absent from the school for over a year. If they do not intend to return in the near future, application should be made for their discharge, so that their names may be removed from the return.\n\nThe Principal did not forward a copy of Form 411. Specific instructions were issued to all Principals several months ago to the effect that Form 411, giving the information requested, must accompany each quarterly return. Please request him to forward one for the June quarter and point out to him that such form must accompany all future quarterly returns.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nJuly 26th, 1945.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe your letter of April 20, 1945 - No. IIo-0-10\n\nPupil No. 197 is recommended for discharge. He has been home on the reserve during the past year and is now 16 years of age. Pupil No. 0106 whom we thought might return last year is now married and living on the Hobbema Agency.\n\nIn regard to Pupils Nos. 0201 and 0205. These are two very capable and promising girls. Last year at the suggestion of the Department they took their Grade IX here at the school instead of attending Alberta College as was also suggested. I do not consider that they had a fair chance in their studies. I started the term with a good teacher who was interested in their work, but at Xmas time this teacher left and I was only able to secure a young woman as teacher without proper qualifications for teaching high school subjects. The result was that the girls did not try their exams. I would like to see these two girls repeat their year attending Alberta College. They themselves wish to return and their parents, I believe are also agreeable. I request that they remain at school, and that the Indian Affairs Branch pay their per capita and also an amount which will enable them to attend Alberta College. The school to assume part of the extra costs of attendance.\n\nI may say that some years ago pupils from this school took high school work at this institution and did fairly good work. These are the first pupils since then who have been interested in advanced work. I trust that it will be possible to let them continue with their education.\n\nP.S. Pupil No. 0201 is Eleanor Seenum of Goodfish Lake\nPupil No. 0205 is Violet Steinhauer of Saddle Lake.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1945.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, the Department approves the discharge of pupils No. 197 and No. 0186 from the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nEdmonton, Alta.,\nIndian Residential School  \nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA  \nEDMONTON  \nALBERTA\n\nI think I have dealt with the matters of discharges appearing in the June quarter by direct letter. However, I shall attend to the matter of forwarding Form 411.\n\nIn regard to a copy of the quarterly reports being filed in your office:- I quite agree that this should be done, but owing to the fact that all this work is done by hand it involves quite a task to prepare three copies. At present I send a copy to the Branch at Ottawa and keep one for office use. In order to make it possible for the proper number of forms to be made out, may I recommend that a wide carriage typewriter be provided this school by the Branch.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S. I am writing directly to you Mr. Haunt, you might pass this information on to Ottawa. I am sending you June quarterly return under another cover.\n\nI note that pupils 0257 and 0263 are from the Robbema agency. The others from Saddle Lake.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY  \nAUG 10 1945  \nWinterburn, Alta.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nAugust 8th 1945.\n\nMr. J. W. Faunt,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Faunt;\n\nI have your letter re. matters concerning the June quarterly report. In regard to Sylvia Houle, I may say that I had this girl examined by the M.D. last April and immediately forwarded the application to the Indian agent at Saddle Lake. Since then I have had no information regarding the application form. I may say that this form is doubtless in the hands of the parents of this girl.\n\nIn regard to the pupils mentioned in the 2nd paragraph. Time and again I have taken this matter up with the Indian Agent at Saddle Lake. I have also written directly to the Indian Affairs Branch urging that some action be taken to have these children sent to school. I do not consider that I should apply for their discharge as most of them should be in school, and applying for discharge is merely an easy way of getting over a difficulty. I have pointed out to the Branch that every year there are a large number who are absent from this Agency, and who stay out without apparently any compulsion being applied on the part of the government authorities. If these children for any reason should not attend I would appreciate very much being informed of the reasons for non-attendance, but so far the only reasons advanced is that the parents will not send them in.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 19th regarding the June quarter return of the Edmonton Indian Residential School, I wrote to Mr. Woodsworth, sending him a copy of your letter & now have a reply from him, copy of which I am enclosing herewith.\n\nI don't know what grounds Mr. Woodsworth may have for his complaint against the government authorities at the Saddle Lake Agency, but I do think it is too bad that the children concerned should be deprived of an education, if a little pressure applied in the proper place would get them to school.\n\nWhen I came here about a year ago, I asked Mr. Woodsworth to furnish me with a copy of his quarterly return, but he said he had never been called upon to furnish one to the Agency & he did not feel that it was necessary. I contend however, that if I am supposed to supervise the school, I should have a copy of the returns & also that the returns for Ottawa should go through this office.\n\nMr. Woodsworth would now appear to be of the opinion that I should have a copy of the returns & suggests that he be furnished with a wide carriage typewriter, on which to make out these forms & others, requiring the use of a wide carriage machine.\n\nIf such a machine could be made available to Mr. Woodsworth I would recommend that it be furnished.\n\nJ.T.

J. F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nStoney Indian Agency,\nMorley, Alberta,\nNovember 2nd, 1945.\n\nHighlights of a Meeting held on\nStony Indian Reserve\nMorley\n\nSilas Abraham Wesley (Nordegg)\n\nIt was his first time at a meeting like this. The old people found they couldn't get along on the Reserve and they had been living in Nordegg since the first white man between 60 and 80 years. The boys were now growing up and trying to make a living for themselves.\n\nHe said that there were some old people in Nordegg and he wanted to get a permit for them to obtain extra rations.\n\nThe Indians of Nordegg wanted a school.\n\nHe wanted an extension of the trapping season so that they could get more fur. At present he would only take five marten and he wanted to take 12.\n\nMr. Allan At this Point Mr. Allan interjected. He took Silas Abraham's points from the last first.\n\nHe explained that the trapping regulations were made by the Province and he was surprised that the Indians were allowed to take any marten at all. If this was true Alberta was possibly the only province in the Dominion allowing an open season on marten because they were so scarce.\n\nHe advised Abraham that he was very fortunate in this regard and warned him to take only what he was allowed and to protect and see that the remainder of the marten were protected for the future of his own children as well as for the future of all trappers.\n\nHe explained that at present the Dominion Government has a man employed full time in Alberta re-stocking Indian trap lines. Today there are 950 trap line licenses issued whereas four years ago there were none. The department was trying to re-stock all Indian trap lines especially in isolated areas and to that end last year 55 live beaver had been transplanted from their own homes to new districts.\n\nMr. Allan said he was going to Banff immediately and while there would arrange for the transfer of live marten to re-stock trap lines and in an effort to protect the marten.\n\nRegarding the day school for Nordegg Mr. Allan thought it was possible if the Indians lived close enough to the school and there were enough children to attend the school \"But that is not, in my opinion, the proper way to approach the educational problem.\" In Nordegg there were only 9 or 10 children of school age and the Indian Residential School at Edmonton was not filled at present. Therefore it was quite possible for the Nordegg children to attend in Edmonton.\n\nBut, he said, if a Reserve is established at Nordegg the school and the youngsters are together. If the problem of the Reserve is solved the problem of the school and the youngsters is also solved. So far it has been impossible for the Department to make any arrangements with the provincial educational authorities - the Indians at Nordegg were living inside a forest Reserve and the province would not permit any school facilities in that location and thereby establish precedent.\n\nIn connection with the old people and the request for more rations Mr. Allan said that he would recommend to the\nSuperintendent General that any aged, infirm or sick should be paid an allowance from the Band Fund.\n\nxx xx xx\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nOct 31st 1945\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Edmonton Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Lawrence Saddleback\nEnglish name: Lawrence Saddleback\nAge: 8 years\nName of Band: Saddleback\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 226 Samson Road\nFather's full name and No.: John Saddleback\nMother's full name and No.: Abbie Lightning Saddleback\nParents living or dead: Mother died\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: United Church\nDoes applicant speak English?

He stated that for a long time, Xmas and New Years had been the greatest days for the Indians and they had brought the matter up as they wanted their children home for that time. They had expected to take the matter up with the inspector but he had not yet arrived. They had brought the matter up before and wanted a definite answer, yes or no. In regard to relief, the people had already got the habit of getting help and there was no reason why they could not have it when they had the money. The white people got help and had no money. He said they were promised that when they were hard-up they would get help. When the North part of the Reserve was sold, an agreement was made that help would be given when needed. In Mr. Hace's time they had shovelled snow off the road and got grub. At that time they had asked for $10.00 a head and in less than two weeks they got it. He said they wanted an answer yes or no; that the Agency had authority to give them help if they wanted to.\n\nMr. Faunt advised them that as regards the school, he had no authority to say the children could get out. He could make application to the Department and explain their wishes. As explained to the Council the previous day, this would set a precedent for other bands and reserves. Some of the people were scattered all over the bush country and the children would be scattered all over. The Department would have to take this into consideration as the same privilege would have to apply to all. Some of the children were not yet in for the fall term and if allowed out at Xmas they would probably not all be back by Spring. However, if they asked that he write the Department asking that the children be allowed out at Xmas, he would take the matter up with them.\n\nIt was moved by Jas. Peacock and seconded by Wm. Morin that Mr. Faunt write the Department and ask that the children be allowed out for a few days at Xmas. Passed unanimously.\n\nJ.J. Faunt,\nIndian Agent.\nWith regard to the request that the children be allowed out of school for the Christmas holidays, I communicated directly with the Department & have received a reply to the effect that such holidays would not be allowed.\n\nJ.T.

Both in your interest and in our own, we desire that these returns be absolutely accurate.\n\nAs you know, the per capita allowance is paid from the information given under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during the quarter\". On reviewing the return we find in the case of pupil 211 that no grant is asked, but in the column under the heading \"Remarks\" you state \"Now in school\". If the pupil was in residence during any part of the December quarter, you are entitled to grant for that period. If the pupil was not in residence during the quarter, the statement \"now in school\" should not appear on the return, as this return covers the period October 1 to December 31, 1945. Any information shown on the return should refer to pupils during that particular quarter.\n\nFor John Bearhead, No. 215, grant is only requested for 50 days, although no information is contained under the heading Remarks showing why you did not ask grant for a longer period. In the case of pupil 224, grant is requested for 45 days, but under the heading \"Remarks\" you do not show the date on which this boy returned to the school. What has been said regarding pupil 211 applies also to pupils 258 and 0251. On returns for the past two years pupil No. 0263, Florence Brereton, is shown to have been absent. On the December\n\nRev. J.F. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\n......... quarter\nquarter return grant is requested for her for 68 days, but under the heading \"Remarks\" you do not state the exact date on which she returned to the school.\n\nIf you refer to circular letter of December 29, 1944, you will note that Principals were requested to forward a copy of Form IA 411 with each quarterly return. You did not forward this form with the December quarter return. Please complete it and send it forward with the return when you are sending it back to this office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nEDMONTON\nALBERTA\n\nFeb 5/46.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe your letter of Jan 31/46 - no 110-0-10 in reference to Pupils Nos. 211, 256 and 0251 - I may say that on one copy of return this was sent in as a memo for reference. This not in my office copy - evidently the copy with the memo was sent to Ottawa. Those three children returned early in January - I admit it should not be in return.\n\nIn the case of John Blackhead No. 215 - This boy remained at school on the farm during holidays and into September. His holidays were taken in the late fall - still giving him 80 days in the quarter after 62 days had been allowed for holidays.\n\nPupil No. 224 - Gerald - This boy returned to school on Nov. 16th.\n\nPupil No. 0267 - Florence Beretta, returned to school Oct. 25/45.\n\nI trust these explanations are satisfactory.\n\nI am sending you form IA-411 as requested.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ.F.

Staley\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nOct 17, 1946\n\nMr. R. Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you very much for your letter. Many matters were clarified & I am glad that the education of the Indians is improving. Last Sunday we had a visit from Rev. C. J. Staley, principal of the Indian School at Edmonton. Mr. Staley told us of his plans & the plans of the Indian Affairs Branch; we were quite pleased with the great improvements already accomplished. The Indians now feel that they can send their children to Edmonton where they will receive an education that is worth something.\n\nLast Sunday I wished to take Rev. Staley up to Woodland Lake Reserve to see Indian parents on that Reserve about sending their children back to the school at Edmonton. The roads were too muddy for our car & I went to the agency to inquire if...\nI might borrow the jeeps they have supplied to them for Indian work. My request for the jeep having merely turned down. This is the second time it has happened. I need the Agency cars or jeeps are available for any of my Indian work such as calling on Indian families to take their children to school etc. But at the same time, I notice that the R.C. priest has full access to the jeep.\n\nJust what is my relation to the Agency? Am I any right to even ask for the jeep seeing I the government equipment in the Reserve? Do I have the right to this equipment if it is to help the Indians?\n\nI know the amount of business you have to deal with each day so I will understand if some time elapses before my letter is answered.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\nBernard H. Blackeray.\nOttawa, Sept 3rd, 1946.\n\nRev. E.J. Staley, Principal,\nEdmenton Indian Residential School,\nEdmenton, Alberta.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Admission and Discharge form No. 411, for the June quarter, the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered as follows:\n\n245  0257  0263\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 30, 1965.\n\nDear Mr. Thackeray:\n\nI was indeed glad to receive your letter of September 22nd and particularly pleased to note that the son of my old friend, Bernard Thackeray, was engaged in missionary effort on one of our Indian reserves.\n\nYou refer in your letter to conditions confronting you on the reserve at Saddle Lake and to ways and means whereby conditions might be improved. I feel confident that you will believe me when I say that these and a number of such problems have been engaging the attention of the officials here and my own personal attention almost continuously during the last ten-year period. The advancement of the Indian population, as I see it, demands a great deal of self-sacrifice on the part of those engaged in the administration of Indian Affairs and an abundance of patience on the part of our white citizens and Indians alike.\n\nYou refer to the operation of Indian residential schools. We have, I may state, approximately $12,000,000.00 invested in these schools at the moment, and it is not likely that this Government or any Government that might succeed it, will cease the operation of these schools at any time in the immediate future. I am hopeful, however, that residential schools can become increasingly more up-to-date.\n\nYou refer to the half-day instruction given at such schools. In this connection, you will be glad to learn that the period of instruction is being gradually extended. Indian day school pupils, on the other hand, owing to the irregularity of attendance and the Indian's lack of interest in education of any kind, seldom receive more actual instruction than residential school pupils - the average attendance per annum seldom exceeding 60%. It is just possible, however, that the payment of family allowances may help us to correct this condition.\n\nReverend B. H. Thackeray,\nSADDLE LAKE,\nAlberta.\n\n..... We work,\nWe work, as you know, in close cooperation with the church authorities in the operation of our schools. I have been wondering if it would be possible for you to summarize conditions at Saddle Lake from the educational standpoint and send forward your summary with any recommendation you may care to make, including your offer of the church building, to Doctor Dorey, Secretary of the Board of Home Missions. The problem at Saddle Lake, as I see it, is to establish an Indian day school without reducing the number now enrolled at the Edmonton residential school. In any event, if your recommendation is sent forward, it will, I feel sure, be carefully and sympathetically reviewed. It is unnecessary to add that I appreciate very fully your anxiousness to bring this matter to my personal attention. It is also unnecessary to add that I want you to feel free to communicate with me at any time.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of my submission to the Special Parliamentary Committee engaged in a review of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nSaddle Lake,\nAlberta,\nSept 22/46.\n\nMr. R.H. Story,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Story:\n\nAllow me to introduce myself. Perhaps I mentioned that I'm the son of Bernard Hacking? During college days things might be clearer. Glad to say I'm visiting this summer & over the radio heard there was an item concerning some statement you made in connection with the Dept. of Indian Affairs. On hearing this I had said I should write you & let you know that I'm now living on the Indian Saddle Lake & Grassfield Lake Reserve of Alberta.\n\nI am glad to hear that plans are now being formulated for the better education of the Indians. Believe me the\nwell for Saddle Lake. I offered the use of\nthe Church for a classroom. But at the\nlast moment we had no permission from\nthe Department to have such a day school.\nWe're still hoping for next year; what is the\nDepartment's attitude re. day schools in the\nReserve?\n\nI am very glad to hear any scheme set\nforth for better life for the Indians. Now that\nthey are being forced into a white man's world\nthey'll have to be equipped with an equal education\nto the white man. But the Indians themselves\nare very aware of that fact. Many Indians\nhave been told that they'd rather give up their\n\"treasury money\" & be put on the same basis as\nother citizens of Canada. It is really pitiful &\nshameful to see some old folks. It is\ntrue they get ration, treasury money, a little\ninterest money\u2014but where else? Hardly\nenough to live on. The Indians feel they should\nbe entitled to Old Age Pension. I don't\nthink anyone could deny that the Indians\nOttawa, October 30, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Thackeray:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 17th, in which you refer to your interview with Mr. Staley and to the fact that conditions at the Edmonton Indian residential school are steadily improving.\n\nI was particularly interested in your reference to the jeep supplied by the department for the use of the Indian Agent and Farming Instructor. I have discussed this reference of yours with Inspector Gooderham, who is at this time visiting Ottawa. He has promised me that he will discuss the matter with the Agent immediately following his return to Alberta.\n\nThe Government has never at any time accepted responsibility for missionary effort on Indian reserves. We believe that it is in the best interests of the Indians, the Churches engaged in such effort and citizens generally that missionary effort should be completely detached from Government regulations and, of course, from dictation by Government officials. The position of the Government in this respect is, I feel sure, fully understood by the Churches. Indian Agency equipment, therefore, has never at any time been placed at the disposal of men engaged in missionary work, and, if the Catholic missionary at Saddle Lake has had the use of the automobile or the jeep for Church work, this use is wholly irregular and against departmental regulations. The Churches have always accepted a certain amount of responsibility for the recruiting of pupils on reserves and for their enrolment at residential schools.\n\nReverend B. H. Thackeray,\nSADDLE LAKE,\nAlberta.\nWhen recruiting actually takes place, however, on a reserve, the visiting of homes by the principal of the school or by the missionary on the reserve might well be undertaken in cooperation with the Indian Agent or the Farming Instructor. In such cases, the use of Agency equipment would, of course, be quite legitimate. I am anxious, however, that in this regard there should be no discrimination. The Government of Canada, theoretically and in fact, represents the people of Canada, including all creeds and classes. It is of the utmost importance and in the interest of the Churches themselves that a spirit resulting in fair play and an equal opportunity should be in evidence on our reserves at all times.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector\nCalculation\n\n1 - D.A.A. ---- Date Oct 29/46\n\nSec'y ---- \" ----\n\nE.A. ---- \" ----\n\nS.A.I. ---- \" ----\n\nIns. ---- \" ----\n\nW.T. ---- \" AR\n\nT.R. ---- \" ----\n\nF.A. ---- \" ----\n\nWTI ~ P.V.\nHobbema, Alberta,\n17th October 1946.\n\nI beg to herewith submit the quarterly report for this agency ending 30th Sept. 1946.\n\nX X X\n\nEDUCATIONAL.\n\nI understand that the Edmonton Indian School is having a complete new deal and the Indians appear to be quite happy over it.

I might say that a full staff has been maintained at the school since the end of August and they have been engaged in cleaning, sewing and generally getting the place in shape to receive the children.\n\nYou will note that the return is a straight copy of the June return. It is just possible however that there may have been some disbursements applied for and approved of, but I have been unable to find any copy of any such applications.\n\nWould it be possible for you to furnish me with a list of the children from your Agency, who should be coming to school for the next term, giving me the dates of birth, Treaty numbers etc. I would like to have this list so that the school records may conform with the Agency records, which hitherto they have not done.\n\nI am sending you all three copies of the return so that any alterations you may find it necessary to make, may be made on the school copy.\n\nYours very truly\nE.J.

The other boys were questioned but they claimed that they did not know where the four boys were, and intimated that they might be around some of the barns or in the pumphouse. These buildings were searched with no result and then one of the older boys volunteered the information that just after lunch he had seen the four heading eastward and that they were all wrapped up and it was his impression they were heading for home at Saddle Lake.\n\nBy this time it was seven o'clock and we immediately got on the phone and called a number of the people along the route the boys were likely to travel, asking them if they had seen anything of them.\n\nWhile we were engaged in this, a telephone came in from the Mounted Police in Edmonton, telling us that they had a call from a point East of Namao, telling them that four boys from the Indian school had stopped in there and that one of them had his toes frozen.\n\nMr. Faunt, who answered the phone, told them that we had just been trying to locate the boys by phone and asked them if they would send a patrol out to bring the boys in, taking the boy with the frozen foot to the Indian Hospital and bringing the other three back here.\n\nHe then telephoned the Hospital and arranged for the immediate care of the boy and when the police brought him in, he was given immediate attention.\n\nIt was thought at one time that he might lose one of his toes, but this was not the case and in fact we are expecting his return to the school today, fully healed.\n\nOn questioning the boys on their return, it was found that the break had been planned several days ahead and that they had just been waiting for fine weather. The early part of that Sunday was\nWas unusually fine, with the temperature up to 45\u00b0, so they just decided this was the day. Unfortunately however there was a sudden dip in the temperature and in a few hours the thermometer was registering -12\u00b0 and it was more by luck than by good judgement that they had not got further from school and were able to find a place to stay, it having been their intention to keep away from houses and to sleep in a straw stack when they got tired, in which case they might very easily have been frozen to death, as the thermometer went below -30\u00b0 that night.\n\nThere had been no trouble with any of the boys before this break and there has been none since. They said they got homesick and gave in to the urge to go home.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.J. Stanley,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 14th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.A. Mitchell, Clerk in Charge,\nSaddle Lake Agency, St. Brides, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letters of\nthe 30th ult., and the 7th inst., you may in-\nform the principal of the Edmonton Residential\nSchool that the admission of the following\nchildren is approved.\n\nPeggy Jane Hunter    Wallace Thomas Hunter\nLaura Kathleen Hunter    Rena Velma Steinhauer\nLouis Peter Half    Myrtle Violet Jackson\nRobert Abraham Hunter    Sylvia Jackson.\nGeo.

Edwin Wuttunee's boy was taken off the school roll because he failed to return after the mid-summer vacation. His discharge was applied for on December 31st, 1945. He was admitted into our school at Onion Lake on September 1st, 1941.\n\nI don't know just yet what room I shall have for any more boys until I hear what is to become of the orphan children from Lac la Ronge School. Eight came down by plane two days ago, and I don't know when official word comes through to send them on to the Gordon's School. Should today receive some word from Regina. I believe that Regina is now trying to contact Dr. Morrow.\"\n\n(Sgd) H. Ellis,\nPrincipal.\"\n\nC.S. Bell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. C.S.

It is brought to your attention that grant may be requested for the actual number of days in residence.\n\nPupil No. 229 Oscar Jackson was shown as re-admitted and returned October 10, 1946 on the Return but was shown as having returned the 15th of October, 1946 on the Form 411 and ninety-two days requested.\n\nIn all these cases adjustments have been made on the Return and in the case of Oscar Jackson we have used the 15th of October as the date of re-admission.\n\nOn re-checking your December Return if you find that any of the new pupils entered school earlier than the date shown thereon please advise this office and we will make the necessary corrections. You will realize that these Returns are carefully scrutinized by the Auditor and it is, therefore, essential that they be correct in every detail.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 11, 1947.\n\nRev.

Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of February 12th, I am now enclosing herewith original Typed Copy of the school return for the quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nI was not aware that it was necessary for you to have the original, but I will know what to do from now on.\n\nIn connection with the making out of these returns and of other forms required by the Department, do you think it at all possible that the Department might furnish us with a typewriter with an eighteen inch carriage?\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.J. Staley,\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith original copy of Quarterly Return for Dec. 31st, 1946, received from the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nThe typewriter he mentions has already been requested, see your file 110-0-5 (WT.1) of Feb. 18th, 1947.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. Harold Moore, Clerk-in-Charge,\nIndian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th ultimo with reference to a request for the transfer of Betsy Lightning, No. 0686 from the Ermineskin School to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nAs you are probably aware, Betsy Lightning was admitted to the Ermineskin School in December, 1939 and the application form was signed by her father and stated that she was a Roman Catholic. The application form was approved by Indian Agent Lewis, who was in charge of the Hobbema agency at that time. It is noted that the parents now request that she be transferred to the Edmonton Residential School which is under United Church auspices.\n\nAt this time I feel it advisable to give a general statement concerning the Department's practice and indicating how our officers are guided when cases such as this arise.\n\nThe compulsory education clauses of the Indian Act read in part: \"No Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\" The intention of this section is that an Indian child shall attend a school conducted under the auspices of the church with which the child and its parents are affiliated. The Department believes strict adherence to this rule is in the best interests of its wards.\nWhenever there is doubt concerning the religion of an applicant for admission to an Indian residential school, Indian agents are instructed to make careful enquiries. The Department understands that the chief deciding factors in the determination of the religion of a child of tender years are the religion and the wishes of the parents. When the parents are in disagreement, other than in British Columbia, the father, except in special circumstances, has the right to direct and regulate the religious education of his child. This right of the father is recognized even where the child is illegitimate, except in Ontario; but, when the mother is the sole support of the child, her wishes are given some prominence. Further, the father's wishes concerning the religious education of his child are recognized after his death; and, if he die without having left any direction as to the religion in which his child is to be educated, it is presumed that he intended the religious training to be in his own faith. In brief, when there is disagreement, the Department respects the wishes of the father, unless there is some strong reason for disregarding them. Of course, some consideration is given to the wishes of a widowed mother - in British Columbia her wishes are the deciding factor - and, in the case of an adopted child, to the wishes of the foster father. A guardian, appointed by the father, is given equal rights with the widowed mother in this connection. Another deciding factor, particularly in the event of a foster home, is the best interests of the child itself.\n\nIn practice, if there is any doubt concerning the school a child should attend, the Department endeavours to ascertain the religion of the parents and the real wish of the father. We look for evidence concerning the bona fide nature of his wish, if he requests that his child be given an education under the auspices of a church to which he does not adhere. Because of subsequent difficulties, the Department is extremely reluctant to admit to a Protestant school a child of Roman Catholic parents, and similarly, a child of Protestant parents to a Roman Catholic school. In extraordinary cases, when departure from the usual practice is being considered, we not only ask for an affidavit from the father, but we insist upon a few months' consideration. Then keeping in mind the best interests of the child, a decision is given, and the child must then attend the school selected.\nThe practice of transferring a child from one residential school to another for religious reasons would lead to endless applications for a change and would result in considerable difficulty. Further, a pupil that has been resident in a school may have formed religious opinions and even convictions, and a disturbance of these might be untimely.\n\nIn view of the fact that this girl was a pupil at the Ermineskin School for approximately seven years, the Department feels that it would be in her best interests to remain in that institution. You will note particularly, the following statements made in this letter -\n\n\"The practice of transferring a child from one residential school to another for religious reasons would lead to endless applications for a change and would result in considerable difficulty. Further, a pupil that has been resident in a school may have formed religious opinions and even convictions, and a disturbance of these might be untimely.\"\n\nReverend E.J. Staley, Principal of the Edmonton Residential School had no right at all to accept this girl as a pupil. Indian Agents and Principals have been repeatedly advised when there is any doubt whatsoever regarding the eligibility of a pupil to a residential school, either on account of religious or other reasons, such child should not be placed in any residential school until all the facts have been laid before the Department and our decision has been given. Reverend Mr. Staley apparently ignored our instructions in this regard.\n\nOur decision, therefore, is that Betsy Lightning should be returned to the Ermineskin School and you should make the necessary arrangements for this transfer immediately. If you so desire, you can show this letter to the Reverend Principal of the Edmonton School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith certificate of health and application for admission for Oliver and Robert Brereton (Giant) to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nG.A. Mitchell,\nClerk in charge.\nOttawa, March 17th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.A.

Robertson,\nIndian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Robertson:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Voucher in the amount of $189.84, covering amounts paid out to Railroad and Transportation Companies for the transportation charges in connection with the return of the children of this school to their homes on the different reserves.\n\nI am sending you the voucher in the hope that the Department will pay it.\n\nI would explain that if the school were located on a reserve, there would be no problem of transportation involved, but, having to recruit our children from all over Central Alberta as we do, transportation becomes a real problem and I cannot see why the school should be called upon to meet the extra expense.\n\nI am not sending you a voucher covering the amounts paid out for bringing the children in, until I see whether or not the Department gives favorable consideration to my request for payment of the outgoing expenses, but I consider that that too is a legitimate charge against the Department.\n\nDon't you think it might be well to put something in the estimates this year to cover these expenses?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.T. Staley,\nAsst. Principal.\n\nEDMONTON INDIAN AGENCY\nJul 8 1947\nWinterburn, Alta.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of letter received from the Edmonton Indian Residential School, also Voucher No. 308-47, in their favor, for $189.84, being amount paid out by them for transportation in returning the pupils to the various Reserves for the summer vacation.\n\nIf they can be reimbursed for this expense, I would recommend that the Voucher be paid.\n\nE. A. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 21st, 1947.\n\nMr. E.A. Robertson, Indian Agent,\nWinterburn, Alta.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant enclosing voucher for transportation of children from the Edmonton Residential School. You should point out to the principal that authority should have been requested for this expenditure before submitting a voucher.\n\nIn connection with the transportation of children to their homes, it is expected that the principal of the school will make every effort to have the parents come for their children and also return them. In the majority of schools the parents supply the funds for the transportation of their children in the event that they do not come to the school for them. The individual items of expenditure appear small and there should have been no difficulty in obtaining same from the parents concerned.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n**ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Edmonton School During June QUARTER, 19**\n\n| No. | NAME                  | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | Band |\n|-----|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------|\n|     | V.O.

Under these circumstances we can not understand why the application is being made for his admission to the Edmonton School instead of the Ermineskin School. We will wait for a further letter from you before making a final decision. In the meantime, the boy should not be placed in any Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/HH.\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nHobbema, Alberta\n15th October, 1947\n\nChief, Training Division, Indian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: Application of Percy Williams\nto Edmonton Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your 110-0-10 (W.T.) dated October 9th, I beg to inform you that all of the other children of Cecilia Lightning, who is the mother of the above named pupil have in the past been in attendance at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nWith this precedence established and guided by the wishes of the parents, we forwarded the application for your approval.\n\nI would add that the boy is present in school at Edmonton.\n\nH.M.

Percy gave some trouble to the police last summer, breaking into cottages at Ma-Me-O Beach and the grandfather was informed that he must be placed in school this fall.

With reference to the above, a telephone call was received from Father PRIMEAU, Roman Catholic Priest of Legal Alberta, on the 30-1-48 to the effect that two Indian girls had come to Legal the previous day and had asked for assistance and transportation to Saddle Lake, Alberta. He stated that he had given them one nights lodging in the Legal Hotel and had provided them with meals. From the description given it was believed that these two girls were identical with those mentioned in \"KW Division C.M. 43-48, Division File No. 47K-1150/4-374-5.\n\n2. In the a.m. of the 30-1-48 a patrol was made via P.C. 8726 by the writer and Cst. Nykytiuk to Legal, where the above mentioned girls were interrogated. It was ascertained that they had eloped from the Indian Residential School, situated about two miles east of St. Albert, Alberta, on the evening of the 25-1-48.\n\n3. The Rev. F.J. STALEY, Principal of the Indian Residential School was contacted through Father PRIMEAU of Legal and the above mentioned girls were identified as those missing from the Residential School. These girls were therefore escorted via P.C. 8726 by the writer and Cst. Nykytiuk to the Indian Residential School two miles east of St. Albert Alberta and were handed over to the Rev. F. J. STALEY, Principal of the school.\n\n4. In view of the foregoing, since no further action is required at this point, this file is being concluded here as shown.

Woodsworth, Superintendent of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to your letters of\nFebruary 9th, the Department approves the admission\nof the following children to the Edmonton Residential\nSchool:\n\nClifford Alvin Samson,\nIsobelle Firingstony.\n\nP. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nFather Adam announced that he was very well pleased with the way the pupils had returned from the Fall and Christmas Holidays and he planned to grant another 2 days' holiday. The dates agreed upon was from Friday evening Feb. 27th until Sunday evening Feb. 29th. The children to be ready to commence work on Monday morning March 1st. The R.C. School Trustees (Dan Buffalo & Dan Johnson) agreed to make the dates known to the parents and to ask them to see that the children returned to school promptly.\n\nFather Adam then asked for anyone who was interested in tanning elk hides to see him. He had a number to be tanned and offered to pay $5.00 and to give one elk hide to anyone who would tan two hides for him.\n\nThe Supt. also stated that the Camsell Hospital would also like to get some hides, already tanned if possible. He would give them further information as to the price of same, etc., when he had seen Dr. Stone. He also brought up the subject of parents taking pupils from one school and putting them into another. The Department strongly objected to changing pupils from one school to another, and would not authorize such changes. This was brought up especially in the case of Bertha Sittingweasel and Rita Roasting who had been taken from the Ermineskin School and sent to the Edmonton School.\n\nRev. Father Alan and Rev. Mr. Law each presented their side of the history of these cases, and it was left to the Council to ask any questions or make any recommendations they might see fit. Chief James Crane also gave further information regarding Bertha Sittingweasel. He stated that the mother and stepfather were originally Catholics, and that as far as Bertha was concerned, she should remain a Catholic until she was old enough to make her own choice. Philip Soosay stated that the parents should have the authority to decide which school their children attend. Fred Littlepoplar stated that in his opinion, the parents should be able to decide as to what school their children should go, and he hoped that such questions as these, arising from differences of religion could be settled on a friendly basis, without argument on either side.\n\nThe Supt. then explained the Indian Act concerning the attendance of school children, and also the Department's instructions in this connection. He also explained the problem of getting non-treaty half-breeds who are living on the Reserves, into the Hobema Day School, as the rate payers had objected to any more half-breeds going to their school. A meeting had been held at the school which was attended by himself and some of the staff, where the rate payers had presented a resolution regarding the education of these halfbreeds. (Copy of this resolution attached).\n\nJohnny Crier then asked that when school children used gum, balloons and other things that they put into their mouths, they should be instructed not to pass such things on to other children, from one mouth to another. Father Adam stated that this practice was forbidden at the school, but that it was hard to enforce this rule at times. Rev. Father Adam and Rev. Mr. Law then left the meeting (4.15).\n\n(signed)\nH N Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nHobbema, Alberta.

Superintendent gave him a letter asking the Principal if he could release her for a few days, as the admission of this girl to the Edmonton School had not been approved by the Department.\n\nSuperintendent told Council that Mr. Gooderham had stated that both of the Residential schools were filled to capacity. In September a certain number would be discharged, and would create a few vacancies, and any children whose applications had been approved would be the first to be admitted to school. No new children would be admitted to school after the first of the school year, and any truants not attending would be taken immediately to school without hesitation. No children are wanted in school over 12 years of age. The Chief then presented a resolution from his band asking that another school be built immediately on the Samson's reserve, either a non-sectarian residential school where the children would be allowed to go home very Friday evening, or a consolidated day school, where the children could be transported to school each morning and returned in the evening, to their homes.\n\nH N Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nCopied: JGM\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nMarch 19th, 1948\n\nChief Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Percy Williams\n\nWith reference to your 110-0-10 (WT 1) dated December 23rd, 1947, Percy Williams.\n\nIt has been the endeavour of this office to follow as closely as possible the law as outlined in subsection 2 of section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nThe parents propose to apply for admission to the Edmonton Indian Residential School for Archie Lightning, to follow up on what seems to be their determination to send their children to the Edmonton School. The boy is doing very well at school, and the R.C.M.P. have been well satisfied that the trouble in cottage breaking-in has been eliminated at Pigeon Lake.\n\nI recommend that the parents be allowed to follow their desire in sending all their children to Edmonton, and not some to one school and some to another. There seems to be no religious conviction one way or the other on their part. Percy Williams (Lightning) should therefore be eligible as a grant earning pupil at the Edmonton School, as well as his brother John.\n\nH.N.

To the best of my knowledge and belief the parents of this child are Roman Catholics. The parents will be advised against taking her to Edmonton. There is no room in the Ermineskin school for this girl.\n\nWith reference to Julia Roasting I beg to inform you that all other members of the family Colin, Rita, and Robert are in attendance or have been in the past year at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nI am in possession of a document signed by Albert Roasting father, purporting to belong to the Baptist Church and which states that he wishes his children brought up in the faith of that Church.\n\nFor your information the Baptist Church referred to is the organization which has several missionaries on this reserve and runs a Day School on the Montana Reserve.\n\nDue to the unstable religious convictions of the Indians I have listed the religion of the children as it appears in treaty records. Should the Department consider that this man's statement of his religious convictions is in order I will change the treaty records accordingly.\n\nH.N.Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\n\nAUG 23 1948\nP.M.\n\nHNW/cal\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Archie Lightning\n\nWith reference to your 110-0-10 (El) of August 13th 1948 I would like to point out for your information, Johnny and Percy of the same family are attending the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nH.N.Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\n\nHNW/cal\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Edmonton Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid No. 377\nFather's full name and No. Paul Green No. 377 Samson's Band\nMother's full name and No. Julia Green No. 377 Samson's Band\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

The Principal of the Edmonton Residential School (United Church) had stated that he would be glad to take them into residence, if there was no objection. Mr. Robertson stated he believed the parents would be glad if this was approved.\n\nAs you are aware, the majority of the people on this Reserve are Protestant, and a day school should be started, even in a temporary building, as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime, what would you suggest in regard to these Roman Catholic children?\n\nG.

It would therefore be assumed that he would probably be looked after at the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nThis patient is now able to get around fairly well, although he has definite restriction in the movements of his knees and hips. Fortunately his hands and arms are freely movable except for two fingers on the right hand.\n\nI feel certain that this boy could manage fairly well at such a school; being very close to the hospital he could be closely watched from a medical standpoint, and any special care he might need could be easily given.\n\nI would therefore recommend that arrangements be made to allow this boy to be educated at the local Protestant school. Once he has his basic education, further training will depend upon his aptitudes.\n\nH. Meltzer, M.D.\nMedical Director.\n\nM/M\nC.C. Mr. Gibson & Mr. Neary.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 15, 1949.\n\nDear Doctor Meltzer:\n\nDonald Ayelik (or Islik) - No. 6581\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter from Mr. Gibson concerning the above mentioned boy.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward a report on what you consider his abilities are and at the same time advise us whether he is of Roman Catholic or Protestant faith. I have been in touch with Mr. Neary the Superintendent of Education and he states that either the Protestant Indian School at Edmonton or the Kaminaski Roman Catholic School should be able to take this lad in for training; depending on the church to which he is an adherent.\n\nOn receipt of this information, Mr. Neary will send out definite directions for his transfer and admission to the school. It is presumed that at this time he will not require further hospital treatment.\n\nIt is noted that the N.W.T. administration will assume responsibility for his maintenance in the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W.L.

Staley,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have been advised by the Indian Health Services that Donald Ayaklik, an Eskimo boy, is now ready for discharge from the Charles Cassell Indian Hospital. However, he is not yet well enough to be sent north and Dr. Melzer has recently reported on him to the Indian Health Services, as follows:\n\n\"This patient is now able to get around fairly well, although he has definite restriction in the movements of his knees and hips. Fortunately his hands and arms are freely movable except for two fingers on the right hand.\n\n\"I feel certain that this boy could manage fairly well at such a school; being very close to the hospital he could be closely watched from a medical standpoint, and any special care he might need could be easily given.\n\n\"I would therefore recommend that arrangements be made to allow this boy to be educated at the local Protestant school. Once he has his basic education, further training will depend upon his aptitudes.\"\n\nWhile Donald is of the Anglican faith, it is felt that he will fit very nicely into your program of training and you can therefore arrange with Dr. Melzer to have him\nadmitted to your school. As per capita grant will not be paid from Indian Affairs Appropriation, a separate quarterly return should be prepared for him and should be forwarded to:\n\nDirector, Lands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you when you have been able to admit this boy to your school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.
